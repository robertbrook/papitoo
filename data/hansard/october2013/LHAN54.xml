the energy market to deliver over the winter of 2013-14 as it has
always done. We have a range of options in place to meet any tightening
of margins. National Grid has existing system-balancing tools to
respond to any short-term demand or supply fluctuation, and it is
consulting with Ofgem on extending the existing tools to manage any
predicted risks mid-decade in electricity. For the medium to long term,
in the Energy Bill currently going through your Lordships’ House
we are ensuring that we get the levels of investment needed to deliver
secure energy supplies through a diverse mix of energy

important question, but I hope that he will be reassured to know that
we still have a large percentage of our gas provided from the North
Sea. We have greatly increased our import infrastructure over the past
few years, so have a good diversity of supply sources and gas storage
to meet our demands comfortably. For both gas and electricity, National

Hanworth (</B><B>Lab</B><B>):</B></Member> The Minister is bound to
acknowledge that since the Government came to power there has been an
unprecedented hiatus in investment in the energy industry. This must be
due in large measure to the mixed messages that the Government have
given in regard to their energy policy. She is also surely aware that,
among the big six energy companies, those that have reaped the largest
profits have had the worst investment records. What measures, beyond
those contained in the Energy Bill, are the Government taking to
encourage investment in the power industry?</hs_para>

</B><B>Verma</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, I remind the noble Viscount
that under this Government, since 2010, £35
billion-worth of investment in the energy sector has come forward and
there has been a 56% increase in the renewables sector. It is a fallacy
to say that there is a hiatus when we are a very open and welcome
country for investment. However, if we were to go by the plans that the
noble Viscount’s party is trying to project, that investment
would be driven away.</hs_para>

Lawson of Blaby (</B><B>Con</B><B>):</B></Member> My Lords, I welcome
the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, to his place. I recall well his being the
chairman of the Coal Board when I was Energy Secretary. My noble friend
the Minister referred to the Energy Bill but it has nothing to do with
his Question. The Bill will do its damage in the future when it
implements the targets of the Miliband Climate Change Act but there is
a crisis in this coming winter, which is a result of the large
combustion plant directive. That European directive requires us to
close prematurely coal-fired power stations. Will she give an assurance
that if it is a question of either implementing the directive straight
away and the lights going out or saving the lights from going out, the
Government will choose the latter course and not implement the
directive?</hs_para>

</B><B>Verma</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, I am always grateful for my
noble friend’s very helpful questions and I reassure him that
the Energy Bill is relevant to the Question because it brings forward
all the measures we need for long-term security in energy at a
competitive price. I think that I have already answered the Question:
we have enough energy there and we have the measures in place to be
able to respond to any short-term fluctuations, so I hope my noble
friend will be reassured that his lights and our lights will stay
on.</hs_para>

O'Neill of Clackmannan (</B><B>Lab</B><B>):</B></Member> My Lords, does
the Minister agree that the Energy Bill is still deficient in one
respect at least—carbon targets? Were carbon targets to be
included in the Bill, it would be a clear indication to investors of
the Government’s intent 
<?notus-xml column=643?>in this area. At the moment, nobody really knows how green this
Government want to be. The absence of these targets is the surest
confirmation that their energy policy is a

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord really needs to look at
our record. We have seen an increase of 56% in renewable energy, which
will bring down carbon targets. We have committed ourselves, but we
cannot see a target put in place against a global backdrop of what we
do not yet know. We need to ensure that we are leaders, by having our
carbon reductions at the forefront; we also need to ensure that our
trading partners look at their carbon emissions. We need to do this
collectively, not singularly as a country on our
own.</hs_para>

with great interest to the Minister’s optimism, but is she aware
of the implications of an amendment passed last week in the European
Union Parliament that will prevent the EU from sharing in the cheap
energy revolution created by fracking for shale gas? The effect of this
is likely to be a doubling of our household energy costs. Will she

Scottish independence. That decision does not affect the voting age for
parliamentary and local government elections in the United Kingdom.

my party is in favour of votes at 16, but that must be in
parallel with improved citizenship teaching. Lessons well
taught including active citizenship, as at the Bethnal Green Academy,
are crucial in the development of our young people. However, there is
an alarming decline in an already low number of teachers trained to
teach citizenship. Indeed, in too many schools, and in free schools,
citizenship is not taught. Will the Minister say what the numbers of

not have the precise details but I will write to the noble
Baroness with those figures. However, citizenship education is clearly
an important part of the national curriculum, as indeed it has been
since 2002 since her party’s term of office. I applaud that.
Ministers have agreed that citizenship education should
be in the new national curriculum. It is very important, and
I say again: even if some do not agree that 16 year-olds
should have the vote, clearly they can enrol on the electoral roll at
16 and it is important that that is the beginning of the stage of
age-related majority, which across the piece is a very interesting
subject.</hs_para>

identified. We will not let any school, whether a free school, an

Jones of Whitchurch (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister
for repeating the Statement, but does he recognise that the damning
failure of Al-Madinah school all too starkly illustrates that, in the
rush to launch an ideological experiment, the Secretary of State has
lost control of the free schools programme, and that it has, in fact,
become a dangerous free-for-all? Does he now accept that alarm bells
should have rung in the department when Ofsted deemed the school to be
failing to meet basic child protection standards back in 2012, before
the funding agreement was signed? Does not Ofsted’s conclusion
that the school has not been adequately monitored and supported expose
the dangerous lack of oversight of the current free schools programme,
which has a complete absence of accountability and transparency? The
truth is that parents will be wondering who will guarantee the
standards in their local free school, and the Secretary of State does
not have an answer for
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T11:52:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13101768000627" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000627">11.52

Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, after the gymnastics performed by the
shadow Secretary of State for Education in the other place this
morning, I was rather hoping that the noble
Baroness’s answer might enlighten us as to the Labour
Party’s policy on free schools—indeed, whether it has an
education policy at all. Sadly, I am none the wiser. The school was
cleared by Ofsted to open if it satisfied the department on a number of
points, and it did satisfy us on those points. An education adviser
visited the school in November last year and reported that it was
making good progress. In late July, we and Ofsted received various
complaints just before the head teacher resigned. We sent the EFA in 
<?notus-xml column=652?>and Ofsted went in on 1 and 2 October. I have taken swift and decisive
action in this case. I will not allow the school to continue unless it
satisfies me on the points set out in my letter of 8 October, and any
other points we deem appropriate. We should not let the performance of
this school affect the excellent work that is being done in our free
schools, the first batch of which were good and outstanding in 75% of
cases, as opposed to 63% of all other

reports on drug policy? I want to spend a few minutes describing the
remarkable events of the past two years in the
drug policy field globally. For 52 years since the single convention of
1961, the world’s drug policies have been driven by the UN
conventions interpreted—and I emphasise
“interpreted”—to mean that every use of illicit
drugs must be treated as a crime and that every user of illicit drugs
and every dealer must be treated as a criminal. The conventions were
not drafted on the basis of evidence about how best to reduce
addiction. No; they were drafted in response to a moral belief that
taking drugs is wrong and that therefore everyone involved should be
punished. No thought appears to have been given to the consequences of
such a policy. Whatever our personal views about the morality of taking
drugs—and people’s views differ—we all surely
agree that 
<?notus-xml column=655?>good policy is that which reduces the level of drug addiction and harm
to the individual and to others. Criminalising young people is contrary
to that
aim<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T12:02:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

on Drug Policy deserves great credit. That august body, which includes
former presidents, the former Secretary-General of the UN, Kofi Annan,
and many other very senior people across the globe, was the first to
call a halt to the obsession with punitive drugs policies. I quote from
the first paragraph of its

the publication of the global commission report, activity on drug
policy reform has developed apace. Presidents of American states,
including President Obama, initiated a one-year study of the
implications of current drug policy for the Americas, including the
impact on the central American states ravaged by drug trafficking, as
well as the impact on the Andean countries involved in the growing of
the coca leaf. At the general assembly of the Organization of American
States in June this year, which two of us from the APPG were privileged
to attend as guests of the President of Guatemala, the two reports of
that study were debated. This process continues and further discussions
are planned over the next 12 months in the search for reform. Uruguay
has just passed a law to regulate the supply of cannabis—in
other words, to disregard the requirement of the UN conventions that
the possession, use, production and trade in cannabis must be treated
as a criminal offence. This is the first country directly to contravene
the UN
conventions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T12:04:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

course, has for many years made cannabis available legally to users in
its coffee shops. Interestingly, the Netherlands has virtually
eliminated its heroin problem. It just looks at the relationship
between those two, and we need to do the same. Spain has its own system
of lawful or semi-lawful cannabis supply through cannabis-growing
organisations. In the US, 20 states have now legalised cannabis for
medical use—de

legalisation of cannabis. Colorado and Washington have gone a step
further and legalised cannabis for social use. The Department of

those states; this is highly

importance of Uruguay, Colorado and Washington is that, for the first
time in more than 50 years, evaluation of a regulated system
has become possible. Many people believe that regulated herbal
cannabis—and I emphasise “herbal”—properly
labelled, with the THC level controlled, side effects and risks clearly
shown, would be a great deal safer for young people than the illegal
market that we have today. Regulation could, crucially, break the
supply gateway to illegal skunk and other dangerous drugs. Young people
who simply want a spliff would buy herbal cannabis from a lawful
supplier and would not therefore have the need to approach a drug
dealer, who will do 
<?notus-xml column=656?>their very best to sell them something far stronger—skunk, or
worse. Now research can show whether such a policy really is safer than
the illegal market. Can the Minister welcome

countries are quietly moving away from criminalising addicts, providing
heroin legally in a treatment setting, and establishing consumption

I was there to see it. Policies in the consumer countries supply
billions of dollars to the drug barons to enable them to fight their

Minister will no doubt point to the recent modest fall in traditional
drug use, but it needs to be set against the explosion in the use of
new psychoactive substances. But the Government also need to take note
of a few other facts. Despite any recent modest fall in the use of
cannabis—and it is, mainly, cannabis—the UK still has one
of the highest levels of drug use in Europe. In 2011, it was one of
only three countries in Europe where more than 30% of the population
had taken cannabis. Are 30% of our population criminals? This is crazy.
Despite our tough drug laws, England and Wales has the highest
percentage in Europe of the population admitting to taking
cocaine, at 9.6%, amphetamines, at 11.5%, and ecstasy, at
8.6%. The growth in the number of young adults who have ever
used drugs has exploded under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 from 10% in
the 1970s to 35% in 2009-10. There is a modest fall from 1996, but it
is still a very serious

All-Party Parliamentary Group for Drug Policy Reform spent a year
receiving written and oral evidence from witnesses in producing our

highs, of course, present a very serious risk to young people. As one
has found, the Chinese scientists set to work with their test tubes in
their laboratories; they changed the molecules and produced a new
substance. Young people have no idea what that substance is, or what it
contains. The UK is apparently the European hub for such drugs; I
wonder why. They come here from China or India and are then
distributed across Europe. Twice as many young people in this country

from ACPO and the UK Borders Agency who gave evidence to us were very

decriminalising possession and use of these drugs—not only for

point to the New Zealand model, which places the responsibility on the
supplier to show that their product is of limited harm. The supplier,
not the state, has to do the research, which seems eminently sensible.
The New Zealand policy is in its early stages, and I hope that the
Government will be monitoring its effectiveness. The APPG report
recommends an independent drug classification body, which would
classify drugs according to the level of risk identified on a
scientific basis, rather than on a political whim. All political
parties find these issues impossible to deal with rationally. This is
not a party political issue. The reality, though, is that young people
know that our drug law is an ass and disregard it; that
cannot be helpful. An independent body with responsibility for
research, information and classification would help a lot. We could
then more easily move gradually to more evidence-based policies. We
should not do these things in a hurry but we are an awful long way from

course, politicians will be responsible for the strategic direction of
policy, and we have excellent examples of this model with the Monetary
Policy Committee of the Bank of England, and with NICE in the National

drugs to be reviewed, and we share the views of the Home Affairs Select
Committee and the other reports. The ideal would be to have a
cross-party review of drug policy and cross-party policies emerging
from that review. In the mean time, I hope that the Minister will
recognise that this debate is a genuine attempt to respond to the plea
of the current Secretary-General of the United Nations who, on 26 June,
called for every member state to have an open review of drug policy and
to consider all options. That is quite something from the

1986-87, we faced precisely that problem of how to deal with drug users
who shared needles and syringes. The result, obviously, of shared
needles was devastating. We had no treatment to offer—it was a

Teverson (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Meacher, and the all-party group on this excellent
report and on bringing this debate before the House today. When I was
doing some research in this area, the thing that really encapsulated
the problem for me was a United Nations report saying that, in 1998,
the decision was taken to work towards the “elimination or
significant reduction” of illicit drug production and abuse by
2008. We are, of course, five years on from that. The United Nations
decided to extend that programme for 10 years but I guess it had no
confidence whatever that there would be any greater success over that
following decade

of the things that strikes me about this debate is that there is a
psychology in the back of people’s minds that the drugs problem,
and drugs themselves, can somehow be uninvented—that we can hide
them away and they will disappear. However, the reality is, as the
report says so well, that we now have multiplying types of drugs and
that these products will not go away. There is also the fact that any
debate seems to forget that where there is a demand, there will be a
market and there will be supply. That is the way that human beings,
human society and global society
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000114">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T12:27:42"></hs_TimeCode>
spent most of my professional life in the freight industry, where I was
very much involved in supply chains. One of the things on which I want
to concentrate is the even more difficult area of the international
global supply chain for illicit drugs. It is different for different
drugs categories. Cannabis is now the most consumed drug but is often
produced within the nations where it is consumed. Synthetic drugs, as
the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, has said, often come through the post or
through the internet. However, there is still, regrettably, huge
international global traffic in cocaine and opiates. We do not know the
exact figure of course, but that market is worth something like $500
billion per annum—1% of global trade. We are handing that 1% of
global trade to organised crime; to people who are out there to make
money and are not worried about the consequences. We have to find a way
of making that supply chain part of an established route, which is far
more difficult than legalising or regulating the consumption

is that important? It is important because of the countries, nations,
peoples and communities that are destroyed by the 90% of the drugs
market that is driven by North America and Europe. In Mexico, 
<?notus-xml column=662?>there have been some 60,000 deaths and murders directly related to the
drugs trade, a number of them mass killings. In Venezuela, between 1990
and 2008, the murder rate per annum increased from 2,000 to 16,000. In
the United Kingdom, we have roughly 500 homicides a year,
which puts that somewhere in context. In Colombia, 300,000 refugees
moved from that country to Ecuador. The whole problem here is that this
illicit trade is undermining developing countries and even some
countries that are moving up towards developed

frequently do not address drug use. For example, a history of drug use
is seldom documented, even when a patient presents with symptoms which

essential role to play in tackling the use of illicit drugs. Doctors
from every part of the health system can improve their rates of
intervention by opportunistically screening patients and identifying
those with drug misuse. Commissioning the right services will be key to
ensuring that adequate clinical pathways are available to patients.
Education and training will be vital. The Royal College of
Psychiatrists, with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, has reviewed
the competencies required for doctors in relation to alcohol and other

despite the fact that the usage of illegal drugs in the UK is falling,
it is clear that in some areas, such as cannabis, the rates of use
among young people in the UK are, as the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher,
stated, among the highest in Europe. I am pleased to note, however,
that greater clarity appears to be emerging on how we tackle this in
the UK. I am particularly pleased by the recent comments of the leader
of my party, the Liberal Democrats, that we need a more imaginative,
open and, crucially, evidence-based approach to drug

part, I wish to make three points in this debate: first, the importance
of prevention and education; secondly, the issue of decriminalisation
of drugs; and, thirdly, the importance of helping families and
individuals. First, education is key, particularly education of the
young. As a mother of two daughters, I understand the importance of
that. Having a clear drugs strategy which is effectively monitored and
evaluated is fundamental in all our schools, including fee-paying
schools and academies. Early intervention is key, as is a cohesive
implementation programme and a co-ordinated strategy between the new
body, Public Health England, and the Department for Education. Indeed,
I would go as far as to say that PHE must be the lead body in
monitoring and evaluating the success of the education programme, and
not merely a provider of centralised funds, if we are to make real
progress on drugs education in our schools and in higher education. As
a former governor of a number of higher education institutions, I know
the importance of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000138">Secondly,
if the case for the decriminalisation of drugs or the retention of
effective legislation to control their use was clear, there would be no
merit in my address today. There is no such clarity, and the scourge of
our times remains hotly disputed by those on both sides of the
argument. Decriminalisation, when viewed against the vagueness of
alcohol control on our streets, is not an obvious solution to the
problem. Since the problem was recognised, we have appealed for a
policy that is both firm and resolute. We have sought to use
legislation to control and suppress those who use and abuse drugs,
without much success. We have attacked the supply of drugs and the
associated organised crime that supports it—again, without
definable progress. That is not a condemnation of the paths that we
have taken but recognition of the enormity of the
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T12:42:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000139">Will
decriminalisation solve anything? It seems that one effect would be to
produce cheaper drugs with wider availability. That deregulation would
introduce a massive problem of control of the drugs themselves. That
would make them more accessible to criminals in countries with equally
enthusiastic criminal resources, leaving the problem immune and further
away from proper
control.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000140">I
offer no clear solution, although I have drawn the view that continued
control allows us to focus on related crime and criminals. Money
laundering, illegal alcohol, prostitution, gang warfare and even
armaments are intrinsically linked to and caught up with the use and
marketing of drugs. To remove the drug issue would in no way reduce the
horrifying effects of serious 
<?notus-xml column=666?>crime, but would have the effect of drawing our attention, even
partially, away from those involved in such crime. I cannot find it in
my heart to support such a

there are other things that we can do here and now. This brings me to
my third point: how we support those whose lives are affected by drugs.
I believe that we must direct resources to help those suffering the
consequences of the use of drugs and build a stronger, more cohesive
society: one that helps the sick and disadvantaged and which values the
importance of prevention and education in this complex and challenging
area. That is why I support the view that responsibility for drugs
policy should be moved from the Home Office, which rightly focuses on
policing and law enforcement, to the Department of Health. That would
allow a greater focus on the care and support we need to give people
for them to get off drugs, into treatment and back into
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000142">I

congratulate my noble friend Lady Meacher not only on securing the

share her views on criminalisation and the need for both national and

another as chairman of the cross-party group on justice, drugs and

listened with interest as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, introduced the

thought was utterly inappropriate in talking about drugs is the word
“war”. It introduces entirely the wrong perception of
what people are meant to be doing. Yes, of course drugs are an evil and
need to be tackled, but war is something entirely different. As for
“military”, as was touched on by my noble friend Lady
Meacher, I add that when I was serving in the Army, every time we went
off to do something somewhere we felt that we had the country behind us
and, in particular, that we had cross-party support behind us. That was
broken, of course, in Iraq in 2003 and has been a matter of great
concern ever since. On this issue, it has always seemed to me that 
<?notus-xml column=667?>cross-party agreement is essential, because the inevitable result of
cross-party wrangling is inertia. In tackling something as urgent as

go back to my experience as Chief Inspector of Prisons. I have always
thought that if anything encapsulates the nonsense of the present
position, it is the way that drugs are treated in prisons. There
is something called the mandatory drug test, which is meant
to give a picture of drug use in prisons. It is absolute nonsense. Five
per cent of people in prison are tested. I always remember going into a
cell and finding nine pieces of paper on the wall. I said to the
person, “What are those?”. He said, “They are my
certificates for being drug-free. If you come next week, there will be
a 10th. They always test me because they know I am drug-free and it
makes the figures look good”. That is absolute nonsense. The
only way to find out the actual size and shape of the problem is to
test every person when they come in and decide from that what needs to
be done with
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T12:48:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000148">The
second thing that I found was that when the drug treatment and
assessment programme started, it ended up with a lot of assessment but
no treatment, because prisoners were moved around the country, away
from the people who might have worked with them in prison and carried
on doing so when they were released. Prison policy was totally against
consistent assessment and treatment. I then found that there were
masses of dealers in every prison. They were causing not only misery in
prison by what they were doing to the prisoners who failed to pay them
their dues for illegal substances, but terrible problems for their
families outside. The misery was widespread, not helped by
the fact that there did not seem to be proper liaison between the drug
treatment organisations outside the prison and those people who were
responsible for
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000149">Last week,
those of your Lordships who saw the prison inspection report on HMP
Oakwood would have seen that drugs were easier to obtain there than
soap. It seems to me that our prisons, where we have people who cannot
leave and could be treated, are the very place where we ought to have
proper policies. You can do the assessment; you can start the treatment
and make certain that it carries on. The whole situation shows the
lunacy of the prohibition that seems to dominate our policy.</hs_para>

to end on a doom and gloom moment because I am very glad to see that

However, it became apparent during the 1960s that we were going to need
one. Very little was known about drugs or drug use in those days but it
was quite clear that they were damaging to an individual’s
health. They hurt families and the wider communities, and there was
potential damage to society itself. That is how it was perceived and,
from where we are now, it probably was not entirely wrong. However, we

cannabis, a little amphetamine, heroin—that was probably the
most serious one—and some hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD.
Although cocaine existed, it was not really available in the United
Kingdom then. All the new NPDs such as ecstasy, methedrone and ketamine
really did not exist. Crack had not been invented and prescriptions for
drugs such as valium and librium were really new, and their long-term
effects not known at all. In 1974, there were 14,000 heroin addicts

things you can do about drugs, then or now. You can put in place
measures to restrict or reduce the supply of drugs or try to reduce the
demand for them. You can restrict the supply by use of the criminal
law. Unfortunately, in the 1970s there was no recognised way of
treating drug addicts, so there was nothing much that you could do
about reducing demand. We introduced something called the British
system, whereby addicts were prescribed heroin every single day as a
way of keeping them level and out of the black market. That in fact
continued in this country until the 1980s and it is the forerunner of
much of the state provision of treatment today.</hs_para>

to try to control or reduce supply, which was done through the passage
of the Misuse of Drugs Act, supported internationally by the United
Nations conventions. While those and the law may not have changed over
40 years, quite a lot of other things have. We now have 300,000
addicts, mostly of heroin and cocaine. We have crack, NPDs, ecstasy, 
<?notus-xml column=670?>methedrone and ketamine, with two new drugs appearing every week. In
1992—but not until then—the Home Office decided that
there was after all a link between drugs and crime. That led to the
first ever drugs strategy, while my noble friend Lord Howard was in the
Home Office. We learnt then that the cost of drug-related crime and the
policing of drugs was about £12 billion a

locally—I cannot see that our attempt to restrict the supply of
drugs has been anything but a disastrous and incredibly expensive
failure. In 1971 we did not have options but today we do. If we cannot
restrict the supply, as we clearly cannot, we can reduce demand. The
United Nations, the World Health Organisation and the NHS all accept
that drug addiction is a primary illness; it is not curable but it is
treatable. The previous Government recognised this and over
10 years put an enormous amount of time and effort into

have taken that forward by ring-fencing the funding and by moving the
National Treatment Agency into Public Health England, but there is a
structural fault in drug treatment in Britain. The officials at both
the Department of Health and the Home Office fundamentally do not
believe in drug treatment; they believe that drugs are a symptom of
social deprivation. They are backed in this feeling by the medical
profession; because there is no medical treatment for drug addiction,
which there is not and never has been, there is therefore presumed to
be no treatment at all. Therefore the only treatment for drug
addiction, in the view that is held, is substitute prescribing, which
means that 150,000 out of 300,000 addicts in this country live on
prescription drugs. To look at it another way, it is like taking an
alcoholic off whisky, putting him on vodka and saying, “There we
are, job done”. However, there is a vast amount of other
treatment available such as abstinence-based treatment, which has been
in existence in this country for 40 years but which virtually no one
has access to because they cannot get it through the health
authorities.</hs_para>

Lane-Fox of Soho (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Meacher, for proposing this debate and particularly for
being so encouraging about participating in it. I have two areas of
experience that I hope may be relevant. I have been a funder and
trustee of several charities that deal with the fall-out from drugs,
including Reprieve, IntoUniversity and Storybook Dads. My involvement
has also made me think about the impact of the internet on this issue,
which, as some noble Lords may know, is my particular

charity that I know well, Just for Kids Law, provides invaluable
support for children and young people, many of whom are in care, looked
after or at risk of exclusion from school. As well as legal help, it
offers services ranging from securing housing to finding work. The
organisation is a vital resource for the most vulnerable in our
society. One of the most distressing and relentless aspects of the
lives of the children that JFK helps is being stopped and searched by
police. We know from police statistics that 50% of all searches are to
look for drugs. We also know from police data that the searches take
place disproportionately among the BME population. Some JFK clients
talk of being stopped more than three times a day. Not only is this
hugely destructive to the lives of the children but it is expensive.
JFK worked with another not-for-profit organisation, StopWatch, to
produce a smartphone app that allowed the kids to register every time
they were stopped, whether there was an arrest and how the police
treated them. The “stop and search” app allowed young
people to get some control over what they felt was persecution. It also
showed the high number of searches that did not result in any
substances found, data that could be very useful to the police when
prioritising

is interesting to reflect on that development. Technology is changing
with great speed the relationship between the supposed criminal and the
authorities. But could we not be even bolder in thinking about how the
internet could inform some of the solutions for the enormity of the
challenges facing drugs policymakers? It feels as though those
currently illegally controlling the drugs industry certainly already
are. Only yesterday on the Radio 4 “Today” programme

called the Amazon.com of drugs. Launched in 2011, the site was operated
on Tor, a “dark web” service that anonymises users,

want to talk for a moment about the visit that I was privileged to make
to Colombia with the IPU and about one of the insights that gave me. It
has since been underpinned by the excellent report on the coca leaf by
Sophia Ostler of the UK IPU. In Colombia, I saw first hand some of the
realities for the police in trying to deal with narco trafficking and I
saw the UK supporting them in that. I think we still have 40
officers out there helping, and the Colombians are very grateful for
that effort. One of the unforeseen effects of that support is the shift
of the coca-growing effort to Peru and Bolivia. The question is: what
else can small-scale peasant farmers high in the mountains grow and are
there alternatives to that or to the coca leaf? That is where the
report is so valuable. It shows all the current alternatives, from
Coca-Cola to Red Bull. It states that companies are extremely reticent
about where their coca leaf comes from and that a helpful start would
be more openness and accountability from international companies
already engaged in legitimate trade in the coca leaf. There are lots of
other uses. It is depressing that countries in the Andean region have
had to suppress their cultural use of coca tea and so on because of the
UN’s attitude to their traditional use. Everything I have said
about coca and the Andean region could be said about Afghanistan and
opium
growing.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_17_PT_1/0CA351AAFDA98B65A8A837E90D33002BB4D6BABA" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 17 October 2013">Thursday,

Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood (Non-Afl):</Member></B> I thank my noble
friend Lady Meacher for securing and so brilliantly introducing this
debate on a subject that is always topical and of the first importance.
It is trite but true to say, first, that illicit drugs and the problems
they create have for decades been a scourge around the world and,
secondly, that the so-called war on drugs has conspicuously failed. I
do not pretend to any particular expertise in this area, although a
lifetime in the law has inevitably exposed me to many of the problems,
and still less do I pretend to any easy solution. There are no quick
fixes available here. Some would say that, like democracy,
unsatisfactory though the present law is, it is better than any
alternative and is the least worst option, but I respectfully question
that. There must be better policies and better ways of control
available. My main reason for participating in this debate is to
encourage government to engage internationally with all those striving
to reach such better solutions and to urge government to be imaginative
and to recognise, as my noble friend Lady Meacher 
<?notus-xml column=674?>described that a number of other countries have, that policies
concentrating essentially on criminalising all aspects of the drug
trade are counterproductive. Better health must be the ultimate
goal.</hs_para>

that the central objectives of those seeking a better control system
should be twofold: first, to reduce the level of harmful drug-taking,
and secondly to reduce the level of criminality resulting from present
systems of control. As to reducing the level of harmful drug-taking,
while recognising that most drugs are harmful or at least have the
potential for harm, in certain circumstances some are not, or at any
rate are no more so than alcohol or smoking. Putting aside the fact
that sometimes drugs such as cannabis or even ecstasy can have
medicinal value, it should be possible, as presently it is not, at
least to carry out studies to see at what level the consumption of
various substances becomes really harmful. We should not strive to
criminalise substances not shown to be significantly harmful and
thereby risk alienating many consumers, particularly the young.
Government should also bear it in mind that new psychoactive
substances—chemical highs—not yet made illegal are
increasingly being introduced into the market. A sound overall drugs
policy should seek to combat the temptation to devise and resort to
them too. The less the criminalisation involved, the better the chance
of moving to a system by which drug-taking can be lawfully licensed and
controlled and damage to health thereby
reduced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000179">I
turn to the second objective: changing the existing control system and
reducing so far as possible the level of resulting criminality.
Associated crime is essentially of the following kinds—of course
I discount the actual offences of supply and use that one is
contemplating perhaps in part, at least, decriminalising. First, there
are crimes such as robberies, burglaries, theft and so forth which are
committed for gain by those needing cash to fund their addiction. Many
addicts’ lives are dominated by their addiction and they will do
anything to satisfy their craving. Secondly, there are crimes committed
in the course of turf wars between rival dealers protecting their trade
and internationally between drug cartels and law enforcement agencies.
These crimes regularly involve murder, extortion, corruption and so
forth. Thirdly, there are crimes committed by those under the influence
of drugs, who are disinhibited often to a considerably greater degree
than by excessive drinking. By the same token that the nation’s
health might be improved by licensing rather than criminalising drug
supply and use, so too might associated criminality be reduced. What a
prize that would be. Perhaps liberalising—further liberalising
as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, would have it—the drugs regime
would involve some short-term political cost, but the longer-term
benefits would be colossal indeed. I hope that government will actively
participate in the search for these
benefits.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13101768000644" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000644"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T13:19:59"></hs_TimeCode>1.17

subverting the electricity and the water and creating large, successful

the police raided these farms, and not as victims. It is hugely to the

which nearly everyone is agreed: we should transfer the primary
leadership on this issue from the Home Office to the Department of

There was also, not total agreement, but a majority of recommendations
that possession of drugs should not be treated as a crime. Some 42,000
people a year are sentenced for drug offences, and 12,000 are given
jail sentences for drug possession. There is no evidence whatever that
this deters drug abuse. Indeed, it discourages going for treatment
because, as many speakers have pointed out, of the stigma involved in
such a conviction. The last thing that those who are addicted want to
do is to acquire a criminal record, which would have all sorts of
disadvantages<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T13:29:19"></hs_TimeCode>.

evidence-based policy has often shown considerable shortcomings. Take,
for example, the classification of drugs, to which many noble Lords

appalling. There is no particular evidence that the present

officially prescribed, and that the methadone is easily sold, that is
an incentive to relapse from treatment. As many

the mid-20th century that diverse drug use began to rise exponentially

the 1960s can understand this well. Drug use was part of revolutionary
social and cultural change. We read about hallucinogens in our Aldous
Huxley. My next-door neighbour at college, a biochemist, kept a test
tube on his bookshelf that was openly labelled LSD. Marijuana appeared
exotic and bohemian. Jazz musicians took heroin, we were told, and that
seemed cool—and no one talked about the dangers. We know better
now. Which of us would not be horrified to learn that our children, or

heroin substitution to heroin prescription, from counselling to
coaching, from help with accommodation to workplace training, will not
bring a cure but will bring substantial harm reduction, including a
significant cut in acquisitive crime. However, help must be available

concerns that still nag at me and stop me fully embracing the radical

teachers and others to give very clear guidance to youngsters about the
health risks and—yes—the criminal consequences of illicit
drug use. Based on my experience with youngsters, and as a police

so-called soft drugs are legalised—which some have argued

supply of so-called harder drugs. Softer-drug supply may become a
gateway, a loss leader and a route to addiction in the criminal market
of harder drugs. Your Lordships’ House has heard in previous

stronger cannabis derivatives. A caring, responsible society should set

not allow our youngest people to be involved in drugs. Perhaps there

reporting. The second session was led by a journalist, who blamed the
politicians for being risk averse. We say something about this in the
report of the APPG, which is led so energetically by the noble
Baroness. I add my thanks, too, to Frank Warburton and Jonathan Hurlow,
who did a huge amount of work on
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000219">We said

realised that the world had changed. As others said, drugs are traded
on the internet. If we close a site here, another will pop up there. We
may ban a new drug, but already there will be several in the pipeline,
because scientists in China are poring over published

do not want to break the law. I do not discount that. However, the
orders seem to feed a drive for the development of alternatives that
are subject neither to the orders nor to the Misuse of Drugs Act. Those
alternatives may be very dangerous because their contents are unknown
and change from week to week, and because young people make their own
risk assessments without reliable information. A harm-based policy,
which must be the logical approach, suggests that temporary orders
should be in place long enough for a comprehensive risk assessment,

Hannay of Chiswick (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, when the EU
Committee’s sub-committee on home affairs, which I have the
honour to chair, reported 18 months ago on the European Union’s
future drugs strategy, one of our most important findings was to note
the paucity and the poverty of the public debate on drugs issues,
including the way that such debate as there was tended to be dominated
by raucous tabloid press scare stories and governmental knee-jerk
reactions. One of our central recommendations was that the Government
and the EU institutions should aim to stimulate an EU-wide debate on
drugs policies. That finding remains as valid today as the day we made
it and that recommendation remains largely ignored by both the
Government and the EU’s institutions. It is in that context that
I warmly welcome today’s debate and the tireless efforts of my
noble friend Lady Meacher to fill that lacuna. I hope that the
Government’s contribution to this debate, and other statements
to be made by the Government in the months ahead, will help to serve
the same

striking consequence of this lack of informed debate is the
astonishingly confused and confusing public terminology for some of the
main issues at stake. It is not uncommon to read newspaper articles
which actually equate decriminalisation of a limited number of drugs
offences with the legalisation of trade in drugs as if the two terms
were synonymous, yet there is a world of difference between them. To
decriminalise the possession and use of small quantities of drugs but
not their trafficking, as Portugal has done, is a completely different
approach from that being followed in Uruguay, and possibly being
prepared in two American states, where these
commodities are being legalised. That, in turn, is quite different from
the attempt being made in New Zealand to regulate legally what are
called “legal highs”. If we are to have a sensible debate
in this country about these matters we need to pay greater heed to
these distinctions, 
<?notus-xml column=683?>and we need to be a lot better informed about the successes or failures
of these policies in the increasing number of countries where they are

is not surprising that such innovations are being tried since the not
very wisely named “war on drugs” has fallen a long way
short of being a complete success. Not only are our already overcrowded
prisons, particularly in this country and the US, being filled with
drug offenders, but many countries in Latin America, west Africa and
Asia are being devastated by the collateral effects of that war, and of
the trade in drugs, which our inability to control the demand for in
our developed economies is continuing to stimulate. That certainly does
not prove that all those policy innovations make good sense or should
be replicated here, but it does show why a policy of simply standing

remedy which seems to be gaining wider support and acceptance here and
elsewhere in Europe is to put greater emphasis on harm reduction and on
trying to treat drug users in the community rather than in prison. When
we conducted our inquiry into the EU drugs strategy we came across
small but encouraging signs that in this country such an approach was
gaining ground, often encouraged by the devoted work of voluntary
organisations. However, it is still desperately underresourced and, in
terms of government policy, this seems to be something that does not
dare to speak its name. Perhaps the Minister will address that concern

am not sufficiently expert, or perhaps sufficiently foolhardy, to put

those difficulties, surely, is the political toxicity for any

the smallest measure. Yet, if you come to think of it, this should not
be an issue where party politics are involved at
all. We should not allow such debate as there is to be dominated by a
competition in demonstrating toughness towards anything to
do with drugs. There is surely a good case for doing as
the Government have done over airport capacity
and setting up a non-political body to assess the
whole field of drugs policy, including particularly
the innovations taking place elsewhere in Europe and in the
wider world, with a remit to report back early in the next Parliament

first is to question the actual meaning of the phrase
“relatively less harmful”. Much is often made of the fact
that, in a 2007 paper, cannabis came in with a final net score lower
overall than that for tobacco or alcohol, suggesting that it might be
safer, but then again, in the same paper, cannabis scored higher than
LSD, which is widely regarded as a model for psychoses such as
schizophrenia. Is having hallucinations really more welcome than, say,
the relaxing effects of moderate amounts of alcohol? Similarly, on the
same scale, cannabis also had a higher score than ecstasy, a drug for
which in the past five to six years more than 60 papers have
documented adverse short and long-term effects on the brain. Therefore,
on that comparison, cannabis should be more harmful. Moreover, smoking
cigarette after cigarette in one sitting is unlikely to achieve an
“overdose” akin to a single session of marijuana that can
send smokers to A&amp;E with acute panic
attacks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T13:56:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000233" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000233">These
drugs all have detrimental effects, but they are qualitatively
different. Surely any direct comparison is like benchmarking apples
against pears. Further factors might come into play, such as the
differential effects of certain drugs on the still developing
adolescent brain. In teenagers a certain region, the prefrontal cortex,
is still not fully operational, accounting perhaps for the tendency of
young people to take more risks and seek sensation. This, in turn, may
be reflected in the differential statistics, where the risk of cannabis
addiction has been estimated for adults to be about one in 10, but
almost doubles for teenagers to one in six. A recent report in the
<I>Lancet</I> has documented cannabis as having a dependence syndrome
in the young,
including,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13101768000605" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000605">“increased

a paper published in <I>Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences</I> has shown that persistent cannabis use was associated
with neuropsychological impairment among adolescent-onset users, for
whom cessation did not fully restore neuropsychological functioning.
Confounding factors such as socioeconomic status or personality
differences were subsequently eliminated: the link appears direct
between cannabis use and an irreversibly lowered IQ. No similar claims
have been made for nicotine. Even if such qualitatively different drugs
could be compared on a quantitatively single scale, the crucial
question is then: just how harmful is a “less harmful”
drug? The phrase lacks any precise definition, and cannot therefore
really be used as a valid justification or a starting
premise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000235" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000235">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T13:58:15"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T13:58:40"></hs_TimeCode>
second point relates to the paradoxical signals sent out that, although
the laws may be relaxed on a drug, it is still to be avoided. Already
the possibility of cannabis legalisation is all too readily glamorised
as a cool and trendy campaign to support, with little negative
publicity offsetting that image, in contrast, for example, with
tobacco. It would be helpful to know how the preventive programmes
mentioned in the reports—we have heard too little about those
this afternoon—will be funded and rolled out. The reports paint
a rather 
<?notus-xml column=685?>gloomy picture of the preventive programmes, yet one initiative they did
not explore, which has proved successful, is a community-wide approach,
such as the one in the US, where community anti-drug coalitions have
shown positive impacts when a community-wide response is taken

possibility has been prompted by my own experience of speaking in
schools and penal institutions on drugs and the brain. Adults and
teenagers alike get fascinated by basic neuroscience that can give
insights into drug action: the “plasticity” of the brain
whereby dynamic, endless reorganising of individual neuronal
connectivity is driven by individual experience through chemical
messengers signalling between different brain cells. It is this
chemical transmission, this plasticity, that is modified in various
ways by different recreational drugs. If this personalisation of the
brain could be the individual mind, then “blowing your
mind” might be an unintentionally accurate description. I have
found from experience that this carries weight with young
audiences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000237" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000237">Other

new challenges, including new drugs as they emerge; and a policy that
is sustainable in the long term. To do this, we clearly need to learn
from quality research, including the experiences and evaluations of 
<?notus-xml column=686?>different approaches from other countries. In fact, in their response to

this explicitly. They say

new risks to which we must urgently attend, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Hamwee, mentioned. I am speaking about risks posed by the rapid changes
in drug manufacture, the new psychoactive substances and so-called club
drugs. While temporary drug control orders are to be welcomed as a
helpful step in dealing with these new threats, they are not
sufficient. As I understand it, the Government have used three
temporary banning orders in total, despite the fact that there are well
over 100 legal highs out there and they are coming in at a rate of more
than 70 a year. In fact, in the last year alone, 73 new
substances came on to the British market and are now freely available
from 690 online shops. The noble Baroness, Lady Lane-Fox, highlighted
the pros and cons of the internet market. In addition, the Angelus
Foundation thinks that there could be up to 300 head shops selling
these substances on UK high streets. The European Monitoring Centre for
Drugs and Drug Addiction is monitoring 280 new substances across
Europe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000243">Against
this disturbing background, Les Iversen, chair of the Advisory Council
on the Misuse of Drugs, has said that the ACMD has the capacity to
review only about four legal highs a year. I believe that it has to
carry out a review even for a temporary banning order. I would
therefore like to understand more about the Government’s
rejection of the all-party parliamentary group’s key
recommendation regarding these orders. Perhaps the Minister can explain
the thinking behind not making these orders permanent in a way that
does not, as the all-party group recommends, add to the criminalisation
of young
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0001.htm#13101768000244">On the
question of decriminalisation, which many noble Lords have mentioned,
and the issue of whether we have a punishment-led or treatment-led
approach to drug problems, I have to say that all Governments, my own
included, sometimes fail to make the right decisions based on evidence.
This is due to the pressures that build up from public debate, which is
itself often ill informed as a result of exaggeration in the media and
cries that the Government of the day are somehow being soft on drugs if
they give way to the advice of the experts. Let us be clear about this:
the evidence supports treatment rather than criminalisation and
punishment. The recent experience in Portugal on using drug treatment
panels rather than the traditional criminal justice system supports
this. We have also recently seen a complete reversal of direction in

first treatment that a drug user receives must be about stabilising the

talked to offenders, ex-offenders and drug users to get feedback for

after listening to all the many excellent contributions, I suggest that
the way forward on these complex and challenging issues is to establish

I could set this in motion today. I am sure that there are a number of

the crime committed by organised career criminals; such criminals would
simply seek new sources of illicit revenue through crime. Neither would
a regulated market eliminate illicit supplies, as alcohol and tobacco

centuries of human achievement, we still see endless conflict, death

more than 2 billion people. It embraces a complete cross-section of the
globe, from the Pacific to Africa to the Caribbean, big states such as
India and small states such as Trinidad, rich and poor, following many
religions and beliefs. We share a common history stemming from our
empire, a common language and shared aspirations for good governance,
the rule of law, respect for human rights and increased prosperity.
Many of us in this Chamber have witnessed in our lifetime the
transition from empire to this Commonwealth of equal
nations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000290" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000290">Throughout
the Commonwealth’s history the Queen has given us the

from apartheid to Rhodesia. During her reign she has made
150 Commonwealth visits. Indeed, she has been the unifying figure of
the Commonwealth. The new Diamond Jubilee Trust recognises her special
role. We could not invent the Commonwealth today. It stems from our
shared history and experience. At its heart is contact between people
as much as contact between Governments—links which cover every
facet of our lives The 750,000 Commonwealth immigrants who arrived in
this country between 1950 and 1960 symbolised the end of empire and are
now an integrated part of our lives in Britain. This Commonwealth
migration applies to many other countries as well. Furthermore, the
links that have been forged by more than 90 Commonwealth professional
bodies cover every aspect of life, from medicine and universities to
forestry and the media. Many other noble Lords will demonstrate today

this gives us an opportunity which we either discard or
seize—the opportunity to use this organisation to improve the

increasingly important. Modern technology gives us the means to use
this vast network to our mutual benefit. The Commonwealth is unique.
Membership is not a substitute, but complements our membership of NATO,
the European Union, or our natural relationship with the United States.
Because it is so comprehensive in its range, the Commonwealth does not
create a day-to-day impact on people’s lives or headlines in the

underestimated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000292" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000292">The
main purpose of this debate is to explore how we can all achieve added
value from our membership and strengthen the Commonwealth to benefit
all members. Let me comment first on intergovernmental co-operation and
then people-to-people contact. First, we need to 
<?notus-xml column=695?>face up to the significance of the Commonwealth Heads of Government
Meeting in Sri Lanka in November. Together with Gambia’s recent
withdrawal, the spotlight is indeed on the core values, highlighted in
the new charter of the Commonwealth. Sri Lanka’s human rights
record in recent times has been disappointing. Our Government have made
it clear that we expect to see at CHOGM concrete progress on human
rights, judicial independence, free and fair regional elections and
proper access and freedom of movement for civil society and the media.
The Prime Minister has decided to participate in this conference, while
Canada’s Prime Minister will not attend and is reviewing
Canada’s funding programme for the Commonwealth. I understand
that the Commonwealth has been active in working for reconciliation and
improvements in human rights in Sri Lanka. Is there a lesson to be
learnt here from South Africa’s successful Truth and
Reconciliation Commission? Can the Minister report to the House on the
progress that is being made? The reputation of the Commonwealth is at
stake.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000293" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000293">While
on human rights, I ask the Minister to accept that our arguments are
likely to be more persuasive if we demonstrate that we are making our
own improvements. For example, it would be helpful for our Government
to state at CHOGM that we plan to restore the right of return to the
British Indian Ocean Territory to those Chagossians who, in the late
1960s, were expelled by us from their homeland to make way for Diego
Garcia. This remains a blot on our copybook which we must
rectify.</hs_para>

most important aspect of CHOGM is to pursue the implementation of a
series of recommendations from the previous meeting in Perth. These
ranged from ways to improve governance, human rights and
the rule of law to economic and commercial development and
cultural collaboration. If Governments are to get more advantage from
this, it is worth stressing how important it is for Ministers in
virtually every department to think in Commonwealth terms and to work
collectively to that end. One of the agreed recommendations was to
strengthen the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group to deal with a
full range of serious or persistent violations of Commonwealth values.
The Commonwealth’s ability to deal effectively with conflict
resolution could act as a model to the rest of the world. Intervention
in the past with countries that have flouted Commonwealth standards,
such as Fiji, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Pakistan, demonstrate its
value. Other areas include strengthening democracy through the

other side of the coin is what we are doing to strengthen development

infections. More widely, there is the question of the empowerment of
women, who are vital to economic development, and broad issues such as

organisation is to stimulate the role of non-governmental bodies in
development. It has embarked on a strategy to facilitate a dialogue
between civil society and government. Civil society becomes
more robust as the newly educated and professional middle
classes emerge and aspire to play a part in the development
of their countries. At the same time, there are citizens that remain
outside the realm of the policy-making processes. The foundation is

my days in the banking world, I thought it would be a good idea to look
at all countries, not just the Commonwealth countries which seemed to
have run out of money. I wanted to get back as much money as possible

projects around the world rather than on British ones. I went on a

mentor in the person of Lord Jellicoe. I went to west Africa with Lord
Jellicoe and the Duke of Kent to visit the French territories and I
found myself being adopted by Société Commerciale de
l’Ouest Africain. The society asked me to help it in Senegal,
saying that there was a problem with the British territory over on the
other side of the water. I went on holiday to Senegal with my wife and
small son because people are kind to children when you are travelling
abroad and not being too commercial. Later, back at my bank, I looked
into the possibility of creating a “Senegambia”. That was
because the Frenchman I met wore a rather smart khaki bomber
jacket-type uniform, while the other one was dressed in what was in
effect British gear. I use that just as an aside, but the idea behind
it is that we should co-operate with France as well.</hs_para>

I am also pleased to follow the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, in admitting

having been born on a tiny island in the Caribbean sea between
Guadeloupe and Martinique—the island of Dominica. That mixed
heritage very much reflects the heritage of the Commonwealth. I, too,

the link of the Commonwealth was the fact that many of the islands and
countries that formed it were British in character. Our union was a
very valuable, attractive and compelling one. It was a loose but
supportive Commonwealth family although, as with any family,
disagreements would arise. There were robust challenges, questions and
arguments, as well as solutions. What is unusual about the Commonwealth
family is that new people are constantly trying to join it. We had
Mozambique in 1995 and Rwanda in 2009. Many noble Lords will know that
I am part French because I have a French grandfather. I cannot stress
enough to your Lordships how much ire has been aroused in my French

Commonwealth together is not just a shared historical connection with
Great Britain, but a shared commitment to the rule of law, human
rights, the protection of freedom of expression and minority rights. In
1991, the Heads of Government of the countries of the Commonwealth met
in Harare and signed the Harare Commonwealth Declaration. As we all
remember, that declaration was signed in the aftermath of the collapse
of the Soviet Union. I think that it is actually a very beautiful
document. If we had had more time, I would have liked to have read into
the record its principles, because they are the principles to which we
should all adhere. They renewed international optimism about the spread
of democracy and human rights. As the noble Lord, Lord Luce, has said,
this year, for the first time in the Commonwealth’s 64-year
history, these values have been set out in one document, the
Commonwealth Charter, which was signed by Her Majesty the Queen on 11
March, which is Commonwealth Day. From that eclectic mix and through
its shared experience of heritage and aspiration, the Commonwealth has
an extraordinary ability to meld together diverse and challenging
histories into something that is capable of delivering unity, peace,
tranquillity and
productivity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000318" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000318">That
productivity has been profound. Commonwealth countries make up 26% of
the world’s population and account for 15% of global gross
national income. The total gross domestic product of the Commonwealth
is greater than that of the European Union and is predicted to grow by
7.3% between 2012 and 2017. Trade in goods within the Commonwealth is
now worth about £250 billion each year to its members. There are
huge positives to be gained from being a member of the Commonwealth. As
we have heard, our exports to India are increasing, as they are to
Canada and Australia. As the trade envoy to South Africa, I want to
mention that we are hoping to double trade with that country by 2015.

eliminate avoidable blindness by the year 2020. We seek to build up a

migration and skills, the unique disadvantages of small states, aid

the potential of the Commonwealth to play an important role as a forum

controversy over Sri Lanka hosting this year’s CHOGM while

resolution positions around the world, for example in United Nations
operations. I have always been struck by the particular way in which
the corps of values that unites them has influenced the contributions
to conflict prevention, post-conflict reconstruction and the other
aspects of conflict resolution. I well remember talking with Admiral
Howe, the American commander in Somalia, and asking him if he had any
wishes. After saying he wanted a British officer in his headquarters,
he said that the contingents trained by us had a very much better
approach to the task in hand than others, citing Malawi and
Botswana.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101768000329" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000329">I

Earlier this week, we had the great pleasure of taking evidence from
the high commissioner from Mozambique, one of the most recently joined
members of the Commonwealth. What I found very revealing was his
description of what membership of the Commonwealth meant for
Mozambique. He mentioned, of course, the help that it had received from
the United Kingdom but also made the very pointed suggestion that it
was membership of the partnership of all the other nations in different
parts of the world—the Commonwealth is represented on 
<?notus-xml column=703?>every continent and subcontinent—that made the most difference
for Mozambique and encouraged them the
most.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000330" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000330">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:06:05"></hs_TimeCode>

in its modern form on 28 April 1949, the Commonwealth next year reaches
pensionable age, and 65 is a good opportunity for reflection. In so
reflecting, we can point to important accomplishments: giving, as we
have heard, a united voice to countries that share a common history and
language and working hard to make progress in areas ranging from
encouraging the leadership of women to strategic thinking on ocean
governance. However, any reflection must lead us also to the conclusion
that, unlike some younger institutions, such as the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation and the African Union, which are
relevant to members because of their heavy focus on economic
development, the Commonwealth suffers from one great defect: its
failure ever to establish a central mission. In an overcrowded market
of international organisations, you need a unique selling point. The
Commonwealth does not possess
one.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000333" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000333">The
central reason for that is the diversity of its membership. Building a
core mission that is as relevant to the people of Canada and New
Zealand as it is to the people of Zambia and the Solomon Islands is
exceptionally difficult. However, if the Commonwealth is to have a
future in a rapidly changing world, then it must develop clarity about
its aims and its
mission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000334" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000334">The
Commonwealth charter, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, is an
admirable attempt to do that. It is a statement of rights and
responsibilities broad in scope and noble in ambition. However, the
problem with it, of course, is that it is worthless if members simply
pay lip service to it and no one—through persuasion, leadership
or even disciplinary action—tries to ensure it has
force.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000335" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000335">I will
outline two pertinent examples. First, Article V of the

Commonwealth countries are littered with colonial laws that stifle the
free flow of information and muzzle the media, including criminal libel
and state licensing of journalists—although none of them yet has
a royal charter. In Uganda, Cameroon, Bangladesh and Rwanda, to name
just a few, the state of press freedom is parlous and punitive laws are
deployed to stop the development of an independent media and to punish
journalists. Sri Lanka, Singapore and Rwanda languish near the bottom
of the Reporters Without Borders 2013 World Press Freedom Index.
Although there have been improvements, there is still a tragic problem
with the safety of journalists, six of whom have been killed this year
in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. Media freedom is fundamental to the
charter, because the right of free expression is one on which all
others rest, yet the record of the Commonwealth here is
lamentable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:09:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13101768000336" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000336">My

propose the creation of something known as Common Health—a hub
for exchange of educational materials, best innovative practice and
life-saving information, made available at the fingertips of every
healthcare practitioner across the Commonwealth through modern
communications technology. If this initiative were able to go
forward—indeed, it was endorsed to do so—it would provide
an opportunity to ensure that everything that we have learnt and that
has been validated in each Commonwealth country, having been shared
among the learned societies and professional organisations for
healthcare practitioners in those countries, could be shared broadly
across a community of practitioners, numbering possibly some 2 million

Simultaneously, at the Oval Test in 1884, the English wicket-keeper,
Alfred Lyttelton, achieved what remains the greatest bowling feat by a

off his pads and took four for 19, bowling underarm. Lyttelton’s

this Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and so shortly become the
Commonwealth chair-in-office, voicing in international forums the
Commonwealth position, including, presumably, the articulation of those
core
values.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000354" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000354">The
Sri Lankan Government host this meeting having made scant effort to
secure accountability for the appalling atrocities committed by their

hospitals by heavy artillery, deliberate denial of food and medicine to
civilians in the no-fire zone and summary executions of civilians.
Despite considerable international pressure on them to mend their ways,
the Sri Lanka Government continue to target journalists and human
rights activists. There are well substantiated reports of enforced

Government will continue to make representations to the Sri Lankan
Government about their concerns— at least, I hope that she will
say that— but I hope that she is in no doubt about how that

Colombo meeting. When the then Culture Secretary decided to spend his
Christmas holiday in Sri Lanka, just six months after the end of the
civil war and all those atrocities, the state-run broadcaster in Sri
Lanka claimed that “his arrival despite the accusations made by
the British government on the human rights record of Sri Lanka is an

Canadian Prime Minister has understood the significance of attending
this meeting. He is not going because, he says, “It is clear
that the Sri Lankan government has failed to uphold the

principled stand of the Canadian Prime Minister. If the Sri Lankan
Government continue to refuse to show greater commitment to these
Commonwealth values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, how
long are the Government going to continue to make representations
before they conclude that they have failed to make any progress, and
then what will they do? What damage does the Minister think will be
done to the credibility of the Commonwealth when those strong, clear

Hannay of Chiswick (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord
Luce’s initiative in holding this debate could not be better
timed in that it enables this House to look at the wider issues and
future development of the Commonwealth, as well as addressing some of
the short-term matters arising in connection with next month’s
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka. Too often in the
past, those short-term issues have obscured the need for us to take a
clear-eyed view of the role that the Commonwealth should play in the
overall picture of Britain’s external relations. Too often also,
successive British Governments have approached a heads of government
meeting with either a spirit of damage limitation or excessive
expectations. Neither of those approaches is a good guide to long-term
policy making.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=709?><hs_para UID="13101768000358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000358">The first step in taking
that wider view is to rid ourselves of two misconceptions. The first is
that the Commonwealth is in some way an alternative for this country to
its membership of the European Union. It is no more that now than it
was when the Macmillan and Wilson Governments concluded in the 1960s
that it was not a viable alternative. Indeed, it is even less so than
then. So far as I can see, not one Commonwealth Government wants
Britain to leave the European Union and most would deeply deplore it,
as the Australian Government—not the most enthusiastic supporter
of Britain’s original membership back in the 1960s—made
clear in a recent submission to the Government’s balance of
competences review. Looking ahead, we should surely conclude, just as
the French have done over the Francophonie, that this is not an
either/or choice but a both/and one.</hs_para>

misconception is the tendency for Britain to take a proprietorial view
of the Commonwealth. We may have founded the organisation but it does
not belong to us, any more than it does to its other members. When we
talk about the Commonwealth as being a soft-power asset for Britain,
which I believe it is—and which I am sure the committee of the
noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, will find it to be—it can
only be so to the extent that it is a soft-power asset for all its
members.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101768000360" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000360">Has
the Commonwealth expanded too far? I do not believe so. It was right to
respond positively to the membership bids by Mozambique and Rwanda. The
Commonwealth of the future should not be regarded simply as a
prolongation of an imperial colonial past. If one day in the future a
democratic, human-rights observant Myanmar were to wish to join, I hope
we would welcome it with open arms. We must certainly not abandon the
hope that one day Zimbabwe, too, will want to—and will be able
to—rejoin.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000361" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000361">In
what way should we be trying to strengthen the Commonwealth? I
certainly do not believe that we should give up the aim of making the
Commonwealth a more effective guarantor of the human rights of its
citizens. That aim was checked at the last CHOGM meeting in Perth. The
holding of the next meeting in Sri Lanka will certainly not strengthen
its credibility, but we should persevere in the effort in the medium
and long term. We need to build up that network of professional
cultural links, which are such an important part of the
Commonwealth’s value to its members.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13101768000362" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000362">In that context, the
Government’s immigration policy, which seems to be having a
disproportionately discouraging effect on the movement of
professionals—it is certainly doing so in the field of higher
education, where large drops are occurring in the intake of
students from a number of the larger Commonwealth
countries—surely needs to be reviewed. There is a contradiction
between the Government’s support for the Commonwealth and the
effect of their immigration policies. Surely, too, we should be
expanding further the grant of Commonwealth scholarships in this
country and not limiting them to its developing members.</hs_para>

many achievements behind it, not least the remarkably effective stand
that it took against apartheid in sport. I would be confident that it
has many more ahead of it, so long as it does not

it is a striking fact that even though the Commonwealth has its
historical roots in the 19th century, it is perhaps one of
the international organisations or platforms that is most suited to the
world of the 21st. One great characteristic of CHOGM is that, similar
to the hosting of the Olympic Games, the spotlight of the
world’s media comes to shine into the recesses of that country.
In the run-up to the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, it focused on Tibet.
Now, increasingly, it is focusing on the question of why the Sri Lankan
Government have not yet independently or credibly investigated the
allegations of war crimes; why there continues regrettably to be a lack
of accountability for human rights violations; why the concerns of UN
human rights chief Navi Pillay have not been addressed in full; and why
political intervention with the media and judiciary go, as my noble
friend Lord Black stated, far beyond the norms of
acceptability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:30:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13101768000366" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000366">As
a number of noble Lords have commented, this year marked the adoption
by all member countries of the Commonwealth charter, which sets out for
the first time in a single document the Commonwealth’s core
values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and commits its
leaders to upholding these values. If, in year one of the existence of
the charter, Sri Lanka does not recognise that the brick that has been
removed from the base of the Commonwealth edifice by the decision of
the Canadian Prime Minister may not be the last one, as my noble friend
Lord Chidgey hinted, and that the organisation is structured on values,
any further “tinkering” or “inconsistency”
by Commonwealth leaders—I quote the Commons Foreign Affairs
Select Committee report—will not number among the last steps
taken. If Sri Lanka does not recognise these realities, it is blind to
its own

values of the Commonwealth, which are under scrutiny, are brought under
the international spotlight and that the Government of Sri Lanka are
encouraged to respond positively. When the current emphasis of the
Commonwealth is, rightly, on young people, we must convey to them the
values of, and describe the institutions that underpin, the
Commonwealth. Now is the time for stronger diplomatic intervention by
Commonwealth leaders and a determined response by the Sri Lankan

Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:32:41"></hs_TimeCode>. At
this stage, the answer for me is a protracted and absolutely necessary
process of diplomacy and engagement, not isolation. Now more than ever,
the Commonwealth must stand in defence of freedom and respect for human
dignity. Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, was right

Browne of Ladyton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to
follow the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, in this debate. I thank the noble
Lord, Lord Luce, and congratulate him on securing this timely debate. I
agree with him that for the Heads of Government convening in Colombo in
November there is a significant history to be celebrated and
a narrative that is redolent with optimistic potential, but, as the
noble Lord, Lord Black of Brentwood, reminded us, as did my noble
friend Lord Wills, there is also a narrative of
challenge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000371" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000371">The
latter is a familiar narrative for this part of the 21st century for
organisations such as the Commonwealth. It is a narrative of challenge
of reform and renewal, particularly a narrative of re-establishing
trust among current Commonwealth countries and Governments in the
credibility of the organisation, as well as rebuilding confidence in
the delivery mechanisms of the secretariat, which involves dealing with
institutional reform, developing leadership and showing a degree of
resolve. The nature and scale of this challenge should not be
underestimated despite the obvious achievement. For example, 70% of the
Commonwealth secretariat’s budget is contributed by only three,
possibly now only two, countries, and 30 out of 54 countries—or
53 as it is now—in the Commonwealth are in arrears in their
contributions to it. There is a manifest north/south divide in the
narratives of the Commonwealth. It was exemplified most recently by the
differential narratives of the Canadian Government’s decision
and the Gambian Government’s decision. This narrative is
blocking relationships between countries. It is being exploited by
others outside the Commonwealth, as the Library note makes clear in
relation to China, and involves a significant deterioration in
relationships. Polling shows that there is a lack of knowledge about
the Commonwealth among the public of its member countries, and why
would there not be when a majority of Governments do nothing to
explain, promote or support the Commonwealth? None of this is new, and
these challenges are not even comprehensive.</hs_para>

part of the process of reform and renewal was to be the relaunch of the
Commonwealth as a partnership of nations committed to upholding the
Commonwealth values as set out in the new charter signed by Her Majesty
in March. These values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and
good governance are all to be seen in a shared vision of bringing
together better opportunities for people around the world. This is a
challenging ambition in itself. Just how challenging has been
exemplified by some of the references that have already been made to
the varying views about the rights of citizens in the Commonwealth and
by the evidence in pages 8 to 12 of the Library note, which make
shocking reading, about the behaviour of some Governments in
Commonwealth countries. The issues that frame this challenge for the
Commonwealth are identified in the EPG’s report and
recommendations. If we were to look for an agenda for the future of the
Commonwealth, we could do worse than just to take that report and its
recommendations as the agenda for the CHOGM.</hs_parafo>

more to listen than to speak, and I have been wonderfully rewarded so
far. I come at this as rather a newcomer to the Commonwealth, or to the
issues of the Commonwealth, although, of course, I was born a
Commonwealth citizen. A lot of people in this country do not pay a
great deal of attention to the Commonwealth. I have been paying

first point is about links. As the noble Lord, Lord Luce, said in his
excellent speech, there is a kaleidoscope of links between our country
and all the Commonwealth countries. I was in Uganda yesterday for the
launch of the Uganda UK health alliance, which brings together about
200 British organisations working in health in Uganda. The speech given
by the Minister of Health there was very much about our shared legacy,
our friendship and what we can do 
<?notus-xml column=713?>together and the future. Anyone who works in health in Africa will be
aware of the painful legacy of colonialism that is still there, but the

already mentioned, the Commonwealth Health Ministers Meeting is one of
the great meetings for Health Ministers in Africa. They see it as an

the people-to-people aspects which the noble Lord, Lord Luce, mentioned
right at the beginning of the debate. We underplay the Commonwealth. I
am not at all unusual in not having thought much about the Commonwealth
at all beyond, perhaps, the Commonwealth Games and a few other things
like that. It has been, to put it slightly rudely, something that the
enthusiasts have understood, and if you know about the Commonwealth you
know about the Commonwealth. The profile needs to be raised in many
different ways, as the noble Lord, Lord Luce, again said. With that
comes the scope for greater shared growth and development in a wide

Gardner of Parkes (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I spoke in my noble
friend Lord Sheikh’s debate of December 2009, and I will repeat
a bit of that today. It is important to know the history of how the
Commonwealth Members are entitled to sit in the House of Lords. Things
seemed to have gone desperately wrong in 2009, when it looked as if we
had been barred from sitting. Inadvertently, the Labour Government
claimed, and I am sure that that is right, they had forgotten to renew
the clause giving Commonwealth citizens the right to sit in the House.

Clerk of Parliaments, because I was speaking in that Commonwealth
debate, as always, and said that I would like to know which Act I was
sitting under. He said, “It was always the 1981 Act.
Unfortunately, that has gone and been replaced by the 2006 Act”.
I could give noble Lords the names of these Acts but there is no time.
“As a result,” he continued, “your position is
anomalous, to say the
least<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:44:13"></hs_TimeCode>”.
Anyway, I mentioned it in the debate and the noble Baroness, Lady
Kinnock, replied to say that they had a few months previously
discovered, three years after the Act, that Commonwealth Members were
not listed and had no rights. However, she confirmed that they would
correct this error before the next election and that I should keep
coming, which of course I did.</hs_para>

time passed by, and the issue was to be brought back in the
Constitutional Reform Act. We got the agreement through in the last
hour of the last day of the previous Parliament. Many noble Lords will
remember what a day it was. Everyone was arguing about whether we
should touch the Bill at all, having brought such a major
constitutional Bill to the House, and how we could be expected to deal
with all the stages on one day, when everyone thought that it was about
three weeks’ work. It looked as if we would not get anywhere.
However, the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, spoke up for the Civil
Service, I spoke up for the noble Lords who would lose their right to
sit here, and another noble Lord spoke up in favour of standards. A
number of noble Lords spoke.</hs_para>

both marvellous throughout this whole procedure. They came with all the
members of the various parties and we returned to the Sitting at
12.05 am on the last day, which was the day of Prorogation.
It was almost the very last thing that went through, and I am very glad
that it did. Looking around the Chamber today, I could not tell you who
is Commonwealth-only, as I am, and who is Commonwealth but also has
British citizenship. It is good that we have that

must also say that the Commonwealth as a whole has a huge regard for
the Queen and there is a great deal of affection there. The
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, whose past three conferences I
have attended, is in a worrying position. The rest of the world and all
the Commonwealth believe that you must have internal audit, and there 
<?notus-xml column=715?>has been a resistance to that. However, Alan Haselhurst has now
persuaded the CPA executive committee to accept that a formal internal
audit is required. As noble Lords will know, Australia has withdrawn
from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association but is still completely
devoted to the Commonwealth. However, it has withdrawn. I am told that
it was bipartisan and that it withdrew because of this lack of
efficiency and proper administration, and that the internal audit is so
essential, worldwide, in everything—giving transparency and
clarity on these matters—and so that had to be resolved. Until
that is resolved, I see no prospect of Australia returning, which would
be a great pity, as it can be a very good organisation. I have attended
the past three conferences, including one in Sri Lanka. There is no
time to say more, but I am very hopeful that CHOGM will go

what is the Commonwealth for? What, according to the question put by
the noble Lord, Lord Black, is the central mission? That question is
not asked of other international organisations—NATO or the UN,
for example—but a substantial answer was given by the noble
Lord, Lord Luce, in his excellent opening. There are real problems of
definition, which become more acute at the time of CHOGMs. Of course,
there is no lack of aspiration, grand declarations or inquiries, such
as the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group, and now, of course, we have

members of the Commonwealth relationship? Is it to be seen in political
solidarity—one for all and all for one? We would expect that,
for example, on controversial matters such as, for us, the Falklands
and Gibraltar. Alas, I do not see such solidarity among Commonwealth

should ask whether there should, as a matter of course, be meetings of
Commonwealth members at all—or at all
relevant—international fora before and
when those meetings are held. Equally, the fact
of the exchange of views between finance Ministers and
others has the effect of influencing both us and our Commonwealth
partners. Do we see strong advantages to members in trade and
economics? There is some evidence of trade
co-operation, but there is no Commonwealth preference and, as we saw
over the recent order for aircraft by India, where, oddly, the French
aircraft was chosen over the Typhoon, Commonwealth countries
take hard-nosed decisions over such purchases. Currently, President
Hollande is in South Africa, and there have been major French trade
missions to India. On aid, DfID’s multilateral aid review
concluded that the Commonwealth was poor value as a mechanism for the
distribution of aid.</hs_para>

which has been the core function of the Commonwealth? I recall that the
report of the Foreign Affairs Committee in 2012 concluded that it was
disturbed to note the ineffectiveness of the mechanisms for upholding
Commonwealth values. The Maldives is a member of the Commonwealth
Ministerial Action Group, yet it has an appalling record on
women’s rights—and, of course, 60% of Commonwealth
countries still have the death penalty. The major recommendation of the
Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group relating to a human rights

the Commonwealth is a loose club from which they
benefit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000389" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000389">Next
month’s CHOGM is in Sri Lanka. In my judgment, it was sad that
that venue was chosen, and a mistake on the part of the Government to
be represented by the Prime Minister. If we are to be represented at
all, perhaps it should be by a junior Minister. It is absurd also that
Sri Lanka will now be the chairman in office, and, equally, will be a

often professional, as was mentioned by my noble and learned friend

often enabling relations between professionals—that the value of

tell the House why I say that. Noble Lords may have read recently that
the Indian Government had decided to give a lot of money for food for
the poorest. The view is that it is not getting to the poorest, and
that either the money or the food is disappearing to the middlemen.
That is one thing. The second thing is that, if the food does get to
the poorest, everybody assures me that it will not get to 
<?notus-xml column=717?>the women and girls; it will go to the men and boys. This is the reality
of the Commonwealth. India has the largest number of undernourished
people in the whole world, but look at the money that has come into
that country and its economic prosperity. However, that money has gone
mostly to Switzerland. There are trillions of dollars in Switzerland

regards Africa, I was in Uganda last year. Every time I saw a good farm

best assets in Uganda. That, again, is very depressing. Who is carrying
the loads? It is the women. Where are the men? They are in the shops.
Nothing has changed and I fear it is very likely that nothing will
change. We cannot influence that. The saddest thing is that there is no
desire to improve the situation of women because clearly that does not
suit the men. If the women slave all day and ask for nothing, is that

but it is not recognised. They are not entitled to anything and they

shared my life almost equally between two member states of the
Commonwealth and have been an ardent supporter of it. At the outset, I
want to 
<?notus-xml column=719?>express my admiration for both the concept and the institutions of the
Commonwealth. Conceptually it is unique—a voluntary association
embracing a diversity and fraternity unusual in today’s world.
This outreach, extending to every region of the globe and including the
largest spectrum of nationalities and faiths, gives the Commonwealth a
rare stature. It is an invaluable asset that can and should be more
vigorously employed in contributing to the resolution of international
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000405" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000405">Nowadays,
international opinion is at long last beginning to have a serious
influence on the behaviour of states. This is evident in the situation
that prevails in the host country of next month’s meeting, Sri
Lanka. That is also true of other countries hitherto impervious to
world sentiment. It is now timely and appropriate for the Commonwealth
as a collective to be more assertive in its diplomatic endeavours. The
Commonwealth would become even more persuasive if it were to mobilise
and utilise the services of its many elder statesmen whose credentials
carry significant authority. I therefore urge the Government’s
delegation to CHOGM to think along these lines and seek the
collaboration of other nations in making the Commonwealth more
effective in contributing to peace, justice and
freedom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000406" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000406">As
members of a freedom-fighting family, we were surprised and delighted
when, at the time of Indian independence in 1947, India’s Prime
Minister Jawaharlal Nehru took the decision for India to stay in the
Commonwealth. This encouraged the notion of a multidimensional
organisation, diverse in its activities and membership.
Institutionally, the Commonwealth has accomplished much through its
secretariat and associated groups. I am particularly encouraged by its
activities in the education sector. Being actively engaged in the work
of several schools and universities in India and this country, I can
testify to the value of such initiatives as the Commonwealth of
Learning and the Commonwealth
scholarships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000407" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000407">However,
institutions are most successful when they engage the broadest
constituencies. The Commonwealth draws its life-blood from the
Governments of its members, but it has been sadly lacking in connecting
with ordinary citizens—in establishing wide popular support.
Therefore, I hope that the institutional structure will increasingly
involve the public of the member states—for instance, in
supplementing English as the official language of Commonwealth
communications. This can only enrich and strengthen
interactions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000408" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000408">The
Commonwealth is at an interesting moment in its evolution. To continue
its mission, it must change, adapt and grow. If it does not, it will
become less relevant and marginalised. That is a fate that its
distinguished record does not deserve and to which I hope next
month’s gathering will give some serious
consideration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000409" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000409">To

Lexden (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, in this debate, kindly made
possible by the noble Lord, Lord Luce—I join others in thanking
him for it—I should like to return briefly to an issue which I
raised in a debate that I initiated a year ago. It is an issue that
should trouble us profoundly. Allusion has already been made to it by
my noble friend Lord Black and the noble Lord, Lord Wills. Millions of
our fellow Commonwealth citizens live under laws that brand them as
criminals because of their sexual orientation alone. Their offence is
the homosexuality with which they are imbued and by which their lives
are inevitably shaped. The numbers criminalised in this cruel fashion
are very large because so many Commonwealth countries defy the
obligations placed on them by international
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000411" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000411">People in
Britain rarely guess the proportion that adhere to these obligations
correctly. They are reluctant to believe that more than a small
minority of Commonwealth states could behave with such inhumanity in
the early 21st century, when the need to respect human rights is so
widely accepted. The shocking truth is that more than three-quarters of
our Commonwealth partners—41 states out of 52—put
homosexuals outside the law. In some of them, the punishments that can
be imposed are almost unimaginably harsh. Life imprisonment is the
penalty in Sierra Leone; in Malaysia, it is 20 years in prison with
flogging. One’s heart goes out in particular to the young
people, who, as we have heard, are so numerous in today’s
Commonwealth.</hs_para>

wrecked by these inhumane laws is not to be measured simply by
sentences imposed on, or by unchecked persecution endured by,
homosexuals. The widespread criminalisation of homosexuality has been a
great driving force in the spread of HIV/AIDS, the worst pandemic of
our times. A single appalling statistic underlines the extent of the
suffering that has been inflicted on so many of our Commonwealth
partners as a result. While the Commonwealth accounts for nearly 30% of
the world’s population, it also contains more than 60% of the
people living with HIV across the globe.</hs_para>

this suffering and oppression to be found? In a number of countries,
including Belize, Jamaica and Singapore, brave individuals are
challenging the violation of their human rights in the courts. Powerful
legal assistance is being provided to them without charge through the
International Commission of Jurists, the Human Dignity Trust and the
Commonwealth Lawyers’ Association. There could be no finer
example of a Commonwealth partnership in the cause of human progress.
Success in one state could embolden the judges in other jurisdictions
because of the similarity of their laws inherited from the British
Empire. However, this is the moment when the central institutions of
the Commonwealth should assert themselves with vigour and
authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000414" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000414">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T16:09:58"></hs_TimeCode>

effective strategy to secure them—a strategy devised in close

Prashar (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord
Luce, for introducing this timely debate. At present, the future of the
Commonwealth looks precarious and its moral authority appears to be
under siege. Some of this is exaggerated—for example, the
suggestion that the Commonwealth may well disintegrate. The
Commonwealth’s current situation should not be seen as a reason
for its disintegration but as an urgent signal for the people and
Governments of the Commonwealth to strengthen their resolve to reassert
its unique features, rigorously implement the reforms recommended by
the EPG in its report, <I>A Commonwealth of the People: Time for Urgent
Reform</I>, and consider further radical changes to enable the
Commonwealth to realise its full potential, which it has in

strengths of the Commonwealth have been eloquently expressed. They
include its reach. It is guided by values and principles, which were
reasserted and enshrined in the charter of the Commonwealth and
endorsed by all 54 Governments in March this year. These
values are the hallmark, strength and anchor of the Commonwealth. It is
not just an intergovernmental association but a people’s
Commonwealth, with myriad professional organisations and civil society
bodies doing excellent work. The noble Lord, Lord Luce, listed them,
and we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, about the mutual learning
that can take

shall mention a couple more examples. There is the Commonwealth
Environmental Investment Platform, launched earlier this year, which
connects entrepreneurs, investors, innovative technology and business
across the Commonwealth. Secondly, as we have heard, there is the
Commonwealth Class, a joint project with the Secretariat, the BBC and
the British Council in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games.
The Commonwealth is an organisation of networks which moves freely at
various levels, recognising that delivering sustainable change belongs
to the whole society and not simply to Governments. However, these
strengths must be built upon; we cannot just live on affection for the

There always have been elections in Sri Lanka. Only once, under JR
Jayewardene did the then president decide that, because he had done so
well in the provincial elections, he did not need to rerun to be
president. Nevertheless, the turnout embarrasses us. It is more than
80%, nearly 90% quite often. Its register embarrasses us—it is
better than ours. No one, so far, in Sri Lanka has been prevented

the face of this reality I have described, there is a tendency to take
resort in nationalism and ethnic groupings. We should not condemn that
because if it enables people to find a place in which to feel personal
significance it can be a good thing. However, the paradox is that we
have never lived in an age in which interdependence globally was more
real. This is true in economic terms, in migration terms, in climate
change terms and the consequences of the movement of peoples, in
security terms—it is true in almost any dimension you may wish
to consider. In fact, there are very few major problems facing our
children that can be solved in any way other than by effective
international co-operation at the global
level<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T16:22:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000433" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000433">It
is a mistake to see the Commonwealth as a rival or a potential

mentioned already in this debate. However, the Commonwealth can bring a
free association of diverse nations and people who have decided, for
one reason or another, that they want to belong to each other in a
closer relationship. That can be tremendously important in the
deliberations of these other institutions. It is not a substitute for
them—it cannot be a substitute for them—but it can be a

single member of the Commonwealth or, I would dare to say, a single
member of the international community who does not have to face issues
of human rights. We are in a mutual struggle to enhance the human
condition and build the stability and confidence that comes when human
rights are being fulfilled. We all know that the absence of human
rights leads to insecurity, danger and extremism. The Commonwealth, as
a resource of human co-operation within the crucial but essentially
more formal international institutions, has a big role to play. I do
not believe that we have begun to realise that

St John of Bletso (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I join others in
thanking my noble friend for introducing this topical debate ahead of
the CHOGM meeting next month. While clearly there is enormous support
throughout the House for the role and importance of the Commonwealth,
some noble Lords have rightly pointed out the questionable human rights
record in Sri Lanka. However, I listened with great interest to the
glowing account given by the noble Lord, Lord
Naseby<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T16:26:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

taken up is that there is certainly scope for improvement in the
Commonwealth so that it can be more effective, and that it is in need
of some reform. Some have referred to the Commonwealth as a social
club, but almost everyone agrees that it has been extremely effective
in its soft power and diplomacy. I am a firm supporter of the
Commonwealth and I agreed with my noble friend Lord Luce when he said
that we could not invent the Commonwealth today. With a membership of
more than 2.2 billion people worldwide, my specific interest relates to
the role and value of the Commonwealth in improving the lives of its 18
member states in Africa, now that the Gambia has recently
left.</hs_para>

controversially, and despite the questionable recent election in
Zimbabwe, I share the views of my noble friend Lord Hannay, in that I
hope the time will come when Zimbabwe will rejoin the Commonwealth
family. With the theme of this year’s CHOGM conference focused
on growth, equity and inclusive development, this is a particularly
important priority for the people of Zimbabwe where the unemployment
rate is estimated to be running at 85%, with the majority trying to
work in the informal sector. The country is possibly facing another
economic disaster, so there is a desperate need for more international
investment and
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T16:28:10"></hs_TimeCode>. Rising
food prices in many Commonwealth countries threatens disaster and, with
that, unrest. I hope that the challenge of food security will be
addressed at this year’s meeting. There also needs to be more
consensus on measures to reduce levels of national debt, especially in
some of the smaller Commonwealth states, which continue to be a major
impediment to sustainable economic
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T16:28:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

has promoted huge improvements in communications and has increased
business between Commonwealth networks, yet youth 
<?notus-xml column=726?>unemployment remains a major challenge for most Commonwealth members. It
is on the subject of digital inclusion that I wish to address my
remarks in the limited time available. It is extremely encouraging to
note that up to 80% of all Africans have access to a mobile telephone.
The digital economy provides huge scope for improvements in access to
education, better healthcare, business information and other benefits.
However, all this depends to a large degree on access to reliable and
affordable broadband. While the CDC Group has achieved a lot in making
infrastructure improvements in many Commonwealth states, access to
broadband, particularly in Africa, remains extremely poor. Despite the
fact that several large fibre optic cables now service the African
coastline, fewer than 5% of the population of Africa have access to
broadband.</hs_para>

there is scope to reform and improve the effectiveness of the
Commonwealth, this year’s CHOGM meeting is not just an
opportunity for leaders to hold discussions, exchange views and build
consensus on topical and challenging issues, it is a pivotally

that I share the points made by noble Lords, Lord Hannay and Lord Judd,
about other regional organisations. It is not a competition and there
are perfectly good roles for each of them. There are other kinds of
network as well, which are having a growing impact. The world is highly
connected and networked—the Commonwealth has become, as the

Commonwealth’s strength is a history of shared experience. The
commitment in the modern period, at least for the most part, is to
shared governmental standards, economic development and the rule of

great strength through co-operation. All of this is cemented together
not just by elements of common language but if, and only if, we have a
common commitment to exacting standards of conduct in each

am wholly with the noble Lords, Lord Luce, Lord Crisp and Lord St John

enthusiastically—that nobody starting today could create the
Commonwealth or, indeed, probably the Francophonie; or the curious
circumstances in which some nations are members of both. History has
dealt a particular hand, which has a new modern life. Nowhere could you
achieve this blend: large and small nations, some as small as Tuvalu;
some of the largest economies and some of the most 
<?notus-xml column=727?>modest; developed and developing countries; and predominantly Hindu,
Muslim and Christian countries—some deeply religious and some
essentially secular. The common ground for all 53 is in the values of
democracy, human rights and the rule of law; themselves the building
blocks of peace and current and future prosperity. I wholly endorse the
point made by my noble and learned friend Lady Scotland that they were
summed up, in words at least, in the Harare principles, even if people

understand why anyone who has served as Minister for the Commonwealth
feels the honour of that role. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan,
that I do not recall in the Foreign Office ever leaving the
“C” bit out. The Commonwealth had that importance for all
of us. There are many examples of why we should feel proud, such as the
scholarships and the involvement in higher education. There are many
examples of positive co-operation programmes, such as the 2008
secretariat initiative, which assisted many countries to innovate in
order to enhance healthcare provision, promoting e-health. I was very
intrigued by the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, about the
imperatives for life-saving information and the possibilities of
sharing them. Assisting the Seychelles in its path to WTO accession
demonstrated what can be offered in the financial

critical and friendly edge generates renewal, as the noble Lord, Lord

deeper review. If we took any other view of the Commonwealth, it would

increasingly 
<?notus-xml column=728?>authoritarian regime there with a history of human rights violations
which fears that it may be judged to fall outside the standards of the
charter which were adopted in 2012 and signed off by Her Majesty on
11 March this year. The president claims that he—and
I mean he—can cure AIDS and infertility with herbal concoctions,
and that homosexuality is one of the three biggest threats to human
existence. Perhaps he decided to jump before he was pushed. Let me be
clear from these Benches that I am wholly in sympathy with the noble

it is right, given the history of the Commonwealth, to continue to

who may be critical. We have to be attentive to the continuing stress
lines between members. We must use our best endeavours to assist. We
are familiar with tensions between India and Pakistan and must continue
to be. There are other tensions; for example, economic rivalry between

infrastructure around them has not been capable of sustaining them.
That has been true in the case of youth development, on which there was
a report on 17 September; on education, which the noble Baroness, Lady
Hooper, drew to our attention; on health, employment, civic and
political participation; and on the subject of press freedom, where I

recommendations of the Eminent Persons Group on reform have either not

(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Luce, for
introducing this timely debate and all noble Lords for their thoughtful
contributions, especially my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes. I
particularly enjoyed listening to my noble friend Lord Brooke of Sutton
Mandeville. I am not sure that any Cabinet Minister can live up to the
reputation of playing in the Ashes, but I once umpired a UK-Bangladesh
parliamentarians one-day match. Perhaps that is my
contribution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T16:42:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

words of the noble Lord, Lord Paul, and use this opportunity to put on
record our appreciation for the tremendous role that Her Majesty plays
in leading the Commonwealth. Her role as an example to us all and we
hope that she continues to lead the organisation for many years to
come<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T16:43:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

strong supporter of the Commonwealth, and the forthcoming Commonwealth
Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka is an opportunity both to
reaffirm the importance of the Commonwealth to member states and to
maintain efforts to strengthen and reform the organisation to ensure
that it retains its relevance and impact in future. This Government
have strengthened the UK’s engagement with the Commonwealth. We
firmly believe that it is in our interests that we have a strong
Commonwealth. The Commonwealth bridges all of the continents, embraces
2 billion people and represents all of the world’s faiths. Its
membership includes many of the fastest-growing and increasingly
technologically advanced economies in the world. I endorse the
description of the Commonwealth of the noble Lord, Lord
Triesman.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000465" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000465">However,
to remain relevant to its people today and to continue to have a real
impact on the international stage, it must respond to the changing
world that it inhabits. That is why the UK has played a leading role in
efforts to reform the Commonwealth. Since Commonwealth heads last met
in Perth in 2011, the Commonwealth has embarked on an ambitious but
necessary programme of reform. Member states have been implementing a
series of important recommendations made by the Commonwealth Eminent
Persons Group in its report, <I>A Commonwealth of the People: Time for
Urgent Reform</I>, which was agreed following the Perth CHOGM. I am
grateful to my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford who, as Minister
for the Commonwealth, made an essential contribution to that process,
but I accept the strong words of my noble friend Lord Lexden that we
need to go much
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000466" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000466">We
have seen some important milestones for the Commonwealth during the
past two years. Perhaps the most significant has been the agreement of
the Commonwealth Charter which gives the organisation, for the first
time, a single document setting out its core values. This was referred
to by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, the noble
Baroness, Lady Prashar, and others. The Government want the charter to
become an established, recognisable statement of what the Commonwealth
stands for. The charter should be accessible to all Commonwealth
citizens and used as a means to protect and promote the core democratic
values which underpin the organisation. It is an indispensable tool for
reform both now and in the future but we recognise, as the noble Lord,
Lord Browne, detailed in his speech, that the charter remains an
aspirational document to many Commonwealth member states. Its signature
is therefore only the start of a longer process of reform. It remains
crucial, as we lead up to CHOGM, for the Commonwealth to ensure that
human rights and values are at the forefront of its work.</hs_para>

and previously, given the human rights situation in some Commonwealth
member states, some question the credibility of the Commonwealth 
<?notus-xml column=731?>as an organisation founded on values. We recognise these concerns but we
should recognise, too, that there are also mechanisms at the
Commonwealth’s disposal such as the charter which can be used to
help challenge, influence and, ultimately, effect reform. The noble
Lord, Lord Judd, clearly put that view. Through signing the charter,
for example, all member states have agreed to
oppose,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13101768000615" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000615">“all

friend Lord Black was right to say that the charter now needs to be put
into practice, so it is for the UK and countries with similar views to
keep making the case for acceptance and integration. We will continue
to press other states to recognise that the LGBT community, which has
come under particular pressure in some Commonwealth countries, deserves
the same protection as all
others.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13101768000468" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000468">The
Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group is a further mechanism at the
Commonwealth’s disposal. The Government strongly supported the
recent reform of CMAG, which enhanced its mandate as the custodian of
Commonwealth values. The UK is not currently a member of CMAG. However,
the Government have consistently called for CMAG to exercise its
strengthened mandate. I have raised these issues personally with the
current chair of CMAG, Dipu Moni, as has my right honourable friend the
Minister of State for the Commonwealth. We have also raised our
concerns with the Commonwealth Secretary-General. We want to see CMAG
demonstrate that it plays a valuable and effective role in addressing
situations of concern.</hs_para>

Luce, my noble friends Lord Chidgey and Lord Brooke, the noble Lords,
Lord Wills and Lord Hannay, and my noble friend Lord
Moynihan all raised the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government
Meeting in Sri Lanka. At this year’s meeting, we will look to
the Commonwealth to assess the progress it has made since Perth, to
identify areas where further work is needed and to be ambitious in what
it hopes to achieve in future. In particular, CHOGM is an opportunity
for the Commonwealth to work collectively to influence a number of
crucial issues unfolding on the global stage. One, which this CHOGM
will discuss, is the post-2015 development agenda following the
publication of the report of the UN high-level panel, co-chaired by my
right honourable friend the Prime Minister. Commonwealth member states
should take this opportunity to ensure that the views of the
Commonwealth on this vital subject are reflected in the final
framework. Foreign and Commonwealth Office Ministers have regularly
raised our priorities with the secretary-general and fellow
Commonwealth Ministers, and my department’s officials have
co-ordinated a cross-Whitehall approach to the meeting. We will
continue to work with key stakeholders up to and beyond
CHOGM.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101768000470" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000470">Given
the considerable importance that the Government place on the promotion
and protection of human rights in the Commonwealth, some have quite
rightly questioned why my right honourable friends the Prime Minister
and the Foreign Secretary will attend this year’s meeting in Sri
Lanka. We will attend CHOGM because it is the right thing to do for 
<?notus-xml column=732?>the Commonwealth, but in doing so we will take a very clear message. It
is a message that the British Government have given consistently in
this Parliament and in our contacts with the Sri Lankan Government at
every level: that Sri Lanka must make progress on human rights,
reconciliation and a political settlement. It is also vital that the
media are able to travel to Sri Lanka and report freely. I hear what my
noble friend Lord Naseby said, but we will continue to press the Sri
Lankan Government to honour their public assurances on this matter.
CHOGM will highlight the work yet to be done to achieve the aims to
which the Sri Lankan Government have agreed, in follow-up to their own
Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission’s report. The
Commonwealth should look closely at what it can do to help to support
Sri Lanka in making the progress that we all expect.</hs_para>

Wills and Lord Browne, specifically raised the question of our approach
to CHOGM. Our approach can be reflected in the way in which we have
handled the situation in other fora. At the Human Rights Council in
March this year we co-sponsored the resolution on Sri Lanka. It is
important to recognise the progress that has been made—for
example, on reconstruction and de-mining—but I accept that much
more needs to be done. The Foreign Secretary, the Prime Minister and
others will deliver a strong message to the Sri Lankan Government on
our concerns and the need for progress, but we feel that engagement is
the right way
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000472" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000472">Noble
Lords have also raised the Gambia’s decision to withdraw from
the Commonwealth, a decision noted by this Government. It is too soon
to say what the Gambia’s withdrawal from the Commonwealth will
mean for the organisation or for the Gambia and for its people. The
Commonwealth is of course a voluntary organisation, so any decisions on
membership are a matter for each member Government. However, we should
not let this detract from the simple fact that membership of the
Commonwealth remains a genuine aspiration for many countries. The
Commonwealth continues to attract interest from potential new members.
Indeed, we understand that applications for membership from South Sudan
and Burundi are currently being considered by the Commonwealth
Secretariat<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T16:51:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000473" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000473">The
noble Lord, Lord Luce, raised the issue of the UK’s funding to
the Commonwealth. The UK remains the largest single donor to
Commonwealth organisations. During the financial year 2013-14, the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International
Development expect to contribute around £45 million to
Commonwealth organisations and programmes. That includes around
£8 million of support for the Commonwealth Fund for Technical
Co-operation, around £1 million for the Commonwealth Youth
Programme, which helps young people across the Commonwealth contribute
to development, and another £1 million to the Commonwealth of
Learning, to enable poor people across the Commonwealth to
access open and distance learning opportunities in formal
education<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T16:51:56"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, we also make large payments in bilateral programmes
in many of the individual Commonwealth countries. These are
significant commitments, so we continue to encourage
Commonwealth organisations to look to make more 
<?notus-xml column=733?>effective and efficient use of the resources that they are given, and to
focus on reforms that affect core strength and comparative
advantage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T16:52:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000474" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000474">My
noble friend Lord Selsdon raised the issue of trade. There is great
potential within the Commonwealth to promote the long-term prosperity
of its members. The Commonwealth is a natural place for the UK and
other member states to do business. Our shared principles of democracy,
the rule of law and good governance, combined with our similar legal
systems, provide a solid foundation for doing business—a
platform for trade, investment, development and prosperity. Among its
members are some of the world’s most dynamic and fast-growing
economies such as India, Nigeria and Malaysia. As a whole, the
Commonwealth accounts for one-third of the world’s population
and its economies export more than $3 trillion in goods and services
each year. The organisation has a strong presence in groupings such as
the G20, leaving the Commonwealth well placed to influence key
decisions across the global
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T16:53:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000475" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000475">The
noble Lord, Lord Luce, also raised the issue of education about the
Commonwealth within the UK. The new history curriculum is less
prescriptive than before and gives teachers more freedom over the
content that should be taught. While it does not make explicit
reference to teaching about the Commonwealth, there is nothing that
precludes schools from teaching about it if they choose to do so. At
key stage 3, for example, pupils should be taught about the challenges
for Britain, Europe and the wider world from 1901 to the present day,
and we think therefore that that will include the study of the
Commonwealth. I take the point that noble Lords made about reflecting
the Commonwealth contribution during the First World War as we approach
the centenary commemoration next year, something that I personally been
involved
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000476" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0002.htm#13101768000476">The
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and my noble friend Lord Chidgey raised
the issue of the British Indian Ocean Territory. On 18 December 2012
the Foreign Secretary said that he was going to review policy towards
the resettlement of the British Indian Ocean Territory. This review has
been under way since then and we have been in touch with all those with
an interest, especially the Chagossian community here in the UK, in
Mauritius and in the Seychelles. Ministers have agreed that we should
have an independent study that will, with as much transparency as
possible, properly explore what might be possible, what is realistic
and what it would cost. I am sure that I will report back to the House

to countries to enable them to move more rapidly towards universal
health coverage. This includes technical assistance and financial
support and is focused on helping countries to strengthen their health
financing systems and their service delivery. We continue to see an
important role for the Commonwealth Secretariat in advocating the

£87 million for Commonwealth scholarships for developing
countries over a four-year period until 2015. This corresponds to some
800 new scholarships per year. Her Majesty’s Government have
been keen to ensure that the wider Commonwealth scholarship and

role to play in advancing democracy, human rights and sustainable

need to change to be ready for this ageing society? Clearly, first, as
individuals, our prime responsibility is always to try to manage our
own lives ourselves rather than to expect others to do it for us.
Clearly, people need to understand the probabilities and risks
consequent on ageing—that they may need to save more, to work
for longer, to at least make provision for their social care and to
think about how they care for others. Individuals also need to engage
with the choices and behaviours that are likely to make for a healthier
and happier longer life. We have control over quite a lot of
things—at least, some of us

people need trusted, accessible, person-centred information and
evidence to make these informed choices and, hopefully, the behaviour
shifts that might go with them. Clearly, civil society itself will have
to make changes in how it will need to engage with ageing and how it
can better work to support the many more older people in our society.
It would be naive to think that the state, either central or local
government, was able to support all the increased numbers of people in
our society. Yet there is enormous potential if civil society itself
engages positively in this and the question, of course, is how we
stimulate such a growth of civil
action<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T17:03:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

also needs to understand the choices that we all have to make
collectively as a nation to address the changes and some of the
pressures and choices consequent on them. Finally, we need to use the
assets of many more older people as a resource that is able to
contribute to meeting the needs of other older people. That is obvious
to many of us and axiomatic. Again, we need to think about how we make
it happen in

greater engagement with ageing from businesses generally, large and
small. Ageing affects our economic growth, our fiscal position and the
supply of labour to businesses, which others may speak on later.
Business needs to become much more positive about flexible working for
older people, otherwise we will have labour supply problems, less
economic growth and less fiscal contribution than we otherwise would.
In other countries, particularly Germany, business is actively engaged
in these debates. I look forward to hearing invitations to discuss
these issues from some of our business leadership figures, not least
the

clearly be at the fulcrum of ageing at local level. In some local
authorities, the scale of the changes in their older population is
quite remarkably greater even than the dramatic figures I have given
already. Clearly, local government’s role has to go way beyond
just the management of social care, although that is already an
enormously taxing role for it. It has to address the failures of
planning and housing supply for older people at a local level, which
clearly cause greater problems for many people and clog up family
housing that could be released. Local authorities will need to work
with, and generate greater engagement from, the voluntary sector and
civil society to increase volunteering, to support attempts to reduce
loneliness and isolation, and to contribute towards informal social
care. We will need a quite remarkable scale of increase in informal
social care. Again, it would be naive to think that the state will deal
with all those things by
itself<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T17:05:20"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is, therefore, a very large range of roles for local authorities over
and above their new public health role. One would expect to see
thoughtful local authorities making estimates of the scale of demand
that they will face, and starting to have dialogues with their
communities about how they will plan for and address those great
opportunities and
pressures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T17:05:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000491" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101768000491">The
voluntary sector—which I recognise does enormously good

more of what it has done in the past, would be adequate or sufficient.

health at national and local level is, I think it is obvious to all of
us, a central issue in how we address ageing. I will give one simple
illustration. If, over the next 15 years, we were able to shift the
behaviours of many people in our society so that they made healthier
lifestyle choices about diet, weight, exercise, smoking and
drugs—and we all know ourselves how difficult some of those
resistances are—the personal, fiscal and economic benefits would
be remarkable. I argue, both to government and to civil society: think
of what we have done on smoking, but also think of how we make these
changes. They start to make coping for an ageing society more bearable
in public policy terms, but they also make individuals’ lives
that much happier and more fulfilled if they are able to enjoy them in
that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T17:07:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000493" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101768000493">On
the NHS, I think we would all acknowledge that the fact that we are
living longer is due in part to the great success of medical science
and of the NHS itself, combined with many people making better
lifestyle choices. That, therefore, is to be celebrated. Nevertheless,
an ageing society is by far the biggest challenge that the NHS has
faced since its foundation. I will give three reasons why that is the
case. First, there will be an enormous increase in the number of
long-term conditions in our society, consequent on many more older
people, many more much older, older people, and the propensity that
that causes to generate long-term conditions. In the past you died of
certain conditions; now you live many years longer with those long-term
conditions. That is a wonder, but it has
challenges<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T17:08:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000494" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101768000494">Secondly,
there will obviously be very great increases in cost for the NHS and
for social care, consequent on that increase in long-term conditions
and social care needs itself, so we will see remarkable increases in
cost hitting the system as well. Thirdly, every bit of evidence we
received, and all the expert opinion—including the briefing
noble Lords have received from the NHS Confederation—is of one
mind that the system needs to go through quite a remarkable change so
that it moves to the better management of long-term conditions in the
community and away from what is essentially an acute and
hospital-centric focus. Everybody broadly agrees with that diagnosis;
the challenge is how it is going to be made to
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T17:08:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000495" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101768000495">The
problem—without wishing to be party-political for a

hope that NHS England, when it produces its strategy in the autumn,
will set out a clear vision as to how that should be addressed, both
assessing the demand and setting out how it thinks the system should
change to do so. However, even if it does that 
<?notus-xml column=738?>well, it will not be able to do it without clear, strong, consistent
political leadership, preferably supported by all political
parties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000496" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101768000496">How
has central government responded to our call for action? First, we all
recognise that central government is not responsible for all these
challenges. They are issues for all of us. However, many of us consider
that central government is responsible for leading the debate and
setting out the issues so that we as a society can face them rather
than hide from them. It is also remarkable that there was no rebuttal
in the Government’s response of the fundamental evidence and
analysis that the committee set out in its paper. They did not say that
we got it wrong; they were almost totally silent on that. Therefore, it
is reasonable to assume that the diagnosis we presented was reasonably
accurate. That has been the view of many experts, as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000497" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101768000497">We were

have also resisted our request to set out an honest debate with the
public about the opportunities, challenges and changes. We argued for a
White Paper and a Green Paper to set out the issues so that we could

final few minutes, I will say a little about what we have done to
maximise engagement with the Government on this report. Our committee
ceased to exist in March, but we chose to ignore that and to continue
having very vigorous discussions among ourselves, and excellent
meetings with Ministers and senior civil servants. We tended to go in
twos, as is our way, whenever we could. I met five or six Ministers,
virtually all the top civil servants relevant to this, and special
advisers, and I thank them all. Without exception, the conversations
were thoughtful, and with many officials we could discuss both policy
and politics—realities—at the same time, because those
things are
real.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101768000499" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101768000499">Next we
should acknowledge that the Government have done some very good things
in a difficult environment. They have made remarkable progress on
pensions reform and on putting into practice the fundamentals of
Turner. Steve Webb is to be commended on that, in an incredibly

the start, not the end of the

current policy and practice. The market in specialist housing for older

wish I could be as positive everywhere, but, as noble Lords will sense,
I am not going to be. What still amazes us as a committee is that we

estimation of the increasing demand consequent on the absolutely
certain increase in the number of older people. Perhaps we will get
that from NHS England; let us hope so. It is fundamental to the
situation. When you know that you will face massive increases in
demand, you make some assessment of what that will look like and you
then think about what it

there is still a doubt over the Government’s narrative that the
massive systems changes that we all recognise need to happen will just
come about organically in a bottom-up process. Clearly, the leadership
of the NHS and the health service generally looks for clear, solid,
consistent ministerial support for these changes. That is difficult,
but they will not happen without it. Lastly, we need an honest
conversation between politicians—hopefully of all

this. As noble Lords will know, the dependency ratio is obviously
worsening as a consequence of these demographics, and I will not go

mean much more spending on pensions, health and social care. It is
axiomatic that that will happen. The debate is about how much of that
extra expenditure should be paid for by the state out of taxation and
how much of it should be paid for by individuals themselves. However,
it will have to be paid for one way or the other because our society
will demand a level of care and healthcare befitting a civilised
society. Therefore, we must face up to a discussion on

from what the Nuffield Foundation and the IFS have produced, to date we

billion, by 2021-22. The IFS told me that those figures had been
reached just by looking at the 4% per annum historical trends; not by

friend—perhaps above all of his colleagues on the Front
Bench—is too courteous and sophisticated to have given me the
Answer that the words yelled out: “Nothing to do with me,
guv”. We all know who has the primary responsibility for
delivering social care. However, we all also know that it is to do with
the Government. It is to do with providing what the Government believe
people need. If it is not a matter for the Government, who is it for?
While we dicker, duck and dive, there are more elderly people with
frailties in mind and body, needs, deprivation, suffering and pain. All
are made worse by the absence of a full seven-day-a-week
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T17:24:02"></hs_TimeCode>. Only

my mother had to spend two weekends in a local hospital because she had

condition, even though the infection was cured. The hospital wrote a
self-satisfied letter telling me how good the standard of care that it
provided had been. We, the family, could not wait to get her out of the
hospital and back to the residential home. In this day and age, that

blessing, not a curse. However, one thing was very clear to all of us:
that if we are to respond to the quite significant challenges that the
ageing nature of our society is going to present, then we
expect—and we are right to demand—vision, leadership and
a coherent strategy from government. So, too, are we right to expect
that from all those parties that aspire to government. Nowhere is that

tried to draw attention to two very significant problems that we face.
We all know that not enough people in Britain are saving for their
retirement and that those who are generally tend not to be saving
enough. That led us to conclude that nearly 11 million people of
working age are, on current trends, likely to be heading towards
inadequate retirement incomes. That will be a significant social and

said, there are plenty of positive signs that the Government are now
beginning to address this problem. The previous Government set in train
the implementation of the important recommendations of the noble Lord,
Lord Turner, and the present Government have taken those forward. That
is to be welcomed. However, we also took the view that, in their
present guise and format, defined contribution pension schemes are
unlikely to be able to discharge the very heavy responsibility that we
are about to place on them. In the future, millions more people will be
saving not in final salary or career average defined 
<?notus-xml column=743?>benefit schemes but in defined contribution schemes. Of course, the one
characteristic of those schemes is that there is no guaranteed level of
retirement income.</hs_para>

defined benefit. We will not be able to recreate new defined benefit

That is part of the pensions past. I hope that we can sustain defined
benefit pensions in the public sector for as long as possible. We know
that the millions of people who will be enrolled automatically into new
workplace pension schemes will be saving in defined contribution
schemes. It was the committee’s view that they are not fit for
purpose; they are not going to be adequate in their current form to
address the expectations that millions of people have for the level of
income that they can aspire to in retirement. How we respond to that is
the crucial challenge in the pensions world

warning to the Government that I would like to give tonight—to
avoid the gimmicks and expensive flummery, as well as the false

world of defined contributions, it is unlikely to be possible to
construct anything that looks like a defined benefit-style guarantee of

possible was that the Government could convene on a much more urgent
basis the attention of the industry and employers on how the current
structure of defined contribution pensions could be improved—and
I think that they can. From my experience, I believe that we have to
focus in future on outcomes from defined contribution schemes and work
to ensure that there is greater confidence in those outcomes. That is a
challenge primarily to the pensions and investment industry as to how
those improvements could be brought about. I personally do not believe
that there is a case for some legislative solution or some magic wand
to be waved over this problem by government. That is simply not a
possibility; it is not the world that we live in. But there is an
urgent case for more focused action and intention, led by government,
as to how the current failing platform of defined contribution could be
improved for millions of people going forward. We have a special
responsibility now that we have decided, as successive Parliaments, to
automatically enrol people into defined contributions, as to how we can
improve the way in which those schemes work for future generations.

others to address it as a matter of urgency. I welcome what the

taken in very difficult financial times. I mention in particular the
Pensions Bill and the Care Bill, which is currently before this House,
which I consider to be a landmark piece of legislation. But—and,
of course, there has to be a but—while the government response
is long on past achievements and current policy commitments up to 2015,
it is short on the long term and the need for a long-term strategic
joined-up understanding of the big choices facing the country over the
next 10 to 20 years, particularly the need to stimulate a
national debate so that people understand the implications, the choices
ahead and difficult decisions that will have to be taken about the

the Minister consider those suggestions and respond in due course? I

retirement pensions, health and social care, and so on did. I would
argue that not enough focus has been given to the importance of social
isolation and loneliness, which are so often both the root cause and
consequence of issues that were discussed at length in the report and
which no doubt will be discussed in the

big barrier to making the UK ready for ageing is the denial of most
younger people of the likelihood of becoming older themselves, with all
its perceived negative connotations. It is human nature to put off
thinking about becoming old, until the day it happens, but the problem
is that by then it is usually too late to do the financial and other
planning necessary to ensure a happy and comfortable retirement. If we
could take away some of the fear, perhaps more younger people would be
more willing to face up to the fact that, barring ill fortune, such as
accidents and grave illness earlier in life, the chances are that they
will live longer than they currently expect—certainly longer
than most previous generations thought likely or even possible. That is
a
fact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T17:37:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000006">I
do not have time to go into all the life expectancy details here, but
it is so important to understand the issues of why younger people, or
those in middle age, do not do the thinking and preparation that they
need to do. We also need to address a key social trend that has not had
enough attention. A lot of people who will be moving into old age over
the next 20 or 30 years will be childless and will not have adult
children to provide some of the care and support that so many do today.
The issue of loneliness and isolation is significant. We need to be
realistic. It would not be true to say that the majority of older
people are lonely; the majority live happy and non-lonely lives.
However, some of the statistics are very stark. Do noble Lords know
that some 5% of people aged 65 plus in the UK said that they spent
Christmas Day 2010 alone? How should we feel about that? It has also
been said that loneliness is very bad for our health. Something that
brings that home starkly is the estimate that loneliness is as harmful
to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. There is much that can be
done about this.</hs_para>

some of the peaks in demand and be great mentors for newer workers.
They provide a real opportunity for business. However, business needs

can benefit from this demographic shift in other ways and it can
contribute to its solution. Most products today are designed for
youth—it is the 
<?notus-xml column=747?>hot thing to do. However, there are more and more affluent older
people—it is a growing market—and businesses need to put
more effort into designing inclusive products that can not only assist
people as they get older but can also provide real solutions,

the emotional and financial case for independence is absolutely
overwhelming. It costs something around £3,000 a month to keep
someone in a care home; to keep them in a hospital bed is a multiple of
that. To help them live on their own usually is a fraction of it. We
need to look at what kind of levers we can introduce to allow people to
live for longer independently. I will refer to two of
them—carers and housing.</hs_para>

Carers already play a vital role, but it is a very tough one. Too often
the stress and physical demands are too much, so that they themselves
also become ill, and society ends up looking after two people rather
than none. A little bit of help, such a small amount of respite care,
can make a world of difference. Also, there should be grants to assist
in the provision of a washing machine, given the amount of laundry that
a caring situation can often create. A little money and effort can
yield multiple

recognise the need for the right type of housing. It should be designed
to be more inclusive from the start. This will help people to stay in
their homes for longer, but as their needs become greater, it is vital
to provide them with the right sort of housing with the right sort of
monitoring and care. That will help not only the ageing population, it
will free up family homes for younger people and make the whole housing
ladder more flexible. This area has to be looked at with the same

We face the same demographic challenges as many other countries. In
fact, there are other countries in Europe with far worse challenges,
while the position in Japan is more urgent still. We should look to
them to learn about some of the things that they are doing, both on the
micro and the macro basis. We do not have a monopoly on this problem,
and I am absolutely sure that we do not have a monopoly on the
solutions. If we take the right measures, we can make a big difference.
As was said earlier, longevity and longer good health are a blessing.
If we do not take these measures, we will have a crisis. We owe it not
only to those who are now ageing but even more to our grandchildren and
our great-grandchildren to take action sooner rather than
later.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13101790000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000162">5.46

follow my noble friend Lord Livingston of Parkhead’s insightful,
witty and passionate maiden speech. We all welcome his contribution to
the House, and indeed to the whole country and beyond. As a
businessman, he distinguished himself when running BT, not merely by
driving it forward to growth commercially inside and especially outside
the UK, 
<?notus-xml column=748?>but also in helping to spearhead many corporate social initiatives,
including those that have helped to create suitable employment for

stellar rise from his start as an accountant to becoming a chief

youngest ever FTSE CEO in 1991, of the Dixons Group, at the age of 32.
Subsequently, he became the BT Group finance director, head of retail

beginnings and originally from overseas, I am sure that he will bring
additional experience to your Lordships’ House, not least from
his being a non-executive director at Celtic. What better
representative could we have as our soon to be installed Trade

to today’s debate, I declare an interest as co-chair of the
All-Party Parliamentary Group on Life Transitions. I want to thank the
Select Committee, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, for its
tremendous work and the Government for their response. It is just over
a year since I had the privilege of co-authoring a report on life
transitions that touches on many of the areas highlighted in the Select
Committee’s report. It is encouraging to see how the report I
wrote, supported by the Gulbenkian Foundation and entitled, <I>Next
Steps: Life </I><I>T</I><I>ransitions and </I><I>R</I><I>etirement in
the 21st </I><I>C</I><I>entury</I>, finds echoes in much of the tone
and language of the work of the Select Committee, and indeed that we
are able to think about life transitions, in this case those of ageing
and retirement, in terms of presenting significant challenges and
opportunities for public policy and public services. It is no longer
enough to stick to our silos and care about the services on either side
of a particular life transition; we now need to integrate and consider
the impact of transitions both on service provision and on the
individuals, families and communities who are affected by
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000022">I agree
with many of the recommendations made in the Select Committee report.
They are generally balanced, thoughtful and sensible, but I want to
highlight one area where I feel that more research could be carried
out, which is how the efforts of public and social entrepreneurs can
contribute to enabling a smoother transition in later life,
particularly when it comes to planning for retirement and ageing, and
in building the support networks to cope better with and combat
isolation. We tend to see retirement in the public policy arena in
terms of hard fiscal, and non-fiscal, measures: pensions, saving,
housing, social and healthcare implications and so on. However, in
<I>Life Transitions and Retirement in the 21st Century</I><I>,</I> we
found that a major challenge for people was also the softer side and
that better consideration is needed to enable people to feel positively
about ageing and to see it as a journey, rather than as a disparate set
of choices which can be 
<?notus-xml column=749?>confusing, easy to ignore when you are busy and sometimes daunting given
the prospect of ill health and the end of life
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000023">Specifically,
we argued for a framework to provide a national retirement service that
could mobilise charities, private organisations and government bodies
to better signpost and draw in the ageing population. It would start
when people are healthy and still in work and be designed to connect
people locally and across generations, while giving them the
information and training needed to make the right choices for them as
they enter later life. A pilot to explore this has been initiated,
which starts this weekend in Stoke with sponsorship, again, from
Gulbenkian under the banner of the Retirement Transitions Initiative,
using the incubation capabilities of the Shaftesbury
Partnership—in which I declare a former interest as a founder.
The scheme will work with employers, community organisations such as
football clubs, charities, government agencies and faith groups, and
local champions to encourage people to attend pre-retirement courses in
a relaxed, down-to-earth and friendly local environment. By knitting
people together and giving them the right information, the aim is to
empower them and help them build resilience and networks of support
from a cross-section of society. The aim is both to help prevent costs
to the NHS and other statutory bodies further down the line and for us
to learn what works and explore what blockages exist that might affect
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000024">I
would have liked to see a bit more in the Select Committee report about
these aspects of ageing and how we can provide a cross-party consensus
around significantly expanding holistic retirement planning courses
under a national campaign, before it is too late. I would also have
liked to see a bit more on how older people themselves can be a source
of wisdom and ideas about how to improve the relationship between
social care and health services and on how best to release equity and
financial assets to pay for retirement or to incentivise continuing to
work and a shift into portfolio part-time work. Those going through the
process of retiring from the corporate world, as well as those who are
unemployed or dealing with chronic illness, can often see more clearly
than even some experts what the challenges are and what can be done.
The APPG on Life Transitions aims to provide a forum to hear from the
public and actors in the community such as social entrepreneurs about
these challenges and the possible innovations in this area. I would
like, in this regard, to ask the Minister whether the Chief Scientific
Adviser’s research will be able to go further and gather or even
crowdsource innovation and ideas from a wider audience than purely
professionals and experts
alone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000025">Clearly,
the challenges and opportunities of an ageing society are mammoth and
will require contributions from all quarters. How will we facilitate
new kinds of start-up businesses, for example, that explicitly
incorporate the wisdom and experience of part-time or non-executive
semi-retirees along with young unemployed graduates and apprentices?
How do we enable even more brokering of non-monetary means of bartering
and support between those in later life and the wider population so
that even those with limited means can still have a decent life? What
role might housing design and building 
<?notus-xml column=750?>play in enabling young and old to live near each other and to support
each other in their respective challenges, along Shared Lives and
Homeshare lines, or is policy to lead inadvertently to a dangerous
ghettoisation of different generations? These and many more questions
and ideas need exploring if we are to have a step change in our
understanding of later life and what is possible from both a wider

they are not well equipped: not because they do not have the

moment—but because somehow we have still not been able to
design, build and shape our public services around citizens and
clients. Whatever the rhetoric and whatever the good intentions, our

is very clear. For many years, we have encouraged different agencies to
develop plans and objectives in isolation. We have set separate
targets for each of them, which have sometimes
been in conflict. We have developed different and sometimes
contradictory regimes. We have failed to provide support for
users seeking to find a way through this increasingly complex system.

has been the case especially in Whitehall, where departments have
fought, mostly successfully, to maintain their independence, sometimes
reinforcing their empires by building their own inspection and
regulation regimes which have made it very difficult, sometimes
impossible, for local agencies to work together for the benefit of
clients. In addition,
we<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T17:55:49"></hs_TimeCode> have designed
measures of success which have had more to do with bureaucracy and
budgets than the needs of clients. We have responded to problems by
reorganising structures, not redesigning services. Perhaps most of all,
we have consistently failed to involve clients in the design of our
public

work of the Select Committee exposed four consequences of these fault
lines. First, the failure of departments to work together means that
there is still no coherent strategy for ageing in this country, because
to have one would need housing through the DCLG and finance through the
Treasury, and for health, 
<?notus-xml column=751?>social care, planning, education and DWP to get together meaningfully to
produce a coherent strategy. They have not done

the fragmentation of the system means that it copes particularly badly
with people who have complex problems. Most older people now have what
is known as comorbidity—they have complex problems. I am afraid
to say that they often find themselves having to go to different
providers or agencies to deal with each of their conditions.</hs_para>

is that when those on the front line trying to provide joined-up care
have succeeded it has been in spite of the system that we have designed
and not because of it—they told us that very clearly. Fourthly
and worst of all, vulnerable old people, often with long-standing and
debilitating conditions, find their final days consumed with stress and
bureaucracy. I was hearing yesterday of an old lady—let us call
her Mrs Jones—who was in hospital when she was given the news
that she was reaching the end of her life. Mrs Jones wanted
to end her life, like most people do, at home. The hospital
staff, to their credit, wanted to support her in that ambition. In
order to realise that single, simple wish required the
involvement of 23 different teams, the completion of 25
assessment forms and the convening of two separate funding panels. It
took three agonising months and she finally got home two weeks before
she

first point is about the language that we use and the signals that we
give out. The noble Baroness, Lady Tyler, talked about the importance
of a public debate. It is easy to use language such as
“retirement”, which indicates something negative, about
stopping and ceasing to contribute. In the diocese where I work, we
have 200 clergy who are retired; 80% of them make an
enormous contribution, not just filling in but front-line, active
contribution to the life of the
church<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:00:36"></hs_TimeCode>. Some
cultures use the word senior rather than the word ageing. We must be
very careful how we frame the debate. I invite the Minister to comment
on the language that we use and the signals that we give out, so that
it is 
<?notus-xml column=752?>not about a problem of decline and desperation but celebrating life at

second point is about the breadth of health issues that need to be
considered. In the city of Derby last year, I organised something that
was called the Redfern Commission. A number of us as commissioners
invited people to come into a space and talk about the challenges
facing citizens in the present context: the lack of investment,
declining local authority resources and such things.</hs_para>

from Age Concern raised two things that had not occurred to any of us
on the commission. One was the lack of sexual health advice for older
people; it is all targeted at younger people; but with changing
lifestyles and changing relationships, there is an urgent need for
people to have access to information about sexually transmitted
diseases and sexual health. The second area that was brought to our
attention was the importance of recognising depression as people face
loss at various stages and the need to set targets, as in other areas
of health, for depression as people get older. Those were two things
that came out from the commission that surprised me. I invite the
Minister to comment on the breadth of how we look at health issues.
Some big things, such as dementia, take all the space, but we may need
to be more refined in talking about what health
involves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000040">My
third point is to talk about care with a small ‘c’ in the
Government's response, the civil society contribution. In the Church of
England, more than 8,000 of our parishes are actively engaged with work
with people who are growing older—seniors. The great thing is
that you have more than 8,000 intergenerational resource centres, where
people of all ages are engaged in home visiting, meeting loneliness and
prolonging a quality of life and conversation that gives health and
vitality to people. The committee proposes a commission about the care
system. I endorse that proposal, because I think that there is an
urgent need to look at how all that informal, civil society
caring, which is intergenerational, with a lot of energy put into it
and which is making an enormous difference. How can we more
systematically embrace what is a highly organised effort in all those
8,000-plus parishes across the country into a system that is also
trying to best target the use of financial resources and professional
expertise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:03:42"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000041">I
have two final points. I remind your Lordships of the fragility of
values. When I am in London, I stay in Putney. As I was walking in
Putney this morning, I passed a huge office block. Over the door a sign
says, “Volunteers overcoming poverty”. I looked closely;
the block is empty, virtually derelict. We have these aspirations but
then they drift away. We must recognise something that the church is
passionate about: in an age where people approach things from the point
of view of, “I want to safeguard my rights”, we must be
bold enough to talk about the discourse of duty to neighbour. That is
vital to turn around the social atmosphere and sense of commitment in
an age that, for understandable reasons, is obsessed with the rights of
the individual as a
person.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000042">Finally,
a great friend, colleague and scholar who was a professor at
King’s College London, Christopher Evans, lived to be well over
100 and died fairly recently. 
<?notus-xml column=753?>People kept asking him, as he went through the journey and had various
health issues, what it was like getting older. He said that the key is
perspective: “You have to understand that whatever happens to
you as you get older, you’re simply waiting in the departure

been in the automotive, housing and finance industries, but with a
constant thread of disability. The reason may be that our two eldest
sons had very bad heart defects when they were born. Our eldest son had
to spend his entire first year of life in the intensive care ward at
the great Royal Brompton Hospital, leaving him with some permanent
disabilities. However, my wife Victoria and I are great believers in
the American maxim, “When life gives you lemons, make
lemonade”. Perhaps this is why I worked to make the London taxi
wheelchair accessible. The secret was to make the accessibility
ordinary rather than extraordinary; to make it normal and not mark it

ordinary in the future of our ageing society, as ordinary as hearing
aids and glasses are today. The truth is that every one of us spends
time in a wheelchair. That wheelchair is called a pram, or maybe I
should say a baby buggy now, and we are very lucky if it is only at the
beginning of our lives that we need such a wheelchair. If our physical
environment must change to become even more accessible, our younger
citizens had better start demanding it now so that it is ready when
they need it for themselves. And yet our young people ignore their
longevity—a point made in this remarkable report.</hs_para>

arbitrary age triggers are out of date now, such as getting a free BBC
TV licence at the age of 75 or being compelled to retire at any
particular age whatever. Age-based benefits become increasingly absurd
as the population grows older. Nobody knows better than the individual
how well he or she is ageing. Many people will be able to start whole
new careers when they are retired. In America, the Prudential
advertises pension savings plans with the strap-line, 
<?notus-xml column=754?>“If you could pay yourself to do what you love in retirement,
what would you do? Would you be a teacher? Would you be a musician or a
painter?”. That is the optimist’s point of view. For many
people who have saved wisely, the freedom to take risks and learn new
skills will be very attractive. Many of us here in the House certainly
are lucky to have started whole new careers as parliamentarians. The
point is that arbitrary regulation by age is flawed.</hs_para>

Ridley (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great privilege to speak
after my noble friend Lord Borwick and to congratulate him on an
eloquent and perceptive speech. I have known him for a little over a
year but in that time we have become firm friends, despite the fact
that we were briefly rivals on the hustings. He is, I venture to
suggest, exactly the sort of successful and independent mind that the
House of Lords most values. Indeed, I hope I do not cause offence if I
say that there are probably not enough of us here who have such direct
experience of manufacturing industry. He has developed batteries,
reinvented electric vehicles, traded with China, run a foundry and
metal powder group, employed thousands of people and, of course, was
for over 20 years the man behind the famous London black cab.</hs_para>

noble friend Lord Wei but, although my noble friend Lord Livingston
became chief executive of a plc at the age of 32, my noble friend Lord
Borwick did so at 31, albeit that the company was a slightly smaller

debate about ageing. It was in that role, as he has said, 
<?notus-xml column=755?>that my noble friend Lord Borwick championed the idea of making the
London taxi the first wheelchair-accessible public transport in the UK.

to the topic of the debate today, and not wishing to take up
too much of your Lordships’ time, I begin by saying that it is
hard to remain an optimist after reading some of the things of the
beginning of this report. We read phrases like “woefully
underprepared”, see references to an inappropriate health model
for England and are told that the current system is in trouble now. So,
before making a more serious point, I would like to offer a tiny crumb
of demographic good news—at least, I think it is good.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13101790000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000057">Although the number of
85 year-olds is going to double by 2030, as the report says, and
although the number of people over 100 is increasing at the rate of
about 7% a year globally so that there are now 500,000 people in the
world over the age of 100, none the less there are just 60 people in
the world over 110 and that number, if anything, seems to be going
down. When the party opposite came to power in 1997 there were four
people in the world over 115; today there is one. I am not sure who
that reflects badly on.</hs_para>

global longevity record was beaten was in 1997 when Jeanne Calment died
at the age of 122, and it will be at least 23 years until it is beaten
again. The last time Britain’s longevity record was broken was
in 1993—20 years ago—when Charlotte Hughes died at the
age of 115. So something slightly odd is happening. Average lifespan is
going up dramatically all the time, but maximum lifespan seems not to
be changing much at all. As I said, it is a very small crumb of comfort
as far as the issues discussed in this report are
concerned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000059">I
turn briefly to three of the report’s conclusions that I found
most interesting and vital. The emphasis on a new model of healthcare
to cope with this problem is crucial. We had a debate in this House a
few months ago, which was initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, on
models of healthcare. I was very stuck by how bipartisan the support
was for fresh thinking on how we tackle healthcare. We have to be able
to get beyond the sterile debate about whether it should be public or
private and realise that it is bound to be a mixture of both.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Filkin, mentioned in his speech, is the importance of
drawing on the assets of the elderly to support their care. This is not
an easy subject, and it is one that many people have struggled with. I
do not pretend to have the answer, but it is vital to have raised this
matter and to be able to discuss it again, I hope in a bipartisan
way.</hs_para>

vital importance of economic growth, because if we redoubled our
efforts to increase the growth rate of this country, some of these
problems would suddenly look a lot less insoluble. Nothing does more to
make debts affordable than economic growth. If this country were
suddenly to find a way of growing at 5% a year, it would double its
economy in 14 years. On that note, I draw the attention of the House to
the possibility that what we need to be doing is looking at the wider
economy as a whole as a way to solve this
problem.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13101790000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000167">6.17

their excellent report. This document is theoretically a wake-up call,
but like so many alarm clocks, it runs the risk that people may turn
over and hide themselves under the duvet rather than respond to it, so
I propose to talk in more apocalyptic terms today about a national

schmaltz for a moment and remember that the NHS is a £100
billion-plus a year business and its budget will account for nearly
one-third of public service spending in 2015-16, up from just over
one-quarter in 2010. By 2015, the NHS will still be spending every
pound that it had in real terms in 2010, but most other public
services, such as local government, will have only 70p of their 2010
pound. Those are not my figures; they are from the Institute for Fiscal
Studies. The NHS is a 65 year-old pensioner that has adopted a
lifestyle that is well beyond its current and future means. It now
faces—and I do not think this is too
apocalyptic—bankruptcy. If noble Lords do not believe me, they
should read the chief executive—of whom the noble Lord, Lord
Mawhinney, is so fond—of the NHS in this week’s <I>Health
Service Journal</I>. The NHS is in very difficult financial trouble. It
faces not only the demographic time bomb well described in the
committee’s report, but rising public expectations and the costs
of scientific advances, many of which may produce cost savings, but
usually involve extra cost at the point of the introduction. However,
it is doing this not at a time of economic growth but at a time of
fiscal constraint, probably low economic growth and serious limits on
the tax ability of the electorate or the capacity to transfer resources
from other public services.</hs_para>

2030—a huge back hole in the NHS’s finances is opening up
by the end of this decade if it carries on as it is. The outgoing NHS
chief executive thinks that it is £30 billion. The respected
Nuffield Trust puts it at upwards of £40 billion and possibly
more than £50 billion. These are serious financial
problems to be tackled. As my noble friend Lord Filkin has indicated,
the NHS’s core business has changed to coping with and treating
long-term conditions, and often multiple long-term conditions in a
single individual. However, we have simply not changed the service
delivery model

apparent that we are spending our highly valued NHS pounds on the wrong
business model. The customer base has changed and needs something
radically different. The NHS is seriously on the way to becoming like
British Leyland in the 1970s. I do not have time today to describe how
we need to reshape these services but—and this is my final
point—if we do not change them and increase the efficiency of
staff on NHS plant, we face a real problem. Even if we make all those
changes, that will remain a problem. If the NHS is to remain largely a
tax-funded healthcare system universally available in this country, it
has to find new sources of revenue streams and new ways of adding money
to that provided by the taxpayer. We need to look at the possibility of
changing the boundary of what the NHS covers. We need to look at
co-payments. We need to look at the NHS undertaking more commercial

that system for smaller things such as handrails, grab rails or even a
stairlift. That plea is echoed by 
<?notus-xml column=758?>occupational therapists because, they say, the DFG process is long and
bureaucratic. That sounds ridiculous. Is my noble friend convinced that

brings me to the role of the social services departments of local
authorities. The spotlight is often thrown on to social workers when
tragedies occur involving the death of young children, but the other
vital professional group we hardly ever hear about are the occupational
therapists, who are the first port of call when an elderly person rings
their local authority to say that they can no longer get out of their
bath safely or climb the stairs. What may not be so well known is that
local authority OTs advise people in all forms of housing on how to
stay independent as they age. They manage the long waiting lists of
assessments and are the key workers in providing early interventions,
preventive approaches and reablement. That assesses what people can do
for themselves with their existing support, helping them to set weekly
goals, and reablement workers support the person in meeting those
goals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000073">However,
the occupational therapists’ workload grows ever heavier, while
local authority budgets are shrinking. OTs deal with between 35% and
45% of local authority referrals yet make up only 2% of the workforce.
The importance of their intervention is illustrated if one looks at
what happens when an elderly person has a fall which leads to a hip
fracture. That costs the public purse around £28,665, which is
more than four and a half times the average cost of a major housing
adaptation and more than 100 times the cost of fitting hand and grab
rails to prevent falls. There are many other savings to be made when
OTs become involved at an early stage, and I urge the Government to do
all they can to make sure that guidance is given to the relevant

speak as a former permanent secretary of the Department of Health and
chief executive of the NHS, and declare that I work in health, although
globally, not in the UK. This is, of course, a global issue, as the
noble Lord, Lord Livingston, said in his 
<?notus-xml column=759?>excellent maiden speech. I agree with the analysis that the committee
has made of the problem. Very simply, we are using a 20th century model
of health and social care to deal with 21st century problems of health
and social care. It does not work, and we see that every day in the
newspapers and will continue to see it in the newspapers, in our
A&amp;E departments, in the number of elderly people who are stuck in
hospital—and in everything that we all
know<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:29:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000077">As
noble Lords have said, and as the report says, we still do not have a
clear strategic vision for the future of health and social care, and
that is fundamental. I will mention two areas where the report could go
even further—and I hope that the Government will. There is a lot
of agreement, as has been said already in the House, about the nature
of the problem. People are all aware that we need a much more
community-based system that is much more focused on prevention. We also
seem to accept a lot of the implications of that, which will involve
bringing together health and social care much more closely, closing
some acute hospitals, and investing in technology and in the community.
However, agreement falls apart when we get to some of the detail, and
the issues of winners and losers. Because we do not have a strategic
vision that spells out all the implications, we have too many
initiatives that are piecemeal and that often tackle symptoms rather
than causes. Camilla Cavendish’s review of healthcare
assistants, which was mentioned in the government response, is a good
case in point. It was a good review, but it would have been even better
if it had been in the context of a genuine, strategic vision for the
workforce. Healthcare assistants do not operate in a
vacuum.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000078">This
is the biggest failure at the moment. The biggest factor to take into
account is the workforce. I do not think that it is mentioned in the
report or in the Government’s response. I may have got that
wrong, but clearly it is not in any of the headlines. Of course, the
workforce never is. If you are going to have radical change in the
service that is provided, you will have to have radical change in the
workforce, as well. I will give some radical examples, although I am
not necessarily advocating them. Are we going to be talking about
having far fewer specialist doctors and more generalists? Are we
talking about nurses doing many more of the things that doctors do now,
and other people doing things that nurses have done in the past? We
need graduate nurses, but do all nurses need to be graduates? What
about the links between health and social care and the workforce? How
radical are we going to be in taking this on? I am a member of the
Lancet commission on the future of professional education. That has
produced some radical notions about the role of senior professionals
and team leaders as agents of change who are constantly searching for
quality and cost improvements. Are we going to be that
radical?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000079">Of
course, this is the biggest cost in the NHS; around two-thirds of the
cost is in the workforce. In Africa, where I work, we have long
recognised that the scarcest commodity is not money but skilled
health-worker time. Do we in the UK use skilled health-worker time to
best effect? Do we always make sure that people are working, as the
Americans say, at the top of their 
<?notus-xml column=760?>licence, as opposed to doing things that other people in the system can
do? This is not just about getting rid of paperwork for professionals;
it is about making much more radical
changes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000080">While
Africa leads the way in changing health roles globally, the UK leads
the way in developed countries—for example, with the expanded
role of nurse prescribers and of nurses more generally. As I said, this
is the highest cost, which is one reason why it is the most difficult
area to tackle, and why people never tackle it. I understand the
political traps of taking on the doctors or nurses to make some of
these changes, and I understand that it would create winners and
losers. However, it is not good enough to leave this to the local
level. First, they cannot do it; you cannot make the changes necessary
at local level. The headquarters has the responsibility of ensuring the
capacity and capability of an organisation, and it is not doing so at
all at the moment. Of course, this need not be top-down; it should be
developed with practitioners and people at local level. However, as
many people have said, the Government have a responsibility to ensure
that there is an appropriate framework here for the future. Of course,
if it is not sorted out, we will not see
change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000081">My
point is that this is not just about economic costs. The other question
that needs to be looked at alongside it is: who will give the care? I
will take 30 seconds more to refer to the fact that this is
not just about professionals. We must not slip into the lazy assumption
that the NHS is like a commercial insurance system, and that patients
are simply customers. Care is not given just by professionals but by
many carers. It is given by neighbours and voluntary
organisations; it is given in a wide range of different ways. The NHS
and social care form a social system rather than an insurance system.
There are roles for carers, patients and families, and we need to
redefine those as well. People can do more for themselves. We see
examples in other countries of people doing much more in the way of
monitoring. We see them delivering dialysis for themselves. Of course,
these examples also produce improvements in quality and in
cost.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000082">In
conclusion, I would be very interested to hear what both the Government
and the Opposition say about the challenges that the report sets them
in setting out the position for the future and a long-term vision. I
will also ask the Minister a specific point, as a first step towards
that. Does he accept that a changed, new NHS of the type described here
will require a new, radically different workforce strategy, with
changed roles for doctors and nurses, and changes in professional
education? If he says that that is the responsibility of NHS England,
as I suspect he will, will he then ensure from the Government that NHS
England, in developing its strategy, will take proper account of the
60% of the NHS budget and of the changes that need to be made there as
well as
elsewhere?</hs_para><hs_time UID="13101790000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000170">6.35

Griffiths of Fforestfach (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it was a great
pleasure to be a member of the committee. I congratulate the noble
Lord, Lord Filkin, on his chairmanship of it as this subject is
potentially politically divisive. He chaired the committee brilliantly.
He listened 
<?notus-xml column=761?>carefully to everyone’s arguments and was very balanced in his
judgment. We have heard two outstanding maiden speeches this afternoon.
I am delighted to see two more noble Lords with a business background
on the Benches of our House and look forward to hearing many more
outstanding contributions from
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:35:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000084">I
wish to make four points. First, I draw noble Lords’ attention
to the strong language in the report and to the strong language of the
chairman. The noble Viscount, Lord Ridley, pointed out that the report
says that the Government are woefully underprepared to tackle this
problem. It also refers to “a collective failure” to
address the problem. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, has said that
the Government’s response to the committee’s report was
weak and failed to give leadership. He also
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13101790000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000155">“Government
and all political parties prefer to keep the public in the
dark”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13101790000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000149">In
opening this debate, he said that there was no rebuttal by the
Government of the committee’s evidence and that the Government
lacked vision, which was a great shame. As I say, the noble Lord is a
man of balanced judgment and moderate temperament. However, I suggest
that the strength of his language and the stringency of his argument
fairly reflect the views of the committee regarding the sheer scale of
this problem—it is enormous—and the fact that we are
simply not grappling with
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:37:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13101790000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000085">Secondly,
one thing which came out very clearly is that many people in our
society are not financially prepared for retirement. People are living
longer. Many surveys have been done—for example, by HSBC,
Scottish Widows and the department itself—which have tried to
figure out what people’s position really is. I shall not bore
noble Lords with the details, but, frankly, they are horrendous. A
section of our society, the members of which unfortunately fall in the
lower income groups, is not at all prepared for retirement. If we as a
society do nothing, we face the spectre of a much more unequal and less
inclusive society. In the future, no Government will be able to stand
by and be indifferent to pensioner poverty, which will create a serious
problem for the public finances. We need to grasp this problem now; it
cannot be
deferred<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:38:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000086">Thirdly,
something in our report that struck me forcefully was that many people
will have no option but to work longer if they want to have a decent
standard of living in retirement. We made it very clear that no one
will be forced to work against their will. The decision of when to
retire must be made freely by the individuals concerned and not be
imposed by society as a whole, least of all by government. On the other
hand, if people have to work longer through necessity, the
committee’s view was that we should make a virtue of
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000087">In any
case, as I know myself, work brings positive benefits. Apart from
providing some extra income, it keeps your mind active and means that
you are involved in a community of much younger people. I find it
extremely stimulating. The good news from surveys that have been
carried out is that many people would like to work into retirement,
whether part-time, part-year, job-sharing, working reduced hours, doing
term-only work or home working, and perhaps taking unpaid 
<?notus-xml column=762?>leave. Business is already rising to the challenge of this extra work.
The department has published a list of companies and local authorities
which have been very innovative. We also know from maternity leave and
from the arrangements made for pregnant women while at work that
business can be very flexible. Therefore, there is evidence of
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:40:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

chimed with the closing remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, when he
said that the Government need to set a framework encompassing
retirement age, state pension, housing equity release and developing a
savings culture and so on. On the other hand, could not the political
parties make a commitment in the manifestos that they will be preparing
for the next election regarding the immediate challenge that we face? I
should like to ask the Minister what he would suggest in this regard.
Could they not make a commitment saying, “We will address this
problem in our manifesto.”? Such is the scale and seriousness of
the problem, as I think our report
shows.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_17_PT_1/7073B060EAAE2D1CDFA80617B5F93F8D4F9244BB" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 17 October 2013">Thursday,

communities are encouraged by various Governments also faced with

had been meeting regularly, building the social capital which is the
essence of cohousing. They aimed to be, and are, a living demonstration
of how older people can band together to address the challenges of
ageing. My noble friend Lord Warner, then the Minister, was very
encouraging in his reply to the debate. But that was 10 years ago, and

Finlay of Llandaff (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, it was an enormous
privilege to serve on this Select Committee, which was led so elegantly
and chaired so well by the noble Lord, Lord Filkin. The report should
be a wake-up call to everyone, but we must be careful that the language
does not disguise what we are facing. Talk of a demographic time bomb
makes it sound as if everybody growing old is a problem, when actually
we must harness this fantastic cohort in our population, 
<?notus-xml column=764?>who are well and living well, but who are not encouraged to contribute
adequately back into society, as many want to. We know that 30% of
those over 60 volunteer through formal organisations but, sadly, their
real skills are often not adequately harnessed. I have just met a group
of people, many of whom are retired, who provide accompanying
people—doulas—for people at the end of their life, to sit
with them and stay with them. They are provided with training and many
of them work as volunteers, giving of their own experience, their
ability to be calm and the wisdom that comes with age to those who are
frightened and to support families. That is just one
example<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:49:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000099">At
a personal level, I also experienced over the summer how well some of
the services can work to enable and re-enable the elderly. My 95
year-old uncle, adamant that he was not going into hospital, looked as
if he was dying. The sensitivity and compassion with which Westminster
social services dealt with him when he was in need has re-enabled
him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:49:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:49:34"></hs_TimeCode>.
He is now back using his iPad, working, in a voluntary capacity of
course, and lending a listening ear to other people who are lonely and
want someone to talk to. He has a great network that he is supporting,
and he is contributing back into that
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:49:55"></hs_TimeCode>.
Sometimes it can be done, but the elderly population themselves need to
be encouraged and harnessed, and our policies need to recognise
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:50:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000100">In
healthcare we view the elderly potentially as a problem. I had the
privilege of being asked by Mark Drakeford, the Minister for Health and
Social Services, following my time on this committee, to lead a
national conversation in Wales about the unscheduled care of the
elderly. There the problems are exactly the same, with emergency
departments that seem to be full of elderly people. Indeed, there has
been a 26% rise in the past four years of elderly people attending
emergency departments but they do that by default. They go to hospital
because it is the only part of the system that is open 24/7. Like other
noble Lords, I fully support the need for a seven-day service. We
cannot have a service that admits on seven days and discharges people
on four and a half days. That does not add
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:50:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000101">We
need to change attitudes, too, across the whole piece to stop being
risk-averse, so that the kind of delays we heard about of people
getting home will go, and that people will be respected for their own
ideas and for what they want to do. Care homes are a place that many
people fear going into. In our inquiry, we found that things are not
always as good as they should be. It is a tragedy that one in 20 people
report that they do not always get adequate or timely food and drink.
Even though 71% are very or extremely satisfied with their care, that
drops to only 55% for home care. So the attitude within all aspects of
the services has to change to say that the older person is of worth.
Cicely Saunders said that dignity was having a sense of personal worth.
We need to value that wisdom and that cohort and harness
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:52:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000102">I
hope that the Government and all future Governments will proofread
every policy that they produce against the needs of the elderly to make

want to point out a few things that I have been thinking while
listening to the excellent contributions today. First, we are living in
an unprecedented situation—unprecedented in the history of
mankind’s existence on this planet, which in the history of the
planet is perhaps not very long, but which in our minds is a long time.
It is a long time since people died before the age of 25 because they
were starving, were attacked by wild animals or caught an infection
that they had no possible means of
correcting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:53:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000105">We
know now that most of us are not as certain as we used to be about what
happens when we depart this world, so we want to hang around for as
long as possible. For that to happen, we want to be in good enough
health to enjoy living and be recognised by other people as part of
society—not an add-on to be cared for or looked after, but a
real part of the total society in which we live. We have to plan, which
is what the committee’s report emphasised, across the board to
cope positively and to enable us to celebrate in the appropriate way
this incredible change in the longevity that each of us can expect to
enjoy—real planning for today’s society, and not, as the
noble Lord, Lord Crisp, pointed out, planning the future on the basis
of what we did in the past. That would be a bit like planning for a war
on the basis of yesterday’s war technology and weapons. If we do
not, as the report points out, needs will remain unmet, cost pressures
will rise inexorably and the balance of responsibilities between
individuals and the Government will not change in the way that is
absolutely essential. Again, the report points this
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:54:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000106">We
need radical reforms across the board but this will be very difficult
to achieve because there are many pressures not to change. The report
points to the essential fact that, as the noble Lord, Lord Warner,
said, we have to look at everything in the light of what we need to
keep as it is and what we must
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:55:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

we need employers and government to work together because people cannot
save in the way that they need to unless they work for longer. We know
people have to save more, so they have to work more. In order to do
that, employers need help in creating the kind of workplace in which
older people can work. There are some brilliant examples in other
countries and there are a few in this country. We have to
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:56:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101790000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-0003.htm#13101790000108">We
have to look at how we pay for the kind of care and pensions that we
will need in the future if we are to live decently. The move to support
old age must take place. If not, age-related spending is projected to
rise from an annual cost of 21.3% of GDP in 2016 to 26.3% of GDP in
2061, which is a rise of £79 billion in today’s money. We
must therefore consider at all options. We must look at pensions and
benefits, and look again at property values, and consider how we will
pay for our needs in old age with an open mind.</hs_para>

attempt by the Government to begin to get this right, on which I
congratulate them, 
<?notus-xml column=766?>but the support ratio—which, by 2051, will be only 2.9
workers to every person of pensionable age—means that this is
even more necessary that we thought
previously<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T18:57:38"></hs_TimeCode>. To
make employment realistically possible for our ageing population,
flexible work must improve. However, many other changes are needed in

issue or an issue only for the Government, employers, unions and the
voluntary sector; this is a whole-society challenge. Major works are
going on, in which I am grateful I can play a part, and I wish to
mention two or three. The King’s Fund has set up a commission
looking at the future of health and social care, of which I am
delighted to be a part; the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales is looking at a strategy for the ageing society;
Business in the Community is looking at responsible business practice
going forward; and the current and future work of the ILC is part of
the Commission on Ageing and the Voluntary Sector. These organisations
are trying to address these issues so that we can truly celebrate the
ageing of our society in the future. It is a triumph. We must therefore
ensure that both our older and our younger future populations together
create a society where age does not mean stigmatising labels, but
rather that we are all valued for what we are, what we do and what we
contribute, so that we can forget about the number of birthdays we have
celebrated.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_17_PT_1/9E698FF92EEFAF91AE5F76D965D28E45C9232DF1" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 17 October 2013">Thursday,

Hunt of Kings Heath (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great
pleasure to wind up for the Opposition and to congratulate the noble
Lords, Lord Livingston and Lord Borwick, on their excellent maiden
speeches. I also congratulate my noble friend Lord Filkin and the
members of his committee on producing such a good report. We have had a
good debate and many issues have been raised, but for me one of the
most important was mentioned by my noble friend Lord Hutton. He was
surely right to point to the impact of defined contribution schemes on
pensions and whether the well known shortcomings of those schemes
really are going to be dealt with. The noble Lord, Lord Griffiths,
talked about literacy in terms of the financial issues facing
pensioners. We have been discussing in the Care Bill the whole issue of
whether vulnerable older people are able to make the big decisions that
often have to be taken on their finances without access to proper
information and advice. The recent ABI report on annuities makes for
sobering reading in relation to the differences between the best and
the worst annuity schemes, and the seeming inability of very many
people to understand that they can shop around when the time comes to
make a
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T19:01:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

cliff edge of retirement and the need for businesses to be flexible.
The positive 
<?notus-xml column=767?>point which has come through that I would stress to the Minister is that
it can be a key advantage to businesses if they are flexible with their
workforce in terms of the contribution that older people can make to
the working environment. My noble friend Lady Wilkins talked about
housing and the need for a much more cohesive approach to meeting the
housing needs of older people. I refer also, of course, to the
pressures on our health and social care

I hope to hear from the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that there will be a
greater recognition on the part of the Government of the kind of
challenge we face and the vision that is needed. Certainly the initial
Government response to the report is what I would call a worthy one,
where each department has put forward a number of points, but at the
moment it does not read like a cohesive whole. That, I think, is what
the clear message of this debate is all about. Certainly from the point
of view of the Opposition, the Leader of my party is very well aware of
these issues and we will be assessing how we can take the lessons of
this report forward into the next

Bichard, raised a very important point when he talked about the failure
of different government departments to work together. That leads to
different performance and management processes at the local level and
different regulatory systems. The result is that when people at the
local level are planning and delivering services, there are often
perverse incentives in the way of them working together. I would be
grateful if the noble Earl could say a little about how the Government
can encourage local organisations to work more together effectively by
blowing away some of the bureaucracy that often gets in the
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T19:03:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

health and social care, as did my noble friend Lord Filkin. There are
huge pressures in these areas. Now, in mid October, many hospitals are
facing an A&amp;E crisis. If we are facing a crisis in October, the
winter is going to be bloody. It is very simple: primary care is
inaccessible and therefore 24/7 A&amp;E is often the only place where
people can go. Discharge has become much more difficult, and so
hospitals are getting fuller and fuller. At the same time, the
pressures that have come, quite rightly, from the Francis report, the
Berwick report and the Keogh report, have been particularly around the
need for hospitals to increase their staff. But money has got much
tighter and something is going to have to give. That is a serious issue
which underpins what my noble friend Lord Warner said. We are marching
towards a real crisis in health and social care, and at the moment, I
do not think that any of us are confident that we really know the way
through.

hospitals, reflecting that most people in hospital will be older, but

forward was for general physicians to treat the patient as a whole,

committee’s report covers a number of very important and
fundamental issues. As a result, it has provoked discussion and debate
across government about how we can continue to work together most
effectively to meet the needs of an older population. This country
faces major demographic and economic challenges as a result of an
increasingly ageing population. We welcome the committee’s
report, which shares the Government’s ambition of making this
country a great place in which to grow old. If we think about what such
a country should look like, it is a place where older people get
excellent care and support when they need it, where people are
supported to live independently, where people plan and save to ensure a
good retirement income in later life and where we make the most of the
skills and talents everyone has to

the challenge is significant. The quality of our later life is an issue

cross-government co-ordination and focus are crucial to achieving
success. We all have responsibility for ensuring we make the most of
the extraordinary opportunity of increasing life expectancy, as the

place, as well as the plans we have for further work, which we believe
will begin to address the challenges that the noble Lord and his
committee have set out. The noble Lord, Lord Warner, was correct to
highlight the pressures on the NHS. For example, the NHS handles more
than 2 million unplanned admissions to hospital a year for people aged
over 65. These account for 68% of hospital emergency beds and the use
of more than 51,000 acute beds at any one 
<?notus-xml column=769?>time. It would simply not be sustainable for those admissions to go on
increasing in line with demographic changes. We know that, to adapt and
respond to future need, the health and care system needs to
change. The challenges set out in the report create an opportunity for
the NHS and local authorities to innovate and explore new ways of

Borwick and Lord Griffiths and the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross,

financial health and social well-being of individuals. The noble Lord,
Lord Hunt, made that point as well. We have abolished the default
retirement age, meaning that most people can now retire when the time
is right for them. However, employment rates for older people remain
lower than for some of their younger counterparts, and we must ensure
that older people who wish to contribute in the workforce have the
opportunity to do so. To that end, we have announced our commitment to

clear foundation for retirement saving. The reforms will underpin the
rollout of automatic enrolment, which will see 6 million to 9 million
people saving more, or saving for the first time, into a workplace
pension. I can tell my noble friend Lord Griffiths that increasing the
basic state pension by the triple lock is part of the secret
here—a minimum of inflation, earnings or 2.5%. From April this

enrolment and the single-tier pension will provide a firm foundation

benefit schemes, the pension income of future generations from
workplace pensions will be more uncertain than for past generations.
Over the past 12 months, the defined ambition project, a joint project
between DWP and the pensions industry, has been exploring options in a
middle ground that do not leave either individuals or employers
shouldering the entire risk of pension saving. The Government will
shortly publish a consultation paper outlining the conclusions from
this work and proposals for defined ambition pensions. Following the
response, the Government will consult on draft

connections, we can keep people healthier, active and more resilient
for longer. If we do not, as she rightly said, people will continue to
have their lives cut short. We are raising awareness of the issue and
helping local health and well-being boards and commissioners to get
better at measuring the issue in their local communities. This will
help them to come up with the right targeted solutions and to drive
local improvements that really make a difference. Loneliness and social
isolation are problems that government alone cannot solve. For older

in cattle.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101778000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-wms0001.htm#13101778000013">I
am updating the House following the completion of the six-week control
pilot in Gloucestershire on  15 October. This is further to my
statement of 9 October, in which I informed the House that
Natural England was considering, and has since granted, a short
extension to the pilot in Somerset to improve the disease benefits
already achieved.</hs_para>

announced, the badger population in Gloucestershire immediately before
the pilot began was estimated to have fallen to 2,350 compared with an
estimated population of 3,400 last summer. In the six weeks of the
pilot 708 badgers have been removed from this population. This
represents just over 30% of the local badger population.</hs_para>

Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) has advised that the period of culling
this year should be extended to achieve the earliest and greatest
possible impact on bTB in Gloucestershire. Natural England is therefore
considering an application for an extension from the cull company in
Gloucestershire.</hs_para>

year are the first stage in a planned four-year cull. Three of the
areas of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial also had a slow start.
These areas saw an increase in the numbers of badgers removed in
subsequent years and went on to contribute to overall disease
benefits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101778000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017-wms0001.htm#13101778000017">I
have always been clear that both the Somerset and Gloucestershire culls
are pilots. This has enabled us to test the safety, humaneness and
effectiveness of controlled shooting as a means of reducing badger
numbers and so reduce significantly disease in cattle. Having the two
separate pilot areas has similarly enabled us to see how different
environmental factors, field and other conditions affect the practical
delivery of our objectives. Experience gained on the ground has been
invaluable. I would like to pay tribute to the local farmers and
landowners who are undertaking the cull, often in difficult terrain and
weather, and often in the face of intimidation by a small minority who
are determined to stop this disease control policy.</hs_para>

Panel of Experts has reported, we will consider all the information
these pilots have generated and decide on next steps. The early
indications are that, as in Somerset, the pilot in Gloucestershire has
been safe and humane. Nevertheless, the Gloucestershire pilot has again
demonstrated that the cull period may need to be longer than six weeks
in future, enabling teams to adapt their approaches to suit local
circumstances.</hs_para>

step towards halting the spread of bTB. We continue to make good
progress on all aspects of our draft strategy to eradicate the disease
in England within 25 years, including the development of workable
badger and cattle vaccines and better biosecurity on farms.
Collectively, we are putting in place the necessary measures for the
successful long-term eradication of bTB in the

respect of the carriage of passengers and their baggage. The Presidency
invited responses to questions posed on compensation for missed
connections and whether compensation should be time/distance based or
linked to the price of the ticket. I expressed concern that the
inclusion of connecting flights in the text would impact negatively
upon interlining agreements, reduce regional connectivity, increase
capacity problems at airports and place the EU sector at a competitive
disadvantage. I stated that the priority should be to agree the 5, 9
&amp; 12 hour trigger points for when compensation is due. The
time/distance based approach to compensation should be maintained. I
also took the opportunity to make some other points on the
proposal—I stressed that extraordinary circumstances should not
be limited to two flights, and that the provisions should not cover
other transport modes.</hs_para>

Northover (LD):</Member> New section 139A of the Equality Act 2010 (as
inserted by the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013), gives
Ministers the power to make regulations requiring employment tribunals
to order an employer to carry out an equal pay audit where the employer
has been found by the tribunal to have discriminated against an
employee because of sex in relation to pay. It is intended that
regulations will be made under this provision to come into force in
October 2014. The measure will not, by itself, provide a solution to
the gender pay gap, but we do think it will be a useful tool in
tackling it. The Government is using a voluntary, business-led approach
to help drive the culture change necessary to address the pay gap. It
has introduced Think, Act, Report to promote greater transparency on
gender employment issues, including pay. Over 125 companies are now
supporting this initiative, representing nearly two million
people.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13101775000334" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131017w0001.htm#13101775000334">European
