Lord Steel stated when he introduced the first of his five private
Members’ Bills on this subject, some six years ago, the years of
debate about the long-term reform of the House of Lords have obscured
the need for effective, immediate, yet modest, reform. Today, I hope
that we can all set aside any differences we may have on long-term,
substantial reform of the House of Lords and instead focus on
delivering the very modest reform that this Bill
delivers—although modest, it is overdue and increasingly
necessary. It is important, too, that the House notes that this Bill
has broad cross-party support. It has broad support across both Houses
of Parliament, in the media and across the country.</hs_Para>

the past few months, I have engaged widely on this matter, doing my
best to ensure that this Bill is not seen as frightening or sinister in
any way. I hope that I have been successful, because it is not a
stalking horse aimed at any group of peers and it is not certainly not
an attempt to close off any potential future reform. I wish to tackle
head on the issue of the debate over an elected House of Lords, because
this Bill makes no contribution to that debate whatsoever. The Bill
does not prevent or preclude further reform of the House of Lords, at
any time or of any type. This Bill is simply irrelevant to the debate
over election to the Lords, and I believe that any Member, regardless
of their position on an elected Lords, should feel comfortable
supporting this
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101840000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0001.htm#13101840000014">It
is fair to say that that Lord Steel’s Bills did contain some
controversial features: the establishment of a statutory appointments
commission and an end to the by-elections for hereditary peers. My Bill
does not reintroduce those proposals, and instead contains three core
elements, all of which have already been agreed by the House of Lords
during the passage of Lord Steel’s most recent Bill. First, my
Bill provides for the retirement or resignation of peers who are
Members of the House of Lords; secondly, it provides that those peers
who do not attend 
<?notus-xml column=1002?>should be cease to be Members of the House; and, finally, it provides

Byles:</Member></B> Absolutely; in the absence of any method of leaving
the other House, the leave of absence system does provide a compromise.
However, it is far from a perfect compromise, because one could very
well ask: how many peers do we currently have? The 43 peers currently
on a permanent leave of absence have a very ambiguous status. Some of
them could, in theory, continue to seek a rolling leave of absence each
time for 10 or 15 years and then suddenly decide to come
back and start voting again.</hs_Para>

it possible to replace them? Arguably not, because we could replace 43

whole House. Clearly a degree of judgment must be applied, according to
the degree of constitutional change, if any, that a Bill brings in. For
example, it is my understanding that my hon. Friend did not call for a
Committee of the whole House for the European Union (Referendum) Bill,
which was considered only a few weeks ago and which arguably has
greater constitutional implications for the country than this

that there is a fundamental difference between those who have been
elected to this House and those who, leaving aside the small number of
hereditaries, are appointed to the other place. They are appointed to
the other place in order to provide a service and a duty to their

necessary improvement. This could have been called a House of Lords
Improvement Bill, if some people are upset by the word
“reform” in the title and others are upset by any kind of
move, no matter how limited, thinking that it might undermine
substantial reform such as an elected House of Lords. It is strange
that those who are so strongly in favour of compromise and of always
being here to compromise that they want proportional
representation—so that there is permanent compromise—do
not want to compromise when it comes to the House of Lords. They say,
“If we can’t get what we want, we don’t want
anything”. That has bedevilled attempts at improvements to the
House of Lords—its operation, its relationship with the House of
Commons, its make-up and membership, and its reflection of society as a
whole—since 1911, through the post-war changes, the 1958 debates
that have been referred to today and the great combination

even those Government Members who are worried about the particulars of
the Bill could view it as a constitutional outrage. It is a modest
effort to be encouraged and supported. If hon. Members believe that
there are too many Members of the House of Lords for the place to
function properly, and there clearly are, they will back the Bill, even
if it achieves only a modest improvement in that regard; if they
believe that the Bill is too modest to effect any substantial change,
they will not oppose it, because it is so modest that it could not

across the House. There is consensus on sensible reform; on building on
the recommendations of the Political and Constitutional Reform

fact that consensus on the make-up and balance of the House of Lords is

of Lords, it will implode. Those who want to keep the House of Lords
should be in favour of substantial, sensible, non-elected reform; those
who want reform because they believe in reforming the House of Lords
and its nature should be in favour of reform per se; and those who
could not give a damn should leave the rest of us to try to get on and

the Greater London authority; the change to the powers of the Assembly

already achieves and is good at, if we took away, very carefully, the
element of it being a legislature. That does not mean that it could not
debate and put forward legislative propositions; I am talking about the
constitutional role that it plays, which is what upsets people so
much—people not being elected to it— even if, under the
proposal of the Deputy Prime Minister, those people would not be
responsible or accountable to the people who elected them, because they
would never have to stand for election again; nor would they have held
offices, or have had to report back to their multiple constituencies in
any meaningful sense. It would be good to start with the question of
what we want the House of Lords to do, and then go on to how it should

agreement. We have to be able to sit down, talk together and reach
sensible conclusions. There are sensible people in this
place, and if they go into negotiations in good will we can reach a
proper conclusion. I do not want to go over the problems of the past
year or so, but our view is that the difficulty with those negotiations
is that they did not begin on that
basis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101840000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0001.htm#13101840000121"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T10:22:32"></hs_TimeCode>Clause
1 would allow peers to resign or retire, and that seems entirely
sensible. I do not believe that becoming a peer should be a life
sentence. There are many reasons why people might want to leave the
other place. They might be ill, or there might be other things they
want to do, so it seems entirely sensible that they should be able to
leave if they so wish. It does not seem sensible that they should
continue to have desks and that papers should continue be delivered to
them if they are not attending.

2, which would allow for automatic severance if someone is not fit to
attend for a whole Session without leave—essentially, the
“able” clause—seems very sensible. So, too, is
clause 3, which would allow a peer to lose their seat if they had been
convicted of a criminal offence and were sentenced to at least a
year’s imprisonment or an indefinite sentence. Surely that is
nothing more than a sensible provision that already applies in this
place. There is some discretion in relation to overseas prison
sentences, and I understand the reasoning behind that. My only regret,
I suppose, is that it is not retrospective, so even if the Bill is

do not wish to revisit at any length the events surrounding last
year’s House of Lords Reform Bill, but whatever one’s
views of the underlying merits of that issue or of an elected House of
Lords, it is hard to deny that the Bill was deeply misconceived. It
purported to create greater accountability by electing unaccountable
senators. It purported to increase the power of the legislature against
the Executive, but the fact is that the Blair Government were defeated
four times in the elected Commons over 10 years and 460 times in the
unelected Lords. It purported to advance democracy but would have meant
fewer women, fewer people with disabilities and fewer people from black
and minority ethnic backgrounds in front-line politics.

contrast, our Parliament has always been at its best when it acts in a
spirit not of 18th century innovation, but of reform. I cannot help but
mention the great Member for Wendover, Bristol and Malton, Edmund
Burke, who is not in his seat—not surprising, perhaps, as he
died in 1797. In his writings, he set seven tests for reform, which
might be of interest to the House. Reform should be early, anticipating
the emergence of a problem before its full effects are felt; it should
be proportionate to the evil to be addressed, to limit any collateral
effects; it should build on existing arrangements and previous reforms,
so that it can draw on any lessons learned from them; it should be
measured, so that those making the change and those affected by it can
adjust their behaviour accordingly; it should be consensual, so that
the process of reform can avoid unnecessary conflict and outlast a
particular Government’s own period in office; it should be cool
in spirit, to maintain consensus throughout the process of change; and,
finally, each step must be practical and achievable in itself. The Bill
meets every one of those
tests<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T10:29:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

modest, but let us recognise that they have the potential to have a
fairly radical effect on the membership of the other place. Because of
the nature of the Bill, one can only surmise what its true effect would

Bill essentially has three different aspects and I will consider each
in turn. The first is the retirement or resignation of a peer, the
second the removal of a peer for non-attendance, and the third the
removal of a peer after conviction for committing a serious criminal
offence. I am inclined to agree that it is absurd that a Member of the
other place should be required to remain a Member if they no longer
wish to do so, but there is already in place a procedure that enables
them to take leave of absence. Last Friday, <I>The House </I>magazine
stated that 43 noble Lords have taken such leave of absence. Roughly 5%
have taken advantage of the process, so it must be fairly widely known
and it seems to be working. There is a list on the Parliament website
of those Lords who have taken a leave of absence. I will not read it
out, but what I will say is that 10 Members of the other place applied
for leave of absence and were granted it in the first month of this
Parliament back in May 2010. Those 10 knew straight away what the

dozen Members of the other place who, for whatever reason, are not

allowance only if they turn up, all those who have taken a leave of

anything. If we offer their noble lordships an incentive to retire, we
will enter an arms race of incentives. Although some Lords might accept
the incentive, others will say that it is not enough, so people will
say that we ought to make the incentives more generous. There are

underestimate the power of the writ of summons. For somebody who has
devoted a substantial portion of their life to the service of their

entitled not to attend. Some people really do feel that they are

point. There will be noble Lords in the other place who feel that they
have an obligation to continue. One suggestion is that there should be
a formal retirement ceremony to mark the service of a peer. There is,
after all, a formal ceremony to introduce new peers into the House of
Lords. We saw that ceremony only yesterday, when two new peers were

Inevitably, the numbers will fall over time by reason of death. When
there is a diminution in the number of working peers—those who
regularly attend and take part in proceedings—because peers have
died, it is right that the party leaders should replace them. What is
not right—we saw this all too often under the last

if peers are not attending, they are not causing any

apparently, use the facilities but do not attend. Quite how that works
needs to be considered, but I am sure there are other ways to do it.
For example, it would be easy, even if the clause became law, for
Members who 
<?notus-xml column=1025?>wanted to retain their membership of the other place to take advantage
of their membership without playing a full and active part. They could
turn up on the first day of the Session, take part in a Division, thus
ticking that box, continue to come and go as they please and not take
part in anything else. Human nature being what it is, there will always
be one or two who do that if such a provision is introduced. It would
perhaps become known as “the Byles attendance”. They

Edward Leigh:</Member></B> I also commend
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T11:27:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North Warwickshire (Dan Byles) for promoting the Bill. I
hope he did not mind my intervening on him and suggesting that it would
make very little difference. His reply was interesting; he said,
“It’s going to make so little difference, it’s not
worth opposing,” which is an interesting constitutional
innovation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T11:27:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0001.htm#13101841000014">I
think that my hon. Friend is going about this the right way, though. We
are all familiar with the dictum that when it is not necessary to
change, it is necessary 
<?notus-xml column=1027?>not to change. I think we can add to that: when it is necessary to
change, it is necessary to do so very slowly. That is a gradualist,
Conservative, Tory—high Tory, if I may say so—notion of
constitutional reform, and Edmund Burke would have been proud of him
today. Edmund Burke, incidentally, was known as the “Dinner
Bell” during his time in the Commons because his speeches were
so long and so boring, but that certainly did not apply to the crisp
way in which my hon. Friend introduced his Bill and replied to all our
many points.</hs_Para>

I like about the Bill is that it establishes the notion that it is
possible to reform the House of Lords gradually and to remove its
greatest faults without suggesting that we need an elected House of
Lords. I am personally convinced that this is the way forward. It was a
very good point made earlier that it is extraordinary that those most
hellbent on creating an elected House of Lords, based on proportional
representation to ensure that no one party can dominate it, are the
same people who, precisely because they want a radical reform, insist
on killing off every single modest reform ever attempted. That is an
extraordinary constitutional notion.</hs_Para>

this extraordinarily modest Bill, we are just trying to take one or two
steps, and if it becomes law, there is no reason why we could not take
two or three further steps next year. Of course, I
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T11:29:38"></hs_TimeCode> not think the
Bill goes far enough. It does not get to the kernel of the problem, but
that is not a good reason for denying my hon. Friend’s Bill
progress
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0001.htm#13101841000017"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T11:29:52"></hs_TimeCode>I
want to make a few points about how we could solve some of the House of
Lords’ major problems. If the Bill were to become law, what
would it achieve? It would allow people to retire. My hon. Friend made
a fair point when he asked why anyone should not be allowed to retire.
No one would suggest that the provision on retirement is a wrong notion
in itself. We all know, however, that it is already possible to take
leave of absence.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T11:30:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope) has intervened to make that
entirely justifiable point. There are no incentives to retire, because
there is no pension and because people can take leave of absence. Even
under this Bill, Members of the House of Lords would have to turn up
only once a Session to retain their membership. It is therefore hard to
imagine why anyone would choose to retire. However, according to
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T11:30:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North Warwickshire, there are four or five people in the
other place who wish to do so. Fair enough—why should anyone
stop them? The fact that only a few people want to do something is not
a reason for opposing their right to do it. So I have no problem with
that
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T11:31:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0001.htm#13101841000018">I
do not think anyone has a problem with putting the House of Lords
pretty much on a par with the House of Commons in terms of criminal
convictions, although I think that too much is made of this point. Just
as there are probably very few people who would choose to retire from
the House of Lords, because it is unnecessary to do so, there are also
very few people who have been convicted of relatively serious criminal
offences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T11:31:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0001.htm#13101841000019"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dan Byles" PimsId="5598" UID="13101841000435" xid="1199" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0001.htm#13101841000435">Dan

problem with the House of Lords is that there are too many people
there. It is not that the Benches are overcrowded or that people have
to turn up early to speak. The problem with having too many people in
the House of Lords is that it gives too much power and patronage to the
Government. The Bill will make absolutely no difference to that. That
is not a reason to oppose it,
however.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0001.htm#13101841000022"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T11:32:39"></hs_TimeCode>Our
debating these important constitutional points today gives us an
opportunity to say that the Government are in a difficult position on
this matter. They introduced a massive Bill last year that would have
fundamentally changed the relationship between the two House of
Parliament. It would effectively have created an elected House of Lords
and put people in there for a 15-year term. Such a dramatic, radical
step would have offended many Conservative sensibilities, and the
Government failed to achieve consensus on the Bill.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T11:33:15"></hs_TimeCode>They also tell
us constantly that they are worried about the other place because there
are too many people there, yet they go on stuffing it—I use the
word advisedly—with more and more political placements. It has

people who had delivered extraordinary service to the nation, for
example by serving in the Cabinet.

the Member for Bury North (Mr Nuttall) said that only a quarter of the
Members of the other place were former politicians, but when I go there
these days, it is like looking at the House of Commons of 10 years ago.
The same people are now there, and I believe that that gives far too
much power and patronage to the Government.</hs_Para>

what it is worth, I would reform the House of Lords by going a lot
further than the Bill and getting rid of the fundamental iniquity
whereby the Government can go on appointing more and more people to it.
I would set an upper limit on the number of its Members. It would be
reasonable to set a maximum size of 650, the same as the House of
Commons. That would concentrate minds and ensure that only the most
distinguished people, such as former Deputy Speakers of the House of
Commons, could end up there. We should aim for that level of
distinction, Madam Deputy Speaker. My serious point is that setting an
upper limit would concentrate minds. It would also prevent Governments
from threatening to create extra peers if they could not get their way
in relation to a particular
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T11:35:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0001.htm#13101841000027">I

a certain interest in those matters. It would be perfectly possible to
allow Members of the other place who were over 80 to attend and go on

with the cardinals. I believe that setting a sensible retirement age
and placing a limit on the number of peers would solve many of the

importance of this very small Bill in terms of constitutional change is
that, if by some miracle it gets through its Second Reading by

have been talking about these matters for a very long time. We started
with the Parliament Act 1911, after which came the Bryce commission,
which was set up by Lloyd George following the interregnum of
the first world war. The commission failed to agree on any
proposals. It is interesting to note that most people then favoured a
House of Lords with 246 Members, chosen by MPs, from different
geographical regions. I have said that there is something wrong with
the size of the House of Lords, but there is also something wrong with
the geographical spread of its membership.</hs_Para>

22% of Members of the House of Lords come from London, and 18% come
from elsewhere in the south-east. Only 2.94% come from my region, the
east midlands, and 2.2% come from the north-east. That geographical
concentration on London is a problem, and the House of Lords has become
the home of the metropolitan liberal elite. I am sure that my hon.
Friend the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)
would<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T09:42:04"></hs_TimeCode> agree that
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T11:38:49"></hs_TimeCode> is a sad fact
that there are probably now more social conservatives in the House of
Commons than in the House of Lords. Without wishing to get into the
whole subject of gay marriage, we saw that, when that legislation was
passed. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T11:39:06"></hs_TimeCode>The
membership of the House of Lords is not spread widely enough,

have mentioned the initial reforms that attempted to achieve such a
geographical spread, and the Bryce commission, which proposed those
ideas in 1922. At that time, people were still talking about limiting
membership of the House of Lords to hereditary peers, albeit with some
kind of election by the House of Commons. All along, however, and even
in those early days, and there was a determination not to upset
parliamentary conventions, as is this Bill, which I like, so there was
no power to amend or reject money Bills and the Parliament Act would
not apply. The gradualist notion that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T11:39:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North Warwickshire is talking about is important because
it means that the fundamental conventions, which primarily ensure the
supremacy of the elected House of Commons, are not affected. All those
who take part in these debates must constantly repeat the point that no
Bill should so radically alter the House of Lords or make it
democratically justifiable in some shape or form that 
<?notus-xml column=1030?>the supremacy of this House of Commons, which has

Marquess of Salisbury proposed a scheme based on the Bryce idea and
that received a Second Reading in 1934, but again no progress was made.
An inter-party conference on Lords reforms in the late 1940s agreed on
nine principles, and I do not think any of them would be affected by
this Bill, and none of them would fall foul of the notion of
gradualism. They included the principle that no party should have
overall control of the reformed House, that life peerages would be
created, that women would be allowed to be Members and that allowances
would be introduced. They at least had the right idea, therefore, which
was that they should reform
gradually.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0001.htm#13101841000035">The

“Completing the Reform”, of 2001; the first and second
reports of the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform of 2002; the

contention that no consensus will ever be found, so let’s get
over it. Perhaps we should send buses around London bearing billboards
saying, “The House of Lords will not be elected: get over
it,” because that is the reality. No consensus will ever be
found in the House of Commons to create any kind of elected House of
Lords, and that is why the approach we are trying to follow today is

addition of any element of a reformed Chamber that includes directly
elected Lords threatens the whole raft of conventions that have been
carefully built up over 100 years, and which determine the relationship
between the Commons and the Lords. These conventions are important and
bear repeating: the Salisbury convention regarding Bills implementing
manifesto commitments; the convention that the Lords do not usually
object to secondary legislation; the convention that the Government
should be able to get their business done in reasonable time; the
financial privilege of the House of Commons; and the convention on the
exchange of amendments between the Houses. These conventions are not
unimportant. They are central to our constitution and I believe they
have to be preserved because they conserve the supremacy of the elected
House of Commons.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Suffolk Coastal (Dr Coffey), if they only speak
once over 10 years—if they speak with sufficient knowledge from
personal experience. That is what they are there to do. We are here in
the House of Commons not to speak as experts; we are generalists. We
are here to represent public opinion as we see it. Of course our own
prejudices occasionally come into play, but we do attempt to
reflect public opinion. The House of Lords is not there for that

because it was heavily whipped against, and it was defeated. But in the

House of Lords performs that function excellently. Those who believe
that the House of Lords can have legitimacy only if it is elected
forget what the result of an elected House of Lords would be: it would

“politicians” because we are elected and too many of us
believe that we can feel justification in our life only if we become

come to see light in the House of Lords, whereas in this place it is
almost impossible to defeat the power of the whipping system, because
most politicians are naturally ambitious.

I was saying, the major strength of the British parliamentary system
not just in the past century, but over 200 years, is that it bends
rather than breaks. It does move very slowly, and people often
criticise us for the slowness of our constitutional change, but its
very slowness is its major strength. If we were to enact legislation to
codify a convention—if

the Member for North Warwickshire were to say that, as we have
excellent conventions regulating the relationship between the two

do not know how any of the proposals for House of Lords reform will
upset the conventions, which time, tradition and compromise have
erected. Time, tradition and compromise are the essential agreements of
any successful constitutional change. That is a conservative
principle—a Burkean principle—and it lies behind what my

there is scope for a mechanism for effectively leaving the other place.
As has been said, for the past two years there has been an informal
voluntary retirement scheme, which involves peers being given permanent
leave of absence, but not many people have taken that up. It was

short, clause 1 provides the mechanism for noble Lords to leave
Parliament once and for all. I understand that one peer, from

2 provides that noble Lords not attending the other place during a
Session lasting over six months, and not having leave of absence for
the Session, would cease to be a Member. I believe it deals with people
who do not show up—one thing that brings the other place into
disrepute. As a parallel example, a non-executive director of UK plc
who failed to show up to any meetings would be likely to be turfed out
at the next annual general meeting. I would expect them to be turfed
out if they showed up but did not ask a single question or utter a
statement. That is important for the good repute of the other

is also contrary to the obligations of a Member of the other place as
set out in the terms of the writ of summons. In exchange for the honour
of a peerage bestowed by the Crown, noble Members have certain duties
to carry out. They agree that they will be personally present in
Parliament to “treat” and “give counsel” to
the sovereign. Looking beyond that perhaps archaic language, I believe
that the settlement of the writ remains valid, and that when noble
Lords take up their writ, they should be expected to honour it. When
candidates for Parliament sign up to be elected, it is expected that we
will have obligations: we will vote. The Government and other Members
are seeking mechanisms to recall Members of Parliament in certain
circumstances. I believe it is important that anyone who becomes a
Member of the House of Lords should expect to attend and contribute
either their expertise or the crown of silver wisdom that one gets

years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0001.htm#13101841000061"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Chope" PimsId="2598" UID="13101841000448" xid="110" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0001.htm#13101841000448">Mr

served in a particular post, they should automatically become a Member

Metropolitan Police Commissioner has always become a peer until

somebody can remain a Member of the other place and be able to vote on
the most serious matters of state without setting foot in the Chamber
for months, years or even decades. I understand that the Clerk of the
Parliaments now writes to noble Lords who attend infrequently inviting
them to take a leave of absence, so 
<?notus-xml column=1036?>they are able to retire informally. That has led to a few more taking

currently disqualified from attending the other place because they are
members of the judiciary. They includes judges who were appointed Lords
of Appeal in Ordinary under the old system prior to the establishment
of the Supreme Court. They are currently disqualified from sitting, but

other category of peers that is not covered—I am surprised that
the other place chose this system—is those who are temporarily

the back-up plan of returning to the mother of Parliaments when elected

welcome clause 3, on the expulsion of noble Lords convicted of a
serious offence. There is no doubt that it causes consternation for the
membership of peers to go unchallenged despite their being sent to
prison. No Member of this place or the other place should be above the
law, and the view is reasonably held that we as legislators should be
held to an even higher standard. The clause would make that
happen.</hs_Para>

certainly makes sense to align the rules with those in the Commons, so
that those given a sentence of a year or more should be forced to leave
the Lords. In this Parliament, a Member of this House voluntary
resigned before being convicted of a crime, although they were given a
sentence of less than a year. Some noble Lords have been given similar
sentences, and clause 1 would provide them with the opportunity to step
down rather than perhaps simply not attending again. That is a
common-sense, even overdue, measure that will bring the Lords into line
with the long-established practices of this House and improve the
reputation of Parliament as a
whole.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0001.htm#13101841000075">To
sum up, the Bill provides several reforming measures that are
important, and indeed perhaps even necessary, because of the failures
of past attempts at reform. It is important that we do what we can to
enhance the reputation of Parliament. Allowing peers to resign or
retire, if they wish to do so, with dignity is a common-sense move. The
provisions on serious offences are also a way of enhancing the
reputation and perception of Parliament. The measures relating to
people who do not turn up to share the wisdom for which they were first
appointed also take a sensible approach. I hope that there is consensus
in the House, and that we make progress with the Bill
today.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13101841000421" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0001.htm#13101841000421">12.5

tread carefully here, because a Member of the upper House who formerly

is reasonable to say that those convicted of criminal offences should
be barred from the upper House. The electorate would expect that. There

it, the Government have no intention of allowing time for this Bill to

Reading goes through, move in accordance with Standing Order No. 63 for
it to be so committed. The question of whether a Bill is of
constitutional importance of the first order, which is how
“Erskine May” refers to those Bills that should go into a
Committee of the whole House, seems to me to be extremely clear:
something that affects the membership of either House must, by

a matter of HR, but the question of who has the right to determine
legislation is at the heart of our constitution and to put the Bill

House—the ability of every Member to attend the
Committee—seems to be wrong. It might be being done just to save
the blushes of the Lord President of the Council, who was not
enormously successful with his previous effort, but it is disappointing

we have discovered in the course of this debate, there are some issues
that need clarifying. They may, to some extent, be pedantic points, but
the history of constitutional change is that it is often the

Bill tries to deal with problems that are not exactly new. I managed to
find a reference in 1298 to the difficulty of getting Members to attend
this House, rather than the other place. In those days a surety was
required to ensure that Members turned up. The sheriff of Sussex
required that the two deputies of Chichester should have surety and
they simply ignored him. Some deputies from Bedfordshire were bound
over in eight oxen and four draught horses. Now, some hundreds of years
later, instead of demanding oxen and horses as surety for peers to turn

Bill is clear that peers must attend the House unless they have leave

applied for and is not arbitrary, but there might be circumstances in
which peers cannot apply for leave of absence. It is possible to
envisage circumstances in which they might not wish to apply for leave
of absence but, for sensible political motives, do not want to attend
the House. For example, if a Government obtained a majority in this
House on a very small minority of votes in a general election, which is
not impossible, and then used the Parliament Act aggressively to
overrule the House of Lords, a peer or group of peers might say that

House of Lords does not have the right to expel its Members, unlike the
House of Commons, and for good reason. The House of Commons has that
power, and always used to use it in relation to those who went to

re-election, so the expulsion can be tested by the electorate. That

relatively modern Representation of the People Act 1981, which allows

intended to deal with an immediate political problem relating to the
hunger strikers. As Members will remember, Bobby Sands was elected
while on hunger strike in prison. It was enormously politically awkward
for the Government that Members of Parliament were dying on hunger
strike, so a law was rushed through to debar automatically people from
standing for election to this House if they were in prison. That

a bad emergency Act carried out for a political purpose, rather than a

House of Lords has never been able to expel Members, although it can
suspend them and still retains a vestigial right to imprison them
during the course of a Session. The reason is that it was always
thought that it would enhance the powers of the Crown too greatly if
it, by using a majority that it could cobble together through its
patronage in the House, could remove obstreperous Members. The only way
to remove peers was by a specific Act of attainder—as Members
will recall, such Acts were used against people such as Stafford, who
was expelled from the House and his titles struck down—or by
bringing an action against a Member for treason. His titles would
technically cease just before his execution; they would go with the Act
of Parliament or the impeachment for treason. So there is a process to
expel peers, but the reason it is very long and difficult is the fear
that the prerogative power and the patronage of the Crown would be used
to determine the membership of an upper House.</hs_Para>

is the historical context on why peers can only be suspended and not

its Standing Orders. Much preferable to the clause on removal for
non-attendance would be entirely to delegate that to the Standing
Orders of the House of Lords, whereby a peer who was absent for a
certain period would have to make a submission to return, would have to
explain the reason for the absence, and would be suspended for the rest
of the Parliament if those explanations were not satisfactory to the
Lords. That would allow for the flexibility that would be needed in the
case of a prisoner of war, somebody who was kidnapped, or somebody who
was imprisoned in a foreign country. One can envisage that, say, in the
case of a peer who had been involved with the Greenpeace demonstration
in Russia, 
<?notus-xml column=1041?>found guilty of piracy and sentenced to 15 years in prison, the House of

the nub of the matter: the courts can determine what is a proceeding in

deny the European Court of Human Rights and our own domestic courts

looser whipping system, Cross Benchers do not necessarily know when the
votes will take place. I have heard from some Cross Benchers that they
feel that the votes are often deliberately scheduled for the point at
which most of them will have gone home, because the party Whips prefer
to keep the votes mainly among themselves, rather than have too many
pesky Cross Benchers interfering, but that is anecdotal and may not

the position of Cross Benchers is particular and that voting certainly
does not mean attendance. It is a different requirement. Indeed,
activity in the Lords can mean different things: it can take place in
general discussion, in Committee or on the Floor. I think that that is
a matter for the Lords to determine for themselves internally, not for

two disadvantages are that they cannot vote in general elections and

peerage. The Queen does not go around commandeering people and saying,
“You’re going to the Lords, whether you like it or

have to discuss their title, and they have to pay for their letters

glorious things that we all like to be called. When they accept that

current Parliament—that there have been idle Members of the
House of Commons. You rightly look deeply shocked at that thought,
Madam Deputy Speaker, but it must have happened on occasions. That does
not mean that we should go around expelling Members of either House
without knowing the full reasons for their actions, and it should be
done under the auspices of the House. This House, through its
Committees, has the ability to expel Members if it feels that is the
suitable course of action. I cannot recall any example of a Member of
this House being expelled for idleness. Some have been expelled for
criminality, for treason or for libel, but I cannot think of one who
has ever been expelled for idleness in the hundreds of years of the
existence of the House. Penalties and fines have been introduced for
non-attendance, but not expulsion, and it would be excessive to
legislate for the House of Lords to expel for non-attendance when we
are not willing to take it on

should of course obey their writ of summons and the Lords could
introduce Standing Orders to cover that, but resignation would be
improper. Having taken on a lifetime promise, people should not
abrogate it willy-nilly. Retirement would be sad, because the Lords is
the last representation in society of the elderly, and they are an
increasingly important part of our society and deserve to be
represented in the political nation. One of the great things about the
Lords is that those of us who are little younger can wander over there
and see some of the infirmities of age that are becoming such common
issues across the nation. It helps bring those to the centre of the
political debate and informs legislation on disability. The older
people in the House of Lords have a deeper understanding of such issues
than perhaps we do. That is valuable and I would strongly oppose any
move to compulsory retirement. I would be cautious about clause 1
because it would open the way to that, and indeed that is what some of
the promoters of earlier Bills probably wanted to see. Some people want
a compulsory retirement age for

rule. Having said that, the nub of the problem with a peer going to
prison is as much to do with the title as with the ability to be in
Parliament. I suggest that most people are not aware of the reasons why
a knighthood can be removed and a peerage cannot be removed when
somebody goes to prison. Equally, I would not like to make it easy to
remove a peerage. It needs to be a difficult process because of a
peer’s position as a legislator and the desire not to allow
malign Governments, which do occur from time to 
<?notus-xml column=1046?>time, to abuse a power that has been introduced for a very good reason.

1917 Act—it is fascinating that we were three years into the war
before we decided to do anything about this—set out the
circumstances under which somebody could be reported to a Committee of
the Privy Council for their peerage and title to be removed, which were
that they had to be residing in an enemy country or fighting for the
enemy in the current war. That had the advantage of essentially being a
judicial process. I would argue that the deprivation of titles ought to
be more a judicial than a directly internal matter. It is taking away
not just something from a proceeding in Parliament; it is taking away
an honour that it is used outside Parliament, is relevant outside
Parliament and, in the case of an hereditary peerage, cascades down
through the generations. This would allow, and I think the 1917 Act
sets out a very good formula for doing it, the two members of the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council required to be on the Committee
to consider whether somebody’s offence was serious enough that
they should be deprived of their title, and therefore the rights and

Rees-Mogg:</Member></B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I would say it
was analogous to an election court, where, if election fraud or
misbehaviour during a general election was shown, a court would
determine whether the seat had been won in a valid manner, because it
is a second degree from the court’s action. The court’s
action, or the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council’s action,
would be to remove the title, and it would follow from that that there
would a removal from the House of Lords. I feel it would also allow a
proper flexibility to consider the circumstances and would not, as was
brought up by another hon. Member, mean that a judge, in passing
sentence, would know that a 365 day sentence disbarred and a 364 day
sentence did not, and that this must add to the weight of sentence.
What if the situation were that a judge, in handing down a sentence,
said, “If you were Joe Bloggs, I would give you a
year in prison, but because you are Lord Bloggs you will receive an
additional punishment on top of a year in prison. Therefore, I am going
to remit part of the sentence.” What then? How would the Act
apply to that? It would have been a year, but it is discounted. There
are issues relating to suspended sentences.</hs_Para>

concerned about the ability of foreign courts’ judgments to be
recognised and to disbar people from peerages. I assume this is done in
relation to Lord Black of Crossharbour and that his conviction in the 
<?notus-xml column=1047?>United States is viewed as having tainted him in such a way that his
peerage should be removed. I have great doubts about the judicial
process used against Lord Black of Crossharbour, whom it is not my
intention to defend particularly. Somebody he worked with was
threatened with judicial, criminal action that would, if he had been
found guilty, have led to an exceptionally long sentence, but which, if
he turned evidence against Lord Black, would give him three weeks in a
country club; and he took the latter option, as we might all have
done.</hs_Para>

is how American justice and plea bargaining works. Even if they think
they are innocent, people are under such pressure to accept the low
sentence they would get with a plea bargain and the consequences of
protesting their innocence are so great, that they find there is an
injustice against them automatically. Worse than that, the prosecutors
use them effectively to bribe witnesses into saying that the other
chap, who is not co-operating, did it. By protesting their innocence,
the other chap—Lord Black, in this case—risks a very long
sentence that we should not take any notice of in this country. Indeed,
I think it is restrained of him not to use his vote in the House of
Lords. I would not think it improper of him, because he has not been
found guilty of any offence in this
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000135"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T12:45:54"></hs_TimeCode>Hon.
Members might think that view is very little Englander, but I happen to
believe that the standards of justice in the United Kingdom are higher
than those in other countries. That does not mean to say that all other
countries are unjust, but other countries’ systems have
injustices within them, and this issue of plea bargaining in the United
States is one that is particularly egregious. But it is not just the
United States, which is a close ally and has a common-law system, a
system that we understand; the system on the continent is not one that
we understand or are used to as Britons. It has the Napoleonic code. As
Geoffrey Boycott so memorably said when he was in front of a French
court, it is all in French—of all the audacities! They have
different sentencing processes as well, so a crime that in this country
might be viewed as a relatively modest offence could be seen as a very
serious one in a foreign country or could relate to things that in this
country are entirely legal. For example, in some countries,
homosexuality is still illegal and is persecuted strongly. Are we to
say that a peer caught out in those circumstances should be disbarred
from the House?</hs_Para>

accept that there is the exceptionalism, but that is the wrong way
around. If somebody has been through a British court and had judgment
against them, that is a perfectly rational basis for determining their
membership of a British Parliament, but if some foreign court has found
against them, it does not seem to me to raise the same issues. Some
foreign courts are willing to try people in absentia; others—the
Italian courts come to mind—are extraordinarily political in how
they approach prosecutions and sentencing. In that respect, I have some
sympathy with Mr Berlusconi, whom I think was persecuted by extremely
left-wing judges who wanted to use a legal mechanism to get him out of
office, which they succeeded in doing. I will not stand up for his

the proper time and that requires them to be Government Bills, because
Government controls the timetable in the House. It seems to me that the
only reason why this is not a Government Bill and has not therefore
been thought through more carefully is to save the blushes of the Lord
President of the Council, who said he would not support a future House

hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg). His
remarks should persuade anybody who has any doubts about the
desirability of having this constitutional measure debated on the Floor
of the House in a Committee of the whole House of the wisdom of that
course of action, because this is a serious constitutional Bill. In the
absence of a written constitution, it is this House and the other place
that have to look after our constitution, and why should all Members of
this House not be able to consider in detail the provisions and
implications of this Bill, which could be done if there was a Committee
of the whole House?</hs_Para>

of the advantages of the Government supporting any motion in relation
to Standing Order No. 63 would be that the Committee of the whole House
could meet to consider this not on a Friday, but on some other day of
the week, so we could get an even higher attendance than we have been
able to achieve today. We could then be sure that, if and when this
Bill leaves this place and goes to the other place, it will have been
properly thought through and all the constitutional implications will
have been

of my roles in life at the moment is to be the representative of the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the Venice
Commission, which looks at written constitutions. Last week in Venice
we were looking at the proposed Tunisian constitution, and the time
before we were looking at the amendments to the Hungarian constitution.
One of the problems with those written constitutions is their rigidity.
We are fortunate in having an unwritten constitution, which is
inherently flexible. Long may that continue to be so. That is why it is
essential that, before making changes to our constitution, which we can
do by a bare majority in both Houses, those changes should have been
properly thought through in the way my hon. Friend is encouraging us to

hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Dan Byles) on
introducing this Bill. It is a pity that he was not able to incorporate
in it some of my ideas in the House of Lords (Maximum Membership) Bill,
which is also on today’s Order Paper. Some of my Bill’s
provisions dealing with retirement are perfectly apposite to his Bill.
If his Bill reaches a Committee of the whole House, some ideas from my
Bill may well be taken forward by him in the form of new clauses or
amendments. I am grateful that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T12:59:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

Member for North Warwickshire, but it does, as I mentioned in an
intervention, deal with the issue of incentives for retirement. Clause
5 of my Bill refers to the ability to convert, whereby the title of
someone seeking to retire becomes a hereditary one on retirement. That
would provide an incentive, not an expensive one, and it would address
the issue of a lack of incentive and of compensation, which seems to be
very much at the forefront of my hon. Friend’s
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T13:01:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000155">As
has come out in the debate, clause 4 of the Bill, which deals with the
effect of ceasing to be a Member, is silent on the issue of any costs.
Would, for example, severance payments be made? Could we ensure that
there was no guarantee of, or no entitlement to, severance payments? I
imagine that the issue of whether money should be paid out of central
funds to compensate people who cease to be Members would be a matter
for the other place. However, that should be specifically excluded from
the provisions of this Bill, so that in no circumstances could a Bill
which made provision for retirement from the House of Lords be an
additional and significant charge on public funds.</hs_Para>

we recall, the Prime Minister has been very hot on the issue of
reducing the cost of politics, although he was not able to reduce the
numbers in this House because of the duplicitous way in which the
minority Government party and the Liberal Democrat leader behaved.
Meanwhile, however, the Prime Minister has been increasing
significantly the numbers in the other place, and that has added
significantly to the cost of politics. So, the cost of politics, far
from being reduced, is going up substantially. On the way back to this
House yesterday, I was looking at the <I>Daily Mail</I>, which was
forecasting that yet another tranche of new peers is going to be
appointed very soon—perhaps the Minister wishes to intervene on
that point. That will increase their number even beyond what we have
now.</hs_Para>

do not know whether one reason for the visits to China by the Prime
Minister and the Mayor of London was to see the Chinese second Chamber,
which is the world’s largest. Our House of Lords is exceeded in
size only by the Parliament of the Chinese Republic. Having regard to
the relatively modest population in this country compared with that of
China, I am not sure that we should be pleased that we have a Chamber
of Parliament that is second in size only to that in the Republic of
China. The case for reducing the number of people in the House of Lords
through having a maximum number is very strong. Having said that, I am
not sure that the way that the Bill goes about it is right in its
present form.</hs_Para>

refers to the issue of retirement or resignation. Essentially, those
words have the same meaning. The long title of the Bill makes provision
for retirement from the House of Lords; it does not refer to
resignation. Obviously, those who were looking at the drafting of the
Bill realised that the term “resignation” effectively
came within the concept of retirement. The use of the word
“resignation” rather than “retirement” is
an issue of semantics rather than of
substance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000159">However,
I am concerned that clause 1 does not make it clear whether, and if so
how, it applies to their lordships spiritual and to hereditary peers.
At the moment, 
<?notus-xml column=1052?>it seems to apply to all peers, but I am not sure it would be
appropriate for the Bill to introduce rules relating to the retirement
or resignation of their lordships spiritual or to hereditary peers.
However, that is not spelt out in the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000160">I
am concerned also, in clause 2, about the issue of non-attendance.
There are many ways of defining non-attendance and the Bill sets out
some of them, but as my hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset
made very clear, one may well be a Member of the other place but not
choose to attend. For example, at the moment Baroness Ashton finds
herself too preoccupied with trying to rule us from Brussels to be able
to attend the other place. One might argue that, in that case, it would
be a good idea if she was forced to resign, or indeed expelled, from
that place, but that is a separate argument and it is not covered by
the Bill. However, there is a wide range of reasons why someone might
wish not to attend the other House.</hs_Para>

witnesses who attended the Political and Constitutional Reform
Committee discussions on these issues made the point that the relative
number of people who would wish to retire at the moment is very modest,
so because most of those who would wish to retire do not attend anyway,
the provisions relating to retirement would have no significant impact
on the numbers in the House of Lords. Those who are currently not
attending would be faced under clause 2 with the threat that if they
carried on not attending, they would be deprived of their membership,
so those people might be given a perverse incentive to start attending.
The Clerk of the Parliaments has said that the biggest problem with the
other place is not the people who do not turn up, but the fact that so
many people do turn up, with the pressure on resources.</hs_Para>

misconceived. It deals with a presentational point. Their lordships
seem to think that if there is a suggestion that some people are not
very regular attenders, that causes reputational damage to their
lordships’ House. But as we have discussed, there may be any
number of reasons why those people choose not to attend, and if, in any
event, under the provisions of the Bill, they could receive a
certificate from the Lord Speaker to the effect that, notwithstanding
their lack of attendance, they could still carry on as Members of the
other place, that undermines that provision of the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000163">The
Political and Constitutional Reform Committee took all that evidence,
and we produced a report. Some people—even the Minister on the
Front Bench today—said that they were wholly in support of
everything that is in the Bill. I think that is going a bit far. Sadly,
I was not able to be present at the meeting at which the Committee
examined the final report and considered possible amendments. If I had
been able to contribute at that stage, I certainly would have tabled
some amendments.</hs_Para>

said that, the report accepts that there is a case for dealing with
some of the issues covered in the Bill. The strongest case relates to
clause 3, on people who have committed offences, because it would bring
the Lords in line with what happens in this House to a greater extent.
Even on that clause, however, I have some concerns.</hs_Para>

soon as somebody was convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to a
year or more of imprisonment, he would automatically cease to be a
Member of the other place. That would apply even before any appeals 
<?notus-xml column=1053?>process had been exhausted. Someone might be convicted in the Crown
court and wish to appeal against the sentence, but before the appeal
they would lose their position in the other place.</hs_Para>

one wants to go along with the idea of clause 3, it would be much
fairer to provide that a person ceased to be Member of the other place
after they had been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment in excess
of one year, but also after all their rights of appeal had been
exhausted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T13:11:30"></hs_TimeCode>. That
would still not cover someone seeking an appeal in future through the
administrative process by which people can have their convictions
reviewed, but the provision in clause 3 should apply only after the
right of immediate appeal against a sentence has been utilised and
proved unsuccessful, or after the person in question has chosen not to

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T13:12:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

contrasting ways in different countries, and if we are to deprive
people of the right to be Members of our legislature, we should say
that a conviction by a court overseas has no effect. We should not

we heard in the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, the
previous Lord Speaker, Baroness Hayman, and some others of their

Goodlad and one or two other witnesses, told us that that would be a
good idea. However, the points that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T13:13:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North East Somerset made show that we must be extremely
nervous about what the impact would be if their lordships tried to
extend the range of conduct—misdemeanours as well as criminal
law offences—that they considered sufficient to deprive somebody
of being able to be a Member of the Lords. Even in this House, we do
not have the power to expel Members who have not been convicted by the

against the idea of a retirement scheme for their lordships that is

that, although the House of Lords (Maximum Membership) Bill has
received the Queen’s consent, that does not mean that it has
their support. I live in hope, but as I said to my hon. Friend the

is often not clear how a Bill is stopped in its tracks. We know that
the House of Lords Reform Bill was stopped in its tracks not by dealing
with the issues of substance, but by a procedural device in relation to
the programme motion. It may well be that when a vote is called

respond in an intervention, I have made a note of them. I am conscious
of the ping-pong concern of my hon. Friend the Member for North East
Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg), which is an interesting point. It is
probably not an easy point to get around. Unless one were to bar former
peers from standing again for the House of Commons, which would remove
for life a right that every other non-peer in the nation has, I do not

the Member for Christchurch made that the non-attendance issue is

already have a leave of absence, and that does not cost anything, so
what does it matter?” Actually, the status of a peer who is on
leave of absence is a very grey area. They could be on leave of absence
for 10 years and then come back, so can they be replaced? What if we
ended up with half of all peers being on leave of absence? We could not
replace them with new working peers because we would not know if any of
them were ever going to come back. I understand his point, but
I  
<?notus-xml column=1057?>do not think that it is purely about presentation, because there are

a conviction in a foreign court should deprive a peer of the realm of
their place in the House of Lords. I do not think that it is as clear
cut as saying, “Let’s simply make it UK courts.”
It would be very difficult if a peer was convicted of an offence in
Australia and New Zealand, or somewhere that has a relatively
unimpeachable judicial system that compares to our own, and sentenced
to two years imprisonment, if that offence would warrant a two-year
sentence here. There would be no way to remove them, whereas they would
have been removed if they had been convicted and sentenced for the same
offence in the UK. Again, I am open to discussing whether the wording
in the Bill is exactly right and seeing whether there is a better way
of doing that. I am sensitive to people’s concerns about the
foreign courts issue and have heard them loud and

opinions on drug-driving. Ninety-six per cent. of respondents thought
that those who had taken illegal drugs should not drive.

the police to arrest and prosecute drug-drivers. Before the Act was
passed, in order to pursue a conviction for drug-driving, the police
had to show that the driver had been impaired—a requirement that
can be difficult to meet. The Act brought the legislation on

the road” is a phrase that rightly has no place in our more
safety-conscious society. Drug use is now openly part of our society,
but it is 
<?notus-xml column=1060?>more difficult to address the attitudes of drug-drivers. In a
drink-focused environment, we are aware of the designated
driver—usually the least cheerful looking person at the
party—and culturally we are conscious of that role, aware of
their responsibilities and we do not encourage them to drink. We know
that drink-driving is against the law and puts the driver, their
passengers and other road users at
risk.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000276" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000276">In
an environment where illegal substances are being used, a similar
collective understanding is not necessarily present. I therefore
welcome the fact that the 2013 Act reinforces in the popular awareness
the dangers of the use of banned substances while driving. The Bill
will similarly send out a clear message that drug-driving is
unacceptable. However, the prosecution of drug-drivers can overlook the
need to address their underlying problems. As a former special
constable, I have huge respect for the work that the police do and how
difficult their job is. I recognise from my personal experience that
dangerous patterns of behaviour by individuals result in repeat

turn someone’s life

we can work with the individual on wider psychological, physical or
lifestyle problems, as well as their substance misuse, we can help to
prevent further offending. Unless they appear in court, however, there
is no mechanism to direct drug-drivers towards the necessary health

misuse. That contrasts with the existing approach to require
assessments for other types of drug-related offending, such as theft or

for heroin, cocaine or crack cocaine can be compulsorily referred to a
drugs assessment if the arresting officer believes that would be
appropriate. In contrast, someone who is suspected of drug-driving
cannot be similarly required to attend an assessment of their
potentially harmful drug abuse. The Bill would tackle that gap in
legislation. It is about helping to break a cycle of behaviour and
doing more to ensure that those found driving under the influence of
class A drugs receive the appropriate help. By extending class A drug
intervention processes to drug-driving, we may be able to intervene at
an early stage and perhaps prevent an individual from committing

purpose of requiring them to attend an assessment for drug misuse. If
the sample tested positive for class A drugs—heroin, cocaine and
crack cocaine—the offender could be required to attend up to two
assessments with a drug worker. It is already an offence to refuse to
give a sample when required to do so. The purpose of the assessment is
to assess a person’s dependence on drugs or propensity to misuse
drugs and whether they might benefit from treatment or other support

section<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T13:54:33"></hs_TimeCode> 11A sets

careless driving when under the influence of drink or drugs, or driving

Analysis of the sample must have tested positive for a specified class
A drug—heroin, cocaine or crack cocaine. The person must also be

initial assessment, the police officer must also require that person to

section 11C sets out how the arrangements for attendance at initial and
follow-up assessments would be made. The notice of requirement must be

contain information about the time and place of the initial assessment,
the requirement to attend and remain at a follow-up assessment, and a
warning that a failure to attend or remain at the initial and follow-up
assessments without good cause means that the person is liable to
prosecution. New subsection 11C(3) would enable a police officer, or
other suitably qualified person, to give a person a further written
notice informing them of any change in the time or place of the initial
assessment, and repeat the warning that a failure to attend or remain
at the assessments without good cause means that the person is liable
to prosecution. New subsection 11C(4) would require the person to be

send the strongest possible message that you cannot take illegal drugs
and drive. We firmly believe this will also act as a strong deterrent
to those thinking about taking illegal drugs and thus have a positive
impact on road safety as well as potentially contributing to the
Government's overall drug strategy. A part of that strategy is to get
drug misusers into treatment and support services to enable them to
address their drug dependency. Being able to require drug drivers on
Class A drugs to attend a drug assessment will be a valuable
contribution to tackling drug misuse. Drug driving may be the first
offence of someone who could be at the beginning of a lifetime of
misery for them, their families and their communities, so tackling it

principle behind the Bill is in line with the previous
Government’s policy of referring people for drugs treatment in
the criminal justice system, which we did through the National
Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse, but the agency has now been
scrapped and funding is no longer ring-fenced. We will need to test
that. We also funded drug prevention and rehabilitation work directly
through community safety partnerships. So the principle behind the Bill
is sound—namely, that someone who is caught having a
drug-driving experience should be referred by the police for
treatment.</hs_Para>

Bill raises a number of questions, however. The Department for
Transport’s assessment estimates that about 8,800 additional
prosecutions a year could take place under the new drug-driving offence
in the Crime and Courts Act 2013, but
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T13:59:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Weaver Vale has said that we do not yet know which drugs are to be
included in the new offence. Similarly, the Department has not yet
published the regulations, following the public consultation on this
matter. I would therefore be interested to learn how police forces will
be expected to interpret the hon. Gentleman’s Bill, given that
we do not yet know the details of the legislation that has already been
passed.</hs_Para>

the Department eventually publishes the guidance and sets out the
boundaries for drug testing, we will need to be told who will fund the
drug assessments, who will employ the drug assessment workers, and what
assurances the Minister can give us that the necessary resources will
be made available to police forces to allow them to offer these
services. A police force such as West Midlands, for example, might have
a large number of health bodies in its area. How will the treatment
programmes be co-ordinated in such an area? What negotiations will take
place between the relevant bodies to ensure that that is done in a
positive way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:01:24"></hs_TimeCode>?
The Bill suggests that it will be for local areas to decide whether to
carry out and fund assessments. This is therefore an enabling Bill,
providing powers at national level, but it will not mean anything
unless local police forces and health bodies in England and Wales have
the resources, the capability and the willingness to implement
them.</hs_Para>

Minister of State, Home Department, the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman
Baker), will need to reflect on those matters, and I would like to know
his estimate of the costs involved. I have heard a figure of
£128 million a year. Is that a genuine figure? If so,
how have the Minister and his team arrived at that costing? Who will be
expected to pay for this, at a time when we have already seen a 20%
reduction in policing budgets? Like it or not, there are also now
greater freedoms in the

whom the Bill will presumably apply, could make their own judgment on
drug treatment in Wales.</hs_Para>

Today’s Bill is about treatment when people are caught through
drug testing, yet I know—I would be grateful if the Minister

offence in that Act are not yet specified, the limits for the drugs in
the body are not yet specified, the consultation by the Department for

has not yet, in my view, been sufficiently tested to ensure convictions
are possible even if the levels and the drugs were set.</hs_Para>

require those found to be drug-driving to be assessed by a qualified

appropriate specialised treatment for that individual to help them get

consultation period expired about a month ago, so we have not had a
Government response. When we get that response, we will know which
drugs will be the subject of the new regime of drug-driving. I
understand that they will include cannabis—certainly that was

main issues that was raised in my earlier private Member’s
Bills, and we know—these are figures from Brake, the road safety
charity—that in the United Kingdom 18% of people killed in road
crashes have traces of illegal drugs in their blood, and the main
substance found is cannabis. Yet the Bill before us would make no
provision at all in relation to cannabis, because it is confined to
class A drugs. As the right hon. Gentleman makes clear, the Bill does
not introduce the offence that everyone has been crying out to have
introduced for years. I want to put more pressure on the Government to
tell us exactly when they expect that provision to be on the statute

not come forward with a quick response. When we get that response,
draft regulations will be drawn up, and the Government’s own

necessary to get type approval of the testing equipment. At the moment,
despite years and years on this—I know, because when I
introduced my private Member’s Bill I got evidence from
companies in this country that produce that drug assessment equipment
and are marketing it in northern Europe and Australasia, where it is
being used, and other countries—a game is being played whereby
the Home Office is blocking progress, on the basis that it does not
have the right equipment, but it is delaying the implementation of the
type approval.</hs_Para>

the Member for Weaver Vale would come into action only when the police

not be able to get much out of a £100 assessment of somebody who
had been stopped at the roadside for suspected driving while impaired
by drugs. If the police used their discretion to refer the matter to
such an assessment, what would happen afterwards? That would be the
stage at which something needed to happen. If the assessment said,
“This is somebody who has a drug problem, and they need to go
and see a therapist and go for more expensive treatment to wean them
off”, that would create a fresh lot of costs. The financial
memorandum suggests that they are not regarded as costs directly

is that for a long time, there has been too much gesture politics on
the subject. Those of us who are genuinely concerned about road safety
would like to see section 5A of the 1988 Act, which is already part of
the statute law of the country, brought into effect. That means
deciding which drugs will be included in that Act and authorising the
equipment that will enable analysis to be carried

there is something to be said for putting pressure on the
Government—more pressure than he has so far—to respond to
these points. My understanding is that there has always been a strong
conflict between the desires of the Department for Transport, which I
had the privilege of serving in as a Minister, and the Home Office,
which is resisting taking such measures. If I am wrong about that, and
the Minister can give me a target date for full implementation of
section 5A, I will happily give way to him—if he is
listening.</hs_Para>

he does not wish to intervene to try to ensure reasonable cross-party
consensus shows that the Government are again playing games with the
House. They talk the talk; they say, “We want to outlaw
drug-driving” and they announced, with a fanfare, in the
Queen’s Speech before last that they would legislate on the
issue. The Prime Minister congratulated my hon. Friend the Member for
Croydon Central and met some of his constituents who had experienced
tragedy as a result of death by drug-driving. Today, the Minister has
the opportunity to tell us exactly when section 5A will come into
effect—legislation that was forecast and supported in 2010 in
the North report—but he is choosing not to; I do not know why.
Perhaps it is because, as a Home Office Minister who has been a
Transport Minister, he has, in a sense, a split personality on the
issue. His previous responsibility was to try to push such measures
through, but now that he is wearing his new hat as a Home Office
Minister, the idea is to give people the impression that something is
being done on the issue when we know that not very much is being
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000336" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000336">The

Bingham</B> (High Peak) (Con):</Member> When this debate was selected,
I received a telephone call asking whether it would be more appropriate
for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs or the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport to respond. It is all too easy
to consider rural businesses as either agricultural or tourism-based
and the main issue facing them as access to fast broadband. For High
Peak, which is one of the most beautiful constituencies in the country,
tourism is without doubt a very important industry. As the Federation
of Small Businesses survey found recently, 60% of rural businesses
reported that the problem of access to good quality broadband is
potentially holding them back, so I do not seek to minimise those
issues. But concentrating the debate on just two stereotypical
industries and one, albeit important, problem misses the point that the
rural economy operates in a diverse range of sectors, as I hope to
demonstrate throughout my
remarks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:33:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000372" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000372">The
value of England’s rural economy is about one fifth of the
national total. It can therefore make a substantial contribution to
restoring the economic strength of the whole nation and is as deserving
of support from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills as
any other area, so I am pleased to see the Minister of State,
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, my right hon. Friend
the Member for Sevenoaks (Michael
Fallon)<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:33:45"></hs_TimeCode> here and

me make a few points about the rural economy in general. It is worth
£211 billion a year. Although rural areas are home to just one
fifth of the English population, they support nearly a third of
England’s businesses—around half a million businesses.
Small and micro-businesses, of which I am very supportive, employ about
70% of employees in rural areas. So it is clear that we need to get the
conditions right for all these businesses to thrive. The Government
have been quick to recognise that there are real challenges facing our
rural communities and businesses. I wholeheartedly welcomed the
publication of the national rural proofing guidelines in July, which
sought to ensure that rural areas get a fair deal from all Government
Departments.

UK businesses have been through tough times, as we know, but the
situation is beginning to turn, largely as a result of the
Government’s efforts. Rural businesses, however, face additional
problems beyond those faced by others seeking to grow their businesses
and provide employment in metropolitan centres. For many years
now—for too long, some might say—the effort has been in
assisting the redevelopment of our inner cities. I admit that those
areas had been overlooked and deserved help, but not at the complete
exclusion of rural areas, which face similar issues and where it costs
more to deliver or access services.</hs_Para>

am pleased that the Government are taking action to restore the
balance, but the gap between rural and urban areas has remained at a
similar level since 2006. There have been indications of improvements
since the peak of the recession a few years ago, including fewer
redundancies and insolvencies in both rural and urban areas, but rural
businesses are still facing drops in confidence and
investment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000377" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000377">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:35:46"></hs_TimeCode>

depressing reading, however, is the fact that the figures are not
moving in the right direction as quickly in rural areas. In the
manufacturing, construction, finance and transport industries, rural
communities suffered more redundancies than their urban
counterparts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000378" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000378">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:36:08"></hs_TimeCode>

heart. I always make myself available to visit as many businesses as I
can when they ask me. I am a regular speaker at the business breakfasts
organised by the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire chamber of commerce. In
the town of Glossop, a lady called Kathy Ford runs the Glossop Business
Network, another organisation that pulls small businesses together to
discuss common issues. I visit GBN regularly to speak and, more
importantly, to listen to the concerns of small businesses. Having
listened to them and to other companies from metropolitan areas, there
is no doubt in my mind that there are differences in how businesses
operate depending on their
location.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000379" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000379">I
will talk briefly about
broadband<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:36:53"></hs_TimeCode>,
although this subject is about more than that. Broadband has become an
essential business tool. Without it, or with a slow and unreliable
connection, rural micro-businesses are at a competitive disadvantage
compared with urban businesses. I welcome the Government’s
investment in broadband, but for some in High Peak it cannot come soon
enough. As my constituent Mr Steve Otty, who runs his business, Hindlow
Technical, from just outside Buxton, has
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13101841000418" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000418">“Here’s

think that he makes a very good point. As I often say, broadband is now
the fourth utility for businesses. It is crucial in so many ways to
their futures.</hs_Para>

geography in rural areas can make hiring staff more challenging. Lack
of affordable housing means that many young people cannot remain in the
area where they grew up, which starves businesses of young employees to
train in their own way. Fewer than half of rural areas have access to a
bus service. With limited and scarce public transport, those same young
people who cannot drive or afford to run a car—many of us will
know how expensive that is for young people nowadays—cannot
access available work and employers cannot get the staff they
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000382" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000382">Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:38:09"></hs_TimeCode>
planning difficulties and the lack of affordable housing can also
affect the ability of businesses to expand. Swizzels Matlow is a
world-famous brand—many of us will know it—that makes
such sweet childhood memories as refreshers, drumsticks and love
hearts. Those of a certain age, like me, will remember having them in
their youth. They are loved the world over. Swizzels has been based in
New Mills in High Peak 
<?notus-xml column=1075?>since 1928 and is very much part of the fabric of the town. It is a
fantastic brand and it is looking to build and expand, but suitable
additional premises are hard to come by in rural areas. It would be so
easy for companies such as Swizzels to move into urban areas, which I
am sure would welcome it. It is to be commended for its loyalty both to
High Peak and to the people of New Mills, where it has been based for
over 80 years and where it wishes to
stay.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000383" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000383">I
do not want to paint a picture that is completely one of doom and
gloom. Nestlé, which markets the famous Buxton water, which I am
sure many of us have taken, has recently opened a new bottling and
warehousing facility at Waterswallows in Buxton. It implements the
latest thinking and best practice in environmentally friendly
buildings. It is a fantastic thing to behold. Some £35 million
has been invested to minimise the building’s environmental
impact, the operation’s running costs and the site’s
infrastructure and ecology.However, no matter how much investment firms
are able to make in their premises, poor roads, difficult transport
links, inadequate signposting and higher delivery costs add to the
geographical challenge faced by the businesses who provide these dearly
needed jobs in our rural
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000384" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000384">Because
of poor roads and increasing demand for travel, every day in my
constituency thousands of commuting cars meet heavy lorries, creating
severe traffic jams and pollution, particularly around the A57 and A628
trunk roads. They are ruining some stunning local landscapes and
shaking parts of the village of Tintwistle to their foundations. There
is also a knock-on effect whereby traffic is being sent through small
villages such as Charlesworth, creating further congestion and traffic
dangers. Any<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:40:06"></hs_TimeCode>
business man knows that delays cost money and impact on the viability
of any business. I have great concerns about this road issue, as the
Secretary of State for Transport is well aware. These horrendous
traffic problems will choke off the local economy if we do not address
them. I have first-hand evidence of a company in Glossop that tries to
meet its clients at Manchester airport because it does not want them
being delayed in trying to get into Glossop for important business
meetings. I am further concerned that such infrastructure issues will
deter other businesses from moving to High Peak and Glossop.</hs_Para>

subject of transport and access, we alight on fuel prices, which have
been discussed in this Chamber many times. I am pleased and proud that
the Chancellor has taken the steps that he has to cancel the various
duty rises that led to my constituency having higher fuel bills. One of
the main industries in High Peak is quarrying, and the stone has to be
transported. Quarries cannot be built next to the point of use; they
have to be where the stone is. Consequently, there is a huge road
haulage industry in High Peak which carries tonnes of high-quality
limestone around the country. As we know, that industry is facing ever
higher fuel bills.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101841000386" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000386">Businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:41:20"></hs_TimeCode>
that are not transport-related also suffer from high fuel costs. For
example, while I welcome the recommitment to the universal postal
service in all areas, businesses and residents in parts of my
constituency can face a 14-mile round trip to a post office, and people
may have to go 10 miles for a doctor or dentist. All those journeys
have to be made using their own 
<?notus-xml column=1076?>transport. As I have said before, in rural areas a car is not a luxury
but a necessity. Rural businesses have to pay for more travel and pay
higher prices for their fuel because it is sold at a premium because of
the cost of getting it to remote areas. Petrol is always dearer in High
Peak than it is here in London. The Government have recognised this
problem and, as we heard on the news today, they are acting in certain
areas, but regrettably not in High Peak. I understand the difficulties
to do with the European Union and fuel derogation. There is also the
problem of other fuel costs. Electricity prices are rising. We heard
the news about British Gas this morning. On some occasions in High Peak
we cannot even get gas, and further costs are incurred as a
result.</hs_Para>

mentioned the quarrying operations in High Peak. I would not describe a
big quarrying company as an SME, but I know from experience that such a
company involves a huge supply chain in its area. From my own business
experience, I know how that supply chain works. It supports a variety
of small businesses, micro-businesses and even sole traders, many of
which would like to be near that customer, because it may not be their
only customer but is certainly their most important. It is vital that
rural areas can get these big companies so that the benefit of their
presence can be felt across the rural economy. Their buying power goes
down through the economy through money spent in local retail areas and
the creation of jobs and, as I said, the supply chain. We are lucky in
High Peak—our limestone means that the quarries have to be
there—but like other areas we need to get other businesses that
are not as tied to natural features as the quarries.</hs_Para>

to return to the point I made earlier. This is not all about
agriculture and tourism. In High Peak we have a bewildering range of
businesses. I recently visited Selden Research, the UK’s largest
independent manufacturer of professional cleaning, maintenance and
hygiene chemicals. Based in Buxton, it has invested £250,000 in
solar energy to help power the factory. That investment follows a
£1 million investment in bulk raw-ingredient storage tanks to
minimise levels of in-bound raw material transportation and packaging
costs. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:43:51"></hs_TimeCode> have
high-tech and manufacturing businesses such as Pressure Tech in
Hadfield, which makes high-pressure regulators. It is the
highest-quality manufacturing that can be seen: precision stuff.
Peakdale Molecular in Chapel-en-le-Frith is a leading company in
pharmaceutical, biotechnical and diagnostic sciences. Next week I will
be visiting Glossop Cartons, which has invested thousands of pounds in
the world’s first production order for the Highcon Euclid
digital cutting and creasing machine, no less. I will not go into how
that machine works, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I am sure that if
the Minister would like to know I could explain it to him afterwards.

me begin by assuring my hon. Friend that stimulating economic growth is
the top priority for Government. We want to see rural areas
contributing to and benefitting from that growth across the country. We
have introduced a wide range of national policies to promote business
and deliver growth in both urban and rural areas, delivering new
infrastructure, raising skills levels and supporting business,
particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up a
significant element of the rural
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:47:06"></hs_TimeCode>. For
example, we are investing £150 million to improve
mobile coverage for up to 60,000 rural premises across the country that
currently cannot receive any signal. We are also taking a number of
other actions to support the rural economy, including improving
competitiveness and skills, investing in rural tourism and supporting
micro-enterprises<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:47:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000396" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000396">As
my hon. Friend said, we have established five pilot rural growth
networks aimed at tackling the barriers to economic growth in rural
areas, such as a shortage of work premises, slow internet connectivity
and fragmented business networks. These pilots expect to create up to
3,000 new jobs and support up to 700 new businesses, offering a local
approach to local problems. We will share the lessons that they learn
with other local enterprise partnerships and local authorities, to help
them promote growth in other rural

rural development programme, beginning next year, is a major
opportunity to continue to invest in rural growth and the environment.
We are working together with interested groups to design a programme
that will make a measurable contribution to improving the environment

hon. Friend referred to a couple of our programmes that provide grants
at a higher level, and he rightly identified the issue of getting that
financial support to businesses that may require only a much smaller
but important amount. In his constituency, the D2N2 local enterprise
partnership—the Derby, Derbyshire, Nottingham and
Nottinghamshire LEP—has recently awarded local crane
manufacturer Street Crane a £152,000 grant towards the
£1.5 million cost of building and equipping a new factory to
support export growth. This is good news in terms of creating new jobs
and developing skills, helping Street Crane to expand to new markets
and providing a boost for British
manufacturing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000399" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000399">Some
of the challenges that are faced by rural businesses are the same as
those that are faced in towns and cities. SMEs need to be able to
access effective business support and the finance they need to start
and to grow. There must be less red tape and better access to public
procurement. Although the location of a business is not always the key
factor, I recognise that rural areas may be affected disproportionately
by the issues that are faced by all SMEs in accessing business support.
It is important to ensure that the support for all businesses is
simpler, more joined up and easier to
access.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000400" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000400">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:50:18"></hs_TimeCode>

recognise the importance of being able to access finance. We have
therefore put in place a package of credit-easing measures to improve
the supply of affordable credit to SMEs. The funding for lending
scheme, which is by far the largest intervention, allows banks and
building societies to borrow at cheaper rates from the Bank of England
for periods of up to four years. That will significantly reduce the
cost of providing credit. The StartUp loans scheme is providing a
£117 million funding boost to enterprise. We have removed the
upper age cap and the scheme is now available to people of all ages
over 18. My hon. Friend might like to know that there have been 15
loans to his constituency so far, with a total value of £97,000.
The enterprise finance guarantee scheme continues to be an important
source of finance. Since May 2010, it has facilitated additional
lending of £1.3 billion to more than 12,700 businesses. Twenty
EFG loans have been offered in the High Peak constituency, to the value
of £1.26
million<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:51:51"></hs_TimeCode>. We know

hon. Friend raised some specific issues that affect rural communities.
I recognise that broadband connectivity is essential to the ability of
rural businesses to compete and contribute to our economic prosperity.
I am aware that there are concerns in the rural community about 
<?notus-xml column=1079?>the speed of connections. We are a world leader in the online economy
and are in the top three EU member states for broadband coverage,
take-up, usage and choice. However, more needs to be done to connect
rural businesses so that they can participate fully in the online
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000403" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000403">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:52:45"></hs_TimeCode>
Government, local authorities and the devolved Administrations are
investing more than £1 billion to extend the benefits of
broadband to rural areas of our country. Our projection is that we will
reach our original goal of 90% superfast coverage by early 2016. We
recently announced an additional £250 million of investment to
extend superfast coverage to 95% of premises by 2017. Together with the
industry, we are exploring how to expand coverage further, using more
innovative fixed wireless and mobile broadband solutions to reach at
least 99% of premises by
2018<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:53:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000404" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000404">Mobile
connectivity is increasingly important in providing rural broadband

conclusion of the 4G spectrum auction and nationwide 4G services are
now being rolled out. EE, O<Sub>2</Sub> and Vodafone are all committed
to rolling out 4G services to 98% of the population by 2014. Through
the mobile infrastructure project, the Government are providing
£150 million to provide masts covering so-called not spots. The
first mast went live last month. We have also streamlined the planning
laws, which should speed up the deployment of fixed and mobile
infrastructure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-18T14:54:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101841000405" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/debtext/131018-0002.htm#13101841000405">Transport
is also central to local economic development. We have announced our
intention to devolve funding for local major transport schemes in a way
that aligns with local enterprise partnerships. There should be a
smooth transition to the inclusion of that funding in the local growth

investments in local transport projects. 
<?notus-xml column=1080?>The D2N2 local enterprise partnership has a local transport board, which
is now looking at the delivery of major schemes across its area. We
want to see a greater local influence over the delivery of such
projects and, while funding will come to the D2N2 area from 2015, the
LTB has been set up now in order to agree a programme of schemes and
oversee their development and implementation. The D2N2 area has been

displaced people and infrastructure development, much more work is

139 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012,
which reforms the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. The essential
prerequisite for the commencement of the reforms is to put in place a
system for producing basic disclosure certificates, which show unspent
convictions, which reflects the new rehabilitation periods for England
and Wales. Until we 
<?notus-xml column=901?>do that there would be no way for an individual to obtain an official

basic disclosures reflecting the existing rehabilitation periods are
only available from Disclosure Scotland and this service is provided to
residents of England and Wales as well as Scotland. However, the
reforms to the 1974 Act only revise rehabilitation periods for England
and Wales, leaving the position in Scotland unchanged under its
legislation. This complicates matters and creates two different
rehabilitation regimes within the UK, which means that there are
significant business and technical issues to work
through.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101842000736" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131018/text/131018w0001.htm#13101842000736">The

amount of freight carried by ship and barge. Part of the role of the
Promotion Centre is to attend meetings of the European Commission
regarding short-sea and coastal shipping policy and the movement of

Varied length sanctions: A sanction of between one week and 26 weeks is
imposed for leaving employment voluntarily without just cause, refusing
employment without good cause, or losing employment through misconduct.
The actual period in each case is at the discretion of the adjudication
officer who makes the
decision.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">4.
Fixed length sanctions: A sanction of between one week and 26 weeks is
imposed for refusal, without good cause, to attend an employment
programme or carry out a jobseeker's direction. Payment of benefit
continues in full pending the adjudication officer's decision on a
sanction
question.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">5.
Entitlement decisions: These are questions on which entitlement to JSA
depends. For example, if there is doubt around whether the jobseeker's
agreement (JSAg) is suitable, whether they are actively looking for
work or making themselves available for work. In most cases payment of
JSA will be suspended by benefit processing until the doubt is
resolved.</hs_TableFooter>
