is a pleasure and an honour to present the Bill. Members may ask why I
have tabled this particular  Bill. It is because of my concern
about the need to reform the private rented sector so that it works for
all, not just the few who are currently abusing the system. That is
sorely needed for the following
reasons.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000063">In
England, there are now more than 9 million people, including more than
1 million families with children, renting privately. Those are two
truly amazing figures. I say at the outset that I believe the private
rented sector has an important role to play in meeting housing need.
Indeed, it is an essential ingredient in doing so. Yet today in
Britain, as a result of the biggest housing crisis in a generation,
more and more people are being locked out of home ownership because of
rising costs and are instead looking to find their home in the private
rented sector. They do that at a time when, as Members will know, the
housing crisis continues to worsen considerably. The situation is
caused by a number of factors, not least our growing population. So far
during this Parliament, home completions are at their lowest level
since the 1920s when Stanley Baldwin was in No. 10 Downing street and
King George V was sitting on the throne.</hs_Para>

approaching winter. Homelessness and rough sleeping are on the up, and
have risen by a third since the 2010 general election. I pay tribute to
many organisations such as Shelter, Framework, which is in my area, and
others who work tirelessly to ease the plight of people caught in that
situation. Needless to say, such organisations should be supported in
their important works, which cover a range of
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000065">As
the housing situation worsens, people continue to struggle deeply to
own their own properties, with average house prices now eight times
wage levels. It takes more than 20 years for low and middle-income
families with children to save enough for a deposit. Last but not
least, rents are ever rising in the private rented sector, and are now
moving to unaffordable levels, with many young people not even earning
enough to pay their rent.</hs_Para>

costing £247,000. For young people with families who need a 5%

them earn.</hs_Para>

the Government have recently stated that they do not intend to
introduce regulation in this sector, pointing to the use of myriad
ineffective consumer protection legislation which, as I will show, has
proved wholly inadequate at protecting either tenants or landlords. I
feel obliged to say that the Government have recently moved slightly in
that direction, after tabling an amendment to the Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Act 2013 that requires agents to sign up to a redress
scheme. The amendment was tabled following pressure from the Labour
Front Bench and the other place, particularly Baroness Hayter.
Nevertheless I welcome that U-turn, which as I said at the time must be
the first step and not

evidence of bad practice in this area. A report by Citizens Advice
found that 73% of tenants are dissatisfied with the service provided by
their letting agent, and reported that significant numbers of people
have difficulty contacting agents and suffer delays in getting repairs
to their property. Furthermore, a report by Which?, “Renting
roulette”, shows that, shockingly, letting agencies are ranked
second from bottom across 50 separate consumer markets. Indeed, there
are many cases of agencies, even large and well-established businesses,
running into difficulty because there is no client money protection,
with the money of landlords and tenants being lost. Scandalously, in
some instances that has not prevented the owners of companies which
have gone out of business while holding their clients’ money
from resuming their activities soon after the collapse, expressing a
“no blame, no shame” culture. No safeguards are currently
in place to protect tenants, landlords or reputable agents from being

understand the scale of the problem on the high street we should
consider the figures. It is estimated that in England alone there are
more than 4,000 managing and letting agents who are entirely
unregulated. It is still possible to set up a letting or management
agency with no qualifications whatsoever. There is no need for them to
conform to any requirements as to their conduct, or to provide
mandatory safeguards for their customers, as no such formula or
regulations exist. In other words, letting agents operate in the
property market’s “wild west”, as the Royal

that local authorities will carry out repairs “unless”. I

references ranged from £10 to £275, while charges for
renewing a tenancy ranged from £12 to £220. In
some cases, charges for a tenancy amounted  to more than
£600. According to Which?, some tenants are being charged up to
£90 to renew a tenancy and up to £120 simply to check out
the property. That is an incredible cost for people to pay; by and

too many Members have heard time and again in their surgeries that
there is a problem with rogue landlords and poor standards. It is true
that the majority of private landlords are responsible
people who treat their tenants very well, but it is also true that
there are too many rogue landlords who undermine responsible behaviour
and prey on vulnerable tenants. This is a small but dangerous minority
of rogue landlords who, frankly, make people’s lives an absolute
misery. They are condemning their tenants—who are, after all,
our constituents, and we were elected to come here and serve
them—to live in run-down, unsafe and often greatly overcrowded
properties. What is more, they regularly intimidate those who speak
out, and regularly threaten them with eviction.</hs_Para>

case of the 11 young models described in this week’s <I>Evening

the problem is not just one of criminal landlords, because a large
number of amateur landlords can cause similar problems. They may have
purchased a cheap property, inherited a property or secured one by
other means. They may often be well-meaning people, but they are
unaware of their rights and responsibilities in letting out a property
as a home for another person. A recently published case illustrates the
severity of this particular problem. A young mother of two, just
33 years of age, had realised her dream of moving to a
private rented home in Cornwall. Six days later, she was found dead by
her young daughter. She had been electrocuted because of a faulty
heater—a very serious situation. Faulty wiring was responsible;
that wiring had not been checked for 32 years! An amateur landlord

Bill proposes a mandatory national register of private landlords. This
should be a light-touch register requiring all private landlords to
sign up. It would be in contrast to a licence-based approach and it
would as a rule reveal that the vast majority of landlords were able to
offer a good service to their tenants. The Minister will be pleased to

would assist and improve private renting in two particular ways. It
would assist local authorities in managing the housing market in their
areas and offer greater transparency and information that would enable
them to target enforcement action in the places most in need of it.
Another advantage is that the register would enable the Government and
local authorities to communicate with the majority of well-meaning
amateur landlords. As I have said, many of those landlords are not
aware of their rights and responsibilities and would welcome such
communication. Indeed, many have said that they would welcome this new
information, welcome some kind of mechanism to advise them and welcome
greater liaison with the local authorities in their area.</hs_Para>

Bill is designed to grant local authorities greater freedom to
introduce local licensing schemes where they deem that they might
improve the housing market and, of course, reduce the particular
problem of antisocial behaviour in their areas. Such changes would

Newham, Oxford, Blackpool and now Liverpool, which are already using

of the Bill and the need for it are very clear indeed. The private
rented sector has, and will continue to have, an important role to play
in meeting housing need, but it should not be based on the current
terms. With 9 million people, including over 1 million families with

hon. Member for Mansfield on presenting the Bill. As he knows, I am a
great admirer of his: in fact, I might even be so bold as to consider
him a friend of mine. He may not see it in those terms, but I certainly
do. He is a good man, and he has a long track record of bringing
important issues to the House and representing his constituents in
Mansfield to great effect. I have absolutely no doubt about the
sincerity of his case, and I commend him for that. We tend to agree on
matters relating to horse racing, and perhaps we would have been better
off sticking to that subject today—we could have secured
cross-party agreement—but the hon. Gentleman knows as well as I
do that when we leave the subject of horse racing our views tend to
diverge, quite widely on occasion, and this, I am afraid, is one of
those occasions. He will also know, however, that my opposition to the
Bill is not directed at him personally, and that my admiration for him
has not been diminished by the fact that I happen to disagree with him

yesterday. It has been very difficult for some of us to understand all
its complexities, given that we have been allowed such a short period
before being invited to analyse and scrutinise it, although I am sure
that if I have misunderstood any aspects of it,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-25T10:14:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Mansfield will pull me up. Moreover, I am not aware of the
existence of any explanatory notes. The hon. Gentleman may say that
none are needed because the Bill is self-explanatory, but I feel that
some explanation of the Estate Agents Act 1979, and other related
legislation covered by the Bill, might have helped. It might be handy
in future for Bills to be accompanied by some form of briefing for
Members to read beforehand. That would enable us to know exactly where

Indeed, we approached the Department for Communities 
<?notus-xml column=565?>and Local Government itself to establish whether it felt able to accept
any of the proposals in the Bill. As the hon. Gentleman knows, a Bill
should be printed up to two days before a debate on it takes place, but
there was never any thought of our trying to keep this Bill secret from

given such a short time in which to look at the detail beforehand. I
know the hon. Gentleman well, and I knew that there would be a good

seems to be some kind of dispute among us about the amount of
legislation and regulation that currently applies to the private rented

and I thought I even heard him use the term “wild west”.
However, what concerns me is not a wild-west-style lack of regulation
in the sector, but the possibility that there is too much regulation.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-25T10:16:58"></hs_TimeCode>According to
industry experts, there may well be more than 100 pieces of legislation
and more than 400 regulations governing the private rented sector. I
think that would sound like an awful lot of legislation to most people,

want to control and regulate everything, I am not entirely sure that
this extra piece of legislation is likely to satisfy them
either.</hs_Para>

problem is that the left in politics always want to regulate something.
They always want to interfere in something. They cannot help
themselves: it is their natural state of being. They will not be happy
until everything is regulated, or, in some cases, strangled to death,
if they do not much like the industry concerned. I wonder why on earth,
in 2013, we suddenly need a national register of landlords and the
regulation of letting agents. This sector has been going strong for
years, and we do not seem to have encountered massive problems. I
understand the points that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-25T10:18:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

to crack a nut. The hon. Gentleman himself said at the end of his

were causing a problem. It strikes me as bizarre to assume that the
best way of tackling a very small number of people who, in the hon.

regulation on everyone, regardless of whether—even in his

hon. Gentleman to the numbers involved. In England alone, there are
4,000 unregistered letting agents, and a huge number of people have
expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment  
<?notus-xml column=566?>that they have received. The hon. Gentleman should note all the comments
that have been made by organisations such as Which? and Shelter. We may
be talking about a minority, but it is a

respect in which I have a lot of sympathy with the hon. Member for
Mansfield, and that is on his point about antisocial behaviour; he is
on to something there. Again, this is from personal
experience—from speaking to people in my constituency, including
those who come to see me at my surgery. Getting antisocial behaviour
dealt with by a social housing provider may well be a
far-too-long—incredibly long—and tortuous process, but I
have evidence to suggest that social housing providers take the issue
seriously, as do the local police. In my constituency, there has been
some terrible antisocial behaviour by tenants in the private rented
sector, but the problem is that as long as a tenant pays the rent and
keeps the house in a decent manner, the landlord, who may live in
another part of the country, or a different country, is not really that
bothered about the tenant’s antisocial behaviour in the local
community. There is an issue about landlords’ responsibility for
dealing with their tenants’ antisocial behaviour, and for
helping the local community by being inclined to help have tenants
evicted, if there is evidence to suggest that they are causing a
menace.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000129"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jacob Rees-Mogg" PimsId="5628" UID="13102537000658" xid="1186" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000658">Jacob

If private sector landlords are minded to evict a tenant, it is easier
for them to do so; he is right. Perhaps he has put his finger on what
would help social 
<?notus-xml column=569?>housing providers to evict problem tenants quicker: less regulation,
rather than more regulation. The situation that I am referring
to—I do not know whether the hon. Member for Mansfield has this
in mind—is one where the private landlord has no interest in
evicting the person causing the problem, because that person is paying
the rent on time and is not causing havoc in the house. The landlord is
quite happy; why would they go through the hassle of trying to find a
new tenant to replace someone from whom they are getting a steady

end up as light touch. They always end up with some empire building and
more and more costs being added. At the end of the day, the landlord

a landlord is expected to pay a fee—in many cases, my cynicism

There has to be some benefit for them in signing up, and the best way
to ensure that is to make signing up a free choice, not to mandate
people to do it. The only effect it will have on landlords is to ensure
that they have the additional task of renewing their registration every
year and that they pay for it out of their own pockets. As my hon.
Friend so wisely suggested, this is no more than a tax. It is a tax for
letting out one’s house for others to live in. I am not 
<?notus-xml column=575?>sure whether that qualifies it to be called a bedroom tax, but given
that most people who live in these houses will be occupying a bedroom,
and given that the cost is likely to be passed on to them, we can
safely say that this is the Labour party’s attempt to impose a
bedroom tax on the public. It introduced the spare room subsidy when it

Davies:</Member></B> I do not doubt the hon. Gentleman’s
intention; I just do not see how the Bill would work like that. The
problem with the Labour party generally is that they think people live
their lives in a particular way and that no matter what it throws at
them, they will continue to live in exactly the same way and just pay
the levies and taxes and burdens that it imposes on them. The real
world does not work like that. There is no doubt that if the renting
out of property becomes too onerous and too expensive, a considerable
number of people will leave the market. They just will not bother being
involved in the private rented sector. I can say with some considerable
certainty that that will lead not to a reduction in rents in places
such as London, but to an increase in rents, because there will be
fewer rental properties to go round. That is the great flaw in this
socialist ideal of imposing extra regulation and charges on people.
People will not stand there and take them. They will change their
circumstances so as not to be bogged down by them all. There is
absolutely no doubt that if the scenario envisaged by the hon.
Gentleman in his Bill were to be put in place, it would lead only to a
reduction in the number of private sector landlords. That can only
drive up rents, and will probably drive up property prices as well, as
those who are involved feel that they can get a better return on their
investment. That would be not only what I would call an unintended
consequence of what the hon. Gentleman seeks to achieve, but a
certainty.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000172">Another
point to bear in mind is that landlords come in many guises. Often they
own only one property or a small number of them. Sometimes they are
accidental landlords, as I am, who either inherited properties or were

pension provision. They are not all big commercial landlords making

made during the course of the 20th century to stimulate the

which introduced regulated tenancies; and through the Housing Act 1988,
which deregulated rents on new lettings after 15 January 1989. Those
measures were all designed to encourage investment in the private
rented sector by increasing potential returns from rental income. That

rented sector, which is one of the rationales behind the Bill, but
given the enormous explosion in the number of people in the private
rented sector over the past 15 years—from around 2 million in
1999 to 3.843 million in 2011-12—is it any wonder there has been
an increase in the number of
complaints?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000182"><B><Member ContinuationText="Philip Davies" PimsId="4767" UID="13102537000691" xid="887" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000691">Philip

that the larger the sector, the more complaints will be generated. I

bad.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000183">A
2010 survey that looked at the number and type of people who are
private landlords found that 89% were private individual landlords, 5%
were company landlords and 6% were other organisation landlords. Those
landlords were responsible for 71%, 15% and 14% respectively of all
dwellings in the private rented sector. More than three
quarters—78%—of all landlords owned only a single
dwelling for rent, comprising 40% of the total private rented housing
stock. It found that 22% of those landlords had let properties for
three years or less, and two thirds—69%—had let
properties for less than 10 years. Almost four fifths of all
landlords in the sector earned less than a quarter of their income from
letting properties in the private rented sector, and only 8% were

Alan Meale:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman will have heard me talk
specifically about amateur landlords in the way that he describes them.
The organisations that some amateur landlords are involved in greatly
support the Bill because it would give them the opportunity to learn
more. They are not in it for the short-term grab of a large profit;
they want the long-term return. Like him, they may have ended up being
landlords through inheritance or whatever. They are not inherently bad
people, but very good people. The Bill is to protect them and the
long-term return on their capital. Regulation is not bad, but
good—it brings properties up to the marker and stops rogue
landlords from giving the others a bad
name.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000188"><B><Member ContinuationText="Philip Davies" PimsId="4767" UID="13102537000693" xid="887" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000693">Philip
Davies:</Member></B> I am pleased that we agree on the main
thrust—that the vast majority in the sector are good people
trying to do the right thing, with no intention of being bad to their
tenants. That is where I am coming from, and I am delighted that it is
where the hon. Gentleman is coming from as well. We differ on the best
way to help those people do what they are doing. I do not think that
piling on extra regulation and cost is the way. He does. That is our
genuine disagreement.</hs_Para>

consequences of such regulation would be terrible for some of those
landlords. The good people, to whom the hon. Gentleman referred, might
well have to sell their properties because they cannot afford the extra
costs and regulation—perhaps to one of the unscrupulous
landlords whom he is trying to stamp out. That would be another
terrible unintended consequence of what he is trying to do. The
good people are probably, by definition, not making as big a return as
those who are not so good. Such a transfer of property would not be to
the hon. Gentleman’s or the tenant’s
advantage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000190">In
February this year, the Office of Fair Trading concluded that the
demand for rental properties was increasing. In 2010-11, the lettings
market accounted for 16.5% of all housing in England, which equates to
3.6 million households. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bury North
mentioned, that represents an increase from 2 million in
1999.</hs_Para>

figures suggest that the number of households in England will grow by
an average of 232,000 a year until 2033. There is also a general trend
of increasing rental in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Meanwhile, mortgage lending has decreased following the financial
crisis, so demand for properties to let may be outstripping supply.
That is why it is essential that we do nothing that could lead to a
reduction in the supply of private rented accommodation—all that
will do is stop people having their own homes to live
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000192">The

range of powers to tackle the problems associated with criminal
landlords. Those powers were enhanced by the Localism Act
2011.</hs_Para>

other relevant legislation. The Housing Act 2004 allows for a housing
health and safety rating system, an evidence-based system used to

of the 2004 Act, local authorities have a duty to take enforcement
action to secure necessary improvements where those serious hazards are
present. They also have the discretionary power to intervene where less
serious category 2 hazards are present. To determine the most
appropriate form of action, local authorities can consider the extent
of the vulnerability of the persons in the accommodation.</hs_Para>

authority can carry out an assessment of the home and look at the
likelihood of an incident arising from the condition of the property
and what the harmful outcomes may be. That seems an incredibly useful
tool for what the hon. Gentleman refers to as “dealing with
rogue landlords.” There is mandatory licensing of houses in
multiple occupation. There is already a statutory duty on local
authorities to license larger, higher-risk houses in multiple
occupation of three or more storeys housing five or more unrelated
persons.</hs_Para>

Letting or  
<?notus-xml column=580?>managing a property without a licence is a criminal offence subject to a
maximum fine of £20,000. There is also the additional licensing
of houses in multiple occupation. Poor conditions and bad management
practices can be dealt with by local authorities, which can introduce
schemes subject to local consultation. There is also selective
licensing—a discretionary power to license all privately rented
properties in a designated area deemed to suffer from low housing
demand and/or significant and persistent antisocial
behaviour.</hs_Para>

local authorities are required to provide a robust evidence base for
introducing a scheme, and once they have introduced it they have
substantial powers. There are special interim management orders to take
over the management of individual privately rented properties that give
rise to significant problems if landlords do not take action
themselves. Local authorities can require approval from a residential
property tribunal to do that, but the power is there if there are
terrible landlords. There are planning contravention notices for when
there may have been a breach of planning control. There are temporary
stop notices, enforcement notices, stop notices, breach of conditions
notices and injunctions that can be obtained from the High Court to
restrain any breach. There are also powers of entry and article 4
directions. The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 can be utilised if landlords
have been using proceeds of crime in relation to local housing, and it
allows specific financial investigation powers for the public sector.
Lots of assets have been recovered from people using that
tool.</hs_Para>

help to deal with what the hon. Gentleman would call rogue landlords

should be commended for its document, which gave people a very clear
guide as to exactly what powers local authorities have. Perhaps local
authorities have been unaware of what powers they have to deal with
rogue landlords in the private sector. A better starting point than
more legislation might be to ensure that local authorities are using
the powers they already have in existing legislation to deal with the
issues that he is trying to deal with.</hs_Para>

post? Would the role be advertised to the general public? Would it be a
Government appointment? Would the landlords themselves, who were paying
into this scheme, be able to appoint the person they wanted to run it?

previous Government consulted on this suggestion and reported back in
early 2010, the main concerns were listed in the consultation document
that contained all the responses. Those concerns were valid then and
are still valid now. The first main concern was that a better
understanding was needed of likely costs. In particular, it was thought
that linking other services to the register would increase costs, and
it was suggested that they should be deferred until the register was up
and running smoothly. Given that the Bill makes no mention of what the
costs would be, that uncertainty will still be a factor that people are
concerned about.</hs_Para>

main concern was the objective of the register; there was a lack of
common understanding of its purpose. It was not clear whether it was a
comprehensive list of private rented properties and landlords or an
attempt to enforce better behaviour. The same doubts still apply today.

scenario, more red tape, more regulation and less return for an
investment may lead to foreign landlords going to other parts of the

would a landlord pay? Does the hon. Member for Mansfield envisage a
landlord paying his money out on a pro rata basis? Would it be based on

cross-purposes. I am not referring to a person who decides to
immediately rent out a house in which a deceased parent used to live. I
totally accept the hon. Gentleman’s point about that. It is
self-evident. I am referring to a person whose parent was a landlord of
another property that the child inherits on their death and in which a
tenant is already in place. If the landlord of the property is the
person who must be registered, I do not know how people who have just
died would get off the register. They can’t say,
“I’ve just died,” to get themselves off it. How on
earth could their child be expected to know that they had to register
when they have never been involved in renting out properties before?
They would find themselves, at an instant, the landlord of a property
without knowing the circumstances involved. That is the sort of
situation to which I am referring, which I think the hon. Gentleman
would accept is slightly different from his
suggestion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000234"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andy Sawford" PimsId="6000" UID="13102537000706" xid="1241" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000706">Andy
Sawford:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his clarification.
I understand that he is making a slightly different point. Of course,
many responsibilities fall to someone on losing a loved one and they
can be very important, including thinking about the obligations they
owe to people living in a rented property that they have inherited. The
well-being of the tenants has to be their concern, even in a very
difficult
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000235"><B><Member ContinuationText="Philip Davies" PimsId="4767" UID="13102537000707" xid="887" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000707">Philip
Davies:</Member></B> Of course. The shadow Minister states the
blindingly obvious. Who is to say, however, whether that person would
have any ill will towards the people 
<?notus-xml column=585?>renting the property? Presumably, they would just carry on with the
arrangements already in place, but without registering on a national
register of
landlords.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000236" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000236">This
is the difference between Government Members and the Opposition: they
think that not registering on a state-sponsored register makes someone
a bad landlord, but I do not accept that premise. I think that what
makes someone a good landlord is whether they are treating their tenant
well, irrespective of whether they are on a register. It is how they
look after their tenant that determines whether they are a good
landlord. Someone who is not on a register might be a very good
landlord, but, equally, someone who is on the register might be a very
bad landlord. The hon. Gentleman seems to be under the impression that
being on the register would determine whether someone is a good
landlord, but I am afraid I do not share that view. The hon. Gentleman
seems to support a Bill that would criminalise people who had no idea
about the obligation being thrust on them by the socialists opposite.
We have to be careful about introducing legislation left, right and
centre—in this case, left—and we must remind ourselves
that laws have consequences. A criminal sanction is serious. We do not
want decent people falling foul of the law by accident and receiving a
criminal conviction. As I mentioned earlier, four-fifths of private
landlords are part-time landlords, with just one or a small number of
properties from which they earn less than a quarter of their income. We
should tread carefully.</hs_Para>

the last Government consulted on regulating letting agents, many
concerns were raised about how a letting and management agent would be

landlords manage properties for other landlords. Sometimes family
members manage properties. Those people are not official letting
agents, but they are, in effect, operating as letting and managing
agents. Would they be covered by this regulation? Would the consequence
of the Bill be to send some of that work underground? People might not
employ a professional body or registered company, but get other people
to do these things under the radar. They might get friends from around
the corner—perhaps even unsavoury people from around the

time that other Members wish to use, and I am sure others have better

is full of more bureaucracy and more interference by politicians, and
it provides more evidence of the need to be seen to be doing something,
which is the prevailing culture in politics at the moment. I always say
that if a politician is faced with a problem, their solution will
always incorporate two ingredients, the first of which is being seen to
be doing something. I long for the day

second part of a politician’s solution when faced with a problem
is to do something that does not seem to cause offence to anybody. The
Bill falls in that category—it would make it look as though we
were doing something, and it would not really offend any of our
constituents. It is a naked attempt to please people. At Prayers, I am
always struck by the fact that we pray that we will not do things
through a desire for power or a desire to please, which tend to be the
two traps that politicians most often fall into. I fear that the Bill
shows a desire to please. It is full of good intentions but would not

I said at the beginning, by force of accident I am both a landlord and
a tenant, and I use a managing agent. As a customer I am quite capable

There is plenty of evidence that there is already an abundance of
remedies and laws to protect tenants from rogue landlords and landlords
from rogue managing agents. I do not doubt that rogue landlords and
managing agents exist—they clearly do, and that is not in
dispute. What is in dispute is whether the Bill will help or hinder

practical issues could affect the workings of the Bill’s

about the fact that some properties and landlords are already part of a

working well to make them part of the one in the Bill, or would we
allow them to stay part of their voluntary scheme? There are all sorts
of practical problems with the Bill, which would make people criminals

because my hon. Friend the Member for Mansfield powerfully set out the
case, this country faces the biggest housing crisis in a generation. We
have a rapidly growing private rented sector—we have heard some

too many people lack security and have to pay ever increasing rents

of the growing housing crisis, more and more people are locked out of
home ownership and living in the private rented sector, which is now
bigger than the social sector. Last year, the private rented sector
overtook the social rented sector for the first time in nearly half a
century. Private renting is not just an issue for young professionals,
as is sometimes thought, and there are now 3.6 million households in
the private rented sector, including more than 1 million families with
children. At a time when home ownership is falling, people are faced
with record rents, and nearly 5 million people are on local authority
waiting lists. Young people are waiting until their 30s before they can
buy their own

out a series of measures that I believe will tackle the issues faced by
private renters. It seeks to regulate residential lettings and managing
agents, protecting tenants, landlords and the reputations of many
responsible agents. It would end the confusing, inconsistent fees and
charges regime, making fees easier to understand upfront and comparable
across agents. It seeks to introduce a national register of landlords,
to empower local authorities to improve standards and deal with rogue
landlords, and to make written tenancy agreements mandatory. I will
speak first briefly about the character of the private rented sector
and landlords, and the role of letting agents, and I will then set out
why I believe the measures in the Bill are to be welcomed and should be

in some way to this sector, providing some form of protection. As I
said at the outset, however, I fully agree with my hon. Friend the

provide better regulation. We should not be confused by the

agents and reported that a significant number of people have
difficulties contacting agents and saw serious delays in getting

of agencies, even large and well-established businesses, running into
difficulties because they have no client money protection, with both

whatever. There is no need to conform to requirements as to conduct or
to provide mandatory safeguards for the consumer, and the Government

me now deal with the issue of rip-off fees and variable charges, which
have rightly been highlighted and which I hope the Bill will do
something to address. A survey of letting agents found that 94% imposed
charges on tenants in addition to the tenancy deposit and rent, or rent
in advance. It also found a huge variation in the size of the charges.
The charge for checking references ranged from £10 to
£275. The charge for renewing a tenancy ranged from £12
to £220. In some cases, additional charges for a tenancy
amounted to more than
£600.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000285" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000285">According

holding deposit was one week’s rent amounting to £400,
the average administration fee was between £120 and £420,

deposit could be anything between one month’s and six
weeks’ rent. On average, one month’s rent was payable in
advance. Credit 
<?notus-xml column=593?>reference checks were charged at between £43 and £90, and
check-in fees were up to £60. That is a huge variation. How can
it be justifiable for one letting agent to charge £220 to check
references, when another can do it for £10? Surely that should
not be presented as a separate fee. Other countries, even including
Scotland, provide much clearer protections and stronger regulation to
deal with such variable and unfair

support the laissez-faire attitude that has been advocated by the hon.

are three principal areas of concern when it comes to rip-off fees and
charges levied by unscrupulous letting agencies. As I have said, there
is a substantial disparity between the fees charged by different agents
for similar services, with no apparent difference in the quality of the
services received. I have challenged organisations, even those that
seek to extol good practice in the sector, to justify the charging of
such variable fees by their members, and they have been unable to
provide any such justification. That is why an increasing number of

months for which the Prime Minister has been in office—it is a
huge ask, and often very difficult, for families to meet such costs.
Too often, the charges are hidden in the small print. People are
exploited by unfair fees that they were unaware that they would face.
Letting agents should be required to publish information about their

course there are many responsible landlords, and many of them are
members of the organisations that have been mentioned today. I have
interacted with those organisations, and I know that they seek to do a
good job in ensuring that standards are met. They are aware that trying
to ensure that tenants in the private rented sector are treated fairly
is not only morally right, but good business. It must be acknowledged,
however, that there are also many rogue landlords out there, and that
they undermine responsible landlords by preying on vulnerable tenants.
The reputation of the many responsible landlords and the good service
that they provide are undermined by a large number of landlords who
fail to offer good standards to their tenants, and by a small number of
criminal landlords who deliberately prey on the vulnerable and exploit
the current lack of proper, fair, effective

him to take up with them the loss of 5,000 police officers and the huge
loss of resources our Crown Prosecution Service is facing, which means
that many cases, even those taken up by the police, are not referred to
it. I would also urge him to look at the consequences of the massive
and unfair cuts to local authorities, particularly those with the
highest number of people who are being treated unfairly by
landlords in the private rented sector. Their cut has been
disproportionately large, and that affects their ability to seek to
intervene where landlords are behaving unfairly locally. Local
authorities have some responsibility for trading standards, too, which
are being decimated, as local authorities find they can only sustain
statutory responsibilities. If the hon. Gentleman wants to support me,
I will gladly work with him and perhaps we can form a cross-party

that they had sought to address the problems, but—this is one of
the sad consequences of the right to buy—all the houses in the
square were now privately rented. It was very difficult for them to
find out who the landlords were and contact them. Unfortunately, the
tenants in those houses, many of whom were migrant workers, were being
exploited. The local authority felt powerless, and so did I, as a

advice is available to them. That way, the local authority can keep in
touch with them. That could be about such simple things as measures to

measures—on more extensive regulation for letting and management
agencies in clause 2; on the transparency of the fees of
private sector letting agents and managing agents in clause 3; on the
very important requirement for written tenancy agreements in clause 4;
on the designation of selective licensing schemes in clause 5; on
consultation, which is also very important, in clause 6; and the
thoughtful clauses on financial provisions, orders and regulations,
offences and interpretation—have been well thought through. Of
course, as always, they would benefit from further consideration and
exploration in Committee.</hs_Para>

am fundamentally opposed to the Bill, which moves in entirely the wrong
direction. I want to go back to first principles: the Bill is an attack
on the rights of property and on the free market, and it introduces a
new tax on landlords and regulation in a market that is working
reasonably well—a very important market to which Government
intervention has been very damaging, as the figures show.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Shipley pointed out that at the time of the first
world war 90% of housing was in the private rented sector, and that
this percentage fell until assured short-term tenancies were brought
in, at which point the market revived. There were also slum clearances,
the development of social housing, and the enormously welcome right to
buy, particularly encouraged by previous Conservative Governments,
which extended home ownership to millions—an enormously
beneficial development. Of course all those things happened. At the
same time, what bore down on the private rented sector was the
excessive regulation, particularly the control of rents in an
inflationary era, with the result that people simply left the market
when their properties became vacant. The stock available for private
renting diminished and would have gone down further had it not been for
the assured
shortholds.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000315" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0001.htm#13102537000315">Assured
shortholds revitalised a market in a free-market manner that has
brought supply back, so in Great Britain—I say Great Britain
very carefully, rather than the United Kingdom or England, both of
which were referred to earlier—the figures went from 1.9 million
in 1988 to 4.6 million in 2011. That revitalisation is important
because the private rented sector is the most flexible element of the
housing market when it works properly. If we are to have an economy
where people are free to move, and free to go around the country to
find employment or to better their opportunities, there needs to be a
supply of housing that is easy for them to find, easy for them to move
into, and fundamentally flexible.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102537000316" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000316">It is
striking that the highest percentage of people in the private rented
sector is in London. The reason it is in London is that, excluding
Somerset, London is the most dynamic part of the UK economy. It
attracts an enormous number of international visitors and makes it
possible for them to come, but it also attracts an 
<?notus-xml column=598?>enormous number of our fellow countrymen, who find London an attractive
place in which to live and work. The Dick Whittington view of
London—that the streets are paved with gold—has
historically drawn people to the metropolis, and that requires flexible
private rented capacity.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102537000317" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000317">Why is that
better, more flexible, than social housing? The reason is that social
housing is limited in its number. If people move around the
country—if someone moves from Somerset to London and gives up
their social housing in Somerset—they have permanently given up
something that they may never again be able to get back into. Social
housing is, therefore, an enormous encourager of the status quo. It
encourages people to stay where they started, where they got on to the
housing ladder.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102537000318" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000318">The same is
true of controlled rents. Once people are in a property with a
controlled rent, or one that is heavily regulated, they know that if
they give it up they will never be in so beneficial a situation again.
They have, therefore, less incentive to move to find employment or to
increase their prosperity, and, given the way in which the law is
devised, that is also often the case for any dependent
children—or certainly one child—because they may be able
to take on a low-priced tenancy, which discourages economic
activity.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102537000319" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000319">The
flexibility of the private rented sector allows people to move and it
allows economic activity to go where it is best needed; it allows
people to move where the jobs are. That has been essential to the way
in which the economy has gone since the late 1980s, and the private
rented sector has been transformed by the huge number of accidental or
amateur landlords that have been discussed. That is a very good thing.
The idea that people can buy a property, let it out, involve themselves
in the capitalist system, and effectively develop a pension for
themselves by contributing to the private rented sector, is good both
for the landlords and for the tenants. I happen to think that those
accidental landlords are likely to be particularly good ones because
their properties are the main source of their potential future income,
so they have a deeper interest in the properties that they are letting
out than almost anyone else is likely to have.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102537000320" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000320">If I were to
rent a property, I can think of nothing finer than to rent it off my
hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies), who, I imagine,
would be a first-class landlord, and attentive if ever there was a
problem with the bath overflowing, a dripping tap or the gas going off.
I would have a service that was second to none. That applies to
thousands, tens, probably hundreds of thousands, of individual
landlords throughout the country, to whom their one property is their
real nest egg. We heard from my hon. Friends the large number, as a
percentage of the total property available, of people in exactly that
category.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000321" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000321">That
interest that such people have means that, by and large, they are
likely to be good landlords. The shadow Minister referred to being a
good landlord being both morally right and good business sense, and I
agree entirely. It was a fine point to make. It was almost a high point
of his speech, marginally beaten by the idea that Governments should
regulate less but more effectively.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102537000322" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000322">The reason
that it is both morally right and good business sense, and that it
should be left to the market, is that if a landlord, a group of
landlords or a letting 
<?notus-xml column=599?>agency have a good reputation, that is something they can advertise.
They can have kitemarks. We have already discussed the associations
that exist that will be able to say that a landlord comes up to certain
standards and is signed up to the property ombudsman, so tenants know
that if they go to a certain letting agent or landlord they will be
likely to live in a better quality of property. That helps the
landlord, because they would probably be able to get a better price,
which makes good business sense. It makes good moral sense, because we
all want people to live in high-quality accommodation. It is also good
for the prospective tenant, who will be assured that not only is a
quality property available, but that it will be managed in a reasonable
way and with a form of appeal to the property
ombudsman.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000323" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000323">That
is the laissez-faire approach. I approve of laissez-faire; it is a good
economic approach. The governmental approach is that everything should
be centrally controlled; that it should be uniform, die-cast and
stamped down upon landlords and tenants, so that they fit and can all
be regulated in exactly the same way. Although that may remove a small
number of extreme cases—though I happen to doubt that—it
has every chance of lowering the standard of the good landlords,
because they no longer have any competitive advantage in saying that
they have independently decided that they will offer such a degree of
excellence, that they will have that verified and that they will go to
the ombudsman. They are now in a situation where there is no
competitive advantage for them to raise their standards. It is,
therefore, a classic socialist example of attempting to level down
standards rather than allowing the market to provide the best
standards.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102537000324" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000324">Why do I
doubt that that will have a great effect on the lowest-quality
landlord? It is because I think that the lowest-quality landlord tends
to be borderline criminal anyway, and one thing that introducing a
level 3 fine will not do is make a hardened criminal quail and quake in
his boots. A life sentence might make him quail and quake in his boots,
but a level 3 fine is not sufficient punishment to really make a
difference to his criminal
activities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000325" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000325">There
is a further point that we should be concerned about. In the days of
the greatest rent control there was the greatest incentive for
landlords to be rotten, and I will explain why. In the current
situation, with assured shorthold tenancies, if landlords require their
asset back for other purposes, they can remove their tenant and sell
their property at the full market price, so they have no reason to
allow the property to run down or to behave aggressively. Under rent
controls, that was simply not true. Rent controls put a substantial
discount on the capital value of a rental property, so if a landlord
was of criminal intent, or even just aggressive, they had a clear
incentive to make their tenant’s life so unpleasant that they
would be forced to leave. That is exactly what Rachmanism was about:
forcing tenants out because the increase in capital value was so great
that the landlord made money from it. With assured shorthold tenancies,
however, there is no incentive for landlords to be really wicked. There
is a perverse effect, because when one bucks the market the situation
deteriorates for those one is aiming to protect most of all.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=600?><hs_Para UID="13102537000326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000326">There is a
further point. Many landlords who might have a property covered by a
protected rent would not dream of behaving badly or aggressively
towards their tenant and would want to continue running the property
properly for as long as possible, but there might come a point when
they have to sell. At that point the highest price in the market is
likely to be from the rogue landlord, because they can make more money
by rogue practices and by forcing out tenants in the protected rented
sector.</hs_Para>

anyone calling for more regulation in the private rented sector will
encourage low standards. They do it for the most noble reasons, and I
do not attack their motives at all. Indeed, I apologise to the hon.
Member for Hammersmith (Mr Slaughter) for the crack I made earlier
about lawyers, because I did not realise at the time that he is a
lawyer. It was not intended in any sense as a personal attack. The
danger is that they will create something worse for the people they are
trying to protect. That is why the market is likely to work better than
regulation.</hs_Para>

from that point. What are the Bills that my hon. Friend the Member for
Shipley talked about, and the support from the Labour Front Bench and
the early-day motions all about? They are about hammering landlords.
There will be people thinking about going into the private rented
sector who might be uncertain about the result of the general election.
I, of course, am certain that the Conservatives will have a majority of
about 200 as we sweep through great swathes of the nation as our
popularity rises with the success of our marvellous and glorious
policies, but some people—it is extraordinary—are less
positive and optimistic. They are doomsayers. They fear that the red
peril might get in and that landlords will be in the front row before
the firing squad to be shot down by these bullets of socialism. That,
18 month before a general election, would put people off entering the
private rented sector.</hs_Para>

other Bills and early-day motions associated with it and the policy
that the Opposition have developed are already threatening the private
rented sector, because there is a developing fear that some type of
regulation will be introduced and that it will be unduly onerous and,
worst of all, it will end up seeking to limit rents. The Leader of the
Opposition has already called for price controls in one area. How long
will it be before we hear calls for price controls in other areas? We
know the deleterious consequences that follow price controls and that
would hit the private rented
sector.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_25_PT_1/71718656F6ECAB4C677E7BB94FC794F7435CB076" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 October 2013">Friday

also said at the beginning that the Bill is an attack on the rights of
property. That is an important point. The House has always defended the
rights of property—the rights of individuals to own and enjoy
their property and use it in a sensible and lawful manner—rather
than unreasonably restricting people’s lawful use of their
property. It is an incredibly important part of our constitutional
settlement that the state should not interfere with property
unnecessarily and that people will be able to get full value for their
property without facing onerous Government regulations depriving them
of that benefit.</hs_Para>

an attempt to reduce, limit and regulate people’s lawful
enjoyment of their own property. I deeply regret that. If people decide
to rent out a property, they do so under a free contract; nobody is
forcing the tenant to take a particular property. There is choice. As
long as there is choice, the legal enjoyment of property ought to 
<?notus-xml column=601?>remain sacrosanct within our national political settlement. That ties in
with the liberty that people enjoy in contracts. There is no harm in a
Government’s setting certain minimum contractual standards; that
has been practised for a long time. However, when two free people
decide that they should make an arrangement, the state ought to
intervene as a later rather than an earlier resort.</hs_Para>

as it exists, landlords and tenants are both in a position of strength.
Obviously, the landlord has the property, but it is only one property
of many; there is not a monopolistic supplier of private rented
properties. The buyer—the tenant—has many properties to
choose from. He may go to a variety of letting agents and use a variety
of landlords. That is an extremely sensible competitive system. It
allows landlords to set their prices at the market rate and tenants to
negotiate and have the freedom to decide which property they should or
should not take.</hs_Para>

applies to letting agents. We have heard a lot about the variable
charges that they apply, but that is the market. All sorts of
industries apply different rates—plumbers, electricians and
supermarkets apply different rates. It is up to the consumer to decide
which rate he is going to pay. Thank heavens we do not live in a
society in which the state directs everybody—“You can
only go to that agent rather than that agent.”</hs_Para>

people do not ask the letting agent, “What are your
charges?”—a perfectly basic question—how can we
turn up and say, “Well, you didn’t ask so you’ve
been overcharged.” Letting agents will set their prices
competitively because there are many of them—so many of them
that the Government cannot count them. Primary school children learn
how to count, but Her Majesty’s Government, with their civil
service and all the resources at their command, cannot count the number
of letting agents, which indicates that there is a competitive market
and the ability to go from one to another and check the
prices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000335" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000335">I
happen to have greater confidence in the electorate than the socialists
tend to have. I believe that my electors and constituents in North East
Somerset are intelligent enough to check out prices for themselves. I
campaigned in Corby during the by-election; I apologise to the hon.
Member for Corby. I found that the hon. Gentleman’s electors
were also first-class, intelligent, capable people, easily able to see
whether one price was higher than another. Although they elected him,
they do not need his help to compare prices every time they go to
Tesco’s or Sainsbury’s. It is remarkably simple for
people to get a comparison, and that is also part of the competitive

asks for the full gamut of charges, they may well see that the agent
charges £10 for one part of the process but £200 later
for the inventory check. Inevitably, there is some degree of
competitive pricing—low at one stage and high at
another—so that the charges overall balance out. However, in
many cases, the bulk of the charges impact on the landlord rather than
the tenant. The charges for letting are absorbed by the landlord
because he has taken the agent on as his agent rather than the agent
for the prospective tenant. It is important to remember that the agent
is for the seller of the good, not for the purchaser of the good. We do
not need to protect people from themselves quite so much.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley said, the fee that could be
charged is not determined and so could be set at any level. We would
find that law-abiding landlords who had their one property to let out
went from profit to loss as they found that the impositions placed on
them were so great that they could not afford to continue. What this
does—it is fascinating how socialism often does this—is
to corporatise the private rented sector, because those who would be
able to cope with it would be the larger companies and

prices is only a very short step from price control. One country I used

noodles—a deregulatory measure. However, the price of noodles
still had to be registered with the Government, and if someone put the
price up the Government refused to accept their registration.
Therefore, although they had claimed to have deregulated and not to be
regulating the price, by the power of registration they were able to

horse, with the hon. Member for Mansfield leading as Odysseus in its

this House should always circumscribe what it writes into law. Not all

people can commit without really wishing to do any wrong. We have had a

is all down to the Government’s policies and that it has nothing
to do with longer-term consequences, demographics or anything of that
kind. It has all happened in the past three years and that is a great
triumph. However, I do not want to see crime going back up purely
because this House legislates to criminalise things. That would add
cost to the operation of the state as a whole, increase burdens on the
taxpayer and make the lives of British subjects more onerous. Surely
this House should always be aiming to make the lives of the British

I am nervous about the proposal to regulate private sector letting
agents. As I have said, it seems to me that there are so many of them
that there is genuine 
<?notus-xml column=604?>and deep competition, and competition is a much better curer of ills
than state regulation. A lot of this is informal. Even in this House,
every so often an e-mail comes around saying, “I have a property
to let,” or “A friend of mine has a property to let. Are
you interested? It’s in the Division bell area.” Do we
really want to turn someone harmlessly working in a parliamentary
office into a criminal because they have not registered as a letting
agent for the purpose of sending one e-mail? Is that the degree of law
that we wish to implement when there is already a perfectly workable
system, with kitemarks, that is competitive and allows for up to 17,000
letting agents in the country at

have already spoken about written tenancy agreements. I completely
understand the desire of lawyers to have everything written down and
buttoned up. If we look at what lawyers have done to us and at the
legislation this House has passed, we will see that when we first
started passing legislation it could be done on a few sheets of paper.
It was clear, distinct and easily justiciable. We now pass so many
volumes of legislation that practically all the legislation up to 1945
is in fewer volumes than each year of legislation since 1945. We have
an incredible desire to write everything down in quintuplicate, in
flowery language that is not understood by most people—half the
time it is not understood by most lawyers—and that leads to
endless litigation and complication. People in Somerset agreeing to let

the need to register everybody who is at any point involved in letting

the people to have the good sense to make arrangements for themselves
that work, and for knowing what their best interests are and being able
to operate in a competitive market. I am for the rights of property and
I am for the liberty of people to decide what is best for them and
their families. I am against the socialist view that it always has to
be done by the state. The over-management and excessive intrusion of

“Never mind the quality, feel the width” comes to mind. I
was not greatly persuaded by the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip
Davies). I am sorry he has had to leave us and host his luncheon party,
but I felt that he simply took the anti-regulation speech off the shelf
without any consideration of the Bill. He confessed, either because of
the late publication of the Bill or because he did not have the time,
that he had not looked at it in detail. If he had done so he would have
seen that it is not a great addition to regulatory burden or an
impediment imposed on the private rented sector, but a necessary and
modest proposal. It would be effective in an area where more effective
regulation is needed.</hs_Para>

am not persuaded by his Hobbesian vision of a private sector market

rights and the only way for them to have any sort of protection would
be by allowing landlords to evict them on a whim, which is effectively
what shorthold tenancies do, without giving any reason. If private
tenants insisted on some form of protection or regulation, they would
stand in fear of the type of behaviour that Rachman and his ilk got up
to in the 1950s—which led to the major expansion of social
housing to counter such behaviour.</hs_Para>

lawyers to be unqualified. One would not expect to be able simply to

is true that the private rented sector declined substantially for most
of the last century. It is also true that it has increased massively
over the past 10 years. Although I support and believe in a strong
private rented sector, most of the reasons for that expansion are not
good ones. One reason is the decline of the social housing sector,
which is due to fewer properties being built and to properties being
sold or demolished. That sector generally provides decent, affordable
homes for people on low and middle incomes. Another reason is that
owner-occupation, particularly in London but in other parts of the

has as much discretion and power as the vendor. That is not the private

is no longer available for most areas of housing law. Many cases such
as some that I have litigated—as often for the landlord as for
the tenant, so I am not speaking with any vested interest—will
not come to court now, simply because a tenant who is living in poor
conditions, being discriminated against, not having their repairs done

the conditions that the Bill suggests imposing on them were onerous,
Conservative Members might have a point, but they are not. One cannot
excuse landlords on the basis that they are amateurs or have come into

received over a longer period. As we have seen from the endorsements to
proposals in the Bill by some of the more respectable landlord

rented sector, rather than what we have at the moment, which is a
free-for-all and downward spiral. It is a sellers’

one third of those in private rented accommodation are families with
children. If one reads the <I>Evening Standard</I> or listens to the
media, one would think we are talking simply about “generation
rent” and young professionals who are waiting to get on the
housing ladder and who are forced into private rented accommodation
while they wait. That may be right—they are certainly an
important group and more should be done to enable people to get into
home ownership—but increasingly we are going back to those
Rachmanesque days in which vulnerable people are forced to live in
those conditions. Part of that involves the relationship between social
housing and the private rented sector and it is now
possible—this is an intended, rather than an unintended
consequence of the Government’s attack on social rent—for
a local authority permanently to discharge its obligation towards
homeless families to the private rented sector. That means that
vulnerable people are put into the hands of what are often very poor
private landlords.</hs_Para>

one gets to that stage, because of the shortage of social housing many
families are in temporary private rented accommodation for up to 10
years. I will give one example from my surgery from the past two weeks.
A family of six who had been in overcrowded, private rented temporary
accommodation for 10 years, were finally—very unusually in
Hammersmith—made an offer of a permanent two-bedroom flat. That
was clearly inadequate for six people, so they had to refuse it and
therefore lose their right to housing. In the end—there is still
an obligation—the family were told, “Yes, we will find
you a property with four bedrooms in the private rented sector for
£500 a week”. That four-bedroom property turned out to be
a two-bedroom council flat that had been purchased and converted by the
technique of putting a piece of plywood over the bath and making the
bathroom into a bedroom, making the store cupboard into a bathroom, the
kitchen into a bedroom, and putting the kitchen in the lounge. It was
effectively a two-bedroom property for a family of six. That is
anecdotal, but it is typical of the type of problems I see in my
surgery every week. I have had hundreds, if not thousands, of such
cases.</hs_Para>

authorities have a shortage of social accommodation to let—in my
local authority there is a deliberate policy of demolishing and selling
off social housing—they are forced more and more to rely on
substandard private rented accommodation. Owing to the benefit cap, the

very low quality; alternatively, it will be a long way outside
London.</hs_Para>

transparency is needed, too. I do not recognise this picture of the
all-knowing tenant going into the letting agency and quizzing the agent
carefully on the fee and charging issues. It is perfectly clear that
many agencies—not just the rogue ones; I am afraid that this is
almost the norm so far as letting agencies are concerned—are not
transparent. I have heard complaints about some of the blue-chip
letting agencies—I shall not name them here—that let out
some of the most expensive properties in London and take every possible

right through the tenancy from the time that the tenant first signs up
to the time of leaving it. First asked for money as a deposit or for
rent in advance, the tenant will then be asked to pay administration
fees, holding fees, fees for renewal and finally fees on leaving. The
tenant is over a barrel and not in a position to escape. If a tenant is
in need of housing and there is only one agency that will accept him or
offer something within his price range, there is little choice. In
those circumstances, it is all very well saying “caveat
emptor”; a wide choice does not apply. The landlord has the whip
hand on every occasion. If measures can be brought in, not necessarily
to regulate but to make the fees transparent, and if we can have
greater scrutiny of the worst type of landlords such as those exposed
by the BBC, that would be worth while.</hs_Para>

tenancy agreements are standard agreements these days. It is possible
to provide one’s own, but 99% of landlords will take out an

Of course disputes can arise over written contracts—that can be
taken as a given—but difficulties and confusion are far more

local authorities are under pressure, and nobody wants to put more
pressure on them at this time. I think the scheme in the Bill is
effectively the beginning of self-regulation. It asks good landlords to
identify themselves and allows bad landlords and bad letting agents to

them from abusing their tenants any longer, as some of them have done
for week after week.</hs_Para>

my comments there. I do not want to delay the Bill’s Second
Reading, but I suspect that other Members may well have that in mind.
My hon. Friend the Member for Mansfield has done us a great service in
bringing this Bill forward and in identifying what has often been an
neglected area of public policy. Frankly, it has been neglected not
just recently, but over 30 years or more. People are suffering
silently. It is naive of the hon. Member for Shipley to say, “I
do not get these people flooding into my surgery”, because
people often do not know their rights. They may be transient tenants,
migrant labourers or families who simply do not know what to do. They
are prey all the time to poor landlord practices time and are exploited
by letting agencies on the way there. If we can do something, even
through 
<?notus-xml column=610?>these modest proposals, to address that, it should be viewed as an
obligation. I await the Minister’s speech to see whether my
speech has persuaded him to throw his brief away and say what we know
he probably
feels.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_25_PT_1/7BE02AB3C1D32FD65B6174E882EDB87EF9C68BD5" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 October 2013">Friday

I do not resile from anything that I said when I took part in that

indeed disturb us. I was talking then about my own experience of living
in rooms in a terraced house which was in poor condition, and of being
evicted. The one detail that the hon. Gentleman left out—perhaps
he had not watched the full clip—was that I was 10 at the time.

then.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000385" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000385">We

by responding to some of what has been said. I believe that the private
rented sector plays an essential role in the English, and British,
housing markets, and I would not want anyone who operates in that
sector to think that the House is against it. A great deal of
negativity has been expressed about it today, although some Members
have issued the caveat that they recognise it to be an essential part
of our housing market. I believe that it provides much-needed
flexibility to that market.</hs_Para>

graduated from Bristol university a quarter of a century ago—I
know that is hard to believe—I lived first in a one-room bedsit
with plenty of strangers in the house. When I could afford it, I lived
in a two-bedroom bedsit in the attic of a terraced property in Bristol,
but still had to share a bathroom. Then, when I could afford it, I
rented a one-bedroom flat, and when I could afford a bit more, I bought
a two-bedroom flat. The private rented sector provides people with not
just the first rung, but often the second and third rungs on the
housing ladder, as well as providing liquidity and flexibility in the
housing market. That is certainly true in my constituency, Bristol
West, which contains the highest proportion of people living in the
private rented sector in the country.</hs_Para>

to the House of Commons Library for providing me with figures from the
2011 census while I have been sitting on the Front Bench this morning
and this afternoon. I think that I could have read the entire census
during the four hours that have elapsed so far. In Bristol West, 21,538
households rent in the private sector, just over 40% of the total
housing market in my constituency. That is topped only by the
proportion in Cities of London and Westminster—where we are at
the moment—which is 42%. The average in the country as a whole
is about 15%. I have looked up the statistics relating to the

this point congratulate the hon. Member for Mansfield (Sir Alan Meale)

good discussion. I can inform him that the proportion of households in
the private rented sector in Mansfield is 13.6%. In
Hammersmith—as I am sure the hon. Member for Hammersmith is
aware—it is just under a third. In Shipley and in Bury
North—I believe we may be hearing from the latter

private rented sector has a great role to play in the future as well.
Traditionally, private landlords have often been small providers who
might only have one property that they let out; they might have
acquired it to generate a stream of rental income to support them
during their current life or, as is often the case, to provide for
their retirement. This country has over a long period lacked large
institutional investors in the private rental market, however, and the
hon. Member for Hammersmith lamented that. In many other European
countries it is the norm to rent accommodation and not to have this
country’s obsession with buying, and they also have many large
investors in their private rented sector. The Government want that
market to develop here, too, so that there is more choice for tenants.
Large providers are likely to invest heavily in quality and provide
long-term leases.</hs_Para>

the Government have set up the Build to Rent fund, which hopes to
generate £1 billion in investment. The Department has already
agreed its first contract, in Southampton on Centenary Quay, where, as
part of a wider scheme, 100 homes will be provided in the private
rental market. The Government have helped to the tune of £3.5
million to get that development off the ground. We are, therefore,
doing what we can to encourage larger investors and larger schemes to
become more the 
<?notus-xml column=612?>norm in this country. Other first-round bids are being evaluated by the
Department, and we have opened a second round of invitations to bid,
which will end on  31 October. We would welcome more bids from
new providers in this
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000392" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000392">We
also have the private rented sector guarantee scheme. We are prepared
to guarantee £3.5 billion for large potential investors who wish
to enter the private rental market and provide new accommodation.
Discussions are ongoing with several large institutional investors who

scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000393" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000393">The
growth of the private rental housing market—and, of course, of
social housing as well—is key to the economy, so I should also
mention the Government schemes Help to Buy, which enables more people
to buy their own home, and the Growing Places fund, which has helped
house builders, including in my own constituency in Bristol, to get
schemes that were frozen after the crash of 2008 and 2009 off the
ground.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000394" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000394">The
Government also want more affordable housing to be built. Our aim is to
have 170,000 more affordable housing units built by the end of this
Parliament, and we have already achieved 84,000, which will go some way
towards addressing the shortfall that arose during the 13 years of
Labour Government. For much of that period—certainly the first
half of it when the economy was growing strongly and tax revenues were
buoyant—they could, frankly, have done rather more to get
affordable housing
going.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000395" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000395">As
the housing market is important for the economy, it gives me great
pleasure to be able to say that today’s GDP figures again show
that the economy is returning to strong growth. We have had news that
the economy has grown by 0.8%—again, that news came to us while
we have been sitting in the Chamber today. Most pleasing of all, the
construction sector, which is the sector that collapsed the most during
the difficult period, grew in the most recent quarter by 2.5%. I think
we can say that the economy is growing and Britain is getting building

me turn to points that the hon. Member for Mansfield made in

people lived in the private rented sector. I found that amazing as
well; I raised my eyebrows at that point. My understanding is that
there are about 3.8 million households in the private rented sector,
and as other speakers have said, there are children in about a third of
those. I do not know whether we can extrapolate 9 million from that,
but I suspect that the number is a little smaller. However, the number

hon. Gentleman referred to selective licensing, a power that is already
available to local authorities. When Bristol city council was
controlled by Liberal Democrats, it initiated selective licensing in
Easton in my constituency, so I know that authorities are making use of
that power. He said that it was being strangled by red tape; I am not
sure what the evidence base is for that, because he did not expand on
that point, but back in the summer, when my predecessor, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Bath (Mr Foster), was in office, he initiated a
survey of all housing authorities. We are still gathering in the
responses, but thus far we have had 194. Given that there are about 300
housing authorities, obviously quite a lot have not yet responded, or
did not feel that there was an issue with selective licensing that
merited a response. From the 194 that did respond, we know that 16
selective licensing schemes have been introduced in different parts of
the country. Obviously, there are still data to be crunched, and I am

hon. Gentleman also mentioned the issue of rogue landlords—as
did other speakers, perhaps to counter what he said—as if there
was nothing that local authorities could do about the minority of
private sector landlords who can be described in that way. Of course,
local authorities already have powers that they can use; certainly, as
regards health and safety, there are powers to do with the safety and
sanitary condition of houses, flats and bedsits in the private rented
market. I think that somebody—possibly the hon. Member for
Hammersmith or the shadow Minister—mentioned that local
authorities face budgetary pressures. I certainly acknowledge that, but
the Department has made available a £3 million fund for
district, unitary or metropolitan authorities that feel that they have
particular issues with tackling poor standards in private sector

issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000401" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000401"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andy Sawford" PimsId="6000" UID="13102537000736" xid="1241" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000736">Andy

private sector, the English housing survey found that 83.6% of tenants
were fairly or very satisfied with their landlord, compared to 76.6%
who had the local authority as their landlord. Some 9.7% of private
sector tenants were dissatisfied, compared with almost 17% of people in
local authority housing. That might 
<?notus-xml column=614?>back up the point made by the hon. Member for Shipley that his
constituency surgeries quite often see complaints about a sector that
is already heavily regulated and has democratic
accountability—that is, local authorities. Although there are
clearly problems in the private rented sector, they are smaller than in
the sector that is under the direct control of housing
authorities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000405" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000405"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sir Alan Meale" PimsId="1859" UID="13102537000738" xid="422" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000738">Sir
Alan Meale:</Member></B> Assuming that the Minister’s figures
might be correct and about 15% of tenants in the local authority sector
are unsatisfied, let us take the figure for the private rented sector,
which is 3.7 million households. Fifteen per cent. of that is half a
million—a not insignificant number—so we have to deal
with the fact that huge numbers of people show
dissatisfaction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000406" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000406"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Williams" PimsId="4842" UID="13102537000739" xid="813" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000739">Stephen

from English housing survey data, which are available for all of us to
look at. I have acknowledged several times that there are problems in
the sector. The hon. Member for Hammersmith mentioned the Shelter
pop-up shop. When that was in Bristol, people cited extreme cases of
exposed electrical wiring, poor plumbing and awful sanitation. Local
authorities already have powers to deal with those transgressions. That
is what we want to see them tackling, and the £3 million fund
that the Department has opened should help
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000407" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000407">On
the tenant satisfaction data, repairs are often an issue about which
people come to see us as constituency MPs. The housing survey data show
that 72% of tenants in the private sector are satisfied that their
landlord deals with repairs in a satisfactory way, compared with 66% in
local authorities. I am not in any way trying to diminish the fact that
there may well be problems in the private rented sector; I am trying to
put those into context. Even in a regulated environment, and even in an
environment where each of the three main parties in the Chamber
controls housing authorities and councillors have oversight of what
they are doing, there is a certain amount of tenant dissatisfaction. No

housing survey in some detail. It is interesting to hear his take on

dissatisfaction with private rented
accommodation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000409" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000409"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Williams" PimsId="4842" UID="13102537000741" xid="813" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000741">Stephen
Williams:</Member></B> I will look at the survey in even more detail to
deal with the points that the shadow Minister raises, but he is right.
The private sector is growing, and that is something that we wish to
encourage. That is why we have the policies in place to get people
investing in the private sector in order to provide extra
accommodation, which is needed in general, but is needed also to
provide the flexibility that many of our constituents would
want.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000410" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000410">Let
me turn to the Bill and its four clauses, the first of which
establishes a mandatory national register of private landlords. When
the shadow Minister was speaking, he allowed me to intervene once about
the Rugg review. I tried to put it to him that that review was
commissioned by the Labour Government. One issue that it considered 
<?notus-xml column=615?>was whether there should be a national register of landlords. It
rejected that and the then Labour Government, as represented either by
the present shadow Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Normanton,
Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), or by the right hon. Member
for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey), both of whom were housing
Ministers in the period of the Rugg review, accepted that
recommendation. The hon. Member for Corby said to me, but would not
allow me to intervene in response, that the general election got in the
way of implementation. The Rugg review was in 2008. A lot of things
happened between 2008 and May 2010, but clearly a decision was made by
predecessors in my Department not to introduce a mandatory national
register of private
landlords.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000411" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000411">The
range of benefits that a register might provide was not clear, but one
was that tenants would be able to find out whom their landlord was.
Under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, a tenant can ask the collector
of the rent, which in many cases may well be a letting agent, to
disclose the identity of the ultimate landlord. That information has to
be provided within 21 days and failure to do so is an offence. If as
constituency Members we find that people do not know who their landlord
is, or the local authority does not know and may want to encourage the
tenant to find out, perhaps we should publicise that provision, which
has been on the statute book for quite a long
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000412" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000412">It
is unclear what a national register would achieve. We certainly believe
that it would create an unnecessary burden on all landlords, whereas
what has been acknowledged in the debate is that there is a small
minority of potentially rogue landlords whom we should be concerned
about, rather than the vast majority who provide a good service to
their tenants. None the less, many private landlords are already in
industry accreditation
schemes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000413" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000413">One
concern is that the introduction of any new compulsory burden of
regulation involves a cost. The hon. Member for Mansfield said that
there would be no compliance costs, but I would be surprised if a
national register of anything was introduced without some compliance
costs. People in the private rented sector are looking to make a profit
and like any private enterprise or individual in business they will
pass costs visited on them on to their customers, who in this case are
tenants.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000414" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000414"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sir Alan Meale" PimsId="1859" UID="13102537000742" xid="422" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000742">Sir

several obligations that are not the same. You and I, Madam Deputy
Speaker, will have debated the requirement to register to vote many
times on the Select Committee and during consideration of Government
legislation on individual electoral registration, but that is totally
different from someone in business having to disclose their business
practices via a register. We have Companies House, where directors have
to be registered, but I would be hard-pressed on the spur of the moment

<?notus-xml column=616?>to think of another area of business where the owners of the business
have to be on a national register. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will give

likely to need to know the identity of the landlord is the tenant, if
they pay their rent via an intermediary, whether a letting agent or
someone else, and under the 1985 Act the tenant has a statutory right
to have the identity of that landlord disclosed to them within 21 days.
That might be a long time to wait for the
disclosure, but there is a statutory right to know a

Communities and Local Government Committee, which has been referred to
several times, produced a report in the summer. Despite the evidence it
heard, which the shadow Minister was keen to refer to, it rejected the
idea of a mandatory national register of private landlords. Local
authorities already have powers to introduce landlord licensing schemes
to tackle problems such as antisocial behaviour where there are houses
in multiple occupation that do not already fall within the statutory
licensing regime to which the hon. Member for Shipley referred. A house
that is three storeys high and has more than five unconnected people
living in it already has to be licensed, but local authorities can
license properties that fall below those criteria if they have
identified particular problems. Therefore, with regard to the problems
that a national register might solve, there are already laws in place,
passed by this place, and opportunities for local authorities to
introduce regulations in their
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000420" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000420">Clause

my parents should have known about that Act in 1977, because that was

Williams, who came to talk to my mother. I listened to them talk and
asked my mother afterwards, “Who was that woman?” My
mother replied, “She’s the person we vote for on the

It would not be me or Parliament or anyone else; it would be the
Secretary of State. That is what I am asking for; I am not asking for
somebody out there to do it. When I was a Minister at the Department of
the Environment, Transport and the Regions, I abolished quite a lot of
quangos. I took the number down from 116, which was unnecessarily
large, to fewer than 100. I am not a great fan of quangos. The

North East Somerset was a little

been prepared for me, I am in any case suspicious

that it should apply to plumbers, electricians, painters or decorators.

their tenancy to be provided in writing, including the amount of rent
payable, the date on which the rent falls due; whether there are any
terms that the landlord wishes to impose for providing for a review of
the rent, and, if there is a fixed term of tenancy, how long it is. The
tenant can already request that those extremely important items be put

in response to that substantial report: reconsider the decision not to
follow the recommendation to carry out a consolidation of legislation

regulations covering landlords and tenants, so that they were together
in one place and more easily understandable, would be a reform that
benefited both landlords and tenants. That would be a great service to

be employed. It would, of course, need its own human resources
department to deal with all its staff, and its own administration
department. Before long, it would need regional offices. Before we knew
it, there would be a staff of thousands. The cost of that would not
disappear into the ether; it would be borne, ultimately, by the

Macleod:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point, and she
is right to say that we want to encourage more private sector
landlords. We need more landlords, and I do not want them to be put off
by additional costs, regulation and red tape. In any case, as my hon.
Friend said, rogue landlords would no doubt find their way around that
anyway. I do not want to impose cost, red tape and more regulation. The
Conservative party is about rolling back the state and having less
regulation, and some of the extra charges would lead to landlords
having to impose higher rents at a time when the cost of living is
critical and we want more housing.</hs_Para>

from many hon. Members and the Minister about the work that the
Government have done. As the hon. Member for Corby (Andy Sawford) said,
substantial legislation is already in place, and we certainly do not
need or want any more. We heard about the Communities and Local
Government Committee, and my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip
Davies) said that we should simplify legislation. That is the right
thing to do. My hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob
Rees-Mogg) mentioned making the provisions consumer-led, and as someone
who came from the business world prior to entering this place, I firmly
believe in that. We do not want to live in a nanny state; we want to
create a competitive market and—as my hon. Friend put to the

comparisons.</hs_Para>

consider the recommendations in the Bill, even the national register of
private landlords can and will be a financial burden on
landlords—a cost that would no 
<?notus-xml column=624?>doubt be passed on to tenants, which we do not want. Regulation of
private sector letting agents and managing agents is again about
imposing more and more burdens on local authorities, increasing costs
and reducing the choice and availability of accommodation offered to
tenants. I certainly would not want that across London and the rest of
the country.</hs_Para>

mentioned the things that the Government have done, which are
important. They recently announced a tenants package, which means that
we do not need to introduce new regulation for that. The package
includes the tenants charter, which will help to promote awareness
among tenants about what to expect, such as transparency of letting
agents fees. We heard about the Government-endorsed model tenancy
agreement that written tenancy agreements can be based on.</hs_Para>

that the hon. Member for Mansfield would have mentioned another issue
that has been brought to my attention in my constituency many times.
Landlords have had to take tenants to court to evict them because of
advice that the tenants received from local councils. If tenants want
to be seen as homeless and get housing support—even though under
their tenancy agreement they know they should leave the property with a
month’s notice, or whatever—they have been told to
overstay so that they have to be taken to court and evicted. Then they
will not be seen as having made themselves intentionally homeless. I
had hoped that the issue would have been addressed by the Bill, but it
was not.</hs_Para>

conclude my remarks because I want to give my hon. Friend the Member
for Stourbridge (Margot James) the last few moments to say a few words.
My hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset said that we should
be making life better, easier and happier for citizens of this country,
and that in North East Somerset they would do that over a pint of
cider. In Brentford and Isleworth it would be over a cup of Teapigs
tea, which is made in Brentford, or a pint of London Pride or Chiswick
Bitter. I hope that we in this House can do everything possible to make
life better, easier and happier for our constituents. I therefore
cannot support the Bill.</hs_Para>

to draw the attention of Members to my entry in the Register of
Members’ Financial Interests, in which I have declared a
property that I rent out. It is not really applicable to this debate,
because it works on the basis of short-term holiday lets. Although this
is not officially an interest, my partner owns two small properties in
London, which she rents out and has done for some considerable time. I
must say that she is a model landlord, who has not put her rent up at
all in the last three years. I have observed first hand some of the
difficulties that a landlord experiences on the controversial issue of
the balance of rights as between landlords and tenants. None the less,
my constituency brings home to me that the balance is a fine one, and
that some tenants are victimised by landlords. That is why I sympathise
with the intent behind the Bill and why I congratulate the hon. Member
for Mansfield (Sir Alan Meale) on bringing it forward.</hs_Para>

however, I feel that the balance is about right at the moment. My
partner would certainly not agree, but that is my view. I believe that
further burdening landlords and their letting agents with a
registration scheme over and above the voluntary schemes that already
exist and that are already quite effective would have the effect of
disincentivising people who own small properties from renting them out
up and down the country.</hs_Para>

that we face a critical housing shortage at this time. I need hardly
remind Members that between 1997 and 2010, there was a woeful lack of
new house building. We inherited that situation, but despite the huge
improvements of the last 12 months, which have seen a record increase
in house building, we still have a long way to go in providing decent
homes for the many people who are on housing waiting lists and cannot
find private rented accommodation. For us to pass further legislation
that would, in the opinion of many, act as a disincentive to the
private rented sector at a time of such housing need would, I think, be
a retrograde step. Along with my Conservative colleagues, I shall
therefore oppose the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000476" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000476">In
the short time available, let me cover some aspects of regulation and
legislation that already give protection to tenants in the private
housing sector. Private sector letting agents are subject to consumer
protection law, while councils have powers to tackle rogue landlords
and their agents. I am sure many hon. Members would agree that we would
like to see local authorities using these powers more assertively than
they sometimes do. None the less, the powers are there, and I am not a
believer in bringing in new regulation and new laws just because
existing provisions, regulations and laws are not being used
effectively. The first port of call should surely be to use existing
legislation and regulation before we start burdening the whole system
with yet more regulation. A registration provision of the sort in the
Bill only adds to that burden of
regulation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000477" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000477">At
least half of private landlords in this country already belong to a
professional organisation, of which the Association of Residential
Letting Agents and the National Association of Estate Agents are but
two examples. Such bodies have provisions for codes of best practice,
to which letting agents and landlords must subscribe if they are to
join them. I think it much better for us to try to increase the number
of letting agents who subscribe to those schemes and organisations than
to
attempt—</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13102537000590" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000590">2.30

Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears), who was then the police Minister, to
meet local people on Steers Mead who wanted a team of police to tackle
the low-level crime and antisocial behaviour that affected their part
of Mitcham. Thanks to her, we fortunately 
<?notus-xml column=628?>got one of the country’s safer neighbourhood teams. The model of
one sergeant, two police constables and three police community support
officers in every ward has been a great success and has directly led to
more police officers, especially PCSOs, patrolling the streets. One
reason for that success is that those officers and PCSOs looked like
the people whose streets they walked down. The police had drifted away
from community policing for decades, but safer neighbourhood teams
meant that we had six people working local beats whom we knew and who
could not be moved away from us.</hs_Para>

the overall number of police officers  has been falling. In
March 2010, when police numbers in my borough of Merton were at their

According to Merton’s borough commander, by September 2013 the
number of sergeants had dropped by a third, to 39.5, the number of
PCSOs had dropped by around 40%, and there were 15 fewer PCs.
Inevitably, that results in fewer people in our police service who
reflect the social composition of the wider community. That is why it
is important that when the police recruit they do so in a way that does
not discriminate against under-represented parts of the

The reliance on specials is hard enough, but if serving as a police
officer is possible only for people who are able to cough up nearly
£1,000 many months before they can even apply to become an
officer, who will sign up? Will that interest the black and Asian young

pre-application questionnaire, which takes about 45 minutes. If they
pass that stage, the police service will send them an application pack

that stage, they are invited to an assessment centre for a two-day
assessment. That includes a 20-minute structured interview, followed by
a numerical reasoning test. That is followed by a 30-minute verbal
logical reasoning test, and two further written exercises, including
one in which the applicant writes a proposal document. That is followed
by four interactive role-play scenarios. Day two concentrates on
assessing whether the applicant can meet the physical and mental
challenges of policing. Even that is not the end of the matter: the
applicant still has to go through security and reference checks. It is

put the money forward not just for people from their community, but in
favour of all young people in the area, irrespective of whether they
have a religion, what colour they are or whether they are a man or a

other things that they could, and do, spend their charitable money on.

Chief constables and senior police officers are rising to the challenge
of making efficiency savings and providing greater value for money

the record that we inherited the toughest fiscal challenge in living
memory, and had no option but to reduce public spending. At the start
of the current spending review period, the 
<?notus-xml column=632?>police spent some £14 billion a year, so it is right that they

All forces need to look at the way front-line services are delivered to

As Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary has previously

demand of Londoners to keep police numbers high at 32,000 to deliver a

want to address a number of the points that the hon. Lady raised in
relation to the recruitment exercise. As I have already highlighted,
the Metropolitan Police Service’s plan is to recruit 5,000 new
constables by 2015, with an aspiration that 2,000 of them will be from
black and minority ethnic backgrounds. It is notable that that
objective has been set within the overall recruitment focus. In
relation to the Mayor’s objective to achieve a more diverse
police force in London, I understand that the Mayor’s office for
policing and crime has established a task force to support the
Metropolitan Police Service as it recruits new police officers. The
task force is progressing with initiatives to introduce community
ambassadors aimed at promoting and encouraging police officer recruits
and careers across London and communities to help to identify
opportunities for community
engagement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000536" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000536">The
task force also suggests media improvements to increase the appeal for
women and black and minority ethnic applicants. Most notably, adverts
must encourage the positive impact that BME applicants could have in
keeping their communities safe and improving policing. There is also a
suggestion about introducing a London factor to the recruitment
process, including elements of intercultural competency, London
residency, subject  to certain legal issues that the Mayor is
examining, and language skills. Therefore, although I note the hon.
Lady’s concerns, I think that the Mayor’s office for
policing and crime—it is at the sharp end of the
recruitment  
<?notus-xml column=633?>process, rather than the Home Office—from the information I have
received from it, is ambitious and is seeking to drive its work forward
in ensuring that the Metropolitan police work force better reflect and
represent the diverse communities of our capital
city.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000537" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000537">I
want to address some of the hon. Lady’s other points, for
example on changes to equality legislation. We believe that the
Equality Act 2010 included positive action provisions to enable
employers to address identified under-representation of protected
groups in the workplace. We are working with forces and colleagues at
the Government Equalities Office and the College of Policing to
identify ways of tackling under-representation under existing
equalities
legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000538" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000538"><B><Member ContinuationText="Siobhain McDonagh" PimsId="1796" UID="13102537000775" xid="378" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000775">Siobhain

certificate in knowledge of policing is one of  a number of
routes into the police. It is designed  to increase access and
inclusion and to build the professionalism of policing. The
Metropolitan Police Commissioner has chosen, as part of his plans to
recruit the 5,000 officers I referred to, to make it a requirement that
candidates applying must have completed a certificate in knowledge of
policing before starting as a constable. Chief officers—in this
case the commissioner—are best placed to determine the skills
and capabilities most needed locally, based on their understanding of
the local labour market and what is needed in their forces. That is a
decision best taken by the chief officer, rather than the Home
Office.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000541" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000541">The

It is not intended that the certificate should be a prerequisite for

on to the cost of the certificate, which the hon. Lady focused on in
particular. It is for each provider to set a fee—so far, 37
providers have registered for the certificate and 12 have been
approved—but it is estimated that the cost of the certificate
will be between £800 and £1,000, as she suggested. Many
other professions, particularly law and medicine, require people to pay
for the costs of their initial training. Further and higher education
providers, as well as independent providers, will obtain a licence from
the College of Policing to deliver the certificate course and may offer
grants or loans to individual students.</hs_Para>

Policing is monitoring take-up of  the new qualification,
including demographic data on candidates. As my right hon. Friend the
Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice stated in answer to the hon.
Lady, it is too early to give an informed response on the
certificate’s effect because it is still in its infancy. It
would be a matter for the force to decide whether it wished to
reimburse the costs of obtaining the qualification for those who were
successfully recruited. However, some further and higher education

students.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102537000544" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000544"><B><Member ContinuationText="Siobhain McDonagh" PimsId="1796" UID="13102537000777" xid="378" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/debtext/131025-0002.htm#13102537000777">Siobhain

decision. It is right that chief officers should determine the skill
sets that they require and therefore the appropriate process in the
context of recruitment. I understand that the Metropolitan Police
Service is considering providing loans for students undertaking the
pre-join programmes. There are also some examples of community and
local business consortia developing their own schemes to provide
funding and support to those interested in taking the certificate and
applying to the Metropolitan Police Service. The hon. Lady’s
points are recognised and being examined further, from the information

across all communities want the police to fight crime while having
confidence that their individual needs will be understood and
respected. That is fair and effective policing. Police forces that

they are to tackle crimes that affect them. Diversity is more than ever

Section 19A of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 provides
for a court to make an order against a legal representative, whether of
the prosecution or of the defendant, in respect of 'wasted costs',
which means costs that are incurred as a result of an improper,
unreasonable or negligent act or omission by a legal representative
rather than a party.</hs_Para>

Where a court is satisfied that costs have been incurred as a result of
an unnecessary or improper act or omission by a party, it has power
under section 19 of the 1985 Act to order them to be paid by that
party. In such circumstances the court thus has power to order the
prosecutor to pay the defendant's costs, and vice versa. In the absence
of such act or omission, a court may order the payment of a defendant's
costs out of central funds under section 16 of the 1985
Act.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102538000555" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131025/text/131025w0001.htm#13102538000555">The

is challenging to project and quantify the impact on fuel poverty of
the Green Deal and energy company obligation (ECO) policy framework.
This is because of a number of uncertainties, such as which households
take-up which measures and the costs of delivering measures over time.
There is also inherent uncertainty around changes in the level and
distribution of incomes across households, changes to the housing stock
independent of the Green Deal and ECO and, of course, energy prices.
Nevertheless, based on projected changes in incomes, prices and the
housing stock, the measures installed under Green Deal and ECO are
estimated to result in a net reduction in fuel poverty of between
125,000 to 250,000 households by the time the costs of ECO are no
longer passed through to bills in 2023.<Sup>1</Sup> This figure does
not reflect the aggregate benefits of this policy. In reality, ECO will
deliver permanent improvements to 230,000 low income and vulnerable
households per year. Indeed, in the first seven months of delivery,
167,000 measures were delivered under affordable warmth and the carbon
saving communities elements of ECO

technology is uncertain as it depends on a range of factors—for
example future technology costs. The most recent illustrative scenarios
for contributions from different energy technologies between now and
2030 were developed by National Grid and published in July as part of
the consultation on the draft Electricity Market Reform Delivery Plan.
These indicate a range of 10.2% to 11.7% of generation coming from wind
in 2016. These figures are calculated on a GB (not UK) basis and refer
to the proportion of electricity generation coming from onshore and

improvement schemes across the Strategic Road Network in England
include elements that will benefit cyclists. The agency does not
routinely record the cycling improvement elements of its small scheme

rural routes. The agency is investing up to £5
million in upgrades at 14 locations on the Strategic Road Network
benefiting cyclists, and this work will be completed by March 2015.

infrastructure have meant that higher line speeds are possible. However
with the increased passenger numbers that we have witnessed, train
operators have to allow for various factors when deciding on service
running; they have to weigh capacity versus calling patterns versus
service reliability. Since 2004, the public performance measure (PPM)

legal duty to secure, so far as is reasonably practicable, sufficient
child care for working parents or parents who are studying or training

that will strengthen out of school services. For example, under the
provisions in the Children and Families Bill, from September 2014,
local authorities will have to involve families and young people in
producing a 'local offer', which sets out the services that will be
available for children and young people with special educational needs
