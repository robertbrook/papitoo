Council Resolution 2118, which determines how Syria’s chemical
weapons must be eliminated. However, the conflict continues—this
is not a broader peace initiative. Syria’s use of chemical
weapons presents different security challenges to Iran’s nuclear
programme but there has been a similar international response. The UN
Security Council has agreed six UN resolutions on Iran’s nuclear
programme, all of which Iran remains in breach of. We hope that Iran
will engage substantively with the UNSC mandated E3+3 to resolve the
nuclear

Putin’s biographer. Many people would argue that the Russian-led

We welcome the constructive response that the Russian Government are
now making on Syria and we hope and expect that the Russians will
ensure that President Assad and his regime are represented at the

recognise—and I say this as a Liberal who believes in
international order and is very reluctant to condone the use of
force—that without the threat of force we might not have reached
the position we have so far reached in Syria. Just as with the opening
to Iran, without the very extensive sanctions against it we might not
be having the discussions that we are now having with the Iranian

the beginning of September, there were UPI international press reports
from a reputable source that the Russians were accusing the Syrian
opposition of using chemical weapons. There seemed to be almost a
conspiracy of silence in the western press about these accusations.

pursue investigations on the ground within Syria at present, and all
the evidence to which I have had access suggests that the opposition

that the British Foreign Secretary has worked extremely hard over the
past nine months and more to come to terms with the Russians and to
develop a relationship with the Russian Foreign Minister. The European
Union high representative, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, has also
done a great deal of work with the Russians on Syria and as part of the

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> Of course it would. However, we are
proceeding slowly and cautiously. There was an Iranian invasion of the
British embassy compound only two years ago and we are conscious, as
the Foreign Secretary said in his Statement to the Commons the other
day, that the Iranian political system is a complex structure and that
to be President of Iran is not necessarily to command all power in
Iran. When President Rouhani returned most recently he
was cheered in the streets of Tehran, but he was booed and his
car was apparently pelted by members of the Basij

making it clear that it is no part of the Official Opposition’s
policy to nominate President Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize. The
initiatives on Syria, particularly in relation to chemical weapons, are
plainly welcome, although there is much more to do on Geneva II. I
understand that the Foreign Secretary has done some months’ work
on deepening the relationship with Russia, but it does not seem to have
deepened enough for it to be a reliable way of achieving the objective
in the effort to defuse crises. What positive steps will the Government
take, perhaps with the United States and France, to deepen that

Russians are not easy companions. Foreign Minister Lavrov is giving a
big speech in Brussels today,

we are having at present on a number of Middle Eastern problems, we are
also moving towards the EU summit at the end of November on the Eastern
Partnership, and Russian behaviour towards Ukraine, Armenia, Moldova
and Georgia regarding the possibility of those states signing
association agreements with the European Union is, to say the least,
not particularly constructive, nor is the effort that it is making to
interrupt Lithuanian exports to

worrying that the Consumer Panel has yet to meet? Can we have an

the need to have a Consumer Panel that is as broadly based as possible.
It is important to recognise that the FCA now has significant new
powers: the product intervention power, the ability to ban products and
powers to disclose details of warning notices, for example, as well as
a power to take formal action against misleading financial promotions
and disclose the fact that it has done so. It has more teeth, and all

over a loan twice and that if a consumer has a CPA with a loan

May I respectfully say that whoever drafted them is a little
naïve? Needless to say, those devious people alluded to here
will work around them in a few moments. Does the Minister recognise
that the only way to solve the issue is to cap the exorbitant interest
rates charged and, more importantly, impose strict advertising
guidelines where the advertisers are forced to devote as much
prominence to warnings as they do to the sales pitch? By that, I do not

advertising, which the noble Lord may have seen. As for a cap on
interest chargeable, the view at the moment is that the FCA does not
believe that that is the most effective way of capping the total charge
made. I am sure the noble Lord will have seen the <I>Which?</I> report
in recent days, showing that borrowers from high street banks are
sometimes paying as high, if not higher, effective rates of interest on
their loans because of other charges. The key thing is to have a cap on
the total cost of credit, rather than simply go for a cap on the rate,
which payday loan operators certainly can get around by imposing a

have raised on previous occasions. That is to say that the debtor is
not entirely without protection in our law. As the Minister will know,
a judge of the High Court, or indeed a circuit judge, always
has the power in dealing with these matters to ask himself the
question whether the creditor has acted unfairly or whether there are
conditions in the contract that are unfair. If he finds that to be the
case, he can do one of two things: he can either rewrite the contract
completely or he can refuse all redress to the
creditor<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:05:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to make sure that the regulatory and legal framework is fit for purpose
so that people do not adopt unacceptable methods of behaviour in the
first place, and if they do, they can be caught and dealt with
properly. Secondly, there is a big issue around the culture in the
City, which the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards discussed
at great length and which your Lordships’ House has discussed.
The two have to go hand in hand. The pressure that this House and
Parliament can put on the banking sector regarding culture should not
be underestimated. Debates here are taken seriously by the banks. We
need to keep pressure on them whenever we have dealings with them. This
must be underpinned by law and by better regulation, but we need
both.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_15_PT_1/33000649C09FBF753A9437F7E55A11100C560558" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 October 2013">Tuesday,

language at key stage 2. Thanks to the English baccalaureate, modern
language GCSE entries have also reached their highest level this year,

this with a great deal of expertise from her position as president of

Funding Council for England to treat modern foreign languages as
strategically important and vulnerable, and have provided additional
funding to ensure that adequate levels of provision remain. To give an
example, £3.1 million of further funding for a new three-year
student demand-raising programme has already been allocated. We are

Modern Languages. Is the Minister aware that there is now very robust
evidence to show that languages at GSCE and A-level are subject to
unfair, harsh and erratic marking? This deters schools from encouraging
students to choose languages, in case their position in the league
tables is damaged. It also deters students from choosing languages,
because they know that their chances of getting top grades and
university offers might be reduced. Will the Minister undertake to meet
urgently with Ofqual and the examination boards, in order to ensure

important for all of us across the House to underline the importance of
languages. The new national curriculum, which has now been published,
includes a statutory foreign language at key stage 2. We believe that
this will encourage students to take up modern languages, and indeed
encourage schools to offer them. As I said earlier, the English
baccalaureate is already encouraging more young people to take a
language at GCSE level. Let us not forget that it was in 2004 that a
statutory undertaking to provide languages at schools was removed. We

the noble Lord not agree that it would be a pity for efforts to teach
foreign languages to be motivated by purely commercial interests?
Trying to get people to be better business representatives abroad is
surely not the only reason. Many of the people who are learning foreign
languages find that in other countries they speak English anyway, and
put us to shame. Would it not be a great shame if future generations
did not at least have the ability to read some of the world’s

final point. As someone whose origins lie in the Indian subcontinent, I
assure noble Lords that at home mother knew best, and we were taught
languages appropriately to understand literature from
across the world. While English remains the language of the
modern business world, I referred in my opening Answer to the
importance of education to understanding cultures across the world.
Indeed, looking at the example of the Chancellor and the Mayor of
London, we see that both their daughters are currently undertaking
courses in Chinese. Anyone who has done business in China will know
that without understanding Chinese in China you will not be able to
expand your

e-cigarettes should be regulated as medicines. These products need to

cigarettes, and understandably so, both the European Parliament and the

economies of scale/minimum efficient scale in retail banking which will
ultimately limit the total number of firms in the market. However, we
question whether the need for economies of scale justifies banks having
a 30% share of the market or whether such benefits, if they exist, will
be passed onto consumers in a market where competition is deficient.
Indeed, such economies of scale benefits are likely to be outweighed by
the negative impact on competition by those providers who are perceived

addition, there are two other factors. First, as Andy Haldane has
noted, there is a case for concluding that over $100 billion in assets,
banks actually become less efficient. They are too big. Secondly, the
evidently corrupt culture we have seen in some of our banks
is a clear symptom of a lack of real
competitiveness and is probably chiefly caused by this lack. It
is competitiveness—real competitiveness—that keeps
companies honest, or at least very much more honest than some of our
banks have been. I rehearsed all their recent and shocking failings at
Second Reading, and I will not do so again now, but I will again point
out that the PPI scandal is the clearest possible indication of
non-competitive, cartel-like disregard for the interest of consumers.

supposed to serve, and they did it on a gigantic scale. This would not

indeed, but the plain fact is that we start from a position where the
large banks have 80% or so of the market in the UK and have behaved in
a cartel-like manner. The measures in place or in progress will surely
not reduce this figure by much in the next 10 years. In fact, I would

degree of real autonomy and some real identity. The stakeholder

local businesses, customers, suppliers, and employees as well as

Eatwell (Lab):</Member></B> It would probably be helpful if I spoke

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Sharkey, for mentioning the
comments that I made at Second Reading, but I feel that his amendment,
while it raises a series of valuable issues, conflates some of them in
a way which is not entirely
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000073">The
first point is the one that he also made, which is that there has been
no fundamental thinking at all about the structure of banking in this
country. The whole discussion about ring-fencing which occupied us last
week is a modification of the existing structures of ownership, rather
than encouragement to develop an entirely different and more
competitive banking structure. That is a key issue which underlies the
amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Sharkey, and the one that
is in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Tunnicliffe. Where the
issue has been conflated is that regional banking, to which he
referred, should be separated from the issue of competition. Either or
both can be promoted, but they have to be seen as separate entities.
For example, the chief executive of Santander has recently written in
the <I>Financial Times</I> that she would like to see a significant
increase in regionalisation in its activities. That, of course, is not
necessarily an increase in competition, but is a more regional focus of
the single entity.</hs_para>

encouraging, with respect to the regional issue, that the Governor of
the Bank of England argued in Leeds a couple of weeks ago that he was
very much in favour of an increase in regionalism in British banking,
and I wonder whether the Government agree with him in this respect. The
key issue underlying this is not regionalism so much. After all, if we
look across Europe, it was the small regional banks which failed in
their dozens, particularly of course in Germany. The issue is of
relationship banking, and the return to a close relationship between
the lending entity—which used to be the manager of the
bank—and the community in which he or she is located. For
example, that was an important force in the development of the science
park in Cambridge. At that time, Barclays Bank played an important role
in the funding of the science park. The manager, who took something of
a punt in this respect, was of course then promptly moved on, because
it was felt that he had overstretched his remit. I am very sympathetic
to the idea of regionalism, but we have to see it in the context of a
secure structure, without creating the rather weak structures which
collapsed in other countries. We have to focus especially on the issue
of relationship

remind noble Lords that, going back to the second half of the 19th
century, when an industry got into trouble the regional bank failed and
the whole region became depressed, often for a decade or more. The
principle at that time, led by individuals such as Walter Bagehot, was
to create national banks to spread the risk. Therefore, I am not sure

policy has been anti-competition going back to at least Barings. I
remember more than 10 years ago having an extensive debate
with the late Sir Eddy George when he was Governor of the Bank of
England, because it was stated policy that lender of last resort
facilities would apply only to banks that were too big to fail. It
seemed to me completely the wrong way round in that it gave smaller
banks a disadvantage in terms of what they had to pay for deposits.
Lots of them, such as Hambros, closed down. It created the great risk,
for which we subsequently paid the price with the banking crisis.
Elements of uncompetitive measures have been the big—very much
higher—capital ratios that smaller banks have been obliged to
have in relation to mortgage lending; the costs of the payment system;
and the difficulty of getting a banking licence. If I may boast, I
think that Metro Bank is the first new high street bank to have been
set up in 120
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000084">However,
I therefore have some sympathy with the second part of the amendment of
the noble Lord, Lord Sharkey. What he is saying, in my language, is
that we want high street banks that will get dug into their communities
and will naturally get involved with sponsoring activities in those
communities. That is exactly what Metro Bank is doing. It is very good
business to do it and very popular. When we open branches, there are
queues of people waiting to come in and open accounts because they are
so fed up with the appalling service that they have had from the
banking oligopoly for the past few years. It was, indeed, very much an
oligopoly. I think it was Lloyds that first decided that you could cut
all service and just leave people with telephone numbers to dial. The
other banks all followed, with a very substantial boost to profits as a
result. For customers, however, it has been one of the biggest factors
in making the large banks so

think the outlook is encouraging. Metro Bank plans to have something
like 6% of the nation’s deposit base by 2020, which is not that
far away. There are other new banks coming up. I believe that the face
of the banking scene, even if the Government do not do much about it,
will look very different in some 10 years’ time. One
of the issues is that the big banks are simply too big to manage. The
have archaic silo systems, which are an enormous problem to them. Their
activities are simply too large. The requirement for increases in
capital will lead to them shrinking their balance sheets and, rather
like the old-fashioned huge department stores in the US, it is
inevitable that business pressures will lead to their
decline.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000086">I
attended an interesting meeting that was addressed by Andrew Bailey,
the head of the PRA, this morning. He made the point that perhaps the
regulator had been wrong to require small new banks to have much higher
capital ratios against certain forms of lending. The logic for that was
that new banks were more risky—fair dice—but its net
effect simply increased the oligopoly strength of the existing large
banks. The PRA is looking constructively at making capital ratios, as
far as possible, the same across the board, whether banks are large or
small. So the PRA is very much on to the need for more banking
competition and for it to be supportive and helpful to new banks, as
opposed to having rules that hinder
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000087">The

requirement to look into the subject would be no bad thing. However, as
I said, while I fully support the principle of more high street banks
doing the things that high street banks always did, I am less

Glasman (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to speak in favour
of the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Sharkey. It is very
important that we recognise the severity of the situation relating to
the banks and precisely what happened in 2008. I commend the localism
agenda of the Government in terms of politics, but I wait to see how
the localism agenda applies to banking institutions and their
restructuring. It is very important to see the four root causes of the
crash.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000089">The
first is that it is not only the state that centralises power; it is
also capital that centralises. There is a consistent tendency to
oligopoly and then to monopoly, unless there are constraints on that.
What we have seen, and what we continue to see, is that 80% of our
banking still goes through the same failed institutions, and what we
have is more of the same, rather than something distinctly different.
What we have is a collapse of regional business investment, which is
extremely harmful and manifests itself in two ways: in constraints on
productivity on one side and, on the other, the extraordinary growth of
payday lenders, as the banks cannot deal with local needs. So
centralisation is one 
<?notus-xml column=364?>aspect of the crash, and a lack of accountability in the
structures of the bank is the other. This is where I am very
much in favour of what my noble friend Lord Eatwell says, with one
proviso<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:45:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000090">Relationality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:45:39"></hs_TimeCode>
is crucial and, when there is representation of interests in the
corporate governance of banks, you have a greater degree of honesty. If
you look at the story with the Spanish banks and the German local
banks, you find that the constraints on them were eased and they were,
in fact, acting like normal profit-maximising banks. They had lost
their regional commitment and got themselves involved in series of
overextended loans, very similar to ours. I say to the noble Lord, Lord
Flight, that that is not a condemnation of regional banks; it is a
condemnation of the fact that they ceased to be
regional<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:46:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000091">One
anecdote that crystallises the problem is the example of Northern
Counties Permanent Building Society, which was established in 1850 and
flourished through 150 years. It went through four depressions, grew
and merged as a mutual in 1965—noble Lords will see where this
story is going—with the Rock Building Society. It then became
the Northern Rock Building Society, which did well until 1997, when it
was demutualised. It became the fourth largest mortgage lender in the
country and sponsored Newcastle United but it also, by the maximisation
of returns, completely lost its asset. We do not need any symbolism
here; Newcastle United Football Club used to be sponsored by Northern
Rock and now it is sponsored by Wonga. That is the reality of the
circumstance that you confront, and there is no virtue in that; it is
of no benefit to
anybody<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:47:12"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is centralisation, lack of accountability, recklessness and deceit.
They are all part of the same story of being unable to hold anybody to
account. Without incentives to virtue, unfortunately, you get
incentives to vice. That was the system, and it is the system that we
still
have.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000092">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:47:37"></hs_TimeCode>
want to speak for the logic and the virtue of the amendments proposed
here. The first element is regionality. As I say, all the cases that my
noble friend Lord Eatwell and the noble Lord, Lord Flight, referred to,
concerning Germany and Spain and their regional banks, were due to
those banks no longer being regional. When there is a constraint on the
bank to lend within a prescribed geographic area, banks will flourish.
We can see how effective that has been from the Sparkassen in Germany.
I remember the noble Lord, Lord Flight, a while ago referring to the
stability of the German system being based on its currency, but it is
also based on the fact that there is a regional banking system that
sustains business through ups and downs, and where there is a genuine
local knowledge of what is going on in those businesses as well as a
vocational work
scheme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:48:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000093">The
third part of this is the most important—that is, the
representation of the skills and knowledge of the workforce and
stakeholders in the corporate governance of the firm. This leads to a
balance of interests that holds people accountable. I completely agree
with my noble friend Lord Eatwell about the stress on regionality and
relationships in the second part of the amendment; relational banking
is absolutely essential. However, that implies local knowledge and the
restoration of what we have lost, which is trust. So 
<?notus-xml column=365?>this is not a quick fix. I commend the work of the most reverend Primate
the Archbishop of Canterbury in talking about a 10 to 15-year structure
of reconstituting credit and trust in the nation. There will have to be
a coalition between different stakeholders in doing so. But it is a
terrible missed opportunity when we have an asset that has not been
regionalised and has not been subject to proper balance of power in
corporate governance, with no regional accountability in it to look at
bad practice and correct it before it reaches the taxpayer. Above all,
as the story of Northern Rock teaches time and again, if you maximise
immediate returns on investment, you will lose the
asset<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:49:16"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:48:27"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:49:34"></hs_TimeCode>.
There have to be constraints on that which allow capital to maintain
its presence in areas and be a partner to business and families. In
terms of regionality, relationships, stakeholder accountability and
non-maximisation, this amendment holds the key to the establishment of
the banking system that must come

Savings Bank is unique in Britain as it is the last mutual
trustee savings bank in the country. I declare an interest as I have
had an account there since I was six and my father also had an account
there from the age of six. The difference between Airdrie Savings Bank
and other banks is that it cannot offer the gizmos offered by the big
high street banks. However, it offers a localised service that is
completely trustworthy. There are no two ways about it: it has had its
difficulties throughout the crisis, as has every part of the financial
services industry. However, because it is unique, sometimes there is a
risk that its needs are forgotten about. I ask the Minister to ask
officials to look specifically at how an institution such as Airdrie
Savings Bank can be protected. It is, indeed, a very venerable bank; my
noble friend Lord McFall addressed an event at its 150th anniversary
some eight or nine years ago. The bank is completely rooted in its
community. The only perk its directors get is a fish supper once a

Higgins (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, both these amendments have much
to commend them. The point that I would like to pick up regarding
Amendment 43 is the position of the banks in which the taxpayer has a
large holding. Having bailed out a number of banks, it is extraordinary
that the Government have stood back completely from any
involvement at all in what those banks are doing. In the context of
competition, which we are now discussing, there is a strong case for
them to set an example. This would enable at least a degree of
competition to be introduced at this stage without much
delay<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:54:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000099">Amendment
102 also has much to commend it. It suggests that the inquiry should
look into a series of aspects with regard to banks such as the
level of competition, the obstacles to it, other actions and so on. One
should add to that a careful study of what the economies of scale in
banking actually are, because I suspect the reality is that they do not
exist to anywhere near the extent that the size of the banks at present
would suggest. On the other hand, we would find that there were major
diseconomies of scale, not least the enormous risks to which we have
been exposed as a result of banks being the size that they are. We
frequently say that they are not only too big to fail but too big to
manage. It is clear that they are too big to manage, and that is a
major diseconomy of

an appropriate size or whether some consideration ought to be given to
whether competition would be increased if they were broken

curious that competition in this area has been, as far as I can see, in
no way affected by this or any previous Government’s overall
competition policy, which has simply not been applied here. If, as the

That is a stunning statistic. The fact that some of the small German
banks failed in the great crisis seems to reflect a strength and virtue
as compared with the situation in this country where, but for the
injection of in excess of £80 billion of taxpayers’
funds, as far as I can see the whole banking system would have failed.
The big clearers would have gone to the wall—that is the truth.

issue, also recommended that the Government should examine the scope
for the disposal of any RBS good bank as a multiple entity. I think
that these studies were called for by the end of September. We have now

are also other concerns. As well as trying to increase competition
faster than would be achieved under RBS’s current plans, we
should always be seeking to return RBS to its position as a fully
effective lender, particularly to SMEs. We are asking it to reconstruct
itself so that it gets back into the private sector and becomes a
ring-fenced bank and a non-ring-fenced bank. My concern is that if we
also ask it to start work on a regional agenda now, that will simply

Eatwell and Lord Sharkey, have done the Committee a service by raising
this issue. Four years on from 2010, when the Government came into

capital, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, said, is more expensive; and
SMEs’ credit is still drying up. The problem is that British
banking lacks a “spare tyre”, as Adam Posen of the
Monetary Policy Committee said. I remember a conversation that I had
with Stephen Hester when he was chief executive of the Royal Bank of
Scotland. He said, “If you have new entrants into the banks, all
they will do is replicate the business model that already exists. You
need a Google, a Yahoo or a Facebook to have that disruptive

will see very little improvement at all in five or 10 years’

establishing regional banks—an aspiration which the most
reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury articulated—we
need a secure structure. We have to understand how small banks failed.

changes now underway are most dramatic in the rapid growth in

the system is safer. The individual who said that was a certain Tim
Geithner, who the President of the United States then appointed as the

individual institutions but Mr Geithner, like the IMF and others, was
clueless about the interconnectedness of the banks, which is why the

noble friend Lady Liddell mentioned the Airdrie Savings Bank. I was

The Airdrie Savings Bank was a fly on the back of the elephant that was
the Royal Bank of Scotland. However, the Airdrie Savings Bank prospered

and, as it were, swallowing up smaller banks here than they are
elsewhere? We had smaller regional banks for a number of years in the
19th century and later. Then we had the concentration of only five
large clearing banks left and then even fewer. One question that the
competition authority ought to ask is, “Are the economies of
scale technological, or is it just that larger banks can borrow money
on the money market at a more favourable rate than small banks can? Or
are we as authorities putting serious restrictions in the path of small
banks to stop them from starting and prospering? Are we imposing extra
costs on the small banks so that the large banks get away with lower
costs than small banks?”. Those are the questions that we ought
to examine.</hs_para>

do not particularly mind whether these are regional banks—what
we need is more diversity in banking. Regional and local banks may have
failed not because there is something wrong with being local or
regional but because there was a storm of cheap credit available and
people decided that even if you were a local bank you could still get
into the American subprime mortgage market to make money. That is what
ruined people; it was not being regional. In a globalised market you
have access to buying and selling assets all over the world. German

creating small banks that would have special competitive

is not true to say that there has been no fundamental thinking by the
Government on the structure of banking and the need for greater
competition. That is why we asked the Independent Commission on Banking
to investigate competition issues in the UK as a key part of its work.
Half of its report covered competition issues. It identified a number
of issues and areas which needed action and we are taking
forward its recommendations for dealing with these. For example, we are
removing the competitive advantage big banks get from being seen by the
market as too big to fail through the ring-fence. We have secured a new
seven-day switching service, delivered by industry to
tackle inertia in the personal current account and SME business
account market. This service was launched on 16 September.

sympathy with the general point that the system has worked very slowly
in the past. The FSA was extremely slow in many ways, but one of the
features of the way the new system works is that a greater degree of
urgency is injected. I give as an example the document on consumer
credit published by the FCA last week. The FCA does not take
responsibility for consumer credit until next April, but well
in advance of that date it has produced a comprehensive plan of how it
wants to proceed. This is much more rigorous than anything we have seen
in that area in the past. To a considerable extent, the regulators have

talking about trying to manipulate the LIBOR rate or PPI or identity
insurance—you can go on and on—there is the sheer scale,
impersonality and lack of relationship or any sort of customer

grossly immoral way. That is the way to deal with the narrow point my
noble friend makes. The whole question of the culture of the banks is
addressed only partially in the legislation because it is by definition
a cultural issue. We are taking very significant steps to regulate

have been a lot of strong, very well argued and diverse views, but
there have also been some general themes. For example, there was a
feeling that getting close to the customer is absolutely critical. I
entirely agree with that. In fact, I fear that without this there is
little chance of reforming the banking culture at all. There also seems
to have been a general desire in the Chamber to discuss again the
issues raised and to see whether on Report there could be a way of

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, this clause and the new schedule to the
Bill in Amendment 105 have the effect of amending the Banking Act 2009
to provide the Bank of England with a new stabilisation
option—the bail-in option. Bail-in involves shareholders of a
failing bank being divested of their shares or having their holdings
severely diluted and creditors of the bank 
<?notus-xml column=377?>having their claims cancelled, reduced or deferred
to the extent necessary to restore the bank to financial viability.
During the financial crisis it was not possible simply to allow banks
which failed to enter insolvency, as other companies do when they fail.
This is because of how interconnected the banking system is and because
of the need to protect the banks’ customers by ensuring that
they could continue to access essential banking services. This
protection came at a very high cost to the taxpayer. These new powers
will provide one solution to that problem by offering an alternative to
insolvency which exposes shareholders and creditors to the losses of
the bank, while enabling the bank to continue to operate as a going
concern. This will help to ensure that taxpayers are never again
required to bear all the costs of resolving failing banks.</hs_para>

has long been the Government’s policy to develop such bail-in
powers. This was an important strand of the Government’s
response to the recommendations of the Independent Commission on
Banking. The UK has also been at the forefront of the international
development of bail-in. Along with other G20 countries, we endorsed the
Financial Stability Board’s recommendation on bail-in in
November 2011. We have also worked hard at ensuring that the EU would
agree a feasible and credible bail-in tool, and have made substantial
progress recently in this area. We believe that EU agreement on a
common resolution recovery directive is near and, for this reason, the
Government are now confident enough about the content of the directive
to be able to bring forward bail-in powers through this Bill.</hs_para>

amendments, paragraph 1 of the schedule introduces the bail-in option
as an additional stabilisation option in the Banking Act 2009. When the
bail-in option is deployed, the Bank of England can cancel, reduce or
defer liabilities of the bank for the purposes of recapitalising it and
restoring it to viability. It may also transfer some or all of the
bank’s securities to a bail-in administrator to hold securities
of the bank, or to perform other tasks as specified by the Bank of
England, on a temporary basis. In any event, shares held by the
original shareholders would be expected to be transferred or severely

schedule sets out the conditions for use of the bail-in option. These
are that the bank is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the
conditions for authorisation, that no action is likely to be taken to
restore the bank to compliance and that the exercise of the
power is necessary having regard to the public interest in: the

liabilities that are excluded from the power to make special bail-in
provision. These liabilities are excluded for one of two main 
<?notus-xml column=378?>reasons: either because they would not have been exposed to losses in
insolvency or because exercising the bail-in powers on them would be
likely to impede the resolution of the firm or create wider market
instability. This includes deposits protected by the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme or similar overseas deposit guarantee schemes,
liabilities to the extent that they are secured, client assets,
short-term liabilities owed to certain financial institutions outside
the affected firm’s group, certain liabilities
arising in respect of central counterparties and settlement

the Bank of England exercises its special powers to bail in liabilities

had been allowed to fail and enter insolvency. In terms of economic
effects, this means that the failing bank’s shareholders would
be divested of their shares, or otherwise have their claims severely
diluted, and subordinated debt holders would be exposed to losses.
Senior debt holders would generally be exposed to losses only after
subordinated debt holders. It would also generally be the case that

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, we can forgive the noble Lord, Lord
Newby, for taking some time to introduce the amendment and schedule; I
believe that they are by themselves longer than the original
Bill. It has been one of the significant matters that those of us who
wish to comment on this legislation have had to
digest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000169">An
issue that the noble Lord did not address, which has been a major
concern in the academic literature that has been looking at the issue
of bail-ins and resolution regimes, is that the bail-in regime may in
itself create contagion and systemic risk. One has to consider
that well over 50% of the liabilities of a typical large bank consist
of some form of interbank loans and investments. Therefore, by bailing
in one particular bank you are spreading the contagion to the
banks that will consequently be bailed in. Could the Minister brief us
on the Government’s thinking on that
issue?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000170">I have
a number of questions on particular points about the bail-in schedule,
and I will try to address them in a reasonably logical direction. The
first point is that there seems to be no satisfactory transition
arrangements for those who might be bailed in. In other words, people
who have purchased financial instruments or made investments in advance
of this legislation will, as I understand it, subsequently be at risk
from the legislation even though, at the time then they made the
investment, that risk did not exist. That seems unreasonable. Would it
not be appropriate for them to have some grandfathering that would
allow them to escape this risk if they had acquired the instrument in
advance?</hs_para>

speak—of course, economists always like to be two-handed in
these respects; I believe it was President Truman who asked to have
one-armed economists—the principle of no less favourable
treatment is equally unreasonable. If an individual purchases a
financial instrument knowing the nature of the risk to which he or she
is exposed, why should they then be protected by the principle of no
less favourable treatment from bail-in or insolvency? They are aware of
the risk and should surely take responsibility for it.</hs_para>

conditions for bail-in, the Minister noted that liabilities
representing protected deposits were excluded liabilities. That means
that ordinary people with bank accounts with sums in them that are
below the Financial Services Compensation Scheme limit are
appropriately protected. However, now and again ordinary people will
typically go way over that limit, even people who usually have quite
modest accounts. For example, in the process of property purchase and
sale one sometimes has peculiar large deposits in one’s bank
account for a short period, or when receiving a lump sum in connection
with a pension scheme you typically have a peculiarly large deposit for
a short period. Will these people be at risk? The schedule suggests
that they would be. What measures are available to ensure that they
would not?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000173">The
next point I wish to turn to was raised by the Minister with respect to
banking groups. The bail-in option refers to a stabilisation power in
respect of a “banking group company”. That suggests that
they might be companies outside the ring-fence. Why is this necessary
outwith the ring-fence if the ring-fence is deemed to work? If the
ring-fence is protecting depositors and the maintenance of financial
services in the way that the Government have argued, why are these
measures necessary outside the ring-fence? Perhaps the Minister will
enlighten
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000174">To move on

Turnbull:</Member></B> My Lords, these clauses exemplify the maxim,
“be careful what you wish for”. The parliamentary
commission recommended that the UK Government should prepare a UK
version of the bail-in scheme being negotiated in the EU as a
precaution against the possibility that the EU scheme could be delayed.
One only has to look at the Solvency II directive to know how long
these things can take. We have a slightly different explanation today,
which is that we are sufficiently close to finalising the EU scheme
that it is safe to proceed to legislate for it. In other words, that
implies that this is a substantive scheme, not an interim scheme that
might in due course be replaced by an EU scheme. I wonder if the

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, I can see something like a bail-in
scheme working satisfactorily with regard to a bank the size of the
Co-op Bank, for example, and indeed the proposals to bondholders are
effectively a do-it-yourself bail-in scheme. However, in the unlikely
event that it was necessary, if a bank as large as Lloyds Bank were in
trouble, I find it difficult to believe that the situation could be
resolved by a bail-in scheme. This is in part for the reasons that
others have given, that the knock-on effects to the rest of the banking
system are too large. So while the bail-in system makes great sense, I
do not think it can be a sort of universal solvent to the possible need
for taxpayer money to be used when huge banks are in trouble, or for so
long as we have huge
banks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T16:52:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000179"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Blackwell" PimsId="4025" UID="13101586000376" xid="1079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000376">Lord
Blackwell (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, in asking Parliament to approve

he believes is built into this legislation for the inappropriate use of
these powers. I understand why having a regime in place that allows a
speedy resolution to be enacted is desirable. If that is to come about,
it needs to happen very quickly and efficiently when the circumstances
call for it. The draft legislation sets out the conditions under which
those powers might be exercised. The new Section 8A of Schedule 2 talks
about appropriate conditions

points give me some cause for concern, some of which have been made by

still a considerable risk of contagion if one suddenly bails in a

repercussions elsewhere in the banking system. I am not entirely clear
to what extent the Government have taken that particular risk of
contagion into consideration. These are quite complicated matters, and

first question the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, raised, was the question
of contagion. My first point here is a general one. The markets now
expect the bail-in powers to be one of the options available if banks
get into difficulty. They seem generally to accept this as an option,
and they are adjusting their own activities to the extent that they
feel that is necessary in recognition that this will now be part of the
environment in which they work. However, in an individual case, if the
Bank felt that there was a risk to financial stability by exercising
the full bail-in option, which covers all the assets or liabilities of
the bank, it could decide not to bail in all of them but to be
selective in a manner that would reduce the possibility of
contagion.</hs_para>

addition, in circumstances where a bank is going under, if you do not
go down this other route, virtually whatever else you do with it, there
is a risk of contagion. That is one of the considerations that will be
in the mind of the Bank of England. Of course, if the Bank felt that
there was a risk to the whole system if a particular bank went down, it
has the powers under the Banking Act to nationalise it, which is
another way of protecting the system and the stability of the system.
This is another possible approach, but under the Banking Act it is now
one of only four possible ways of dealing with the problem of a failing

Surely one of the key arguments about the ring-fence is that there is
an implicit guarantee from the public authorities not to allow

worth a lot of money to those banks that have been too big to fail.
Surely the whole point about the ring-fence is that those outwith it

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, we now turn to the government amendments
which implement another important part of the recommendations
of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards on senior persons
and banking standards rules. This group also contains a number of
amendments to the amendments the Government have tabled. I begin by
explaining how the government amendments will deliver the goal of
improving standards of conduct in
banking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000208">The
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards concluded that the
current system for approving those in senior positions in
banks—the approved persons regime—had failed. It saw it
as overly complex and unable to ensure that individual responsibilities
were adequately defined or that clear expectations were set for those
holding key roles. The commission’s central recommendation in
this area is for the creation of a senior persons regime applying to
senior bankers. The regime for senior managers in banks will have the
following features. It will reverse the burden of proof so that senior
bankers will have to show that they did what was reasonable when a bank
fails to comply with regulatory requirements in their area of
responsibility, or face regulatory action for misconduct. It will have
mandatory statements of responsibility, so that whenever someone is a
candidate to be a senior manager in a bank, the bank will have to set
out clearly what aspects of the bank’s business they will be
responsible for. There will be powers for the regulators to make
conduct rules for senior managers in banks instead of the old system of
statements of principles supported by codes of practice. There will be
a requirement that the register kept by the FCA must state who is a
senior manager in a bank and give details of regulatory action taken
against
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000209" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000209">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:13:26"></hs_TimeCode>
new regime for senior managers will also retain the tools which the
regulators have under the existing approved persons regime. The
regulators will also retain their tough powers under FSMA to impose
unlimited fines on, or publish notices of censure about, senior
managers in banks. It may sometimes still be appropriate for the
regulators to approve people to perform functions that are not senior
management functions but which still involve important
responsibilities. The Government have therefore chosen to retain the
power for the regulator to pre-approve individuals to perform functions
outside the senior managers regime. It is for the regulators to
determine what functions, if any, should be subject to
pre-approval outside the senior managers regime. I am confident that
noble Lords will agree that retaining this power is a sensible
safeguard at a time when concerns about individual standards in
financial services remain acute.</hs_para>

addition to the regime for bank senior managers, the commission also
recommended the introduction of a standards regime that would apply to
a wider class of individuals who work in banks. The Government have
therefore provided the regulators with a new power to make conduct
rules for anyone who is employed by a bank, even if they are not a
senior manager or other approved person. This is an extension of
regulatory power in relation to individuals, and gives the regulators
the power to impose a single set of banking standards rules for all who
work in banks. Employees of banks could face disciplinary action if
they breach these standards rules or if they are knowingly concerned in
regulatory breaches by the bank. The regulators will not be compelled
to make conduct rules. They will be able, quite properly, to exercise
their supervisory judgment to determine who in a bank should be subject
to rules, and what standards to impose.</hs_para>

also recommended including provision for time-limited and conditional
approvals of senior bankers, and longer time limits for the regulators
to take disciplinary action against individuals. The Government also
accepted these recommendations. Accordingly, the Bill will allow the
regulator to grant approval to perform senior management functions in
banks subject to conditions, as well as to take steps to vary an
approval it has already given, for example by imposing new
conditions.</hs_para>

to the amendments tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Brennan, Lord McFall
and Lord Watson. Amendments 46A, 46B and 47A seek to ensure that
responsibility for preventing money laundering and other financial
crime is also a senior management function. The Government agree with
concerns that underpin these amendments. UK banks should uphold the
highest standards in preventing criminal activity, and not facilitate
it. Where there is evidence that banks have not lived up to those
standards, the people at the top should be held to account. I reassure
noble Lords that the new regime for senior managers will deliver
precisely that accountability in relation to financial crime.
Therefore, while we can all support the result that the noble Lords
want to achieve, I can assure them that these amendments are
unnecessary and there are no loopholes when it comes to such
matters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000213">I
shall try to explain why. The definition of “senior” is
quite comprehensive. It encompasses all aspects of the bank’s
operations and would therefore include responsibility for aspects of a
bank’s operations that are concerned with the prevention of
financial crime, where those aspects could involve serious consequences
for the bank, for business or other interests in the United Kingdom.
The amendments could in fact have the unintended effect of requiring
junior staff with specific duties in relation to financial crime to be
treated as senior managers. That would run in the opposite direction to
what the parliamentary commission intended, which was to focus on
senior persons in charge of all aspects of the bank’s
activities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000214">Amendment
53A has two limbs. The first seeks to ensure the operational objectives

persons or bank employees. I can assure your Lordships that this part
of that amendment is unnecessary. The reference to the
operational objectives in new

objectives as defined in Sections 1B, 1C, 1D and 1E of FiSMA, without

second limb of Amendment 53A, and Amendment 53B, would require both
regulators to use their new powers to make rules of conduct
specifically about the conduct of individuals responsible for
preventing money laundering or other financial crime. I am not sure
what these changes would add. The Fraud Act 2006, the Proceeds of Crime
Act 2002 and the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 already bite on bank
senior managers. Adding regulatory rules mandating compliance with
statutory requirements would add little. Further, the regulators
already have a power to make conduct rules applying to persons in banks
who have responsibility for compliance with money laundering
regulations and other laws creating financial crimes. We certainly
expect the regulators to use this power to make rules about aspects of
conduct that include ensuring that firms comply with their obligations
relating to money laundering and preventing financial crime. However,
to single these areas out in primary legislation adds little bite to
the existing regime and is, we believe, unnecessary. I hope, therefore,
that noble Lords will agree not to press those
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101586000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101586000216">I
also assure the noble Lords, Lord Brennan, Lord McFall and Lord Watson,
that Amendment 54A is unnecessary. The reference to an application for
approval in a context which refers to a person approved under Section

is no other section under which such an application can be made. I

forward on Report in another place. The government amendments, which
implement the commission’s key recommendations, go much further
than the noble Lords’ amendment, which would really just rename
the existing approved persons regime as a “licensed persons
regime”, and that is all. It would not deliver the real

continuing exercise of responsibility at the most senior levels within
banks. A major cause of this flaw was that responsibilities were ill
defined and were not joined up, so that those at the top could claim
they “didn’t know” or, “It wasn’t

what the definition means. Does it meet the commission’s

Could it be a ring-fenced bank, a non-ring-fenced entity conducting
investment activities within a group, a whole group or a freestanding
investment bank? In our view, the new senior managers regime should
apply to all such entities. It would make a mockery of the scheme if,
as I suspect may be the case, it applied only to banks taking deposits
from the general public—that is, ring-fenced banks. It would be
completely unacceptable if the regime did not apply, for example, to
the senior managers overseeing the LIBOR traders, to those overseeing
rogue traders such as the “London Whale”, to those
overseeing the marketing of highly dubious packages of sliced and diced
mortgages or to those engaged in the mis-selling of interest rate
swaps. I very much hope that the Minister will be able to give us an
answer today or address this between now and Report.</hs_para>

Trenchard (Con):</Member></B> I intervene to ask the
Minister to comment on some concerns that I have about this new
“approved persons” or senior managers’ regime.
First, I am worried that it will place British banks at a considerable
disadvantage when they try to recruit the most talented managers
available, not just from the United Kingdom but from around the world.
Everybody agrees that bank management failed, so it is clear that the
supervision of senior mangers needs to be enhanced and improved. For
example, someone may be offered a job to work in Hong Kong, where he
would probably pay less tax anyway, and he is unlikely to run the risk
of being individually liable or culpable in that jurisdiction. I am not
sure which other jurisdictions intend to introduce some kind of senior
managers’ regime such as
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:28:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101593000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101593000002">My
second concern is that it seems to me that it is up to the manager to
prove that he was not negligent in the exercise of his
responsibilities. It is wrong that a senior manager should be deemed to
be guilty unless he can prove his innocence. My third concern is that
to increase the individual responsibilities of senior managers will
have the unintended consequence of diminishing the responsibility of
the board of directors as a whole, or the executive committee, risk
committee, or whichever committee it may be.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:29:05"></hs_TimeCode> have sat on an
executive committee of a bank and often the business being discussed
was not my responsibility, but I felt that I should understand what was
going on and what the discussion was about because I was collectively
responsible as a member of that committee. What worries me is that if
it is very clear that the individual manager is going to be
responsible, that effectively diminishes the responsibilities of the
other members of the committee. It also diminishes the ability of the
chief executive to change the responsibilities of his senior team based
on his judgment, because it would be too complicated as each department
or division would effectively be under the supervision of people
outside the chief executive’s control. Can the Minister comment
on these points as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:30:06"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_time UID="13101593000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0001.htm#13101593000065">5.30

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the points made by the noble
Viscount, Lord Trenchard. It is entirely understandable that people in
this country are furious when they see individuals whom they blame for
the system blowing up getting off scot free. On that front there are
two points. First, if monetary policy is too lax for a long time, it
will almost inevitably lead to bad lending by banks because, in some
sense, banks are an automatic conduit of money. That really is what
happened in the UK—because of the 2% inflation target, the Bank
of England did not acknowledge that there was much higher inflation
here off-set by imported deflation. We had easy money for far too long
that filtered its way through into bad lending by banks. I remind the
House that it was not investment banks but one or 
<?notus-xml column=391?>other form of bad lending—old-fashioned bad
lending such as HBOS or buying CDO instruments from the US. It is not
just individuals when a banking system blows up but the background as
well.</hs_para>

greatly the useless and negligent regulators as well. Why did they not
spot the problem? Why should they get off scot free as well? They have
a job. Their task is to keep an eye and make sure that the banking
system is safe. If they fail completely in the discharging of that, to
some extent they are as guilty as reckless people running banks badly.
There is certainly an argument for saying that it would be desirable to
bring in draconian powers against the executives of banks, harmonised
internationally. I would be more comfortable if the same sort of
measures applied in the US, Hong Kong and continental
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:32:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

slightly quirky point relating to anti money-laundering since anti
money-laundering amendments have arisen. It seems to me that in some
ways anti money-laundering has gone slightly over the top.
Noble Lords may be aware that, following the large fine given by the US
authorities to HSBC, HSBC has simply fired all its US clients in the
UK. It has closed their accounts. It has said it no longer wants the
risk of dealing with Americans. This has caused huge inconvenience to
lots of Americans living in London. Going forward, I can see if other
dangers present themselves to other banks, they may decide that it is
not worth having a particular category of
client<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:33:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

can see is an unaccountable body laying down anti money-laundering
rules, decided to blacklist a number of countries it felt were not
practising anti money-laundering measures adequately. This led to some
30 embassies in the UK finding their bank accounts were likewise closed
by HSBC. Some of the embassies found it virtually impossible to obtain
a new bank account. If there was a branch of a bank from their country
in this country they could go there but most other banks would not take
them on as a client because they had been blacklisted by FATF. That
again seemed slightly
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:34:22"></hs_TimeCode> fly in the
face of embassies being approved by the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office. Its reaction to this matter, I gather, was to express regret
but not to do anything. I raised this with Andrew Bailey from the PRA.
He felt it was extremely wrong and was quite surprised it had happened.
This is a slightly different issue from where we are in the Bill but I
would just say to the Minister that the Treasury needs to keep a little
watch on what is going on in the anti money-laundering territory and
its knock-on effects. I certainly think it is time that FATF, which is
the top body laying down all this, were accountable to somebody. Both
the Treasury and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office effectively said
to me that they could not interfere with FATF—whatever it says

the part of the Bill that controls how and what people in banks do so
that this kind of dishonesty is not furthered, we should err on the
side of authority. I invite those advising the Minister to avoid the
legislative naiveté I dealt with at Second Reading, or in months

comment by lawyers advising banks. The first rule the lawyers will pick

confidence that past experience shows would be misplaced. They should

of dealing with the proceeds of crime or the results of fraud. There

the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, and to have my name on these amendments.
At Second Reading, I mentioned that the Parliamentary Commission on
Banking Standards was charged with looking at culture and standards. We
found a culture that was rotten and standards that were abysmally low.
That applies particularly in the area of senior management and we need
to ensure that the individuals, the organisations and the regulator do
something about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:49:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101593000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#13101593000020">My
concern is that these amendments might not fully deal with the anti
money-laundering failings that we have
seen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:49:10"></hs_TimeCode>. I looked
to the <I>Economist</I>, courtesy of the December 2012 issue, to recap
on what we have seen in terms of egregious examples. The biggest
money-laundering settlement with the US authorities was made by HSBC,
which settled for $1,921,000,000—about $2 billion. Its
money-laundering activities involved countries such as Cuba, Iran,
Libya, Mexico, Myanmar and Sudan. Standard Chartered’s
settlement was $667 million and the countries with which it was
involved were Iran, Libya, Myanmar and Sudan. RBS had a $500 million
settlement and it was involved with Iran and Libya. Lloyd’s
Banking Group’s was $350 million and was involved with Iran and
Sudan. The settlement for Barclays was $298 million and the countries
were Cuba, Iran, Myanmar and Sudan. These were all UK-based companies,
so our integrity as a financial centre in London is at risk as a result
of the failings that we have
seen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101593000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#13101593000021">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:50:42"></hs_TimeCode>

to the Minister is that he should not accept the words of the banks,

and the Mexican drugs, these are not victimless crimes. To put it into
context, more than 35,000 people died at the hands of Mexican drug

Financial Conduct Authority itself confirmed how widespread the problem

of high money risks. It found that 75% of banks were not taking
adequate measures to ensure that they met their legal obligations and
that more than a third were willing to accept business with a high
degree of money-laundering risk if they thought they could get away
with it. Based on that 2011 review and other findings, the FCA

the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards noted in its final

making the UK vulnerable to tax evaders, drug smugglers, arms
traffickers and corrupt politicians laundering their ill-gotten gains.
The potential for a major British bank losing its licence in a major
market would have huge ramifications for the UK
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:56:09"></hs_TimeCode>. HSBC
came perilously close to losing its licence. The Justice Department was
of a mind to take its licence away and we all know that there was
involvement from the Foreign Office and elsewhere to ensure that that
licence was not indeed taken away. This issue is hugely serious for the
integrity of our banks and for the

Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards highlighted a number of
general causes for the abysmal standards in the UK banking sector. Two
of the most important ones were the lack of personal responsibility for
senior bankers and poor enforcement of legal obligations by the
regulators. I well remember that when Tracey McDermott, the director of
enforcement, came before the commission we had another egregious 
<?notus-xml column=396?>example—one of the star traders of UBS losing
billions of pounds. When we asked her what went wrong, she said,
“We investigated the bank and the trail went cold”. The
trail went cold because there was no list of individuals responsible
for particular issues in the bank.</hs_para>

of the things we would like to see is the responsibility flipped to
individual bankers. Time and time again, as was mentioned earlier, we
had senior bankers with PPI issues coming before us and saying,
“We knew nothing about it”. It was a no-see, no-tell
policy. They were evading the responsibility and they were evading
being honest with the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards

was clear that even when personal liability could be established the

the regulator has a spine in future to ensure that the organisations

when speaking to this group of amendments. The Government are indeed to
be commended on this series of amendments. However, 
<?notus-xml column=397?>as the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, pointed out, in
certain important ways, they do not go far enough. There is also the
critical question of the definition of a bank in government Amendment
55. We would like to hear very clearly what is the definition of a bank
and we would like the Government to look again at the points that the
noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, my fellow commissioner on the banking

there are still important areas where they have not gone far
enough.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101593000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#13101593000033">I
should also like to address what lies behind this and what my noble
friends Lord Trenchard and Lord Flight said in casting doubt on the
whole drift of the provision. We have sought to say that there must be
personal responsibility on members of the senior management in banks.
It is not good enough for there simply to be fines on banks when things
have gone wrong and there has been culpability. What happens if there
are fines on banks? Who bears the burden? It is the owners of the
banks, the shareholders. The shareholders are the innocent victims
here. There must be individual responsibility on the management where
such behaviour can be demonstrated or where the management neglectfully
failed to exercise
responsibility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101593000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#13101593000034">As
the noble Lords, Lord Turnbull and Lord McFall, said, in hearing
evidence, the commission heard one of two things: either, “It
wasn’t me; it was a collective board decision, so no individual
is responsible”; or, “It wasn’t me; I had no idea
what the traders in my bank were doing; it was all them”. Of
course, we strongly suspected that the reason that they had no idea
what the traders were doing was that they took great care not to know.
The point is simple: if they did not know what the traders were doing,
they were culpable. It is their business to know what their traders are
doing. That will not wash
either.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101593000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#13101593000035">Then
we have heard the excuse: “What about the regulators? The
regulators were at fault”. So they were; that is beyond dispute.
The Government have introduced a new system of regulation and
supervision which they hope will be better than the one that preceded
it. We will come to this later, but we have suggested ways in which
that, in our judgment, needs to be further strengthened. That does not
exculpate the

has also been suggested that the Bank of England was pursuing an
inappropriately cheap money policy and, therefore: “What were
the bankers meant to do? It is the Bank of England’s
fault”. I shall not detain the House by going into this now, but
it is arguable whether the cheap money policy was wrong or right at the
time. I think that you could make a very good case that it was
appropriate at the time, but anyhow, whether it was wrong or right, it
is no good a banker saying, “I couldn’t help making a bad

course, others were culpable. The auditors were culpable. They never
raised a finger to warn the boards of the banks of the risks that they

at<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T18:06:31"></hs_TimeCode> the end of

we were told, “Oh, there may be other jurisdictions, such as

whole thinking behind the commission on banking standards was that we

money-laundering offences are not limited to the proceeds of serious
crimes, nor are there any monetary limits. Financial transactions need
no money-laundering design or purpose for our laws to consider them a
money-laundering offence. A money-laundering offence under existing
legislation need not even involve money, since the money-laundering
legislation covers assets of any description. The law applies to a
person who by criminal conduct evades a liability such as a taxation
liability, and that individual is deemed to have obtained 
<?notus-xml column=399?>a sum of money equal in value to the liability evaded.
That is a very important point. Just a week
ago HMRC announced that every year some £35 billion
of taxes due in this country is not
collected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101593000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#13101593000044">With<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
that in mind, we should be careful about setting aside the idea that
money-laundering is an issue. I suggest that it is very much an issue.
My noble friends have rightly outlined a number of reasons why we
really cannot afford to miss the opportunity the Bill provides to deal
with failures in anti money-laundering compliance. Not only would that
compromise the outstanding work and considerable efforts of the
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, it could have a tragic
human cost. Some of the most vulnerable people in poor countries around
the world suffer in many ways as a result of the effects of
money-laundering.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101593000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#13101593000045">I
want to stress the matter of
our<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> own economy.
The parliamentary commission rightly argued that good standards in the
banking industry are important for not only the health of that sector,
but the wider UK economy as a whole. Correspondingly, failures in
standards jeopardise the health of our economy. That may seem
self-evident, but surely the banking sector in this country has been
responsible for enough damage to our economy in recent
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101593000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#13101593000046">It<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

lead to any further damage. I suggest that there is a real risk
of that, notwithstanding that, as was highlighted by the noble Lord,

HSBC has taken rather stringent measures as a result of being hauled
over the coals in the US. If as a result some individuals have lost out
or been inconvenienced, as he seemed to be suggesting, then that is
regrettable. However, it is really pretty small beer

parts of the British banking

such as these. In preparing for this part of our discussions this
afternoon, I looked at the Bill in detail. I was able to find a total
of eight separate pieces of legislation mentioned in the Bill, as it
was originally published. Not once in the Bill did I find any mention
of the words “anti money-laundering”, for a start. Nor
did I find any mention at all of the three pieces of
legislation—the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the Fraud Act 2006,
or the Money-laundering Regulations 2007—in some of the
amendments we are discussing. Apparently the Government do not think
that there is any need to link, at least explicitly, those pieces of
legislation with the Bill. That is a grave

anti money-laundering and the legislative provisions that he referred

say that I support the intention of the amendments which the Government

supervision for those taking management responsibilities within

concern about the amendments introduced by the noble Lord, Lord
Brennan, is that by singling out one group of activities, however
important, we might give the impression that a lot of other things are
not as important. The schema at the moment is drafted quite
generically. It will eventually leave a lot to the discretion of the
regulators—which I think is right—so that they can
operate it in an effective manner. However, by singling out the
particular legislation that the noble Lord, Lord Watson of Invergowrie,
referred to—the Fraud Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act and the
Money Laundering Regulations—it seems to me that a lot of things
are not said.</hs_para><hs_time UID="131015105001076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105001076">6.15

Lord referred to lawyers immediately looking at what is said and what
is not said in legislation. I therefore put it to him that after his
amendments a number of important things would not be said in this
legislation, which might lead people to think that they were not
intended to be covered. For example, issues which are similar to
money-laundering but which were not mentioned by the noble
Lord’s amendments are terrorism financing offences and sanctions
offences. These are very similar, and the banks operate very similar
systems to deal with money-laundering and to stop unauthorised
financial transactions with terrorists and those on sanctions lists.
However, the noble Lord’s amendments do not cover
these.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000005">Stepping
away from that, other potentially criminal activities would not be
mentioned by the legislation after the noble Lord’s amendments.
I single out the new offence which was introduced post-LIBOR, the
offence of rate manipulation, for which I cannot remember the exact
term. This would be another criminal activity which would not be
mentioned by the Bill. Beyond that, there would be a lot of very
important compliance and conduct issues that are managed by banks which
would not be caught by any specific criminality, but nevertheless would
have devastating consequences for individuals. Within the definition
these could involve a serious risk of consequences to the authorised
person or business interest of the United Kingdom, and therefore should
be caught.</hs_para>

Liddell of Coatdyke:</Member></B> My Lords, I found that to be a very
interesting speech from the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. She took up a
point that I had been thinking about, but we come at the prevention of
terrorism from a different point of view. I believe that with this
legislation the prevention of terrorism interface would be through
money-laundering. Certainly it could be wider than that in relation to
sanctions regimes and so on, but the specific area of prevention of
terrorism relates quite directly to the ability of organisations such
as al-Qaeda to put money through the system, apparently cleanly. They
hope—and are able to be fairly confident—that there would
not be the rigorous review and analysis that there should be by
sufficiently senior people within the banking
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000008">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T18:19:38"></hs_TimeCode>

who I regret is not in his place, said something which I must admit
prompted me to speak in support of the amendments of my noble friends.
He spoke about the fact that we would seek to attract the best bankers,
because they would be lured to places such as Singapore and Hong Kong
and even increasingly to Shanghai. If a banker is sufficiently venal
that he or she would chase the biggest pound, when bankers are not
exactly paid the national minimum wage, rather than seeking to operate
in an environment of the utmost integrity, then frankly I am not all
that sure that we would want them in the British banking system. We
have the ability through this legislation to underline our position as
the greatest financial services centre in the world. It is specifically
because of the venal attitude that we have seen that this economy and
economies around the world were almost brought down.</hs_para>

hope that in looking at the anti money-laundering aspects which my
noble friends have raised in their amendments, the Government will
think again about this. I do not think that there is a vast chasm here,
and I do not take the view of the noble Lord, Lord Flight, who I often
agree with, that there is far too much anti money-laundering
legislation. Yes, that legislation can be profoundly irritating when
you come up against it. There are an awful lot of things in life now
that are profoundly irritating, such as having to put your toothpaste
into a plastic bag at the airport. However, we live with them because

Flight:</Member></B> I clearly did not make my point correctly. I was
simply trying to say that I have seen reactions to anti
money-laundering arrangements, namely HSBC sacking all its US
clients and 26 embassies in the UK being blacklisted by the FATF and
having problems getting bank accounts. By the way, 10 of those
embassies belonged to members of the EU. It is right to focus on anti
money-laundering for the reasons which noble Lords correctly pointed
to, but people do not take account of the other side of the coin. What
is happening, as I described—and it will increasingly
happen—is that people who come from countries that have been
FATF-blacklisted will find it impossible to get a bank account,

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I have an amendment in this group and
it may be for the convenience of the Committee if I speak to it now.
Before doing so, I would like to make two comments about the discussion
that has gone on so far. First, Amendment 55 in the name of the noble
Lord, Lord Deighton, which includes the meaning of what is a bank,
requires very careful exposition by the Minister, because if it says
what it appears to say then it seriously undermines the whole
discussion about the senior persons regime that we have been having up
until now.</hs_para>

amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Brennan and his colleagues,
it seems that it is incumbent on the Treasury between now and Report to
produce a written report demonstrating the noble Lord’s claim
that these amendments are unnecessary; showing that the current regime
is fully in accord with the latest FATF principles; and therefore
providing the comfort which my noble friend might seek if his
amendments are indeed unnecessary. Perhaps the noble Lord could also
take in some of the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, as
there are areas that the noble Baroness wants to be sure are equally
well covered. Particularly with respect to the issues raised about anti
money-laundering and prevention of terrorism principles, it is crucial,
as those principles are conveyed into legislation, that we are
absolutely clear—and the legislation is clear and
explicit—on this matter.</hs_para>

is in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Tunnicliffe, proposes to
introduce a licensing regime to apply to all approved persons. The

significantly strengthen the requirement for approved persons to be

ring-fenced banks, other banks, building societies, credit unions and
some wholesale deposit takers, but it does not cover things which in

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> May I reinforce what others have said? I
am horrified by the Minister’s explanation. He must take it back
to the Treasury and get the Treasury to think again. I refresh his
memory, for example, about the evidence that we took from UBS. Not only
was it culpable to an extraordinary degree in the LIBOR scandal but its
top management also said that it knew nothing about what its traders
were doing. This was in spite of the fact that when it had its
capital-raising exercise, it presented to all the funds that its great
profit centre was trading in LIBOR derivatives. Then it said,
“We know nothing about it”. This made it immensely
culpable. The Minister is saying that if you had a bank that was not
taking retail deposits but was doing just that, there would be no
individual responsibility at all under this Bill. I am afraid that he
must look at that

Eatwell:</Member></B> I would like to reinforce the position of the
official Opposition on this. We are totally behind what the noble
Lords, Lord Lawson and Lord Turnbull, have said. It is disgraceful to
suggest that investment banks that are not deposit-taking but offer a
wide range of financial services should not come under this senior

Noakes:</Member></B> Was the Minister talking about retail deposits, as
I believe my noble friend Lord Lawson has interpreted him saying, or,
as the legislation seems to me to say, about deposit-taking more
widely? Deposit-taking is not confined to retail banking on ring-fenced
operations. Deposit-taking occurs across the whole range of banking
activities, as far as I am aware. Will he clarify to what kinds of
activity he intend this to
apply<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T18:31:39"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000026"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="131015105001108" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105001108">Lord

Flight:</Member></B> Could I add my support? It seems to me that it is
in investment banking territory where there is the greatest scope and
where there has been the most inappropriate behaviour. It was Lehmans
that nearly brought the whole system down. Part of the intent of the
ring-fence is that what is in it is much simpler banking. The whole
argument does not stand up unless investment banks are very much
covered by the new

next point made by the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, was about the
licensing regime. He made a common point about “may” as
opposed to “must”, something that we debate at huge
length. There is no doubt that there will be not a licensing regime in
his terms, but there will be rules of conduct that will cover all
employees for whom they are relevant. The intention is not for the
cleaners to be covered by these rules. It is perfectly well understood
with the PRA that it will not only produce the rules but set out the
scope of which employees will be covered by
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000033">The
noble Lord asked about the handover note. Our view is that we do not
need primary legislation to require handover notes. The regulators can
require that in their rules, and I am sure that they plan to. When
senior managers take on a new job, new statements of responsibilities
are required so that there is absolute clarity on what the senior
manager is responsible for. We see these as fulfilling the purpose that
he had in mind, and which other people might colloquially think of as a
handover
note.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000034">The
noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, raised the question about whether
British banks would be at a disadvantage. I cannot really add to the
comments of my noble friend Lord Lawson and others, other than to say
that the Government believe that it is in the long-term interest not
only of bank customers but of the City of London that the highest
possible standards are followed here. If individual bankers feel that
they do not want to operate to the highest possible standards, they
should go somewhere
else.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000035">The
noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, and the noble Lord, Lord Flight, asked
whether the senior management regime undermines collective
responsibility. We do not think that it does. It ensures that
individuals are held to account when things go wrong. It will not
change the way in which decisions are taken in a collective
manner.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000036">The
noble Lord, Lord Flight, raised a point that has been made a number of
times: why did the regulatory system get away with it, and why has no
action been 
<?notus-xml column=406?>taken? The answer is that the restructuring of
the system was undertaken to try to ensure that we did not
have the same problems again. The Government believe that that is how
you stop the laxity of the past, and that we begin to instil a new
culture by having different organisations, objectives and rules. The
regulatory regime has not gone through this process
unamended.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000037">Moving
on to the amendments introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, I
assure him that there is no difference of view between him and other
noble Lords who supported this amendment about the significance of
money-laundering and the need for it to be tackled effectively, nor of
the scale of it. The scale of money-laundering is very
large, and the Government and the regulators are determined to cut it
down.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000038">I would
like to make some points against the amendments and in response to some
of the things that have been said. The most important point was that
raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. The requirements for senior
managers to stay within the law on money-laundering are no different
from those to keep to the law in every other area where there is law.
The noble Lord has a laudable interest in money-laundering while the
noble Baroness is interested in anti-terrorism legislation. There may
be an overlap, but they are distinct. Other noble Lords are interested
in other things, where bankers have a legal responsibility to keep
within the law. Singling out money-laundering, at a point where it is
not required in order to be covered by the legislation, serves no
useful purpose and can be positively unhelpful. However, I am happy to
take up the sensible suggestion from the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, that
we provide a letter of comfort, as it were, between now and Report to
confirm that the regulator takes this extremely seriously, and that we
begin to explain how the obligation under the law will be
undertaken.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000039">The
noble Lord, Lord McFall, repeated that in the past the trail could go
cold. The great thing about these provisions is that they deal
explicitly with that. To say that the trail goes cold will no longer be

McFall of Alcluith:</Member></B> The reason I said that is that Tracey
McDermott, the present FCA director of enforcement, came before the
committee and answered that question in all honesty. She said that what
is needed is a chart of organisations to determine who is responsible
for what and a handover document. That is at the start at the moment;
it has not been fleshed out. That is the reason why I brought that
point to the
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T18:40:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Newby:</Member></B> When this amendment is enacted, it will ensure that
a senior manager will have his or her areas of responsibility
explicitly set out on appointment and that he or she will be held
responsible for everything that happens on their watch in that area. It
will no longer be a defence to say, “The trail ran
cold” or “Nobody told me about it”, as long as
they might reasonably be expected to know about it. That is a killer
point in respect of this amendment.</hs_para>

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, we now turn to one of the key
recommendations of the PCBS: the introduction of a new criminal offence
of reckless misconduct in the management of a bank. The commission
argued convincingly that existing sanctions for financial
crime,</hs_para>
<hs_quotefo UID="131015105001072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105001072">“do not

a criminal conviction and a prison sentence would give senior officers
of UK banks pause for thought. As the Government made clear in our
response to the commission, we believe that there is a strong case for
the introduction of such an offence. Serious bank failure results in
severe economic disruption and considerable losses for
taxpayers.</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="131015105000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000052">In line with the
commission’s recommendations, the new offence will be applicable
only to individuals who are covered by the new senior managers regime.
Senior managers could be liable if they take a decision which leads to
the failure of the bank or fail to take steps available to them to
prevent such a decision being taken. The offence will apply only to
behaviour that falls far below the standard that could reasonably be
expected of a person in their position, which is a similar test to that
for corporate manslaughter. In addition, at the time when the decision
was taken the senior manager must have been aware of a risk that its
implementation may cause the failure of the bank. Limiting the
application of the offence to individuals who are covered by the senior
managers regime, and the precise definition of when a bank has failed
for the purposes of the offence, mean that those affected should be in
no doubt as to their potential criminal liability.</hs_para>

for the new offence will be seven years in prison and/or an unlimited
fine on indictment. This is in line with the recommendation of the
commission, which argued that the offence must carry the possibility of
a prison sentence to be effective, as with other offences of similar
gravity under FiSMA, such as misleadingly manipulating benchmarks such
as LIBOR. The commission said that it,</hs_para>

area where we do not agree with the commission is on its proposal that
there should be a time limit of one year within which criminal charges
could be brought following successful civil enforcement action. I have
considerable sympathy with its arguments that laws forbidding
disclosure of information with regard to criminal proceedings could
mean that the publication of information around a bank
failure—information 
<?notus-xml column=422?>that it would be in the public interest to release—would be
suppressed until court proceedings had concluded. However, it is very
unusual to have a time limit on bringing charges relating to serious
criminal offences such as this and, given the likely complexities of
many of the cases that will be tried under this offence, such a time
limit may seriously limit the regulators’ ability to prosecute.
The offence introduced by this amendment will be in a vital tool in
ensuring that those at the top of our banks are focused on taking
prudent and measured decisions and in holding them account for reckless
behaviour that falls short of that standard.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="131015105000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000055">I now address the
amendments to this group. On Amendment 58, the PCBS recommended an
offence of reckless misconduct. In order for a person’s
behaviour to be reckless, they must be aware of the risks that they are
taking. The insertion of the text proposed by Amendment 58A would allow
for the possibility that a manager acting without knowledge of the
possible effects of their actions could also be guilty of the offence.
A key aspect of making an offence prosecutable is that the person
concerned must know that they are at risk of committing the crime.
There are other, civil, sanctions, which FSMA provides for, which can
apply if a senior manager has acted incompetently rather than
criminally recklessly. For example, if a senior manager in a bank fails
to comply with binding statements of principle issued by the regulator,
they can be penalised. These penalties can be heavy, including up to an
unlimited fine. In light of this, I hope that the noble Lord will
withdraw his
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000056">On
Amendment 58B, we have thought very carefully about the wording of this
offence, and have built upon robust precedent where possible. Referring
to conduct that is “far below” that which would be
expected has precedents in the Law Commission’s proposal for a
statutory offence of killing by gross carelessness, and in
legislation creating the offence of corporate manslaughter. So we have
used this particular phrase knowing that it works and can be
effectively interpreted by the courts. The offence must be precise
enough to comply with principles of legal certainty and fairness. There
is no precedent in UK criminal law for criminalising behaviour that is
merely unreasonable. To do so would amount to an indiscriminate
diffusion of criminal liability in a way that would make it hard for
individuals to know with sufficient certainty when they might be
committing an offence.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="131015105000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000057">We also need to be
very aware of the incentives that the offence creates. There would be a
considerable risk that a broader, vaguer offence would put talented
executives off taking on senior management positions, and the
Government are keen to get the balance right between punishing genuine
recklessness and supporting appropriate risk-taking. This would be a
particular risk when people consider whether to take on a senior role
in a troubled bank just when it was most important for it to have
highly capable leadership.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="131015105000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000058">I understand that the
intention of Amendment 58C is to make the offence more objective.
First, the reasonableness test as currently drafted gives a clear,
objective test of when the crime has been committed by a senior
manager. It will enable the jury to consider whether the
defendant’s behaviour was reasonable, 
<?notus-xml column=423?>taking into account the position they were actually in. To be precise,
it requires the jury to consider what conduct could, in all the
circumstances, reasonably be expected of a person holding the position
in the bank which that individual senior manager
held.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000059">This
amendment would, arguably, remove this clarity and ask the jury to
consider whether the person’s behaviour was reasonable in a more
general way. Such a test would be likely to be harder to apply to
particular cases, and in some cases could be inappropriate. It is
important to note that there can be no one clear definition of what
could be expected of a person in a senior management position in a
bank. Such drafting fails to take account of, for example, which
particular senior management role the defendant was undertaking, in
what kind of banking institution and what the institution’s
business model was. This amendment would change the current
reasonableness test to one that it would be extremely difficult for a
jury to apply in any meaningful way, making the offence less certain
and prosecution more
problematic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000060">On
Amendment 59A, the Government are introducing this offence to close a
gap in financial crime legislation. There are currently no criminal
powers available to sanction senior managers who have recklessly caused
their banks to fail. This is a clear shortcoming, which we are now
remedying. As we have already debated, though, offences already exist
for failing to comply with the Fraud Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act or
the Money Laundering Regulations. Individuals can be prosecuted under
these Acts, and any sentencing following the successful prosecution of
these offences would take into account how serious these breaches were,
so it is difficult to see what benefit this amendment would add.
Further, if a bank is found to have committed an offence under the
Fraud Act 2006 or under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007, senior
managers of the bank could also be found guilty if they have consented
to or connived in the commission of the offence by the bank. As
previously noted, the new senior managers regime will also provide
enhanced accountability in these areas. So there is no lack of
individual accountability in cases where banks fail to comply with the
requirements of the 2006 Act or the 2007
Regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000061">We

Brennan:</Member></B> My Lords, I will deal briefly with these
amendments concerning the creation of an offence in relation to a
decision that results in bank failure. The amendments are designed to
test the definitional value of the present clause, and work on the
realistic expectation that once this becomes statute there will be a
very much reduced prospect of people committing such an offence,
particularly if they face up to seven years in prison on indictment. So
the purpose of this 
<?notus-xml column=424?>section is more of a deterrent, although it has
a punitive value if there is a transgression. It is with
that in mind that these amendments were put
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000063">I
shall address Amendments 58A, B and C in turn. My reading of this draft
offence does not include any use of the words “reckless”
or “recklessness”. It would be unwise in legal terms to
equate its contents with some broad description to be used as a
synonym, or understood synonym, of “recklessness”, which
is a term of art in the
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000064">Amendment
58A deals with the following risk. It is likely that there will be more
cases of one or more people being involved—two, three, four,
five, whatever it might be—than a singleton defendant in a bank
failure. If the bank is operating properly, it is almost inconceivable
that one person could engineer its failure without the knowledge of
others. Therefore I predict that if they are brought to trial, one or
more of them will say, “I did not know; it was that man, not
me.” This particular amendment is designed to cover that
situation. “Should have been aware” infers “should
have been aware by reason of competent and honest practice of
appropriate banking standards”. It is an entirely reasonable
test, and it gets over the point that the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, was
telling us about earlier, of elective ignorance: “I don’t
want to know”; or wilful blindness: “I don’t want
to know because I’m never going to ask”. Many would think
that both of those situations involve culpability. You cannot get away
with it by shutting your mind to that which you should have known by
professional standards and proper competence. So the time between now
and Report should involve a consideration of how this clause is to be
used if it becomes an offence where there is more than one defendant.
Even if there is only one, he can blame someone who is not before the
court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000065">I now
turn to Amendment 58B. Corporate manslaughter is rarely brought to
court. It is normally brought to court in respect of a flagrant breach
of health and safety standards, usually in the construction industry,
energy, or whatever it might be that causes a terrible accident. In
other words, the incident speaks for itself. The word
“far” in that context adds nothing to the impact of the
event, and I suspect that most juries will not pay any attention to the
word “far” when they are directing—they will look
at the event. Between now and Report I want the Government to consider
this question: how on earth will a judge directing a jury interpret the
word “far” in respect of refined banking practices that
may cause a concatenation of events that lead to a failure? It is an
extremely loose word to use in this context, and I invite
reconsideration of it or its omission.</hs_para>

particular point of view, he did his best. That is simply not enough.

59A. I will not repeat the point about the statutes, although they are

respect of such other financial compliance obligations as may be
specified in rules made by the FCA. In other words, the matter arises
in respect of people who seriously fail in their duty to comply with
the appropriate standards and competences envisaged by this section. It
is not likely, but it is conceivable, that there will be situations in
which a failure occurs because of a system collapse in which particular
people were responsible, which system had been carried on

indication that no one can be convicted unless there is a want of

fundamental principle of British criminal law. However concerned we
are, and I certainly am, to bring to book the many malefactors who have
ruined the reputation of the City in recent years, one
cannot do it at the cost of changing or undermining that fundamental
test of criminality, intent, bad faith, dishonesty or want of

clearly require that intent and want of integrity. There are cases that

Noakes:</Member></B> My Lords, my first thought on seeing this new
offence relating to bank failure was to be mildly appalled at something
that might possibly impinge on one’s personal life, but I have
tried to put that to one side and to look at this clause
dispassionately. What concerns me is a point raised by the noble Lord,
Lord Phillips of Sudbury, which relates to causation. That is mentioned
several times in this clause, but one of the conditions in subsection
(1)(d) of the new clause proposed by Amendment 58 is
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="131015105001075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105001075">“the

it clear that single decisions cause failures of the nature that we are
talking about? I ask him to think, in the context of the failures that
existed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, whether any one of
those, had they occurred today and been dealt with under existing
legislation, could have technically satisfied the wording in this
offence. Even in the simplest case of failure, which was probably
Northern Rock, it was not as simple as one decision or even one group
of decisions. There were multiple points of decision which contributed.
Certainly, when one gets to something as complicated as the failure of
Lehman Brothers, I would be absolutely astonished if anybody could have
pointed to one decision causing one
failure.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="131015105000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000080"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="131015105001135" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105001135">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I will try to sum up some of those
points. One of the big challenges that we faced in producing the exact
terms of this amendment was to produce a sanction which is a credible
offence and could be successfully prosecuted. Setting the conditions to
include that in all the circumstances the individual’s conduct
fell far below what could reasonably be expected of them and that they
were aware of the 
<?notus-xml column=427?>risk that a decision could cause the bank to fail gives us the clarity
that we need. This will capture behaviour which in normal parlance or

put in the Bill a form of words that would create a credible offence
that could be successfully prosecuted. The two requirements that an
individual’s conduct had to fall far below what could reasonably
be expected of them and that they were aware of the risk they were
taking, would, in the view of the lawyers, capture recklessness. It is
a definition of recklessness without the use of the word. The wording
gives a greater chance of having a credible offence than using the word
“reckless”. It is an attempt to make sure that we have
got something that we could use, while capturing the

significantly contributed to the failure of a bank then I think my

Newby:</Member></B> I do not think it undermines the whole purpose of
the amendment. It obviously reduces the scope of cases which can be
brought under this amendment, but the challenge that the lawyers have
had is to make sure, as far as possible, that there is the 
<?notus-xml column=428?>certainty of what constitutes an offence, which is required under human
rights legislation. That has been one of the principle drivers for the
particular form of words that we have got. I accept the noble
Baroness’s point that in some cases there will be a whole raft
of contributory decisions which over a period lead to a bank failing.
It will be, I accept, more difficult to bring a prosecution in those
cases. It is not inconceivable, however, to argue, without having any
particular case in mind, that if a senior executive of a bank persuaded
the board to make an acquisition knowing that it was a very risky
acquisition which if it went wrong could bring the bank
down<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T19:16:11"></hs_TimeCode>, that

recklessness for the Government to consider. Let us suppose a senior
manager reports to a chief executive officer saying, “I want to
tell you about the following risks that would arise if decision A,B or
C is taken”. The CEO is of the imperial kind and tells him not
to waste his time, that he is not interested in risk, and to get on
with it and make the decision. In those circumstances, the present
legislation as it is drafted would justify a decision to prosecute the
manager because he went ahead despite the risk, but not the CEO because
he never actually knew what the risk was; he just ordered the junior to
go ahead and do
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000090">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T19:17:39"></hs_TimeCode>

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments will create a new
competition-focused utility-style regulator equipped with the full
range of powers to tackle the deeply rooted issues in the market for
payment system. The Government have serious concerns about the
structure of the payment systems market, which sees problems in three
main areas: competition, innovation and responsiveness to consumer
needs.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="131015105000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000093">Under the existing
self-regulatory framework, there is no systematic oversight holding the
big banks, payment scheme companies and infrastructure providers to
account. Large banks jointly own the payment system companies and the
infrastructure provider, and they dominate the Payments Council, the
pseudo-regulatory body responsible for setting industry strategy. This
allows the incumbent 
<?notus-xml column=431?>players to erect barriers to entry, preventing challenger banks from
competing on a level playing field. It also limits incentives for the
systems to innovate and respond to consumer needs, as there is no
competitive advantage to any bank in doing so. There are also
competition concerns in the international card schemes, as highlighted
by the European Commission’s proposed regulation capping
multilateral interchange fees. The card schemes have an incentive to
increase interchange fees to encourage banks to issue their cards, but
merchants have little opportunity to influence this process, and have
no real option but to accept the major payment
cards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000094">The
first objective of the regulator will be to address the problems
arising from imperfect competition. To tackle barriers to entry in
banking arising from access conditions for the payment schemes, the
payment systems regulator will have powers to tackle anti-competitive
fees, terms and conditions, and to mandate access to the core systems.
If deemed necessary, it will be able to break up the current ownership
structures to create a landscape where fair competition can thrive.
Secondly, the regulator will examine issues relating to innovation.
Payment systems are characterised by strong network effects. Just as
owning a telephone brings little benefit if no one else has one, each
user gains added value from a payment system with the addition of
further users. The shared ownership of the interbank payment systems by
the banks reinforces this, because no single bank stands to gain an
advantage over the others by investing in and developing the systems.
This tendency to underinvest means that, while there have been some
important innovations in recent years, they have too often required the
Government’s or the OFT’s intervention to drive change,
and the industry has taken too long to realise their full
benefits.</hs_para>

Government want to challenge underinvestment and lack of innovation in
the co-owned systems. They want a payments industry that rewards
entrepreneurial behaviour and develops systems that are innovative,
efficient and effective. Therefore, the regulator will have an
objective to promote the development of, and innovation in, payment
systems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T19:21:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

identified in the market is the failure of the industry to respond to
end-user needs. This, too, stems from the market’s network
characteristics and ownership structures, which mean that failing to
respond to end-user needs incurs no competitive disadvantage to any of
the banks. This makes it possible for the banks to take decisions about
the provision of services, even if this is directly against the
interests of the wider public, as we saw in 2009 when the industry
attempted to abolish cheques. The Government want to see a market where
payment systems work for end-users, rather than one that serves only
the self-interest of the big established banks.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="131015105000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000097">Successive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T19:21:59"></hs_TimeCode>
Governments and UK regulatory authorities have been trying to find a
viable solution for these problems for more than a decade, dating back
to Sir Don Cruickshank’s report to the Treasury in 2000
recommending that the Government create a utility-style regulator for
payment systems. Instead, however, the process resulted in the creation
of the industry-dominated Payments Council. In February, the Chancellor
announced that the Government would introduce a new regulator 
<?notus-xml column=432?>to open up payment systems. Over the summer, the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards endorsed the Government’s
commitment to bring payment systems into formal regulation. In their
response to the final report of the PCBS, the Government confirmed that
they will ask the payments regulator, once established, to urgently
examine account
portability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000098">I
turn to the details of these amendments. They establish the payment
systems regulator as a separate legal entity established by the FCA.
This provides bespoke objectives and powers to address the distinctive
problems in the market for payment systems, and allows for the benefits
of close co-ordination with the FCA. The objectives of the regulator
will be to promote competition, innovation and the interests of service
users. The payment systems regulator will oversee all domestic payment
systems brought into scope by being designated by HM Treasury.
Initially, it is expected that the main interbank schemes and
international card schemes will be designated. Once a system is
designated, the regulator will have powers over that system’s
operators, infrastructure providers and payment service providers that
provide payment services using the system. This new regime will not
affect the existing role of the Bank of England under the Banking Act
2009 in overseeing recognised interbank systems for stability purposes.
The Bank will be excluded from the scope of regulation in its current
capacity as a payments system participant. There will also be a duty
for the co-ordinated exercise of functions between the PSR, FCA, Bank
and PRA, and a memorandum of understanding setting out how this will
happen.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="131015105000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000099">The

powers enabling it to address the deep, structural issues causing
problems in the market for payment
systems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T19:24:12"></hs_TimeCode>. To open
up access and encourage greater competition, the regulator will be able
to intervene and require changes to any anti-competitive fees, or terms
and conditions of an agreement for access to a regulated system. It
will have powers to require the provision of both direct and indirect
access to payment systems. It will also have competition powers to
enforce Competition Act 1998 prohibitions against anti-competitive
agreements and abuse of dominance, and to make market investigation
references to the Competition and Markets Authority. These competition
functions will be exercisable concurrently with the CMA. Ultimately, if
the payment systems regulator determines that the current ownership
structures need to be broken up to achieve adequate competition, it
will have the power to require disposals of interests in operators of
regulated
systems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T19:25:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000100">In
furthering access and competition, the regulator will also address
underinvestment by the industry and the slow pace of innovation. There
is no shortage of players who want to be able to innovate in this
space, and with greater access to the core systems and infrastructure,
inventive, entrepreneurial players will be able to bring propositions
to market when they have previously been blocked from doing so. Greater
competitive pressure on industry participants can be expected to drive
up standards and force payment system owners, operators and payment
service providers to deliver improvements in the payment systems space.
However, in cases where market forces are still unable 
<?notus-xml column=433?>to play out, if the big incumbent banks resist, the
regulator will have powers to drive through improvements as it sees
fit, by issuing directions that require or prohibit action by
participants in regulated systems, and this includes requiring specific
developments to be
pursued.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000101">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T19:26:11"></hs_TimeCode>
advancing its service-user objectives, the regulator will be able to
require or prohibit the taking of action in the operation, management
and development of payment systems. This means that it can prevent the
industry ignoring the legitimate needs of consumers—for
instance, by trying to abolish cheques. The payment systems regulator
will be able to publish details of a compliance failure and to impose
financial penalties; if deemed necessary, it will be able to require
owners of payment systems to dispose of their interests in them,

place to facilitate useful new services for businesses and consumers;
and decisions on the provision of payment options are taken in the

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I have a number of queries about
another set of amendments that are longer than the original Bill.
First, I support entirely the notion of establishing a payments
regulator, but why is it being established as yet another independent
regulator? Surely, covering the activities that it refers to—the
nature of markets and settlement systems, which are akin to clearing
and settlement in business and financial services in general—is
the clear role of the FCA. Why are we establishing an extra
organisation? After all, one thing that we have learnt through the
financial crisis is that communication between organisations is less
than perfect, even in the best of all possible worlds. Surely it would
be better if this was simply a division of the FCA rather than an
organisation having, as the schedule makes clear, an entirely separate
board and chairman. This seems to be a proliferation of institutions
with no purpose when we already have the FCA there to do the
job<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T19:28:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000104">Secondly,
I want to explore the competition objective a little more. It is very
clear that enhancing competition by giving access to payment systems is
highly desirable. It is also clear that users might benefit from
competition. What is not terribly clear is whether we want to have very
diverse structures in the fundamental architecture of the payments
system, which is absolutely core to the banking system. It recalls to
me the early days of the railways when there were more than a dozen
railways from London to Brighton, as they all competed with one
another. This was not conducive either to the effective development of
the railway companies or the provision eventually of a proper service
to
passengers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T19:29:34"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T19:28:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T19:27:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, I am a little puzzled, given the essential role of the
payments architecture as being absolutely fundamental to the operation
of the banking system, 
<?notus-xml column=434?>as to whether we want to see diverse structures and how they might be

third point also refers to the nature of fundamental market
infrastructure. Within these new clauses it is the responsibility of
the regulator to assure maintenance of service. However, another part
of the Bill, which we will look at next, is labelled
“fundamental market infrastructure” and is also devoted
to the maintenance of market service more generally. The responsible
authority for maintaining market service is different in the two cases.
In one it is the Treasury; in the other it is the Bank of England. Why
do we have two different authorities responsible for the maintenance of
fundamental market infrastructure when the payments system is
undoubtedly part of fundamental market infrastructure? It seems to me
that, in inserting this desirable measure into the Bill, the fact that
it has created some ambiguities and

should be careful what we wish for. The Treasury committee and the
parliamentary commission both welcomed the Government’s
damascene conversion —that was what it was called in our
report—announced in the Budget last year to create a payments
regulator. However, this has been done in a quite extraordinary way
with some 40 pages of amendments having been produced only two or three
days before we were due to examine them. Although the new clauses were
published following a process of consultation, there does not seem to
be time for anyone in Parliament or anyone affected by them to
scrutinise them. How can we tell whether what has been drafted is
workable, reflects the views expressed in the consultation or will
deliver what the Government want? From a procedure point of view, the
usual channels might consider whether the gap between Committee and
Report might be rather longer than normal so that we get a chance to
look at not just this but also at the bail-in provisions as we have
only had a small amount of time to consider
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T19:32:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000107">Through
much of the consideration in Committee my view has been pretty close to
that of the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. However, as regards whether this

One of the key features here is that there is doubt about whether
competition comes high enough up the FCA’s priorities. We shall
come to later amendments whereby the parliamentary commission wanted to
push competition higher up the FCA’s priorities. The proposal
before us serves the interests of competition better than by making the

cheque system. Will this proposal stand up if the cheque system is

Noakes:</Member></B> My Lords, my initial reaction to
these new clauses was that they constituted a sledgehammer to crack a
nut. It seems to me that creating another regulator in a territory
which is well occupied by regulators is unnecessary in this case. To
that extent I support the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. One has only to
look at government Amendment 60YYH to see that the new regulator will
have to co-ordinate with the Bank of England, the FCA and the PRA.
These bodies already have to co-ordinate among themselves for different
purposes in any event. I think that the world is slightly going mad on
this. My noble friend Lord Higgins asks who will pay for the regulator.
Obviously, the people who will operate the payment systems will pay for
the regulator. I suspect that this arrangement will be more expensive
than the existing Payments Council system. I do not know how much more
expensive it will be. I believe that we should be told what the costs
are because they will inevitably end up being paid for by the
businesses and individuals who use payments systems. There is no one
else.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0002.htm#131015105000111">I have
one question with two parts for my noble friend which relates to the
powers in government Amendments 60S and 60T. One part relates to the
power to require access to payment systems. I completely understand
that. If you are to promote competition, you need powers to require
access. The other relates to the variation of agreements relating to
payment systems to take out anti-competitive elements in arrangements
that have already been made. Both those measures could have financial
consequences for those who operate payment systems. I do not object to
the principle involved, but where in these 40 pages of amendments can I
find the principles that the payments regulator has to use in deciding
how he approaches those decisions? I assume that he cannot have
unlimited discretion to decide who will pay for what and on what terms.
However, there appear to be no basic financial principles underpinning
this arrangement in the 40 pages of amendments, which seems to me a

Newby:</Member></B> A number of noble Lords raised the same question
and have come down on different sides. Should we have a separate
regulator or should it be just a division in the FCA? In the end, it
was a question about how important we thought the issue was. A division
in the FCA would be a division among a lot of divisions. The staff of a
division in the FCA would probably be at a somewhat more junior level
than that of a chief executive of an important regulator. The priority
that the overall body, namely the FCA, would give to this would
obviously be somewhat less than a body on its own could give, because
the sole concern of the people working for it would be to make the
scheme
work<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

possible to do it in the FCA. In a sense, you literally pays your money
and takes your choice. Our view is that this is a fundamental element
of the system that needs shaking up and the best way to do it is to
have a group of people whose sole 
<?notus-xml column=437?>interest—and whose career interest—is associated with
making this thing work. That is why the body is being established on
its

the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, was about the definition of competition.
As he said, competition in terms of access and users is clearly
desirable. Will it be desirable or possible to have diverse structures
for all elements of the system? Almost certainly not; some parts of it
are a natural monopoly. That is one reason why a regulator is needed.
At the moment, you have a natural monopoly controlled by a small group
of banks. What we want to do is open up that access but give more scope
for looking at options, which at the moment are closed down by the
structure. My personal view is that it is highly unlikely that the
basic plumbing of the system will replicate the situation in the
railways; it would make no sense. However, there may be elements of the
payments system, including new forms of payment, which may be
susceptible to competition, and we want the regulator to have that in
its purview and look at it. There is no suggestion that we are seeking
to break up those elements of the system that form a natural
monopoly<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

asked about maintenance of service. There is a difference between what
the regulator will be doing on a day-to-day basis in making sure that
the whole system works effectively and what happens if the whole thing
is failing. That is the difference in the second provision,
which we will come on to later, about resolution. The people to look
after resolution when something has failed are not necessarily

so on, to maintain the service. We then move on to the next section

maintenance of service is the responsibility of the Bank of England.
There is an inconsistency here. As regards the issue of the
infrastructure as a payments system and the issue of all other aspects
of back-office infrastructure, the Treasury is responsible for one and
the Bank of England is responsible for the other. However, they are so
interrelated and interdependent that it does not really make sense. You
have either one or the other. I do not mind which. I would prefer the

country’s operations, not by the UK end of it. Obviously, close
working between both countries is required but we are dealing with the
pipes that leave the UK. Once they have left the UK, the pipes are
regulated by someone else. As far as cheques are concerned, if there
were to be a decision or view expressed that cheques had come to the
end of their useful life, it will not fall under the purview of the
regulator to effect that change. I think that that I am right in saying
that the budget forms part of the FCA’s overall budget, as set
out in the legislation. Therefore, the overall financial services
sector pays into the FCA for a whole raft of specialist functions. This

of the FCA will control the funds going into this organisation. I take

Howarth of Breckland (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, research suggests
that at least one in 20 young adults in the UK experienced sexual abuse
as a child, but most incidents are not reported to the police.
Three-quarters of children who are abused do not tell anyone about it
at the time, as has been so graphically illustrated by the Jimmy Savile
scandal. Services for children and telephone helplines are a key part
of the child protection framework, but it is for the Government to set
that framework and to ensure that local authorities, working through
their safeguarding programmes, together with the voluntary sector,
carry this forward.</hs_para>

the consultancy group established by Damian Green in the other place
and I ask the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, to ensure that
this debate is brought to his attention and to that of the chair of the
group. My own assessment is that primary prevention remains a weak link
in the plans, with emphasis on secondary and tertiary prevention. That
means that we need more emphasis on ensuring that every effort is made
to stop it before it happens—in the words of the campaign,
“Stop it now”. In addition, there appears to be a gap in
the work of the group relating to young people and children who abuse
other children. Only if these two areas are placed at the centre of the
work of the Home Office group will it come anywhere near its mission

this issue having such a high profile, I am indeed grateful to be given

recent NSPCC report looking at the disclosure of childhood abuse shows
that one in 20 children being abused equates, in 2012-13, to 18,195
sexual crimes against children under l6 being recorded in England and
Wales. It also says that, despite the recent high-profile 
<?notus-xml column=480?>celebrity cases, 90% of children are being abused by someone they know.
This often happens in their own home, and that is something that we
should not lose sight of. Around one-third of offences are perpetrated
by other children and young people, as I have just
mentioned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000143">The
present system still leaves too much responsibility on the child victim
when ultimately it is for adults to protect children from abuse. One of
those adults who made a step change was Lucy Faithfull, and I declare
an interest as a vice-chair of the Lucy Faithfull Foundation. As a
Conservative Peer of some standing, she caused consternation to her
Whips by leading mini-revolts on children’s issues. She was
committed to her party but she was just more committed to children. As
a children’s officer, she understood the issues around child
sexual abuse well before many of her colleagues. Therefore, when asked
to help the Gracewell Clinic, which later became the Lucy Faithfull
Foundation, she took it to her heart. She deserves that the present
Government support her
legacy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000144">This
year is the 20th anniversary of the foundation but the work has not
been without its difficulties. Despite the skilled staff leading in the
field of understanding the treatment of abusers and the highly
successful clinic at Epsom, it was closed when the hospital was
redeveloped. The then Government promised to fund an alternative
site—indeed, to develop a range of similar facilities based on
the knowledge and success of the clinic, but they never materialised. I
am afraid that we had placards outside some of the facilities held by
children saying, “Not on our doorstep”. One understands
this, but during our whole time at Epsom we never had one incident when
a man stepped outside the boundaries that he had been set in his
programme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T19:58:21"></hs_TimeCode>. I
wonder how much further we might be in the work had the clinic
continued, and I ask the Minister what plans the Government have to
give community residential programmes to men discharged from prison at
a time when these men are most vulnerable to reoffending.</hs_para>

acknowledge and commend the work of Circles of Support, a scheme

what they have done, which is understandable. It takes a very special
volunteer to befriend them, but in doing so they are an essential part
of protecting children, as well as giving these men new hope. We have
to remember that whatever they have done they have to continue their
lives, and unless they are helped they remain a danger to
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T19:59:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000146">When
I collaborated with Lucy in the days before the foundation, I was chief
executive of ChildLine. It was even more difficult then than now for
children to be listened to and believed, and I congratulate all who
have worked to shorten the time before children come forward. The
changes in court procedures and safeguarding programmes have helped but
there remains room for improvement. What work continues to ensure that
courts are child-friendly while still quite properly ensuring a fair

more room for them to have advocates.</hs_para>

collaboration between ChildLine and the Lucy Faithfull Foundation in
the early 2000s, it became apparent that there was a need for a
helpline to give advice to adults concerned about their own thoughts
and feelings towards children. ChildLine volunteers were trained to
focus on children, so in 2003 the Stop it Now! confidential freephone
service was launched by the foundation. It has grown from taking 1,000
calls in 2003 to just under 6,000 calls in 2012. The demand has grown
despite limited publicity and no advertising. Calls are taken from
adult abusers and those at risk of abusing. Time does not allow me to
give too many examples, but they tell the story. The group for whom
there is most concern if they fail to get help consists of abusers and
those at risk of abuse. Paul, a window cleaner, was having sexual
thoughts about children. He went to the police for help, but was told
they could deal with him only if he committed an offence. They
suggested that he talk to the probation service, which said that it
could offer treatment only if he had been convicted of an offence, so
he went to his GP who told him that everyone had these thoughts
occasionally. Finally, he found the helpline and received advice on how
to manage these thoughts and the terrible things that he felt tempted
to do. Other groups calling for help include parents and young men
accessing indecent images of children
online.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000148">Core
funding for the helpline comes from a grant from the Ministry of
Justice without which the service could not continue, so the foundation
would like to acknowledge the wisdom of this support in difficult
times. It is topped up by donations. Your Lordships can understand how
difficult it is to raise money to help in this area, and demand has
grown to a level which cannot be met. The helpline takes an average of
550 calls a month from 300 callers but has between 1,500 and 2,000
missed calls—missed opportunities to intervene in possible
abuse. The work undertaken via a callback service that can provide
vital face-to-face meetings is no longer funded, and men can receive
that only if they are prepared to pay for it
themselves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000149">We
are of course all familiar with recent developments on the internet and
the strong political drive to make the internet safer for children and
to reduce the occurrence of online offending involving viewing,
downloading, making and/or distributing indecent images of children. I
recognise the outstanding work of the Internet Watch Foundation. No
doubt this is a topic other noble Lords will cover as it needs more
time, but I hope that the Government will continue to press the
internet industry to play its part.</hs_para>

the line. They are often ill equipped to prevent child sexual abuse of
their own children. Research conducted as part of the work of the Lucy
Faithfull Foundation with these groups showed that 59% of those
questioned were not as confident as they would like to be when it came
to protecting their own children. With 7.7 million families in the UK
having dependent children, this could mean that 4.5 million
families are lacking this confidence. Yet the foundation’s
hugely successful Parents Plus programme, part of the Stop it Now!
campaign ceased. Not only the groups but other parts of the programme
will be closed down. Stop it Now! is fully supported by the 
<?notus-xml column=482?>Governments in Scotland and Wales but sadly not in

Lucy Faithfull, I know that the problem has to be dealt with at every
level. I hope that the Government will listen to those calling for a
public health model of prevention. This means deterrence, treatment and
taking steps to prevent abuse ever taking place through community
awareness and education programmes. The impact on victims is long-term
and devastating. It costs money in repercussions on the mental health

Doocey (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness,
Lady Howarth, for providing this opportunity to debate such an
important issue. In the short time available, I would like to
concentrate on the issue of child trafficking. Most of the children
trafficked into, within and from the UK are trafficked for the purpose
of abuse. The UK Human Trafficking Centre’s annual assessment
identified more than 2,000 potential victims of human trafficking in
2012. Of these, 549 were children—a 12% increase from
2011. Some 152 children were believed to have been trafficked solely
for sexual exploitation. The other 397 children were trafficked for
criminal exploitation, such as benefit fraud and cannabis cultivation.
They may also have been victims of sexual abuse, a tactic often used to
control victims. These figures represent only the tip of the iceberg.
The true scale of the problem is not recognised because many front-line
practitioners do not understand the concept of trafficking and do not
identify children who are showing signs of being trafficked. Unless and
until these professionals and their managers receive the necessary
training, trafficked children will continue to go under the radar and
be put at risk of significant
harm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000159">One of
the great success stories in the battle against trafficking was
Operation Paladin Child at Heathrow Airport, which did some superb
work. Despite this, though, it was merged in 2010 with the Child
Protection Unit. The Child Protection Unit has now been merged 
<?notus-xml column=484?>into the Met’s rape command, and the Paladin team now operates
only part-time. These mergers risk a loss of focus and, more
importantly, a loss of specialist skills. We need clear assurances that
protective measures are not being
weakened.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000160">We
should welcome the Director of Public Prosecution’s guidelines
for prosecutors on how to tackle cases involving child sexual abuse.
They are intended to improve the criminal justice system process for
children, both as witnesses and as victims. However, this guidance
should be extended to cover all forms of exploitation, including all
child victims of
trafficking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000161">The
report from the Refugee Council and the Children’s Society,
<I>Still at Risk,</I> presents a sober analysis of what has gone wrong.
What stands out is the failure of professionals to act on indicators of
abuse when the child has no documentation to prove their age, leading
many children to be pushed into the adult immigration system without
protection. Giving children the benefit of the doubt, an obligation
already embedded in various conventions and directives, could so easily
rectify this. I would be grateful if the Minister could let the House

might surprise some Peers and members of the public that at present
there is no specific offence of child trafficking in law. Instead, it
is an aggravating factor in various pieces of legislation that apply to
adults and children. This is just not good enough. The Government
should therefore consider including separate child-specific offences
before introducing the forthcoming modern slavery
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000163">Tackling

Howe of Idlicote (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate the
noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, on securing this important debate. One of
the challenges presented by the horror of child sex abuse pertains to
the way in which it is growing, not just in its extent but also in its
definition. There was a time when one thought of child sex abuse
narrowly in terms of physical acts committed by an adult in relation to
a child. While child sex abuse of that kind continues, it is also
manifest in other ways, and in the brief time available to me this
evening I will look at the public policy challenge of how best to
address these more novel forms of child sex
abuse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000165">New
means of communication, principally the internet and mobile phones,
play a key role. In recent years children and young people have started
to use their mobile phones to take pictures of themselves or others
naked and then to text those images to others or distribute them
through new social media. This practice, called
“sexting”, is hugely damaging. One can gain some
appreciation of the problem by examining the Children’s
Commissioner’s recent literature review on the subject,
<I>Basically... porn is everywhere</I>, which is a deeply disturbing
document.</hs_para>

report highlights studies demonstrating that between 4% and 17% of
young people have sent or received "sexts" or have posted
self-generated images online. I have references to them in my notes.
Crucially, the report makes it very plain that such images can be taken
and/or disseminated as part of bullying, or their discovery may lead to
bullying. This may also lead to threats or blackmail, or may be posted
to or shared by paedophile chat sites. Also, according to one of my
sources, Wolf, online distribution of material generated via sexting
has the potential to lead to self-harm and/or
suicide.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000167">Just
because sexting and associated cyberbullying do not necessarily involve
physical contact and may be committed by children on children as well
as by adults on children, it does not follow that these practices, when
they involve people under 18, are anything other than a new form of
child sex abuse. If we are to have an adequate public policy response
to child sex abuse, we must engage with sexting and associated
cyberbullying. The truth is that these behavioral abuses of the
otherwise wonderful potential that the internet has to offer can only
be addressed through challenging and educating.</hs_para>

Clause 4 places an obligation on internet service providers and mobile
phone operators to make customers aware of internet and mobile safety
issues, which include the online behavioural challenges of sexting and
cyberbullying. Clause 5, meanwhile, places an obligation on the
Secretary of State to provide parents with education materials about
online safety, including sexting and cyberbullying, to help them speak
to and teach their children about such challenges. I would like to know
what the Government plan to do to help parents engaging with this key
educational challenge, and I hope that the Minister will enlighten us

then turn to another crucial issue: to what extent are we prepared to
do what we can to help ensure that children do not stumble on legal but
entirely inappropriate adult sexual content online? Knowing what we do
about the development of the brains of children with respect to sexual
images, I firmly believe that there is a real sense in which a culture
that chooses not to invest appropriate resources on preventing children
from accessing such material is itself guilty of a form of child sex
abuse. While we may not yet have the public policy tools to provide
complete safety for children online, I believe that at any given time
we should do everything that it is technologically possible to do to
protect children from stumbling upon such images.</hs_para>

we pass on this opportunity, we ourselves are guilty of allowing a form
of abuse. That is why Clause 1 of my Bill requires internet service
providers and mobile phone operators to provide service users with an
internet service that is free from inappropriate adult sexual and
violent content at the point of purchase but with the option for anyone
to access such material, subject to their opting in and going through a
verification process demonstrating that they are 18 or over.</hs_para>

warmly congratulate the Prime Minister on taking on this issue and, in
particular, on his 22 July NSPCC speech in which he addressed both the
availability of illegal child sex abuse images online and the current
ease with which children can access legal but inappropriate adult

I thank him. However, I gently suggest that his phrase, “Nothing
is more important than this”, with which I completely agree,
sits rather oddly alongside his refusal to introduce legislation in
deference to the industry's desire for self-regulation. Self-regulation
may sound very fine but it is worth remembering that it was tried
before when seeking to engage with the great child rights challenges of
the past. In 1847 any aspiration for self-regulation of the factories
had to be abandoned in favour of a statute, and no one questions the
wisdom of that now. I suspect that we will come, sooner or

understand debates about child sex abuse now we absolutely have to have
some historical context. I started working on this issue some 30 or so
years ago now. That was a time of denial, both here and in the United
States, let alone elsewhere. Cases of widespread abuse were coming to
light in churches, in orphanages, in hospitals and in the family, but a
veritable smokescreen was thrown up to try to block off the
implications of all this. For example, people spoke of false memory
syndrome, casting doubt on the testimony of many children who did at
that time speak
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:23:18"></hs_TimeCode>. In a way,
that is not surprising because we are dealing here with some of the
most cherished institutions in our society.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:23:33"></hs_TimeCode> substantial
proportion of the cases of sexual abuse that came to light were against
small boys. It is important to recognise this and not concentrate only
on sexual abuse against
girls.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000176">I used
to teach at the University of California at Santa Barbara—one of
the most beautiful towns you could possibly live in. The jewel in the
crown in Santa Barbara was the mission, which stood on the hill above
the town—a really wonderful building. In that building, it was
discovered that there was a long-term history of sexual abuse on a mass
scale. A local newspaper referred to those involved, who were priests
and friars in the institution, as sacred monsters. Over the period 1964
to 1987, fully one-quarter of the friars regularly abused the boys in
the
institution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:24:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

seen in the papers a couple of days ago that high-profile cases are
even now coming to the fore in the Catholic Church in Poland
involving some very high-ranking dignitaries. What
we are talking about here is, as it were, the secret 
<?notus-xml column=487?>sexual history of our civilisation. We are talking
about something deep-rooted, not a transient phenomenon; it has a very
long history. The term “grooming”, for example, has been
widely used recently. It is a fairly novel term, but I can assure noble
Lords that it is a term for a very traditional practice. Grooming went
on at the mission in Santa Barbara as in so many other
institutions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:25:20"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:25:22"></hs_TimeCode>.
Many questions are raised, therefore, by what has been called our Jimmy
Savile moment. In some part, it is our moment of institutional
discovery and the consequences will take a long time to
assimilate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:25:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000178">I
have three brief points on which I would like the Minister, if he has
time, to comment. First, I hope the Government will accept that we are
in this for the long haul; that we are at the beginning of a process
that will go on for a long time. Operation Yewtree, after all, found
450 people who came forward to speak out. None of them had spoken out
before. This is part of a much larger hidden history; it is not an
individual case in any way at all. Therefore, a long-term strategy is
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:26:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000179">Secondly,
would the Minister agree that we need to focus on boys as much as
girls? Boys on the whole are much more reluctant than girls to speak
up, for well known reasons. Jimmy Savile’s victims included
quite a number of boys under the age of 10, so it will not do to
concentrate only on one sex when discussing this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:26:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000180">Thirdly,
we need to hammer home the point made by Keir Starmer, the Director of
Public Prosecutions, that this is not just a problem for the CPS and
the police. That is precisely because it is essentially an
institutional problem—an issue, in other words, for all of those
in charge of the diversity of organisations within which such practices
have been carried
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:27:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="131015105001087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105001087">8.27

Storey (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness,
Lady Howarth, for facilitating this debate. I think the figures are
frightening; let me remind you of them. One in 10 children experience
sexual abuse before their 18th birthday. Youth are the victims of 66%
of all sexual offences reported to law enforcement agencies; they are
two-and-a-half times more likely to be raped than adults. Forty per
cent of victims are 11 years old or younger and 9% of 10 to 17
year-olds receive a sexual request while on the internet. Of course,
sexually abused children are at greater risk of psychological,
emotional, social and physical problems, often lasting into
adulthood<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:28:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000182">What
are the steps that we should take? First of all, there are some simple
thoughts that we should always have in our minds. We should eliminate
or reduce isolated one-to-one situations in order to decrease risk.
More than 80% of cases happen in isolated one-to-one situations. We
should be prepared to have open conversations with children about our
bodies, sex and boundaries. The best protection is our relationship
with children and that is why sex education in schools is so important.
We should know the signs of abuse to protect children from harm and
understand how to respond to risky behaviours and suspicions or reports
of
abuse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:29:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000183">The
greatest risk to children comes not from strangers but from people we
know and trust.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:29:11"></hs_TimeCode>Ninety per cent
of children know their abuser; 60% are people whom the 
<?notus-xml column=488?>family trusts; 40% are abused by older or larger

May 2012, I asked a Question about the definition of neglect of
children and young persons. I just reminded myself of the reply that
the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools at the time, the
noble Lord, Lord Hill, gave
me:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="131015105000938" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000938">“The
Government's vision is for a child-centred system that includes
providing effective help when a problem arises at any stage in a
child’s life. This is one reason why we asked Professor Munro to
carry out an independent review of child protection. She identified
that services are often too reactive, and we are now helping
children’s services, the police and the NHS to work together and
focus on early identification before problems
escalate”.—[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/5/12; col. <I>WA

say: tell that to, or consider it for, poor Daniel Pelka. As we
remember, Daniel Pelka was starved to death and beaten for months by
his serial criminal stepfather and drug addict prostitute
mother—mind-bogglingly, beyond the help of onlooking teachers,
health staff and social workers. There are the ghosts of Victoria
Climbié and baby Peter, two other lovely kids who should be
alive today. There was a boy resembling a concentration camp victim
scavenging in bins and reduced to finding scraps to survive. There was
another inquiry, another set of recommendations and then, sadly, we all
sit back to wait for it to happen
again.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="131015105000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000185">Social
workers carry out a fantastic job. There has been a huge step change in
schools and teachers, with child protection officers and safeguarding
and child protection policies, but the answer is not constantly to have
inquiries—it is actually to do something. We know what we need
to do. If at any time any of the agencies suspect that something is
wrong, they need to act. They need to be prepared to open the door and
go into the house to see for themselves. Do we seriously believe that
there were not adults around in those very serious cases who did not
see a change in those particular children? No child deserves to be
treated by way of sexual
abuse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:32:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="131015105001088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105001088"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:32:20"></hs_TimeCode></I>8.32

Hughes of Stretford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the
noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, particularly for the focus that she has
brought this evening on prevention. She set out clearly for us the
incidence and prevalence of child sexual abuse and made a compelling
case for more to be done to support prevention—something which,
as she rightly said, is the weak link in current plans and, I would
say, in policy and professional
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:32:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000187">Despite
some very high-profile cases lately, as the noble Lord, Lord Storey,
said, most children who are sexually abused are still abused within
their families, although I think that the explosive influence of the
internet may change that over time. Even now, child sexual abuse is not
a homogenous phenomenon. There are many contexts for it, and they are
all distinctive. A victim can be abused by a single relative. I have
come across families in which children are passed around among
relatives in a culture of abuse. An individual victim can be abused
opportunistically by a stranger or by a person in trust in certain
contexts—schools, churches, residential
homes, music lessons and so on. Children may be targeted by men acting
in pairs or gangs, abused by other young people, groomed online 
<?notus-xml column=489?>for abuse, used to make pornography and, as the
noble Baroness, Lady Doocey, reminded us specifically, trafficked in
from abroad for the purpose of
abuse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T20:33:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000188">The
internet and social media are modern phenomena that have exponentially
increased the capacity of predatory abusers to seek out and connect
with children, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, pointed out. The case
was reported earlier this week, as Members may have seen, of Anthony
Marsh, a married man, and Lee Davies who, acting together, contacted
more than 2,700 children right across the country. So far, from the
images in their computers, police have identified only 17 victims, of
whom the men admit to abusing 10, four boys being abused by both of
them. They operated for at least eight years, and for the whole of that
time Marsh was HIV positive. They have been charged with 69 offences,
and pleaded guilty to
55.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000189">There<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
are so many different forms of abuse—and they may be changing
with the use of the internet—that there can be no single method
of prevention. However, I believe that there are some fundamental
approaches which really ought to underpin everything that we can do in
terms of prevention. One is to increase the knowledge, the awareness
and the resilience of children themselves. The second is to improve the
ability of adults to recognise possible abuse, to be open to
children disclosing it, and to be able to respond appropriately. The
third is that we need a special approach to young people who
abuse<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000190">I
will make a few comments on these three points, and hope that when the
Minister replies he may be able to say what the Government are doing in
these areas. First, there is the issue of increasing the knowledge,
awareness and resilience of children. Here I agree with the noble Lord,
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> Storey, and
others who argue that there is now an unassailable case for better sex
and relationship education within schools as part of a broader PSHE
curriculum.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000191">We<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
need to deter children from the kind of risky behaviour with mobile
phones, for instance, that was illustrated by the noble Baroness,
Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> Howe, who
also mentioned the dangers of the internet. Education should include
talking about positive relationships and avoiding exploitative or
coercive ones, and respect for others. I say to the Minister that it is
now urgent for the Government to update the guidance for sex and
relationship education. This was last revised in 2000, well before a
range of relevant legislation that has since been
enacted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000192"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>The
Government could ensure that Ofsted examined the practice of schools in
this area much more closely, to raise the standard of preventative
education and improve consistency of practice across schools. Schools
are the only universal service, and they have a crucial role to play in
helping children stand up to behaviour that might turn out to be
abusive, and have the confidence to tell trusted adults if this is
happening.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000193">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>,
I turn to improving the ability of parents and adults to recognise and
respond. It is clearly essential for teachers, health workers and
others, particularly parents, to know where to go to get help if they
are worried. I am concerned that these kinds of programmes for parents
have diminished. Could the Minister say what the Government are doing
to support 
<?notus-xml column=490?>this? As my noble friend
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> Giddens
said, we still see vestiges of that historic denial, as we did in some
of the cases of sexual abuse of vulnerable girls by gangs of
men.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000194">Lastly<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
but by no means least, there is the significant proportion of abuse
committed by children and young people themselves. When a young person
is displaying risky behaviour of that type, potentially criminal
behaviour, there is more chance of changing that behaviour. That is why
prevention by developing special programmes for young people at risk of
committing sexual abuse is very important indeed. There are a number of
very good programmes, and I wonder what the Government are doing to
support
them<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_15_PT_1/E9A092DBE3458FBDB876D3CEAFDFB214686AD508" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 October 2013">Tuesday,

often lived with the horror and impact for many years. This is why the
prevention strand of the group’s work has been prioritised and
accelerated. It has already seen the delivery of useful early findings
on how multi-agency safeguarding approaches work. My noble friend Lord
Storey is right to tell us of the role of the education
system—and of schools, in particular— in this
work.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="131015105000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000200">The
noble Baroness, Lady Doocey, asked about human trafficking. Many of us
will have been in the Speaker’s great rooms this evening for the
APPG on human trafficking, which was extremely well attended. The human
trafficking strategy recognises the potential for human trafficking to
occur within the confines of the UK. The Government are also clear that
child trafficking is an important issue to be considered within the
national group. I pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Doocey, for
the work she is doing to deal with human trafficking by rail and in
other aspects. She has been a hero on that point.</hs_para>

and multi-agency working between local services is vital if we are to
protect vulnerable people. An excellent example of this new approach is
MASH, the multi-agency safeguarding hub, which is a huge improvement in
the practical way of protecting children. Multi-agency safeguarding
hubs allow real-time conversations to take place about issues including
child abuse, domestic violence victims and missing people. We are
introducing significant measures to improve the court process for
children, and other vulnerable victims of sexual abuse and
exploitation, to ensure that all victims of sexual violence are
listened to and dealt with appropriately and sensitively, and that they
have sufficient confidence in the police and the criminal justice
system to report such crimes.</hs_para>

revised <I>Code of Practice for Victims of Crime</I>, with a bespoke
chapter setting out the services and support for child victims. This
will be published this autumn, giving victims clearer entitlements from
the criminal justice system and tailoring services according to
individual needs. Victims under the age of 18 will be automatically
entitled to an enhanced service, and we have announced pilot measures
for pre-recorded, pre-trial cross-examinations of vulnerable and
intimidated witnesses, including children. We are also considering
options for ways to reduce the distress that some victims suffer as a
result of the trial process, particularly in cases of sexual violence.
This will ensure that cross-examination is not protracted and
repetitive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000203">As
I have mentioned, tackling this issue requires a multi-agency response
with co-ordination across a range of policy areas, operational partners
and subject-matter 
<?notus-xml column=492?>experts. To support this, we have published this
year revised statutory guidance in <I>Working Together to Safeguard
Children</I>. However, the responsibility, as noble Lords are aware,
does not rest just with government. My noble friend Lady Eaton was
right to emphasise the local nature of much of this work. We have
strengthened local safeguarding children’s boards so that they
can hold agencies to account for safeguarding children. The Government
are providing funding to the Association of Independent LSCB Chairs
that plays a crucial role in supporting LSCBs to tackle child sexual
exploitation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131015105000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#131015105000204">This
is why the Government are investing £1.8 million over
the next two years in four new projects trialling new ways of
delivering improved support to children and young people specifically
at risk of sexual exploitation. In addition, the Government have
awarded funding to several other organisations for projects that will
contribute to tackling child sexual exploitation in gangs and groups,
including £1.2 million over three years, from April 2012 to
March 2015, for 13 young people’s advocates to respond to
domestic abuse, CSE and gang involvement. The Home Office has also
committed £1.72 million per year to part-fund 87 independent
sexual violence adviser

Government have put rape support centres on a secure financial footing
for the first time. The Ministry of Justice is providing £4
million over the next year to fund 77 rape support centres across
England and Wales, helping rape and sexual assault victims get the
expert support that they need. The Government have also provided
funding to the NSPCC to provide the ChildLine service and the NSPCC

addition, the Government fully recognise the critical and valuable role
played by the wide range of charities and the voluntary sector. The

the financial sector are a number of critical pieces of infrastructure
that, if allowed to fail, could severely disrupt markets and the normal
functioning of the wider economy. The need to ensure that some of these
systemically important pieces of infrastructure continue to operate in
times of crisis has already been addressed in legislation passed by
this Government. However, there remain other pieces of systemically
important market infrastructure that have not yet benefitted from
statutory provision designed to ensure continuity of service in times
of crisis. With that in mind, the amendments forming Part 6 have been
tabled in order to ensure the continuity of service provision of
recognised interbank payment systems, which facilitate or control the
transfer of money between banks and building societies, and securities
settlement systems, which enable the title to units of securities to be
transferred electronically. These systems are integral to the efficient
operation of the financial system, processing transactions worth
hundreds of billions of pounds a day. As things stand, in the event
that the operator of an inter-bank payment system or securities
settlement system was to become insolvent, it would be likely to enter
the normal administration procedure. In such cases, the administrator
would be under a duty to look after the interests of the
company’s creditors, without concern for implications for the
wider economy. In these circumstances, the continued operation
of crucial payment and settlement services could be
threatened.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310167000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#1310167000004">Part
6 introduces a special administration regime, known as FMI
administration, which prioritises continuity of critical service
provision during administration. The key features of this
administration are the appointment of a special administrator, who will
have an overarching objective to continue critical services during
administration; the Bank of England’s ability to apply to a
court to place a relevant company into FMI administration with the
court appointing the FMI administrator—no-one else will be able
to institute insolvency proceedings against one of these firms without
giving the Bank prior notice; the Bank of England’s power of
direction over the FMI administrator; the availability of powers
allowing for the property, rights and liabilities of the relevant

will be designated if the Treasury is satisfied that an interruption in
the provision of services would have a serious adverse effect on the
effective operation of the relevant system. Insolvency rules made under
the powers in Part 6 will be made in due course. These will prescribe
certain procedural details relating to the conduct of FMI
administration. Different rules will be made in respect of England and
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Any rules made under this power

such powers will strengthen the FCA’s ability to ensure
competitive banking markets that deliver good consumer outcomes. These

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for
introducing these amendments. However, can we reflect a little on the
rush towards competition? A competitive system, if it is working
effectively, is likely to result in the elimination of institutions
from time to time, a process that was famously described as
“creative destruction”. That sort of process can be seen
quite clearly in countries that have large numbers of relatively small
banks. Banks fail regularly in the United States—it is quite a
common process. The process is, of course, managed effectively because
these banks are relatively small. Has some thought been given to the
relationship between the size of banking institutions in Britain and
the effectiveness of competition? If competition were truly enhanced,
one bank managed to eliminate another and both were relatively large,
that could be extremely
disruptive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T21:04:00"></hs_TimeCode>. This
is not to argue against a competitive process but simply to say that it
should not be regarded as an exclusive guideline with respect to what
are desirable policies. Has the FPC been consulted on these clauses,
and what is its

that competition is essentially and necessarily good and that more
competition is better. We have had manifest evidence in the past six
years in the City—and indeed much longer than that— that
there is a point at which competition turns in on itself. Indeed, the

talking about how we get more diversity and competition into the
sector. Obviously there is a danger that this can go too far. It is
important, however, to realise what these powers do. There are two
principal powers. First, Competition Act enforcement powers deal with
restrictive practices. Most people would agree that, almost by
definition, restrictive practices are not a good thing. The second
power is the ability to carry out market studies and make references to
the Competition and Markets Authority for a decision on whether action
should be taken. Earlier we were discussing the need for the
Competition and Markets Authority potentially to do just that. These
are not powers that are going to force the FCA to put competition at
all costs, at any price, ahead of everything else. They are relatively
limited and I think we will find that they are
beneficial.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="1310167000436" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#1310167000436">Amendment

group of amendments proposes changes to the statutory objectives of the

agree with the PCBS on the need for competition in banking and have

three operational objectives of consumer protection, effective

ultimately this should be done in a way that ensures that markets

straightforward and there are no reports of the strategic objective

is also a concern, previously raised by the Treasury Select Committee,
that because the FCA’s actions have to be compatible with the

structural requirement to pay heed to the strategic objective would
only really create a problem if the content of the strategic objective
were in conflict with the operational objective. However, the strategic
objective of ensuring markets function well reflects the values in the
operational objectives and does not undermine them. That is quite
deliberate. So the Government do not agree that the FCA’s
strategic objective creates a genuine problem.</hs_para>

to the second amendment. Strong competition in financial markets is
essential for getting good outcomes for consumers. One impact of the
financial crisis has been an increase in concentration in core banking
markets to levels where they are almost certainly harming competition.
The Government are doing a lot to address this. The account switching
service, the payment systems regulator and the existing regulators have
a role to pay in ensuring a competitive banking market. That is why we
have given the FCA a competition objective and duty, and are giving it
strong competition powers so that it has the right tools to get the job
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T21:10:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310167000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#1310167000027">The
PRA’s main responsibility is towards a safe and stable financial
sector, and this is right; but prudential regulation, while vital, can
run the risk of securing the position of dominant incumbents in the
market, deterring new entrants, and hampering innovation. Therefore, it
is crucial that the PRA gives close consideration to competition when
going about its duties. We believe that the PRA can take a more active
role in facilitating competition in banking markets than under the
current requirement to have regard to adverse effects on competition.
This would build on the important changes made to capital and liquidity
requirements and to the authorisation process as a result of the
barriers to entry and expansion review in March this year. The
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards was also of this view; it
suggested the PRA be given a secondary competition objective, and the
Government have accepted this
recommendation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310167000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#1310167000028">I

I assure him that the objective behind the two amendments is a shared
one. The noble Lord’s amendment is intended to make the
competition objective subject to safety and soundness, but I am not
convinced that it has this effect in all contexts, and it does not make
competition subordinate to policyholder protection when the insurance

are various functions of the PRA that are exercisable for the purposes

Section 55M of FSMA solely for competition reasons, and it might be
seen as required to do so. That is not, I think, what the PCBS intended
by its recommendation for a secondary objective. To require the PRA to
create rules and codes solely to advance competition, as I think the
noble Lord’s amendment does, would mean the PRA becoming a
competition regulator and would risk distracting it from its primary

integrity of the two regulators’ clearly defined roles. Our
expectation is that this secondary objective will see the PRA staffing
up with greater competition knowledge and expertise and embedding a
pro-competition mentality throughout the organisation. The PRA will
need to ensure that competition will always be a fundamental
consideration when making new rules, or determining its policies and

enforcement, will wait until something goes wrong and then intervene

the competition objective comes into the front rank along with the

make any sense at all. Therefore, it seems to me that the strategic
objective is entirely redundant and serves no useful purpose. Indeed,
the idea of changing what were previously operational objectives into
prime objectives places competition at that prime level and achieves
the objectives which the Government themselves have argued are

those who took part in proceedings on the Financial Services Bill in
2012 these clauses will be Groundhog Day—fighting old battles
all over again. The arguments about accountability are familiar, were
set out in great detail in the Treasury Committee’s report
<I>Accountability of the Bank of England</I>, and rehearsed again in
the report of the banking commission. This is not surprising, given the

briefly summarised. The Bank of England’s responsibilities have
been hugely enhanced, and its accountability has changed—one has
to concede that—but not kept pace. Not only has the scope of the
Bank’s responsibilities grown but so has its nature. It is now
not just responsible for generic policies such as monetary policy or
financial stability; it also has powers 
<?notus-xml column=511?>over the lives and livelihoods of individual
citizens and individual businesses. It is therefore important that its
accountability keeps pace with those
changes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T21:22:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Bank of England’s accountability to Parliament is its ability to
be self-critical. This is the key feature about which people were
dissatisfied. The Bank should be ready to review what it has done,
consider how successful it has been and draw lessons from that. One can
see that at some time in the not-too-distant future, the Bank will need
to review the whole exercise of QE, which involves the spending of
billions and billions of pounds, and be able to review the policy
candidly, even when the results may not be entirely satisfactory or the
Bank thinks that it can make
improvements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T21:23:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

abolish the Court of the Bank of England and replace it with a board of
directors. This is the most eye-catching measure—after all, the
court has existed for 319 years—but not the most important. In a
sense, it is what you would do last, having made the other changes to
signify that the Bank’s governance had conclusively changed. The
court has some desirable features, which were noted in earlier
discussions. It is a unitary board and is no longer chaired by the
governor. When I worked for the Treasury, I had to recommend
appointments to the court. However, it has come a long way from the old
16-member court, which was like an in-house focus group on which every
region or interest imaginable was represented. It has been replaced by
a 14-member court with five executives and nine
non-executives.</hs_para>

would contend that that still does not go far enough. The central
recommendation in Amendment 86 is not about whether the court should be
a supervisory board or a board of directors; it concerns the abolition
of the oversight committee and the transfer of its responsibilities

imposed on them. It is illogical to praise the court for being a

element of the amendments relates to expertise. The chairman of the
Bank has hitherto been a highly experienced, highly respected,
all-purpose FTSE chairman with an industrial rather than a financial
background. Amendment 84 requires that whoever is appointed should have
experience in financial matters and financial markets. However, looking

<?notus-xml column=512?>at the advertisement that has just been issued for
the new chair, I wonder whether it has really caught up with the change
in the nature of the work that the Bank is now involved in. The words
“prudential” and “macro” do not appear in
the advertisement; nor do the words “central bank” or
“knowledge of central bank work” or “knowledge of
international financial policy”—for example, familiarity
with the work of the Financial Stability Board. It still looks pretty
old fashioned. Therefore, we are trying to change the nature of the

should like to make a small contribution on the expertise point. I
believe that it is a matter of principle; it is not good to specify in
legislation the characteristics that holders of particular offices
should have. Things change over time and rapidly become out of date.
They are useful things to debate but not in the context of writing
legislation. In particular, the non-executive community should be a
balance of skills and expertise. To follow the formula here, they have
all to be this impossible person in having experience of running large
organisations and financial institutions, and expertise in prudential
policy. The gene pool is pretty limited on those, and to write that
into legislation is a recipe for not being able to fill the posts as
they come vacant. I am sure that it is really enjoyable to go back over
all those debates that we had and to relive the points that have been
raised by the Treasury Select Committee in another place, but for my
purposes they are not necessary for this

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, as noble Lords have said, the governance
of the Bank of England was debated at great length just a year ago
during the passage of the Financial Services Act. As a result
of those debates, the Government accepted that the additional
responsibilities for financial stability transferred to the Bank would
put strain on its governance structures, and as a result we provided
for a powerful new oversight committee, which has been established as a
sub-committee of the Bank’s court.</hs_para>

changes were introduced as recently as April this year and should be
allowed time to develop. Making further changes now would serve only to
introduce uncertainty into the Bank’s governance at a time of
significant change in its senior management. It would also prevent the
new system having time to prove itself. Moreover, it is the
Government’s view that that the amendments would weaken rather
than strengthen the Bank’s governance
structures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T21:33:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310167000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#1310167000056">I
shall deal with the amendments in turn. Amendment 83 proposes that the
name of the governing body should change from the court to the board of
directors. Our view is simple: changing the name of the court would
make no difference to how it operates in practice. Indeed, in substance
the court now operates along the same lines as a modern plc
board. It has a clear division between the role of the chief executive
and non-executive chair; it is made up of majority of independent
non-executive directors; and there are formal, transparent appointment
procedures for executive and non-executive directors alike.</hs_para>

that the number of non-executive directors should be reduced from nine
to four and would require the appointment of a non-executive chairman.
The reduction in the number of 
<?notus-xml column=514?>non-executive directors would drastically alter the
balance of membership of the Bank’s governing body, resulting in
an equal number of executive and non-executive members. It is our view
that this would significantly reduce the level of independent advice
and challenge available to the governors and increase the risk of
decision-making becoming dominated by a small group. The court already
has a non-executive chair, so we believe this proposal is
unnecessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T21:34:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

propose abolishing the new oversight committee and rolling its powers
into the proposed new board of directors. This would be a backward step
for the accountability of the Bank. The oversight committee, which is
made up exclusively of non-executives, was established to provide
stronger challenge to the Bank’s executive. It has a clear remit
to monitor the Bank’s performance against its objectives and
strategy, including the Bank’s monetary and financial policy
objectives. In order to deliver these responsibilities, the committee
has the power to appoint any person to review any matter. These powers
cover not only the Bank’s operational performance but also its
policy decisions. These responsibilities are very important to the
accountability of the Bank, and the Government believe they must
continue to be carried out by a non-executive body independent from the
policy-making process. These amendments would transfer the powers of
the oversight committee to a board of directors whose membership
included the governor and three deputy governors of the Bank. It cannot
be right for the governors to have a role in scrutinising the policy
processes that they themselves are responsible for administering,
especially when the processes in question are of such vital national
importance.</hs_para>

amendments also seek to introduce more specific legislation to govern
how the performance of the Bank’s policy functions are
monitored. This is unnecessary. The oversight committee already has
wide-ranging powers to review the Bank’s performance in relation
to any matter, including specific provision to review the procedures of
the MPC and Financial Policy Committee. The Government also believe
that it is unnecessary to introduce legislation covering requests for
information. The current arrangements are effective, and historically
the Bank has been very co-operative with both the Treasury and
Parliament. Moreover, Parliament already has wide-ranging powers to
hold public authorities to account, including the power to call any
witnesses to appear in front of any of its committees, as the governors
of the Bank of England know only too

Newby:</Member></B> I believe it is in this group. I hope that noble
Lords will not mind if I deal very briefly with it, and we will come
back to it if that is the wish of the House. Amendment 87 would require
the Chancellor to appoint an additional external member with experience
of financial crises. The FPC’s objectives are to exercise its
functions with a view to contributing to the achievement 
<?notus-xml column=515?>of the Bank of England’s financial stability objective and,
subject to that, support the economic policy of Her Majesty’s
Government, including their objectives for growth and employment.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T21:37:33"></hs_TimeCode> Government
agree with the commission on the importance of ensuring that the FPC
has the necessary expertise and experience to understand and draw
lessons from history. The current membership of the FPC equips it to do
so. In the Government’s response to the PCBS we will take this
into account, alongside other relevant factors, when making future
appointments to the FPC. However, I do not think it is either necessary
or desirable to include a provision of this nature in legislation. It
risks constraining the Government’s flexibility, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Noakes said, to appoint the best candidates by placing
particular emphasis on only one of a number of criteria relevant to the
appointment process.</hs_para>

am also not persuaded that the balance of the FPC should be changed by
the addition of a fifth external member. The current composition
strikes the right balance between ensuring that there is sufficient
input from the Bank, as executive, and internal Bank of England
expertise, while supporting the role of the external non-executives in
providing a challenge to members’ thinking. Furthermore, the
oversight committee, a sub-committee of the Court of Directors
consisting of the non-executive directors of the Bank, is
able to undertake or commission reviews of the FPC’s
performance, ensuring that it is held to account for its decisions. The
oversight committee also monitors the processes of the FPC to ensure
that all members have the required information and to tackle any
emergence of groupthink. In view of these arguments, I hope the noble
Lord will withdraw his

should be an additional external member who would have great knowledge
and he might even be an academic, which would enormously please the

only lesson of history is that no one ever learns the lessons of

generally. We commissioned a study of past financial crises. It was
conducted by an excellent man, Mr John Sutherland of the Bank of
England. It is remarkable how the same mistakes were made time and
again. Everyone knows now about the crisis of 2008, but the time will
come when that generation will have learnt the lessons of their own

reason they should want to do that when they have been given this
opportunity to buttress all the other excellent measures in the Bill

previous financial crises? Such knowledge is not widespread among the
great majority of people. I have known this neck of the woods for a

limitations or barriers to growth, while preserving the distinctive and
traditional building society model. Following that consultation, the

first, make it easier for building societies to communicate with their
members electronically rather than by paper. This is obviously in line
with what banks can do. Secondly, they will allow societies to create
floating charges. At the moment, societies can create fixed charges,
but are not permitted to grant security over fluctuating assets. This
causes practical difficulties, because floating charges are commonplace
in financial services. The ban was originally introduced in 1997 to
prevent holders of floating charges taking control of a building
society, but due to changes in insolvency law this threat no longer
exists.</hs_para>

more than 50% of a building society’s funding can 
<?notus-xml column=519?>be wholesale funding. This amendment will mean that
a certain amount of small business deposits will no longer count as
wholesale funding. The amendment will give societies greater freedom to
source wholesale funding, and creates a bigger incentive for societies
to compete for small business deposits.</hs_para>

will allow owners of deferred shares, which are a type of mutual
capital instrument, to be eligible to receive shares or cash payment on
a demutualisation, irrespective of how long they have held the shares.
This will provide an exception to the existing rule that shareholders
must have held shares in the society for at least two years. This
exception is necessary to remove the risk that deferred shares which
are categorised as tier 1 capital would be degraded to tier 2 capital
on a demutualisation, because the holder was not able to be given
shares. Fifthly, I should add that our new provision makes it clear
that the restriction applies to any right to acquire shares by members,
and not just rights to acquire shares in priority to others, as is
currently the case. The existing provision has not worked as intended

the amendments will allow building societies to change their financial

this will have cost benefits. Eighthly, they will remove the

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, in general these are desirable and
beneficial changes, although they do not really represent the great
boost to the growth of the mutual sector which we might have expected.
However, I want to raise just two major issues. The increase in the use
of electronic communication, particularly given the typical customer
profile of building societies, raises the possibility that certain
members will be disadvantaged with respect to the availability of
regular information and of course the summary financial statement,
which they should be able to receive in order to understand the overall
status and security of their building society. Is the noble Lord
content, and can he reassure the House, that there are suitable
safeguards so that those who do not have ready access to electronic
communication receive appropriate paper
copies<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310167000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#1310167000089">Turning
to the issue of owners of preferred shares, can the noble Lord reassure
me that the definition of ownership is the same as for those who have
held shares for two years? The noble Lord may remember that initially
when building societies were demutualised this caused problems, because
if Mr and Mrs Smith held a joint account, in fact only Mr Smith was
deemed to be the owner. If Mr Smith happened to die within the two-year
period, Mrs Smith did not then gain mutualisation advantages.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> a Private
Member’s 
<?notus-xml column=520?>Bill which I helped take through the House, we
changed that regulation so that in that circumstance both Mr
and Mrs Smith would have the advantage if one of them was deceased.
Even young Jimmy Smith would have the same advantage if his parents
were killed in a car accident. Does the definition of ownership in this
case have that broad scope that was specifically created for the
demutualisation efforts—in other words, the owners are not the
first-named person on the account but can include both a spouse or a
partner and a first
child<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310167000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#1310167000090"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Higgins" PimsId="962" UID="1310167000400" xid="1263" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#1310167000400">Lord
Higgins:</Member></B> As I understand it, the Government are proposing
to remove the provision that on demutualisation people had to have held

obtain a purely short-term gain, as against those who have invested in

Noakes:</Member></B> My Lords, I am probably one of the few Members of
your Lordships’ House who does not wear rose-tinted spectacles
when it comes to the mutual sector. I am usually filled with slight
horror when people tell me that they are going to modernise this
wonderful sector and I am not particularly interested in the fact that
it was in the coalition agreement. That is because we have seen a major
failure of the mutual sector in recent years—namely, in relation
to the Co-op Bank—and the history of the building society sector
is one of failed building societies. However, many
of<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> the things in
these amendments are not terribly important. Electronic versions of
documents and the like may well help to reduce the cost of servicing
very large member bases. My only concern is the liberalisation of the
amount of funding that building societies can have, which potentially
exposes the sector to greater risks. I would want to be assured by my
noble friend the Minister that the Prudential Regulation Authority has
no intention of relaxing its normal prudential approach to building
societies, as there is no evidence that given greater freedoms they
will use them
wisely<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T21:59:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1310167000362" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#1310167000362">10

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, asked me
two questions. The first one was about electronic communications and
the age profile of members of building societies. This is a permissive
amendment, and if members wish to be given paper copies of documents
then building societies in future will still be required to provide
them in paper form. In terms of the owners of preferred shares, I
believe that preferred shares are typically owned within the financial
services sector, so they are rather different from personal shares. It
is obviously a highly technical point, and I will write to the noble
Lord about
it.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T22:02:37"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T22:02:37"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="1310167000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#1310167000093">The
noble Lord, Lord Higgins, asked whether we were changing the two-year
bar in terms of shareholders and votes on demutualisation. No, we are
not. For ordinary, individual shareholders in building societies, the
rules do not change. There are never more than a very small number of
preferred shareholders because they are providing a specific form of
financial instrument 
<?notus-xml column=521?>to building societies. The concern is, as I said,
that unless there was an exception to the existing rule, there is a
possibility that deferred shares would move from tier 1 to tier 2 if a
building society demutualised. There is no prospect of the number of
deferred shareholders swaying a result on demutualisation because they
are not the same people as the ordinary people who have a retail
account at the building society.</hs_para>

the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, the Co-op Bank is of course not a
mutual; it is a straightforward plc. It was originally owned 100% by
the Co-operative Group but it is no longer, so to the extent that there
may be problems with the Co-op Bank, the mutuality issue is not
particularly relevant. However, there is no major relaxation in these
provisions regarding the amount of funding. The suggestion that
deposits held by small businesses should be treated in the same way as
those held by private individuals is just common sense. It does not
have a very significant impact on the funding position. I assure the
noble Baroness that there is no suggestion that the PRA should reduce
the rules around building societies because although many of us are
fond of building societies, nobody can claim that they were immune from
some of the excesses of the late
noughties.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="1310167000445" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0004.htm#1310167000445">Amendment

previous arrangements, whereby it was the police, the Crown Prosecution
Service, the judge, jury and everything else, in his words, were
incompatible with Section 6 of the Human Rights Act. Essentially, no
one should adjudge their own cause so last year, as he told us, they
hived off the adjudication process under which cases against doctors
are heard to a separate body in a separate building. It is still funded
by the GMC but, crucially, a judge now runs the adjudication process.
It is now petitioning Parliament to give the GMC the power to appeal
when it does not agree with one of its findings. In his opinion, that

Newby</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, we have considered extremely
carefully all the recommendations from the PCBS. They contain a number
of observations about the importance of banking expertise,
accountability, clarity of responsibility and consistency of
decision-making, which we certainly agree with.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1310167000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0005.htm#1310167000108">I shall explain how the
current arrangements already deliver all those things in a way that is
tailored to the regulators’ individual approaches. First, on
expertise, the call to create a separate decisions committee solely for
the banking sector partly reflects concerns about the level of banking
expertise on the RDC. At the FCA, the regulatory decisions committee is
responsible for taking enforcement decisions. Its remit extends beyond
banking, but that does not mean that it does not contain banking
expertise. Indeed, the FCA has recently addressed the balance of
expertise on the RDC through the appointment of two new members with
banking expertise. At the PRA, of course there is no lack of banking
expertise on its decision-making committees.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1310167000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0005.htm#1310167000109">Secondly, on clarity of
roles and responsibility, Section 395 of FiSMA provides for the
separation of supervision from disciplinary decision-making. Under the
current arrangements, there is also a clear separation of the function
of making enforcement decisions from that of judicial consideration of
the issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310167000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0005.htm#1310167000110">I do
not accept the argument that the fact that the PRA does not have an RDC
gives rise to human rights concerns. We do not believe that there is a
problem on that front. The prospect of decisions being appealed to the
Upper Tribunal means that the system already provides an independent
judicial challenge function to the decision-making process for all
financial services cases. The proposed requirement for regulatory
decisions to be made by a committee chaired by a person with senior
judicial experience, on the other hand, would appear to give this new
committee a quasi-judicial role more suitable for an external review
tribunal than an internal decision-making
body.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310167000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0005.htm#1310167000111">On
consistency of decision-making, I understand that a key part of the
recommendation was to encourage a greater consistency of
decision-making across the PRA and the FCA. Unfortunately, I believe
that the creation of an additional statutory committee for banks would
create only new inconsistency. The new committee relates only to
banking, so any enforcement decisions relating to a building society,
insurer or investment firm would be made under the existing framework
and the FCA would have to maintain the existing RDC. This would mean
one body dealing 
<?notus-xml column=525?>with the breach of a rule by a bank and a different
body dealing with the same breach of the same rule by a building
society, with potentially different outcomes, which seems undesirable.
While I think that the PCBS report contains some useful observations in
this area, I believe that the current, flexible arrangements are the
right ones. On that basis, I would be grateful if the noble Lord

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall be brief; the hour is
getting late. Like the amendment that I spoke to earlier about the
desirability of having somebody on the Financial Policy Committee who
had some knowledge of past financial crises, which I regret that the
Government have not accepted, this amendment is also a proposal of the
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. It is about lobbying.
The context of this applies to all bank lobbying, but it is
particularly important in the context of what we were discussing last
week in Committee, namely the ring-fence. We were very concerned, as my
noble friend the Minister will recall, that this should be strengthened
and kept under review. We had various proposals to that
end.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310167000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0005.htm#1310167000115">In the
United States, the parallel was the separation through the
Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. That, as my noble friend the Minister will
be aware, was gradually eroded over time. It was eroded in two ways.
First, the banks found ways round it to some extent. More importantly,
by extensive lobbying, the banks were able to get the Government of the
day to do a little amendment here and a little amendment there, which
created loopholes which did not previously exist. We know that,
following the recommendation for the ring-fence in the Vickers
commission and report. The banks only accepted it with gritted teeth.
They were not happy; they accepted it very reluctantly. They will
clearly be seeking any way they can, including through lobbying, to get
a change here and a change there over time which will enable them to
undermine the ring-fence. That is natural; they feel it to be in their
interest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310167000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0005.htm#1310167000116">Times
have changed. When I became Chancellor 30 years ago, the Bank
of England had no responsibility for monetary policy, which was my
responsibility. It did however have the dual responsibility of the
regulation and supervision of the banking sector, and being the 
<?notus-xml column=526?>sponsoring department for banks, representing the interests of the banks
to the Chancellor of the day. If the banks had points to make in those
days, they would go first and only to the Governor of the Bank of
England. The governor would assess whether he felt there was merit in
what they were saying, and if there was he would go and see the
Chancellor and put the banks’ points to him. That has all
changed. Now, the banks go directly to the Government of the day.
Indeed it is no secret that the carpets in Number 10 and Number 11
Downing Street have been worn almost threadbare by the lobbying of the
banks. That caused great concern to the previous Governor of the Bank
of England, and we had some concern about it in the commission. We felt
that the best remedy was encapsulated in this amendment: that if the
Governor of the Bank of England of the day feels concerned, he should
be able to flag it up in a public way. The hope is that that deterrent
will keep the amount of lobbying within reasonable bounds. There is the
opportunity to do that, and indeed there is a requirement to do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310167000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0005.htm#1310167000117">That is

Governor of the Bank of England should never hesitate to speak out
should he have concerns about the influence of lobbying by the
financial services industry. However, we do not believe that there is a
problem. Indeed, I fully expect that the governor would raise the alarm

particular factor or circumstances, including lobbying by a bank,
seriously put at risk the Bank’s ability to meet its

the Government do not believe that it is either necessary or desirable
for this specific requirement to be placed on the statute book. The
Financial Services Act 2012 brought together responsibility for all
aspects of financial stability within the Bank of England group. As a
result, the Bank has a statutory objective to protect and enhance the
stability of the financial system. The Government are confident that
the governor will act appropriately if he believes that excessive
lobbing is impeding the Bank’s ability to meet that objective,
which would obviously be the case if there was lobbying with the
intention of undermining the ring-fence. Indeed, the Bank has already
committed to raising the alarm in such circumstances in its response to
the Commission on Banking Standards.</hs_para>

time those contracts—which were purely gaming
contracts—were unenforceable. Since then, the exemptions have

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment proposes that the Treasury
should be required to undertake a review into the effects, including
the social, cultural and ethical effects, of exempting certain gaming
contracts from the rule which used to provide that no gaming contract
or wager can be enforced in a court of law. That exemption applied to
certain categories of financial contracts, such as derivative contracts
like contracts for differences, which could be regarded as gaming
contracts within the meaning of the Gaming Acts because of their
characteristics. Only those transactions which were subject to
regulation under Financial Services legislation, such as the Financial
Services Act 1986, and more recently the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000, ever benefited from the exemption.</hs_para>

changed significantly in this area. Since the Gambling Act 2005 came
into force, gaming contracts and wagers are now enforceable through the
courts, except in Northern Ireland, and the effect of the exemption is
therefore limited to Northern Ireland. In the rest of the United
Kingdom, there is no difference in the enforceability of derivative
investments and other gaming contracts and wagers. Much of the purpose
of the review proposed has therefore, in the Government’s view,
gone.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1310167000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0005.htm#1310167000130">It is
also unclear what action could be taken following such a review.
Trading in financial instruments is subject to European law, and in
particular the markets in financial instruments directive. This limits
the extent of the action this country could take in relation to
financial instruments falling within the scope of the directive. It is
unclear what benefits such a review could bring and we suggest that the

McFall of Alcluith:</Member></B> My Lords, I am surprised that the
Minister is saying that we do not know what benefit this could bring.
After all this is a derivatives 
<?notus-xml column=529?>market. We are talking about a derivatives market globally with $66
trillion or more. Not only is there a complexity in that market but
there is a total opaqueness. Warren Buffett called derivatives weapons
of mass financial destruction. So there is benefit in looking at this
issue. Given that the parliamentary banking standards
commission’s remit was to look at culture and standards, I would
like the Minister to reflect on that issue with culture. In my opinion,
culture is about behaviour and ethics is about conflicts of interest.
In an opaque market, there are many conflicts of interest, and
therefore it would do the Government good to open up this market and
see what benefits could
result.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310167000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0005.htm#1310167000132">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T22:30:15"></hs_TimeCode>

about the issue of culture. Of necessity, today we have been talking
about legislative change but, as we said at an earlier stage, and as
the most reverend Primate reminded us at an earlier stage in this

constitutes culture is a broad, almost philosophical question, but one
key thing that is already evident is that some of the more senior
managers of some of the bigger banks have recognised that, if we are to
get the kind of banking system that the population as a whole is
looking for, they need to change their ways. The chief executive of
Barclays set out his stall when he was appointed. The way in which he
has sought to instil a new culture through the organisation is very
impressive. But one challenge that he has, no doubt—we see this
not just in the banks but across the world, whenever there is any big
change in the way things happen—is how to get a cultural change
trickling down the organisation. It is not just a matter of the chief
executive, for whom making a statement about culture is relatively
straightforward, making that statement; that is happening, to a very
acceptable degree. But how can we ensure that the culture that we
require of everybody in the banks
changes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T22:32:27"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310167000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-0005.htm#1310167000135">One
way in which that is going to happen is, one hopes, through the new
statement of principles of banking practice that we discussed earlier.
If everybody knows when they go into a bank that they are expected to
behave in a different way than possibly they thought in the past and
they know that, unless they follow a whole series of principles there
on a piece of paper, they are liable for disciplinary procedure, they
are likely to behave in a more acceptable manner. I am sure that that
would be welcome across the

other big thing that we believe can help in terms of culture is the
promotion of the mutuals sector that we were talking about earlier. The

satisfaction levels, and that shows no sign of diminishing. To the

Archbishop of Canterbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I am slightly
surprised that the Minister should be resistant to what seems to me a
very reasonable amendment. One of the dangers that we have faced in the
markets over many years is that of parallel markets. The derivatives
markets are, as we know, opaque, as has already been remarked on, and
we examined them in some detail in the banking standards commission.
The computer-driven markets are also very opaque. We examined those
markets and remarked that they would constitute the next great crash.
When you have these gambling markets on the side that no one quite
understands or knows who is participating in them, and which often take
place offshore, it seems to me that at the very least there are grounds
to hold an inquiry into the effect they are having on market prices
through their impact on the shadow market—we should also examine
the psychology of the dealers—and on those involved directly in
the more regulated

of the great lessons learnt from the events of 2008 was the
ineffectiveness of the clearing system for over-the-counter
derivatives, which there was no means of settling. That has been one of
the major problems for the liquidators of Lehmans. The gambling markets
have much the same problem. We are setting up mechanisms—they
are being set up internationally—to deal with the settlement of
derivatives contracts, but nothing is being done in this parallel
market. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has made a very useful point,
albeit that the hour is late and it is almost 10.40 pm, which may

rather missed the point. The fact that Tom, Dick and Harry can go down
to the betting shop or the local casino, run up a debt and be sued for
it has nothing whatever to do with the amendment that I propose
tonight. As noble Lords have commented, and as is obvious, we are
dealing here with huge sums of our money which are gambled, often to
the excessive benefit of the gamblers. We do not know how they function
and have not looked carefully and closely, as we should, at the impact
of this. I refer not so much to the economic impact, although it may be
found that the destabilising effects of this market are greater than we
realise, but to the ethical, cultural and social effects. For the life
of me, I cannot see why a liberal-minded Government should want to
staunch such an investigation. I see no downside to it; it would not be
expensive and would be simple to operate. It would all be within the
purview of

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally)
(LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the draft Legal Aid (Information about
Financial Resources) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 amend the Legal Aid
(Information about Financial Resources) Regulations 2013 that came into
force on 1 April this year. The draft regulations make provision in
relation to requests for information by the Director of Legal Aid
Casework to the Secretary of State for Transport to facilitate a
determination for the purpose of legal aid that a relevant
individual’s financial resources include an interest in a motor
vehicle. This amendment is intended to support the Criminal Legal Aid
(Motor Vehicle Orders) Regulations 2013 that came into force on 30 July
this year. These provide for mechanisms of enforcement in relation to
unpaid contributions towards the cost of criminal legal aid in the
Crown Court imposed under the Criminal Legal Aid (Contribution Orders)
Regulations 2013.</hs_para>

orders regulations authorise the magistrates’ court to order the
clamping and sale, through motor vehicle orders, of an
individual’s vehicle when the contribution required to be paid
by the individual towards their Crown Court legal aid costs is overdue.
Before granting a motor vehicle order, the court must be satisfied that
the defendant owns the vehicle, and it is for this purpose that the
amendment before the Committee is significant. Requests for information
by the Director of Legal Aid Casework to the Secretary of State for
Transport, in practice the DVLA, in accordance with the amendments made
by these draft regulations will enable the director to confirm whether
an individual is the registered keeper of a particular vehicle. If the
individual is the registered keeper of that vehicle, the director will
also be able to request any particulars contained in the register in
relation to that vehicle. An applicant for legal aid is required to
indicate in their application whether they, alone or with anyone else,
own a motor vehicle, and if so, the registered vehicle number of that
vehicle. The individual’s statement that they own a vehicle,
taken together with the DVLA’s confirmation that the individual 
<?notus-xml column=196?>is the registered keeper of the vehicle, will be a way of evidencing
that the individual owns the vehicle for the
purposes of the motor vehicle orders
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000005">These
draft regulations also add the Armed Forces Independence Payment to the
list of prescribed benefits in the schedule to the 2013 regulations. If
an individual is in receipt of a prescribed benefit, the director may
request information about the benefit from various other government
departments, including the amount the individual is receiving. Due to
the timing of the secondary legislation that created the AFIP, it could
not be included in the schedule when the 2013 regulations were first
made; it was always intended to add the AFIP to the schedule at the
earliest opportunity.</hs_para>

information about the financial resources of an individual who is
applying for or in receipt of legal aid is an important part of
ensuring that only those eligible for legal aid receive it and that
those who can afford to contribute to the cost of their legal
representation are made to do so. I should stress that the proposed
data sharing arrangements with the DVLA will in no way impact on
defendants, solicitors or courts in terms of forms or process. There is
therefore no risk of any delay to existing court proceedings or any
additional burden on court users. As was the case with the original
2013 regulations, nothing in these regulations dilutes the
Government’s obligation to protect an individual’s
personal information and to maintain confidentiality.</hs_para>

Beecham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by welcoming the noble
Lord, Lord Bates, to the Front Bench. I am not sure that he has a

perhaps—in these regulations, but it is good to see another Peer

regulations refer to an “interest” in a motor vehicle.
That can take more than one form and need not necessarily be ownership.
Presumably, somebody might be the keeper of a vehicle which is rented
or hired, or indeed owned by somebody else, and I am not quite clear
how the regulations would apply in those circumstances. It is also
interesting that the explanatory notes refer to the fact that details
of the scheme were to be published in an addendum to the
consultation response alongside an updated impact assessment. I do not
know whether that has been published and I confess that I have not been
able to find an impact assessment. Will the noble Lord indicate what
the potential impact is, for example, in terms of the number of
vehicles that might be expected to be reported and, for that matter,
the number of vehicles about which action might be taken, presumably in
taking possession of those
vehicles?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000010">Will

removal or disposal of such a vehicle and what criteria would be likely
to be applied? For example, if someone, whatever his 
<?notus-xml column=197?>involvement in an offence might be, was dependent on having transport,
for example, to work, would that be a material factor or
would the process be directed simply at taking into
account a financial recovery? Presumably, if a contribution was sought
from somebody, he would be expected to dispose of any financial
interest in the vehicle, which could conceivably cause difficulty. Is a
process to be directed to that question? What other impact is
anticipated in relation to the application of the

relation to the other part of the regulations, given the concern about
members of the Armed Forces, I find it a little surprising that a
benefit specifically directed to, presumably, members of the Armed
Forces who have suffered a disability, possibly in the course of their
service, should be taken into account. Will the noble Lord inform your
Lordships about the rationale for that? I appreciate that it might be
regarded as analogous to the disability living allowance but one might
have thought that, if a disability is incurred in the armed services, a
rather different view might be taken. Will the noble Lord indicate the
potential impact of this, in terms of the number of cases which it is
envisaged might arise on an annual basis? Obviously, we are not going
to take a point about these regulations, except to note that they seem
to have been in force for some seven months before coming to this House
for consideration. It does seem an inordinately long time after
regulations have come into force to proceed with the process of
parliamentary approval. None the less, we as an Opposition are not
going to take any point against them as
such.</hs_para>

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that helpful
intervention. On the point about publication, the impact assessment was
published on 5 July 2013. On discretion, the primary
legislation already puts in a number of safeguards. The court may make
a clamping order only if it is satisfied that a defendant’s
failure to pay the amount sought was due to wilful refusal or culpable
neglect. The clamping order must not be made unless a defendant has an
interest in the vehicle, and a clamp may not be fitted to a vehicle
that displays a current disabled person’s badge. So safeguards
are there. The court may grant an order only if the individual has an
interest in the vehicle. If the individual shares a vehicle with their
spouse or partner, this would be sufficient. However, we would not go
after a vehicle which was the subject of a hire-purchase agreement, for
example<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:41:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000013">I
appreciate the noble Lord’s probing. I was one of the initiators
of this tightening of the regulations, because I had in my mind the
idea of the drug-pusher who was kingpin of his estate and who seemed to
be able almost to defy the law by driving around in a swanky car. It
might at least send a message to those who saw him as a role model if
his swanky car was taken off him. However, I understand that that needs
to be carefully balanced against other matters in law—and I

the Armed Forces matter, AFIP is a benefit for Armed Forces veterans to
protect them from any possible financial detriment as a consequence of
the replacement under the Welfare Reform Act 2012 of 
<?notus-xml column=198?>disability living allowance with personal independence payments from 8
April 2013. Like the DLA and PIP, AFIP is a benefit
which is deducted from the gross income of an individual when their
eligibility or liability to make a contribution towards the costs of
legal aid made available under Part 1 of the Act is being calculated.
It is therefore four-square with other benefits in that respect. With
those assurances, I commend the
regulations.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13101592000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000243">Motion

is evidence to suggest that the more informed people are about the
justice system, the more confidence they will have in it. Few people
have direct experience of court proceedings, and public understanding
of how the justice system works is limited. In principle, the majority
of our courts are open to all members of the public who wish to attend,
but in practice very few people have the time or opportunity to see
what happens in our courts in person. The justice system is viewed by
many as opaque and complex. We believe that we should make our courts
more accessible and make it easier for the public to understand court
proceedings.</hs_para>

rely on television and the internet for access to news and current
affairs. It is right to respond to changes in technology and society

do so in a balanced way which will protect the individuals involved and

and broadcasting of footage in courts below the UK Supreme Court is
prohibited by Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1925 and Section 9
of the Contempt of Court Act 1981. Section 32 of the Crime
and Courts Act 2013, which received Royal Assent in April, enables the
Lord Chancellor, with the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice, to
create an order specifying the circumstances in which the prohibitions
contained within the Criminal Justice Act and Contempt of Court Act may
be disapplied. The Court of Appeal (Recording and Broadcasting) Order
2013 is the first order to be made under that power, and sets the
conditions under which the statutory prohibitions on recording and
broadcasting will be 
<?notus-xml column=199?>disapplied to allow for recording and broadcasting of footage from the

and broadcasting of footage will be only of specified proceedings, as
laid out in Article 5 of the order, where these proceedings are in open
court and in front of a full court. Media parties may film only
advocates’ submissions, exchanges between advocates and the
court, and the court giving judgment. Filming of any other
individuals—including appellants, members of the public, victims
and witnesses—is not permitted. In cases where any party is not
legally represented, only the court giving judgment may be

long as any applicable reporting restrictions would not be breached by
broadcasting, in many cases footage may be broadcast “almost
live”, subject to a 70-second time delay, as agreed between
media parties and Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service. We
believe, however, that in some cases it is necessary to impose
restrictions on broadcast in order to prevent prejudicing any potential
future retrials, and to protect the interests of justice.</hs_para>

footage of proceedings where a retrial has been ordered may not be
broadcast unless the court gives permission to do so. This means that
in those cases where a retrial might be ordered, such as appeals
against conviction, the court must give its permission before any part
of those proceedings may be broadcast. Where a retrial is not ordered
by the court, media parties may show footage immediately after the
conclusion of proceedings. In certain limited circumstances, the court
may give permission to broadcast even these cases from the outset. But
until the conclusion of the case, the decision is solely for the judges
in that
appeal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000023">It is
important for justice to be seen to be done but this cannot be at the
expense of the proper administration of justice or the reputation of

the liberty, livelihood and reputation of all the parties involved.
Therefore, we have taken steps in the order to ensure that any report
or presentation using footage recorded in the Court of Appeal should be
presented in a fair and accurate way. It will have to have regard to
the overall content of the presentation, and to the context in which
the broadcast footage is presented. Furthermore, footage may not be
used in party political broadcasts or for the purposes of advertisement

or satire.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000024">The

the broadcasting provisions were debated in this House during the
passage of what became the Crime and Courts Act 2013, concerns were
expressed that the introduction of cameras into the Court of Appeal,
while broadly supported, might be the thin end of the wedge and lead to
the undesirable broadcasting of trials and proceedings in the lower
courts. I reiterate the assurance given at that time that any extension
to the circumstances set out in this order will require a

are conscious of the concerns that were raised regarding victims and
witnesses, and of the perceived potential detrimental effects that
court broadcasting might have on their experiences in court. In
particular, the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy,

well as a report by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, led directly
to the publication of a full impact assessment alongside this order,
and to our continued engagement with interested

rare that a victim or witness will appear in person at the Court of
Appeal, as the majority of cases will be appealing a point of law
rather than the facts of the case. However, in the event that they are
present, a number of safeguards will be in place to minimise any
potential impact that broadcasting may have. As I said, the order does
not permit filming of any victim or witness. Nor does it permit the
broadcasting of any footage of them. In addition, existing reporting
restrictions will continue to apply, and Section 32(3) of the Crime and
Courts Act 2013 provides that the court may stop or suspend filming, or
prohibit broadcast, in the interests of justice or to prevent prejudice
to any
person.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000028">The

Hope of Craighead (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I very much welcome the
order. I rise to speak because I have some experience of the operation
of a very similar system, which I introduced 20 years ago in Scotland.
The position there is that there is no statutory restriction on the
filming or audio recording anything that happens in any court. The
matter is controlled entirely by the judiciary. When I became Lord
President, it seemed to me—very much for the reasons given by
the Minister in his opening remarks—that the public would
benefit from seeing a little of what happened in the courts, and would
thereby understand a bit more about how the process of justice was
being administered. The opening remarks of the Minister were precisely
to the point, and I very much agree with the reasons he gave for making
this order.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000031">On
the other hand, I set as my criterion in deciding what to do the other
point that the Minister made, which was that the administration of
justice and the 
<?notus-xml column=201?>respect that is due to the court itself were absolutely fundamental to
any relaxation that might be made on any blanket restriction on the use
of cameras or audio recording. The system which I set up was rather a
modest one, but is almost exactly that which the Minister has put
before this Committee. It depended entirely upon the consent of the
court to the use of this equipment. Since we were allowing trials to be
considered for audio and television purposes, it would require the
consent of a lot of other people as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:55:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

step, because it looks only to the Court of Appeal process. That is a
good deal easier than the system at which I was looking. Nevertheless,
I have one or two remarks. It is of course very different from the
system from which I have just come in the UK Supreme Court, where there
is a live feed of the hearings on Sky, and our judgments, when we give
them, are reported instantly on YouTube. I understand from comments
that have been made to me that both these systems are widely used by
the universities, which like to keep track of what arguments have been
presented to the court and what judgments have been
given<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:56:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

not going that far, the Minister is making a mistake. When one looks to
the Court of Appeal, as I was doing in Edinburgh, one has to be
extremely cautious and move step by step. This step is carefully judged
and very appropriate. However, I would like to suggest one or two
points. First, the Minister might care to look for the future at the
practice direction which I gave in 1992, which set out one or two other
points to which people were expected to adhere. I do not have a copy
with me today, but it is available in the usual way and provides some
guidance to the way the system is operated in
Scotland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:57:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lords a little idea of how the system is actually used, one of the
points which came over clearly to us was that the broadcasting
corporations want quick feed for news broadcasts but do not have
available space for a good deal of dispute and discussion in court
unless, as Sky does, they provide it live on a feed which is simply
available all the time. I cannot see the live system working here
because, quite rightly, there is a check on what is being put out, so
that the court must give its permission. The Minister said it could be
almost live but cannot be actually live; I fully understand that. That
being so, the use that could be made of argument would be rather
limited<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:57:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

value in the broadcasting of, at least excerpts from, what judges are
saying when dealing with an appeal against sentence. I confess that
once or twice in the past two or three years I have wished that the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge, who was sitting as Lord Chief
Justice, had been seen on television. I knew that his remarks were
extremely well judged, but I would have thought that they would have
carried much more weight if people had seen him actually saying them.
That will be the great value of this in the future, almost certainly
the most valuable from the court’s perspective and also from the
point of view of the broadcasters.</hs_para>

things may be missing here. First, in Scotland, we find that the
television companies now mostly use the system for ceremonies that take
place in court. When a new judge is introduced, which happens fairly
frequently these days, there is a fairly colourful ceremony which takes
place in court. When the First Minister for Scotland is sworn in, that
takes place in court as well. These things do not happen, of course, in
the Court of Appeal. On the other hand, things do happen in the Lord
Chief Justice’s court which might be of interest to the public,
and they are not on the list of things which can be broadcast. It may
be that experience will allow for a little bit of relaxation to allow
that kind of thing to take place; for instance, when a new Lord Chief
Justice is sworn in.</hs_para>

documentaries. I think—but I would be grateful if the Minister
could confirm—that the recordings referred to here would be
available for broadcasters for use in documentaries. That was what
happened in our experience in Scotland. Six programmes were made to
show trials as they happened and, in one or two cases, the appeals that
followed after trial. There has been another one very recently in
Scotland, the case of Nat Fraser, where the same technique is being
used. It has been broadcast, using recorded material from the
proceedings in court. I can see some interest in the way this is done,
although of course it will lack the draw for the broadcaster of having
the evidence, but at least some of the argument could be helpful. It
would be interesting to know whether documentaries would be
covered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000038">Those
are the three points for further reference: first, checking how it is
done in Scotland for some guidance as to how the system actually works
in practice; secondly, ceremonies; and thirdly, documentaries.
Otherwise, I very much welcome this measure and I am sure that in due
course we will find it
beneficial<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T16:00:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13101592000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000180">4

Hope of Craighead:</Member></B> No. I think I had the upper hand, to be
perfectly frank. When I introduced it in 1992, the broadcasters
understood that if they abused the rules, that would be the end of the
system. My experience was that they stuck precisely to what we asked
them to do. I was not aware of any abuse of the system. My noble and
learned friend Lord Mackay of
Drum<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T16:01:46"></hs_TimeCode>adoon, who
is more familiar with Scotland than I am, may have other experience,
but that was my experience. Of course, as far as the Supreme Court is
concerned, we have to keep a careful watch on what is being used and
what is done with what is being used, but in my experience we have not
been let down by that either.</hs_para>

encouraged by the remarks of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope,

the Minister could indicate whether and at what stage there might be a
review of the situation. Obviously, as the noble and learned Lord has
said, if there were some transgression on the part of the media, judges
could stop facilitating the process of broadcasting. But is there an
intention—as in the normal course of events presumably there
would be—to review the operation, and would that be in
conjunction with the senior judiciary? We are limiting the
arrangements, in the first instance at any rate, to the Court of
Appeal. There would be concern if it were proposed to extend it to
other, lower courts, particularly if witnesses and parties were to
appear in broadcasts, but fortunately we do not seem to be following
the American model of turning this into a source of entertainment
rather than education. To the extent that this proposal will contribute
to a better understanding of the legal system, it is certainly to be
welcomed.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101592000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000044">I

impression of the proceedings recorded in Scotland is that the lawyers
and judges who took part were confident that the trust placed in the
broadcasters was merited. I have heard no criticism of the recording
or, ultimately, transmission, of the broadcasts. On the other hand,
among one’s lay friends—including legal
friends—who watch some of these programmes, there is a range of
opinions on the success of the venture. Sometimes it is clear from
questioning the viewer that he or she has not followed everything that
was broadcast. One reason may be that a documentary can only last an
hour or so but must represent filming of a trial 
<?notus-xml column=204?>lasting 10 days or 20 days, or whatever. To some extent the fact that
programmes are sometimes misunderstood or not fully appreciated
may—in a funny way—be a further justification for
taking a small but very well thought-out step

think the Scottish experience has been trailblazing, and none of the
fears I had about broadcasting the courts have applied to the Supreme
Court. It has greatly enhanced public appreciation and awareness of the
Supreme Court to have the live feed and the ability for the public to
watch it at work. I am sure my officials have already taken note of
practice direction 1992. The noble Lord is quite right that the
question of ceremonies and swearing-in is not covered by this order,
and I will reflect on that, because it would be useful. It would be
nice, when a Lord Chief Justice hands over, if there was some kind of
accompanying televisual ceremony. I agree with that. Furthermore, the
broadcasters will be able to create documentaries. I understand there
have been some good ones. There is one in my pile about a Scottish

can be doubly reassured because the Lord Chief Justice has gone through
this at every step and, equally, any changes will have to be agreed by
the Lord Chief Justice of the day. As I said, both Houses of Parliament

are committed to taking and retaining the DNA of people convicted of
crime. This is particularly important for offences of a violent or
sexual nature, where the transfer of DNA between victim and assailant
makes the transfer of DNA more likely. Taking DNA helps solve historic
cases and may deter future offending. The Government have supported
wider powers to take DNA and fingerprints from those with past
convictions. Armed with those powers, the police have carried out
Operation Nutmeg, which involves taking DNA from those convicted of
historic sexual and violent offences who were not sampled at the

need for the order arises from the way in which the Crime and Security
Act 2010 gave the police powers to take DNA and fingerprints from those
with past convictions if this had not been done at the time of the
original arrest and conviction. This Act received Royal Assent in April
2010 and was brought into effect in March 2011. It created a list of

list of qualifying offences contains offences under current
legislation, but not legislation which has been repealed. This
particularly affects sexual offences, as the Sexual Offences Act 1956
was largely repealed and replaced by the Sexual Offences Act 2003,
which came into effect in May 2004. So, for example, someone convicted
of rape before 2003 has a conviction under the 1956 Act, but this is
not a qualifying offence. However, someone convicted of rape in 2005
has a conviction under the 2003 Act, which is such an
offence—hence the anomaly which this order seeks to
address<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T16:15:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13101592000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000182">4.15

have past convictions for qualifying offences, the Act allows the
police to take their DNA and fingerprints at any time if this was not
done at the time of the original arrest and conviction. However, for
those with convictions for other offences, this power lapsed two years
after the Act was brought into effect—that is, in March 2013.
The effect of this is that, since March, though there is a power to
take DNA and fingerprints from a person with a 2005 conviction who was
not sampled at the time, there is no such a power in relation to a
person with a pre-2003 conviction. The order remedies this anomaly by
adding sexual offences under repealed legislation to the list of
qualifying offences. The order also puts those arrested or charged in
the present day with sexual offences committed before May 2004, when
the 2003 Act came into force, on the same footing as those arrested or

Rosser (Lab):</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his explanation of
the terms and purpose this order. As he said, the rules relating to the
retention of DNA samples by the police were changed under the
Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 in the light of a European Court of
Human Rights judgment. On this side, we felt that the changes pushed
through by the Government went further than necessary. Currently, if a
person is convicted, their DNA can be held indefinitely, except in a
few specific types of case. Under the provisions of the 2012 Act that
come into force at the end of this month, people arrested for, or
charged with, qualifying offences but not convicted may have their DNA
and fingerprints retained for a specified period. Those of people
arrested but not charged may be retained for three years if the
Biometrics Commissioner agrees. In the case of those charged, they will
be retained automatically for three years. As the Minister said,
qualifying offences are the more serious ones, which are mainly sexual
and violent. As I understand it, the order ensures that offences under
previous legislation that has now been repealed are included, so that
biometric information can be taken where appropriate. The order
provides also for those additional offences to be designated as
qualifying offences, which addresses the issue of how long the
biometric information can be retained. As the Minister said, the order
adds further offences to the list of qualifying
offences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000060">The
issue that I will raise regards the actions that the Government may
have been taking or not taking prior to the coming into force of the
2012 Act. It 
<?notus-xml column=207?>appears that police forces were told last year to start deleting DNA
samples in order to comply with the provisions of the Protection of
Freedoms Act 2012 that relate to the circumstances under which, and the
length of time for which, such samples can be retained after this month
when the provisions of the Act come into effect. However, the
Government do not appear to have put into effect any interim
arrangements to cover the fact that the appeals arrangements to the
Biometrics Commissioner that the police can use when they do not think
that it is appropriate to delete a sample in accordance with the
provisions of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 were not in place,
and do not come into effect until the end of this
month.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000061">Likewise,
the arrangements for when the police feel that national security will
be an issue if a DNA sample is deleted and so make their own
determination not to delete such a sample, do not come into effect
until the end of this month. It appears that no interim arrangements
were made to cover this situation, bearing in mind that the police were
told last year to start deleting samples in accordance with the pending
legislative requirements of the Protection of Freedoms Act. Under the
2012 Act, the police can make such a determination, which must then be
reviewed by the Biometrics Commissioner. However, the powers of the
commissioner do not come into effect until 31 October this
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000062">Apparently,
the police have already deleted hundreds of thousands of DNA profiles
and samples. A figure of 600,000 was mentioned. Why were they told to
do so when the DNA retention arrangements were not in place? Or did
Ministers have informal arrangements in place under which they would
make a decision on whether the police could retain a DNA sample for
longer than the time provided for in the 2012 Act, pending the coming
into being of the Biometrics Commissioner and his or her statutory
powers? Did Ministers make informal arrangements to address national
security considerations by allowing the police to retain samples for
longer than the time provided for under the 2012 Act, under which they
would have to be deleted to comply with the terms of the Act and its
provisions, which would take effect from 31 October 2013? As I
understand it, the powers of the police to make their own determination
in such cases, subject to review by the Biometrics Commissioner, do not
come into effect until 31 October of this
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000063">When the

part of the reply from the Commons Minister was the statement that from
31 October the police clearly have the right to make such an

they do not have such a right until 31 October, which is precisely the
point I am raising; namely, how have the police, faced with being told
last year to start deleting DNA samples that cannot be retained when
the terms of the Act come into force at the end of this month, been
able to apply since last year for the retention or extended retention
of samples which they deem it necessary to keep but which cannot be
retained under the terms of the 2012 Act when it comes into force at
the end of the month and when the procedure for enabling such
applications to be pursued through the Biometrics Commissioner under
the provisions of the Act do not come into effect until the end of the
month? The effect of the Government’s actions appears to be
that, for example, the police have been unable to retain or even apply
to retain the DNA of someone arrested but not charged with serious
offences such as rape, the sexual assault of a child or manslaughter
since at least December 2012, and this government-created loophole
lasts until the end of this

mechanism for such appeals has not yet been brought into being by the
Home Office, and rather than allowing the police to hold these data
until the legislation has been implemented, the DNA records are
apparently being deleted. Will the Minister indicate at what level
within the Home Office the decision to proceed with the deletion of DNA
records for those arrested but not charged with a qualifying offence
was discussed and then made? Will he say how many police forces have
ignored the demands to delete DNA samples in the interim period prior
to the coming into force of the relevant provisions of the 2012 Act?
Further, how many DNA records have been deleted, and what impact has
this had on policing capability? Alternatively, will the Minister
indicate that there is no truth at all in the matters I have raised? As
regards the Home Office e-mail published by the <I>Times</I> as
stating: “This record”—of someone arrested but not
charged with rape—“will have been deleted as a part of
the legacy deletions for stage 1a. As the individual was NFA’d

for an extension, this will only happen from 31 October 2013”,

that the policy to delete the DNA records of innocent people is
something that has been widely welcomed around the House and, indeed,
by the Opposition. That work has been going on. It has created a gap
which the noble Lord has pointed to; I have to acknowledge that.
However, the Government and the police, in considering the management
of the issue, have come jointly to the conclusion that there would be
no retrospective applications to the Biometrics Commissioner. That is
because to have done so would have required police scrutiny of the case
file of every innocent person arrested for a qualified offence in the
past three years. That is reckoned to be 180,000 case files. This was
considered disproportionate to the circumstances which the new
legislation is designed to address because, according to our knowledge
of those files, it would only have identified a very small number of
cases suitable for application to the Biometrics Commissioner. It would
have significantly delayed the entire programme to delete innocent
people from the databases. I do not think that the Government are
seeking to make an apology for that decision, because we consider that
Parliament’s wish was that the DNA of innocent people should
indeed be deleted from the

Pensions to implement AFIP on 8 April 2013 across the UK, at the same
time as the personal independence payment was brought in to replace
disability living allowance as part of the welfare reform programme.

little doubt about how it would benefit people and how it might be

seriously injured service and ex-service personnel in Northern Ireland
who qualify for the recently introduced Armed Forces independence
payment similar access to passported benefits to that of those who
qualify for disability living allowance or the personal independence
payment. As the Minister said, the Armed Forces independence payment
was introduced in April this year. The statutory instrument providing
for the payment covered all those eligible throughout the United
Kingdom, including in Northern Ireland. The payment is to cover the
extra costs that seriously injured personnel who meet the eligibility
criteria may have as a result of their
injury.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000092">Two
further statutory instruments enabled recipients of the Armed Forces
independence payment to receive additional passported benefits to which
they were entitled. However, as I understand it, these further
statutory instruments did not include amendments to the related
Northern Ireland passported legislation, which I believe related to
allowances for carers and the entitlement of pensioners to a Christmas
bonus. The Minister made reference to this. This point was the subject
of a discussion that established that, in this instance, the relevant
Northern Ireland legislation could

now turn to the key measures in the regulations. They enable postal
votes to be despatched further in advance of polling day, which will be
of particular help to those at remote locations, particularly overseas,
including service voters, as it will give them more time to receive,
complete and return their postal vote in time for it to be counted.
Providing for postal votes to be issued as soon as practicable at an
election will facilitate the early despatch of postal votes soon after
the close of nominations, and earlier than the 11th day before the
poll, which is the earliest postal votes  may be issued to many
postal voters at present.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T16:51:16"></hs_TimeCode> a 
<?notus-xml column=215?>consequence of the earlier despatch of postal votes, the regulations
also ensure that electors can continue to cancel their postal vote and
arrange instead to vote in person or by proxy, provided that they do
this before the postal vote application deadline—that is, at
least 11 working days before the poll—and that the postal ballot
papers have not already been completed and returned to the returning
officer. This ensures that the current flexibility afforded to electors
to change their voting arrangements is
maintained.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000105">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T16:51:46"></hs_TimeCode>
regulations also introduce a set of up to date voter-facing forms and
notices, including poll cards, postal voting statements and the ballot
paper, which are intended to make the voting process more accessible.
This reflects moves in recent years to modernise the appearance of
voter-facing forms at newly created polls such as the police and crime
commissioner elections and the 2011 referendum on the parliamentary
voting system. The revised material has been produced following a
programme of public user testing and consultation with the Electoral

Lords will recall that, during the passage of the ERA Act, the
Government listened to considerable parliamentary concern about the
need to ensure that there is a mechanism in place to deal with any
queues which might form at polling stations at close of poll, given the
isolated but highly publicised instances of queues at polling stations
at the 2010 election. These regulations therefore reflect for European
parliamentary elections the Act’s provision for UK parliamentary
elections, whereby voters waiting in a queue at the close of
poll—that is, at 10 pm on polling day—for the purpose of
voting, may be issued with a ballot paper and cast their vote. Let me
be clear, however, that this provision is not intended as a substitute
for proper planning by regional and local returning officers at
elections. It is for these returning officers to make sufficient
provision in the number of polling stations and staffing levels to
manage the volumes of electors likely to vote at polling
stations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000107">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T16:53:30"></hs_TimeCode>
a related note, these regulations contain a key measure to ensure that

parliamentary elections whereby returning officers’ fees may be
reduced or withheld by the Secretary of State following a
recommendation by the Electoral Commission.</hs_para>

regulations put into legislation that all postal votes are to be

improves upon the current requirement to check at least 20% of postal

has been achieved by a large proportion of returning officers, we want

blank. This is to help ensure that those electors can participate

EROs with the flexibility to challenge postal votes where there is any
cause for concern about their validity. Given that EROs will not be
obliged to inform individuals where fraud is suspected, there is an
opportunity for any such suspicions to be collated and reported to the
police, where that is warranted. This measure ensures that particular
attention is paid to the way in which mismatches appear and provides an
opportunity to identify patterns or anomalies which may indicate that
malpractice has been attempted. The regulations also permit those who
had planned to vote in person but are called away at very short notice
before polling day on business or military service to appoint an
“emergency” proxy to vote on their behalf, which builds
on the current facility for those taken ill.</hs_para>

regulations implement a European Council directive that amends the
existing Council directive, which provides that EU citizens living in a
member state of which they are not nationals may vote and stand as a
candidate in European parliamentary elections in their state of
residence. The position at previous European parliamentary elections
was that a candidate who wished to stand for election in the UK and who
was an EU citizen, but not a UK, Irish or Commonwealth citizen, had to
provide certification from their own member state of citizenship that
they were not disqualified from standing in European parliamentary
elections in that state when submitting their nomination for candidacy.

directive, from the 2014 polls onwards, that will change and candidates
or nominating officers will be able to ask the UK Government to request
information from their home member state. This requirement is to be
applied across all member states and is intended to remove a perceived
barrier to non-nationals standing for election in the member states in
which they reside. Furthermore, the existing provision allowing
candidates to obtain the declaration themselves will remain in place as
an alternative, should candidates and parties choose it. The Government
will liaise closely with colleagues and regional returning officers in
the process of implementing the
directive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000113">Overall,
these provisions make sensible and relevant changes for the conduct and
administration of European elections in line with those being made for
UK parliamentary elections. They are designed to increase voter
participation, further improve the integrity of our electoral system

Teverson (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome these regulations and
particularly like the Minister’s optimism about planning for
queues at European elections. Let us hope that that problem arises and
we can show that this new robust system actually works. Somehow I
suspect that it might not be the case but let us hope so. I should
perhaps declare an interest in that I am a director of a company that,
as a minor part of its business, prints ballot papers, including,
probably, for the European
elections.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000115">I
welcome all the regulations but just wanted to check something around
equal treatment. I am particularly pleased that it is now easier for
non-nationals of the UK and Ireland to put forward their candidacy, and
that there are fewer barriers to that happening. However, I would like
to understand whether and how Irish and Gibraltarian—and even
UK—citizens are checked for potential disqualification. I can
see that we are moving towards national authority where European states
other than the UK and Republic of Ireland are concerned, but do we
check disqualification for people from Gibraltar, the United Kingdom
and
Ireland?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000116">The
other matter on which I wanted to catch up is the date for the European
elections, where a range of dates is set. Have the Government
considered moving to a Sunday, like most of the rest of the European
Union? That could be an experiment to see whether we could increase
voting by holding the election at the weekend. Can the Minister also
tell me whether next year’s local elections will go back to
June, or the date for the European
elections?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000117">Finally,
a much more strategic question: when do the Government intend to
introduce open lists—as opposed to closed lists—for these
elections, so that citizens can make real choices, rather than ones
thrust upon them by a clique of political parties—of which, of
course, we are all members and should therefore declare an
interest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000118"><hs_speaker><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town" PimsId="5755" UID="13101592000231" xid="2032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000231">Baroness

side of the House, we welcome the regulations, including the provision
for telling those whose postal votes are rejected the reasons for such
a rejection so that they can correct the mistake next time. We welcome
the checks on postal votes. Along with the noble Lord, Lord Teverson,
we also welcome making it easier for people to stand for election in

going on to questions about the actual regulations, I draw the
Committee’s attention to the fact—which has already been
alluded to by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and by the
Minister—that this election also covers the people of Gibraltar.
With this in mind, we were concerned by the quite false
suggestion made by the Minister’s colleague in  the
House on 10 October—whether on behalf of the
Government or the Conservative candidates in the European elections we
do not know. The noble Baroness, Lady Warsi said that,</hs_para>

therefore ask the Minister, as he oversees all the rules and

turn to the question of the close of poll. Contrary to what the
Minister’s then colleague, Miss Chloe Smith, said in introducing
the regulations in the other House—words repeated today by the
Minister—the Government did not listen to what Parliament said
about the queue at 10 pm and being able to vote, and had to be forced
to do so by a vote in this House. Sadly, the Government continue to
fail to listen, including to the Electoral Commission, which has a
certain professional expertise in these matters. They did not listen
over that issue and they are not listening now over the Transparency of
Lobbying, Non-party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Bill,
where they failed to consult the Electoral Commission before dreaming
up Part 2. They are still resisting a large number of concerns that the
Electoral Commission has about it, in particular the demands on the
commission to make new sorts of judgments and to register a swathe of
new organisations and, in particular, its worry that it will not have
the resources to do so satisfactorily.</hs_para>

the current regulations which, again, will require the Electoral
Commission to produce guidance, particularly on the matter of the time
when postal votes can be handed in. As the Minister knows, the
commission continues to raise some important questions over that
wording. Can he give us a reassurance that the commission will be able
to manage all the new expectations being laid on it by the lobbying
Bill, together with its work on these European elections, which are to
run concurrently with the local elections?</hs_para>

another place promised him a written response. Unfortunately, I have
not managed to locate it, but perhaps the noble Lord will be able to
read the answer into the record today.</hs_parafo>

in earlier exchanges on other statutory instruments, I thought that
every opportunity was going to be used to forewarn people about the
forthcoming move to individual electoral registration. I was therefore
very disappointed that in my own area, Camden, absolutely no mention of
the move to IER is made on the latest registration form, which has been
done in time for the European elections; nor, I am assured, do the
forms for Harrow or Lambeth. Does the Minister know what action is
being taken more generally to prepare for this somewhat hurried change?
As he knows, the commencement order to bring IER into force is due to
be made on 8 November. Can he confirm that that is still the date,
especially as we have yet to see the details of the outcome of the live
data-matching trials using DWP records, which took place over the
summer? In some instances, they matched fewer than half of the records.
We have not seen a list of the particular areas, but it may be that he
has that information to hand. Perhaps he could also clarify how much
work is due to be undertaken by electoral registration officers on IER
at the same time as they are running the combined European and local
elections. Most importantly, is he satisfied that they have the
resources for both of these challenging
tasks?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_15_PT_1/7DEA48374D4C79D874CAE53D6D9345A1BE875039" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 October 2013">Tuesday,

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness,
Lady Hayter, for that fighting speech which has enlivened our
afternoon. I shall try to answer her questions as well as I can. The
noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked me about open lists versus closed
lists. It is probably fair to say that there is no common view within
the coalition on this, nor is there between the Government and the
Opposition, so it is a matter on which we hope there will continue to
be some form of debate. It is certainly the case that next year the
local elections will be held on the same day as the European elections,
on 22 May, but will then return to their otherwise normal date the
following year.</hs_para>

also asked about moving polling to a Sunday. All sorts of suggestions
have been made for encouraging people to vote and making it easier for
them to do so, including possibly having two days of voting over a
Saturday and a Sunday. The problem with many of them is that the
additional costs in staffing terms would be quite considerable, and
thus these suggestions have not yet gained the degree of traction that
I suspect the noble Lord might like.</hs_para>

far we are checking the qualifications of voters in Ireland and
Gibraltar, I had better write to the noble Lord to make sure that I get
the answer entirely right. The noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, proclaimed
the depth of the Labour Party’s commitment to the sovereignty of
Gibraltar. Perhaps I might be allowed to repeat something that I said
some years ago when this question came up. Under the 30-year rule,
papers were released on discussions within the then Conservative
Government in 1971-72, when a spat with the Spanish over Gibraltar was
in full spate. The Foreign Secretary scribbled on one paper that
perhaps one ought to consider possible alternatives. One alternative
came up from a relatively junior member of the Foreign Office, who
suggested that one might perhaps think of assigning the governance of
Gibraltar to the Knights of St John on Malta. A  
<?notus-xml column=220?>senior official scribbled: “Have you ever met the Knights of
Malta? You might as well give the sovereignty of
Gibraltar to the Young Liberals”. The reason
I use this example is that I once intervened on a Question under the
Labour Government and the Minister responsible for negotiating with the
Spanish Government had been the national president of the Young
Liberals in 1971-72. I pass that on as an anecdote for a pub quiz, if
the noble Baroness wishes to take part in one. I was very disappointed
that the noble Baroness did not ask me how many postal voters there
were on Gibraltar for the most recent European elections. I could have
assured her that it was probably fewer than 100. The entire electoral
roll is about
20,000.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000127">I take

the question of personation, I am assured that the rules for

take the noble Baroness’s point that there is no mention on the
papers going out at the moment of the move towards individual electoral
registration. Perhaps I may take that back and be in touch with her
again, because I entirely agree that we need to make people think about
the change as soon as possible, and must consider how best to alert
people about our move to it. I admit that, as usual, the effective head
of my household filled in our Wandsworth and Saltaire election forms
again this year, and that I did not check what she did. Therefore, I
cannot tell the noble Baroness whether either the Bradford or the

definition goes well beyond physical abuse to incorporate sexual,

are seeking to update the definition of domestic violence in the

the new cross-government definition. Through our existing regulations,
we already give as much weight to a single incident of domestic
violence as we do to multiple incidents, and we already include 16 and
17 year-olds under Regulation 14A. However, domestic violence was
previously limited to specific types of abuse. We need to ensure that
we incorporate the new definition in

that the Grand Committee will accept that the change of definition is a
positive and important step. For the first time, the definition
recognises that victims may be subject to different types of domestic
violence and abuse. It makes it clear that domestic violence can be
many things, and is certainly broader than physical violence alone. By
working to a single cross-government definition, we will enable victims
and those who support them to be absolutely clear about what
constitutes abuse and what support is

from the Office for National Statistics that 31% of women and 18% of
men interviewed in 2011-12 had experienced domestic abuse by a partner

Crime Survey for England and Wales has estimated that around 1.1
million adults experienced coercive control in 2010-11. That is why it
is important to extend the definition of domestic violence to include
such behaviour. It has been widely understood for some time that it is
a core part of domestic violence. 
<?notus-xml column=222?>As such, this move does not represent a fundamental change in the

introduction of the jobseeker’s allowance domestic violence

welcomed by external stakeholders and front-line staff. It is the first

its implementation had worked in practice, in order to understand how
well the policies have been operating and to ensure that we continually

Sherlock (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that
very comprehensive explanation of these regulations. We on these
Benches welcome the Government’s changes, not least because it
is another stage in a process which began with a government amendment
to the Welfare Reform Bill in this House in
2008-09.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000145">I
agree with the Minister that it is of the highest importance that
victims of domestic violence are given the space and support necessary
to rebuild their lives 
<?notus-xml column=223?>at the time that they move away from a situation of abuse. I think that
the regulations have the potential to form an important part of that
support. However, perhaps the Minister can reassure the Committee on a
few points. First, simply in terms of the definition—which seems
to be helpfully broader than the one that it succeeds—can the
Minister confirm for the record that no one who is covered by the
current regulations would be excluded by the extended
definition?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000146">The
Minister referred to the cross-government definition of domestic
violence that is now being used. It clearly makes sense to have a
definition in these regulations which is coherent with that but,
looking at the cross-government definition, unless I am mistaken, there
seems to be a difference between the two. The new cross-government
definition of domestic violence and abuse refers
to:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13101592000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000171">“Any

do not think that threatening behaviour is covered in these regulations
but I may have made a mistake and perhaps the Minister can point out to
me where it is. If there is a difference between what is in the
regulations and what is in the cross-government definition, can the
Minister explain to the Committee why that is the case?</hs_parafo>

tell us whether the Government are about to bring forward changes to
the universal credit regulations? Otherwise, of course, we would be in
the deeply unhappy position of having a difference between the
regulations affecting those claiming jobseeker’s allowance and
the very many people who I am sure will be claiming universal credit
any month now. Perhaps he could reassure us as to what is happening
with that. Do the Government propose to bring forward amending
regulations and, if so, when? How many people will be claiming
universal credit at the point at which they will be
changed?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000148">I
looked at the research that has been done on both the easement and the
DDV, which the Minister referred to, and very helpful it was too. The
Minister referred to some action that has been taken to follow up the
recommendations of that DWP research from June this year. The Committee
may wish to note that I counted 15 recommendations specific to the DWP;
I have chosen to pass over for the moment the recommendations for
further research that are also contained in the report. Can the
Minister tell the Committee which of those 15 recommendations to the
department have already been implemented in full? If he does not have
that information to hand, will he write to me to confirm that? It would
seem important that those recommendations are implemented
very soon, and the department has had since June to do
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101592000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000149">This
matters because the research showed that, despite the fact that we have
high levels of domestic violence reporting in this country, the take-up
of both the easement and the other policy are actually quite low. The
government report
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13101592000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000172">“We
know from official statistics that DV rates overall are high, affecting
one in three women, and that it is particularly
prevalent among unemployed women. Yet the Jobcentre Plus offices
visited with the highest numbers of JSA DV Easement cases were
reporting fewer than 20 cases overall during the course of a
year”.</hs_quote>

correctly, only 338 cases of the four-week easement and 115 cases of
the full 38-week easement were taken up as part of the JSA domestic
violence easement. That seems incredibly low given the levels of
reported domestic violence, and the report points out that those
domestic violence reported rates are higher among unemployed women. Is
the Minister comfortable that the policy has been properly understood
and implemented by his officials? If not, how soon does he expect to
feel confidence in that
situation?</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13101592000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000150">I
have one further question. When these regulations were debated in the
other place, the question was raised as to whether the position of 16

the Minister clarify that for the

Freud:</Member></B> I thank the noble Baroness for that. I know she has
a concern in this area. Clearly, domestic violence is a dreadful form
of abuse. We as a Government are committed to providing better support

the victims may be subject to a wide range of domestic violence and

specific question about whether the move from the old to the new has
left any form of abuse stranded and not covered, I am happy to confirm
that there is no situation covered in the old form which is not covered
in the new form. The attraction of having a single definition is that
it makes it much clearer to everyone—supporters and victims
alike—what constitutes the abuse and that they can go to all
government agencies for help with particular types of
abuse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000154">Running
through the questions in no particular order, on the 16 and 17 year-old
question, our regulations are set out in such a way that they refer to
all claimants. Clearly there are 16 and 17 year-olds who are claimants
and therefore we do not have to specifically talk about 16 and 17
year-olds because they are automatically
covered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101592000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-gc0001.htm#13101592000155">The
other point raised about the structure of the regulations concerned why
the definition is not replicated exactly. This is just about wording;
the practical effect is the same. It needed to be worded in a way
which, in drafting terms, was consistent with the powers in paragraph
8B of Schedule 1 to the Jobseekers Act 1995, which talked about
domestic violence which is inflicted or threatened. The conduct we are
defining must therefore be capable of being inflicted or threatened. In
that light, the reference to “threats” and the
“threat” of coercive behaviour, and “threatening
behaviour”, are in practice surplus to requirements: one does
not threaten to threaten. That is the trouble when one has other
legislation into which one needs to fit things. That is all it
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:30:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

covered there. On the June report, we are going through those specific

free movement rights were weakened by abuse and the Commission would
support Member States in using existing EU tools to fight such abuse.
These tools included sanctions, such as expulsion and re-entry bans in
certain circumstances and with

whether an EU citizen had become an unreasonable burden, and if so
could refuse residence and withhold benefits. The Commission noted

Commission proposed five measures to ensure that free movement rules
struck the right balance between rights and obligations: working with
Member States to produce a handbook on sham marriages; clarifying the
notion of ‘habitual residence’ through a practical guide;
increasing the share of European Social Funds (ESF) available to tackle
social inclusion from around 15% to 20%; organising workshops with the
ESF managing authorities in the Member States to exchange best

Commission’s acknowledgement that fraud and abuse was a real
issue, but said that there was still some way to go in ensuring that
the legitimate concerns expressed by a number of Member States were
taken seriously. A sterile debate about statistics would undermine
public confidence in the EU and its Institutions. The sham marriage
handbook needed further work and there was a need for consistent
interpretation of the Free Movement Directive, for example on expulsion
and re-entry bans. Many Member States supported the UK's position,
recognising that whilst free movement was a fundamental principle,
fraud and abuse had to be counteracted. The Commission took note of the
points raised and said they would be reflected in its final

the Presidency and the Commission updated Ministers on the current EU
response to the Syrian situation, described as the ‘worst
displacement crisis in the world’. With more than 2 million
refugees in total, Syria’s neighbourhood continued to bear the

greater resettlement efforts by the international community. To date, 9
EU Member States have pledged resettlement places, and the Commission

suit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101585000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131015-wms0001.htm#13101585000142">The
Commission said that the Regional Development and Protection Programme
(RDPP) was making progress. A total of £6.8million had also been
mobilised from the European Refugee Fund (ERF), but it was critical to
note that only £3.3million remained in the pot for emergency
actions. Future measures which might need to be considered were:
greater cooperation between European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and
the Member States under pressure; activating the civil protection
mechanism under the right conditions; and triggering the Temporary
Protection Directive (TPD) should the situation continue to deteriorate
to the point where the threshold was met.</hs_para>

Representative (Cathy Ashton) described the situation on the ground.
She welcomed the UN Security Council Resolution and noted that the
neighbouring countries were becoming increasingly unstable. 25% of
Lebanon’s population was now made up of Syrian refugees. The
Geneva II process continued,  
<?notus-xml column=64?>but had a long way to go, as the projection for the next year was that
the total refugee population would increase to 3.9 million. EASO noted
that for half the EU Member States, Syrians were now within
the top 3 asylum intake. The UK highlighted that it had provided over
£500m to the relief effort in the region, as well as
participating in the RDPP with a contribution of £425,000 For
the UK, more protection and support in the region, rather than
resettlement activity, was necessary for a sustainable longer term

Italy outlined the tragedy which took place on 3 October in Lampedusa,
proposing rapid establishment of a taskforce to oversee a range of
measures in response. The Commission supported the measures proposed by
Italy, and announced its proposal for a Mediterranean-wide search and
rescue mission to intercept migrant boats from Cyprus to Spain, working
in collaboration with Frontex. This should be accompanied by quick
implementation of EUROSUR, the planned external border surveillance
system for the Schengen area. In addition, Commissioner
Malmström urged Member States to consider both resettlement and
relocation activities to demonstrate real solidarity for those Member
States at the external border. Commissioner Malmström announced
that she would be visiting Lampedusa with President Barrosso the
following day. Baroness Ashton underlined the importance of working
with Libya and joined others in noting the difficulty of further
progress on joint migration work with the Libyan authorities. Frontex

floor to express their condolences. Support was given to the idea of a
joint taskforce, as well as increased cooperation with third countries
to dissuade migrants from making these dangerous journeys or to detect
them earlier. It was agreed that the focus should be on effective
engagement with the Libyan authorities. The UK agreed that the
collective response must improve. There was a need to target the
organised criminal groups which exploited the migrants, and to have a
better and more coherent dialogue on Migration, Mobility and Security
with an increased emphasis on border management. Migration issues
needed to be fully incorporated into the EU’s wider external
engagement with countries of origin and transit. The Commission agreed
to take forward the setting up of the taskforce, and would provide more

The Government does not consider that it is necessary to amend the age

can marry in England and Wales and any marriage under that age will be
void. In England and Wales it is possible to marry from the age of 16
