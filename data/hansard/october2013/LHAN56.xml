modern language skills is a barrier to anyone who wishes to work for
the EU institutions. We are addressing this at two critical points, by
encouraging school pupils to study languages and providing intensive,
targeted training for those applying for an EU career. We have also
prioritised higher education funding for modern language courses to
ensure the continued availability of language study in higher education

Harrison (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, given the British brain drain
from Brussels in European Union institutions, which has seen a drop of
some 24% of British people working within the European Commission, and
given that no fewer than two out of three jobs notionally available to
the United Kingdom are left idle by this Government or filled by
others, what more can be 
<?notus-xml column=882?>done on the language front? Will the Minister please study the report of
the British Academy, and can she, within her own party, douse the Tea
Party Tories, whose constant Europhobia inhibits young people,
diplomats and British people from taking the opportunities to be found

Warsi:</Member></B> The noble Lord makes the important point that the
number of Brits in the European Union institutions is low. It is right
that it has been falling over a number of years, from long before
2010—and I am sure that the noble Lord would accept that. The UK
represents 12% of the EU population but we have only about 5% of EU
staff. Not having a second or a third language, which was also required
for some of these jobs, has been the largest
barrier<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T14:52:45"></hs_TimeCode>. We are
putting in place a number of things. I hope that the noble Lord will
join me in congratulating my right honourable friend the Foreign
Secretary on reopening the language school at the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office in September this year, which was sadly closed in
2007. I am sure that he will also join me in congratulating the
Secretary of State for Education on putting an emphasis on languages in
schools and making them one of the performance indicators for the

Coussins (CB):</Member></B> Is the Minister aware that only 2.6% of the
total of last year’s applicants to the European Civil Service

recruitment process should collect information on the language skills
of new recruits and that an audit should be carried out across the
whole of the current Civil Service to establish the extent of the
language skills that we do or do not have? If she agrees that that
might help to target the individuals best placed to boost our numbers
in Europe, will she see that it gets

Warsi:</Member></B> There are a number of reasons why we have problems
in relation to that kind of recruitment. One is availability; graduates
here are just not as aware, as they are in other European countries,
that there are these great opportunities in the EU institutions.
Therefore, we have spent a huge amount of resource and energy in 2011
and 2012 in having a road show at graduate fairs to encourage people to
apply for these jobs. That has included ministerial involvement. We are
investing in language schools, as I have said, and we have also set up
an EU staffing unit, which specifically brings together civil servants
from across Whitehall, not just the FCO—the FCO hosts
this—who can be trained to fit into these institutions. When
people get beyond the first stage, we provide some intensive training
to get them through to the second

that it would be helpful if, in the course of speeches made by
Ministers on European issues, the availability of such positions in the

as well. However, what I can say from this Dispatch Box is that I am a
huge supporter of free schools and the opportunities that they present
to some of the most marginalised. I can give examples of communities
that I work incredibly with where children who have been let down by
much of what was available to them in the education system previously
are now being offered the best education—the kind of education

know, the new goals will focus on eradicating extreme poverty within a
generation. Central to this, as we all recognise, is reaching women and
girls, many of whom were left behind by the MDGs. That is why we are
very pleased that there is a proposed stand-alone gender goal and also

take forward the current MDGs. However, one of the most important
things now is to make sure that the proposed new MDGs, or something
very similar to them, are adopted in 2015 so that the progress made in
the past 13 years is built on. As noble Lords know, DfID is committed
to 0.7% of GNI going to aid. For example, my right honourable friend

there. There is new emphasis on, for example, good nutrition, which is
so important in the first 1,000 days of a child’s life, as well
as education—not just primary education but covering a wider

and, in the event of it going to a second round, we are still hopeful
that it will be concluded by about 16 November. The Foreign Secretary
released a statement outlining the importance of the democratic process

is a vital and positive partnership between countries. However, does
the Minister agree that there is growing evidence both of a severe
deterioration of human rights and a move towards authoritarian

among other things, provide an opportunity to shine a light on Sri
Lanka and to question it in relation to the many commitments that were
given as part of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. Some
recommendations from the commission have been implemented, but many
more remain on the table. We will deliver an incredibly tough message
to the Sri Lankan Government that they need to make concrete progress
on human rights, reconciliation and political settlement, and that when
we attend at CHOGM we expect to have unrestricted access to NGOs and to

the transaction or investment bank division was allocated shares. Other
divisions of our banking advisers, separated from the investment
banking divisions by the information barriers, were allocated 13

share a maximum fee of 1.2% of the IPO proceeds, or £16.9

would like briefly to say something about the progress of the Bill to
date. The Government are committed, wherever possible, to publishing
legislation in draft with a view to pre-legislative scrutiny. While it
was not possible to publish a draft Bill in this case, the measures it
contains have been subject to considered and expert scrutiny. The
proposal for a statutory register of lobbyists was analysed by the
Political and Constitutional Reform Committee prior to the
Bill’s introduction. Since then, the Bill has also been
considered on the Floor of the other place in Committee. Ministers and
officials have continued to meet stakeholders regularly in order to
take account of their views as the Bill progresses, and noble Lords
will note the amendments which were made in the other place. I
therefore believe there has been and will continue to be considerable
scrutiny of this Bill. I value in particular the considered input made
by the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, the Constitution
Committee and the Joint Committee on Human Rights. I very much look
forward to the further analysis that this House will bring to the Bill
today. I turn now to the principal measures in
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000065">The Bill
has three main parts. First, it will fulfil the coalition’s
commitment to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists. Secondly, it
paves the way for greater clarity on how much money organisations spend
on campaigning at general elections. Thirdly, it will give the public
greater assurance about the completeness and accuracy of the membership
register which trade unions already keep. This House has long had a
history of shining the light of transparency on our political system
through open and challenging debate. No doubt noble Lords have followed
the debates in the other place on the measures within this Bill. I and
my noble 
<?notus-xml column=893?>friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire greatly look forward to debating the
detail of what the Bill does and does not set out to do, and it is an
occasion for noble Lords to apply their usual thorough
scrutiny.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000066">I
shall summarise briefly the measures in the Bill. Part 1 introduces a
statutory register of consultant lobbyists. The Government believe that
lobbying is an essential part of our democracy and plays a vital role
in the policy-making process. It ensures that Ministers and senior
officials hear a full range of views from those who will be affected by
government decisions. It is important that everyone’s voice is
heard in Westminster and Whitehall. No one should be discouraged from
making their views known to decision-makers. There has been some
concern, however, that some lobbying activity is opaque and there is a
perception that certain powerful organisations and individuals could
exert a disproportionate influence on government. The
Government have already taken steps to address those concerns by
increasing the transparency of decision-making and the accountability
of decision-makers, such as Ministers and senior officials. We are the
first Government to proactively and regularly publish details of
ministerial meetings, government procurement and other items of public
interest. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that the interests of
those who seek to influence decision-makers should be equally
transparent.</hs_para>

details of all Ministers’ and Permanent Secretaries’
meetings with external organisations are published on a quarterly
basis. The statutory register of lobbyists is designed to address a
specific problem within that context, which is that it is not always
clear whose interests are being represented by consultant lobbyists.
That is the specific policy gap which the register is intended to fill.
It will do so by requiring those who are paid to lobby Ministers and
Permanent Secretaries on behalf of a third party to disclose the names
of their clients on a publicly available register. Our objective is to
ensure increased transparency without discouraging engagement by those
who will be affected by policy and legislative decisions, such as
businesses, charities, community groups and members of the public. Our
provisions for a statutory register constitute a pragmatic and
proportionate solution designed to address a specific identified
problem. The coalition Government made a commitment to introduce a
statutory register of lobbyists and to increase transparency in public
life. Part 1 will fulfil that

me now turn to the second part of the Bill. Part 2, put
simply, requires those who want to influence the outcome of a general
election to be transparent in 
<?notus-xml column=894?>doing so. The changes proposed update a system of regulation which has
been in place at the past two UK parliamentary general

Lords will no doubt be aware of the influence that third parties can
have on elections. This influence is often very positive, but we
believe it should be proportionate. Despite existing controls, there is
a real risk of distortion by those who seek to unduly influence the
outcome of the election. The Bill takes forward a number of important
measures to prevent this
occurring.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000074">Expenditure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:30:13"></hs_TimeCode>
will now be more fully recorded and disclosed. Donations to third
parties will now have to be published in advance of an election, rather
than after. Certain third parties will also have to provide a statement
of accounts. The spending limit for third parties will be lowered.
Thirteen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:30:30"></hs_TimeCode> years
ago, the existing spending limit was fixed in legislation at 5% of the
maximum campaign expenditure limit for political parties. This amount
was considered quite generous by the organisation that recommended it,
the Committee on Standards in Public Life. The committee also noted
that groups of third parties could outnumber expenditure by candidates
or political parties. That argument remains valid today. Reducing the
limit to 2% of the maximum campaign expenditure limit for political
parties combats the risk of third party expenditure being used to
influence elections. The reduction to a lower, but still very
significant, sum is justified.
To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:31:14"></hs_TimeCode> that same
end, the Bill also introduces a measure that will prevent third parties
directing the entirety of their spending limit at a single constituency

campaigns to overwhelm the local political
landscape.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000075">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:31:36"></hs_TimeCode>

is the Government’s belief that the vast majority of charities

Electoral Commission and its experience of regulating third parties at
the 2005 and 2010 UK parliamentary general elections. At those

Section 24 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act
1992 requires unions to maintain a register of their members’

it accurate and up to date. I hope noble Lords will agree that this

the Act, however, union members, employers and the public cannot be
wholly assured that a register is up to date. The Bill therefore
requires unions to provide an annual assurance to the certification
officer. Those with more than 10,000 members will be obliged to appoint

Hayter of Kentish Town (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the
Minister for his brave attempt to introduce this bad little Bill and
certainly look forward to the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord
Horam, who has been in both my party and that of the noble Lord, Lord
Wallace, but now resides on the Conservative Benches. I may end his
career by saying that he gets 12 positive mentions in my book
on the Labour Party in the
1970s.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000095">Alas,
the Bill will get no positive mentions in anyone’s memoirs.
Three years ago, we were promised a statutory register of lobbyists.
Instead, we have a skeleton register of only consultant lobbyists,
exempting 80% of the 
<?notus-xml column=897?>industry. The word “transparency” in
the title is a misnomer. It misses most lobbyists—HS2, Heathrow,
the trade associations, the ABI, the BBA, British Gas, npower and the
pharmaceutical, defence, tobacco and sugar manufacturers—as they
all have in-house lobbyists; and it misses most of those being lobbied.
It covers only Ministers and Permanent Secretaries, not senior civil
servants, spads and chairs of Select Committees—the name Tim Yeo
comes to mind—so defence firms can continue to lobby senior
civil servants behind closed doors, untouched by the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:41:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000096">The
Bill contains no code of conduct, so any sanction would be only for
non-filing of returns, not for unethical behaviour. Without a code and

the Bill is just silly. Anyone who wants to use a lobbyist has only to
employ that person directly rather than through a consultant, and then
that person does not have to register. The leader of the Commons says
that this is to know, when a Minister meets a lobby firm, who its
clients are, but he could do that by a flick of the wrist. He
simply has to tell Ministers, as they publish their diaries, to name
not just the lobby firm but the client on whose behalf the meeting took
place. He could do that by 10 o’clock tonight. Instead, as the
CBI says,</hs_para>

most pernicious, the Bill hits the small body, not the big. The House

companies can lobby via their own public affairs staff, but tiny
Alcohol Concern, too small for an in-house lobbyist, must use an
agency, which must then register. The same is true with plain packaging

about everyone considers this to be a non-register and that it should

give rise to confusion by the public, who are unlikely to differentiate
between consultants and in-house lobbyists and, because it does not
cover lobbying of MPs or civil servants below Permanent Secretaries, it
would dilute the objective of true transparency. The Law Society of

Government, we thought, wanted to encourage the big society and active
citizenship. Yet, as the Hansard Society has said, when public interest

RSPB reckons that it is illogical 
<?notus-xml column=899?>to halve the threshold and caps at the same time as widening the
activities that count towards them, and that this could seriously
curtail legitimate charitable work. The National Trust fears that it
could undermine its ability to perform its statutory role to promote
the preservation of places of natural beauty and historic interest. It
is concerned that this law could restrict the contribution that
charities make to public policy debate. Oxfam, which would probably
have to identify donors and the reason for their donation, says the
Bill could have a severe impact on its work. The Newcastle Council for
Voluntary Service fears the Bill is trying to gag it. It is involved in
the Living Wage Campaign, studying the impact of government policy on
local charities, and working with disability charities to minimise the
impact of welfare reforms on users. All fall within its charitable
objectives, yet all could fall subject to the

misunderstood and, to some extent, misrepresented. I hope that during
this debate, and particularly in Committee, we will be able to reassure
the many charities and smaller campaign groups that have been in touch
with us that the Bill is not about stopping them contributing to our
democracy. As my noble friend the Minister said, the target is the very
wealthy and powerful interests that would seek to influence executive
decisions and our elections, and which evidently feel threatened by
greater transparency. I am interested to see that some charities that
have been in touch with me now see that they have more of a problem
with charity law than with the Bill. They may have to look carefully at
the intentions of the Bill and at the detail of the charity law with
which they may have a

Bill is a first, essential step towards taking big money out of
politics: an issue that has been with us ever since Bernie Ecclestone,
the tobacco lobby and Formula 1 was brought to our attention in the
early years of the Blair regime. That has obviously increased our
awareness of the threat to our democracy. I recall that the noble
Baroness, Lady Royall, urged the Government to introduce a lobbying
Bill in her contribution to the debates in May—and I endorsed
her request. Ironically, she referred specifically to the tobacco lobby

suppose would now be described as lobbying. The Government’s
intention—rightly, in my view—is not to regulate lobbying
but to ensure that the sunshine is very firmly imposed on it. We need
to know who has the ear of Ministers and other decision-makers. To my
mind, including in-house lobbyists would be a red herring and would
create a huge telephone directory-style registry, including a huge
number of people who would actually be irrelevant to greater
transparency. It would not improve the extent to which we could see

online front end, through which anyone—the media, individual
citizens, Members of your Lordships’ House—could
establish who has met whom in Government, and indeed what the subject
has been at what stage, without, as is currently the case,
having to go through 60 different Excel spreadsheets, each
parcelled away in different obscure parts of departmental websites. The
key to transparency is easy access and simplicity, and the register is

to ensure that the meetings of special advisers, who are not directly

members of the Civil Service, with any consultant lobbyists who have
interacted with them are appropriately registered. We should remember
that two of the most dramatic scandals involving privileged access in
recent years involved ministerial advisers rather than Ministers
themselves. Secondly, we have to look very carefully to see how
the new statutory register can complement existing voluntary
arrangements. The register that the Government propose is deliberately
a statutory minimum, but surely it would be perverse if lobbyists then

the unintended consequences of what is being proposed in Part 2 for one

shall try to illustrate my reasoning by referring to those charitable
and voluntary organisations that work in the criminal justice field. At
present, the Secretary of State for Justice is seeking to implement
what he calls a rehabilitation revolution. At the heart of this, he
seeks to reduce the appalling reoffending rate, which is impossible to
measure, by awarding contracts to private and voluntary organisations
that will be paid by their results. The work that they do with and for
offenders will be funded either by social impact bonds, taken out by
investors, or the private and voluntary organisations themselves in the
hope that they will be successful and so earn
payment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000140">Contracting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:10:43"></hs_TimeCode>
the voluntary sector is not something new to this Government, but the
method is deeply troubling some members of both
parts—foundations and trusts, which fund organisations, and the
organisations themselves, some quite large and some tiny, which do the
work up and down the country, for which they seek funding, either from
foundations or trusts or from private donations. The Government call
this a partnership, but one ingredient of a successful partnership is
mutual trust. The Government must bear in mind that, as at least 50% of
rehabilitation work is done by the voluntary sector, they must not do
anything that undermines its ability or willingness to contribute to
that work. Above all, the Government must avoid giving the impression
that they think they own the voluntary sector—nor must they
forget that donors do not give money to fund a contracting process;
they give it so that the work that they wish to support can be
conducted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:11:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000141">While
some organisations may involve themselves with policy—indeed,
some exist to conduct and publish research and
recommendations—that is directed at whichever political party is
in power, and in no sense can it be described as electioneering. Even
if they were tempted to involve themselves, they are prevented from
doing so by the current system of checks and balances, with regulation
by the Charity Commission, including a document called
<I>CC9—Speaking Out Guidance on Campaigning and Political
Activity by Charities</I>, which sets out clear, sensible and balanced
rules; guidance by the Electoral Commission on campaigning in the
run-up to elections, including rules about supporting candidates and
parties; and the fact that all charities must prepare accounts, which
they must make available on request. Therefore, I believe that the
restrictions on this most important activity by those in support of the
criminal justice system that are implied in Schedule 3 of the Bill are
not only inappropriate, because they are already more than adequately
covered, but potentially damage the protection of the
public.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000142">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:13:48"></hs_TimeCode>

damage that the proposals are doing to the very trust and confidence

always enjoyed the precious freedom to speak out on key issues,

as regards the test of influencing electoral outcomes, what is at stake
here is not the transparency of lobbying but the danger of trying to
control politics and standardise political debate on the single model
of political parties, which are only one part of the mix. The Bill is
part of a process whereby politics has been professionalised. This
House is part of that process as many Members are full-time
professional politicians. That has led to high standards and enormously
sophisticated legislation, but at the same time politics has taken an
inward turn to the pragmatic and is less guided by the big visionary
ideologies of the past. The result of politics becoming
professionalised and pragmatic has been disastrous for democratic
politics because the demos, the people, have just walked away. It has
become so professional, detailed and dominated by experts and expert
groups wanting smart outcomes, that the great public, as we know, have
retreated into personal space to get on with life and cannot even be
bothered to turn out at elections. Democracy is in crisis in our

groups with sharp, smart outcomes are filling the space of working
politics and ordinary people with political instincts are being
excluded. What we lack in politics, it seems to me, is a space for the
amateur, those with occasional engagement and people interested in
particular issues. Very few people are members of political parties or
of the professional lobbying groups that pursue political lobbying in a
smart way, but millions of people are involved in charities and faith
groups. The importance of all those millions of people is that we
gather together in faith groups and charities to pursue goodness for
ourselves and others, and that is a political energy. People want to do
good for their neighbour, community and country. That is political
energy. It is often concerned with big issues and principles and is
often vague and unformed, but surely the task of a Government and their
legislation should not be to close all that down and put it in a box

the Minister comment on free speech and freedom of assembly? Does the
Minister accept that charities and faith groups bring a different kind
of political energy? One that is vital and needs encouraging and cannot
be bureaucratised into processes and ways of operating that have suited
political parties—in the past at least—but do not suit

what does the Minister say about charities and faith groups convening
hustings—meetings—to discuss political issues? The
proposed regulatory framework might make this subject to registration,
putting in accounts and all that kind of thing. There is a great
aspiration from this Government for a big society, which I believe in.
The danger of these proposals is that we are bringing into effect a Big
Brother society where all the little details are imposed on people from
a very narrow model sapping political energy and making it more

rapidly, on the second test of levels of financial expenditure, can the

a financial measure for energy that is so often less focused but
equally vibrant? Charity law provides a well established regulatory
framework for the political engagement of this sector. Why have we
brought in these lower thresholds that bring a bureaucratic control and
pressure on the free-flowing energy of political concern among
the 
<?notus-xml column=908?>wider public? What is the rationale for extending the scope of
controlled expenditure on third parties? Why has the financial tool

third test is the use of constituency as the measure. This may just
show my ignorance of how politics works. I can understand the need for
a constituency to order voters in a particular mass so you can count
them. However, in an age of social media how are you going to measure
the geographical influence of anybody, even if they are in
somebody’s constituency? How are you going to measure whether it
affects people over the border or has come from somewhere else? Freedom
of association has a very different meaning in the virtual age. I would
have hoped that this legislation would have thought about that
creatively but the test of a constituency and its effect is a rather
crude and simplistic measure. Will the Minister give a rationale for
the constituency test and the criteria that can really be used to make
an informed judgment when all this stuff flies around the internet all

need transparency for professional lobbying and for political parties

should rejoice that so many charities, faith groups and voluntary

political sphere through our tradition of charity Acts. Politics needs
this political energy for the common good and all the signals—as
we can tell from our e-mail inboxes—are that this source of
political energy is being closed down and discouraged at the very time
we are wringing our hands because the great public are not interested
in political parties, elections or the democratic process. So I, too,
hope that there will be a pause, and that the Minister will be willing
to sit down with representatives of charities, faith and voluntary
groups to look at proper controls and accountability. There must be
accountability. How can it come out of the existing charity law, and

Lang of Monkton (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to
follow the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Derby. As we are
debating a lobbying Bill, I suppose that I should declare my interests.
I had the honour to chair the Advisory Committee on Business
Appointments, which is much concerned with lobbying, and to be a member
of the Select Committee on the Constitution. Both, in a sense, are
marginal to the central debate surrounding this Bill, but the Select
Committee criticised, with good cause, the unnecessary speed and lack
of advance consultation with which the Bill was introduced in another
place. I believe that undue haste is bad government. The matter was
three years in gestation with no draft Bill, no White Paper and no
consultation, and unsurprisingly therefore the content has been 
<?notus-xml column=909?>widely criticised. This, I believe, should be, as the committee said in
its report, a matter of significant concern. Indeed, it baffles me that
Governments should behave in this unnecessary but highly provocative
way.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102266000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000156">I know
that, because of that, Part 2 of the Bill has aroused great
concern—we have heard much of that already in this
debate—especially among charities. Of course, Part 3 was always
bound to attract a certain amount of interest from the party opposite,
but in the time available I propose to confine my remarks to
Part 1.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102266000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000157">While
the Bill aims at professional consultant lobbyists, the Advisory
Committee on Business Appointments focuses on individuals. We are
concerned with Ministers leaving government and senior civil servants
leaving or retiring from the Civil Service, and that embraces
ambassadors and senior military personnel. One of our tasks in
considering their applications to us is to prevent them, when taking up
subsequent appointments, whether with industry, commerce or even
charities and consultancies, lobbying their former colleagues or
government in general for up to two years. We are concerned with a
different part of the lobbying spectrum. It is a broad and divisive
spectrum, and therefore we have a different definition of
lobbying.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102266000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000158">The
Bill has another definition because it has a different focus: on
corporate lobbying consultancies, rather than on individuals. I believe
that definition is all in these matters, and a single, comprehensive
definition of lobbying is elusive—indeed, perhaps impossible. As
the Government’s briefing note says, and as the Minister said
today, its aim is to,</hs_para>
<hs_quotefo UID="13102266000288" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000288">“shine the

complete regulator of the industry. That creates anomalies, which I
shall come to, but it is probably wise to concentrate on that category
in the Bill rather than to seek a comprehensive solution, because
lobbying comes in all shapes and sizes and from many different sources.
They are not all malign or dangerous to parliamentary democracy.
Indeed, the taint that has begun to fall on some aspects should not be
allowed to be got out of proportion.</hs_parafo>

another has been around for centuries. Plantagenet kings held their
Parliaments in all parts of England, and they summoned those
Parliaments not just to raise taxation for their foreign wars and
crusades but to hear the pleas, complaints and concerns of their
citizens, to entrench their kingship and, indeed, to enact Acts of
Parliament and thus to give form to the rule of law over a period of
time.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102266000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000160">Ever
since then, lobbying has been, and is, part of the life-blood of our
parliamentary democracy. We cannot and should not seek to choke it off.
Therefore, the Bill is surely right not to try to do that but to focus
on the main areas of concern. However, shining the light of
transparency, in the best Nolan tradition, on one aspect underlines the
lack of transparency in others. It may be that the parameters are too
tightly drawn, and that needs to be explained because a spotlight on
one sector casts a shadow around about it. For example, the Bill does
not include in-house public affairs departments or multiclient firms,
such as lawyers pursuing the legal interests of their clients. What of
consultant lobbyists who do not themselves 
<?notus-xml column=910?>lobby government, but who train their clients and advise them on whom to
lobby and how to go about lobbying?</hs_para>

lobbied, the focus is put on Ministers and Permanent Secretaries or the
equivalent, but does not cover special advisers, who are often well
placed to influence government policy. What about those civil servants
who are below Permanent Secretary level, but are highly expert and
influential in particular sectors of, for example, industry, defence or
health and may work closely with major companies in those fields?
Ministers and Permanent Secretaries are already required to disclose on
a quarterly basis the names of those outside government whom they meet.
Has the Minister considered whether an easier, and perhaps more
effective, approach to the lobbying issue might be to require anyone in
government, whether parliamentarian or civil servant, who is lobbied by
discernible commercial interest to declare that in a lobbying
register?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102266000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000162">I
welcome the provisions approved in another place and the clarification
in Schedule 1 of the position of parliamentarians. In this House in
particular, there are many noble Lords with distinguished careers from
which they have derived immense expertise and wisdom who could feel
inhibited from speaking on their specialist subjects in this House for
fear of being thought, quite wrongly, to be lobbying in some way. I
hope that the Bill may help to lift that particular shadow.</hs_para>

remaining speakers in this debate I have been relatively brief. I
conclude by saying that the Bill as it stands, with its register,
registrar and enforcement powers, has a net, but one that will probably
catch few fish. It may be enough to draw the sting and the taint from
the lobbying issue. I hope so; but if not, it will be something
to build
on.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_22_PT_1/8087DEF8945ED442E344D28B8EB95C2CBD2B9B95" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 October 2013">Tuesday,

Kennedy of The Shaws (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is important that
we retain some clarity about why there were calls for a Bill to
regulate lobbying. It was to deal with the damage to our democracy
caused by the introduction of professional lobbyists and the toxic
effect of big money. There was general concern that our democracy
should not fall into the grip of rich men or commercial interests. I am
afraid that both our Houses came under scrutiny because of the ways in
which wads of cash and other inducements seem to be waved at
politicians to secure favourable policy, or even promises of places on
boards at the end of political careers.</hs_para>

reasons, therefore, why there should be calls for a Bill. As citizens,
we seek the attention of our politicians to persuade them of our cause,
so that the interests and concerns of all sections of our population
might be better served. Lobbying is vital to our democracy: it is how
we change policy and push for different legislation; it is how we see
society evolving and how democracy ultimately works.</hs_para>

agreement—no disagreement at all—that big spending
campaigns should be properly regulated. But the changes made in this
Bill, compared with what was in place for the two previous
elections, mean that charities and campaigning groups feel that their
fundamental right to free speech will be severely curtailed. They have
not been consulted and nor has the Electoral Commission, which has to
offer guidance on the implementation of the law. They have grave doubts

2 of the Bill, as we heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, has
united an extraordinary number of organisations. I am not going to go

charities and campaigning groups need to be consulted is that they are
key players in keeping our democracy alive. With the drastic fall in
political party membership and the indifference of so many to
professional politics, it is 
<?notus-xml column=913?>these groups that arouse people’s interest and help to focus
their concerns. At election times it is the churches and charities that
organise the hustings. The CARE organisation, for example, was
responsible for facilitating more than 300 hustings during the last
election. It is the charities and campaigning groups that educate the
electorate about particular issues so that they can put intelligent
questions to the candidates. Overall they have had a huge influence. It
was the churches and aid agencies which combined together to mount one
of the biggest campaigns that we have ever seen, on dropping
third-world debt. That was followed up with campaigns on the millennium
goals and overseas aid generally. These campaigns have influenced all
the major parties in a very positive way—how much poorer the
world would have been without them. Because of the key role that these
bodies now play in democratic engagement and in keeping democracy
alive, Parliament needs to be particularly careful about any
legislation which affects their ability to do
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000178">It is
said that there are those who resent the role now played by charities
in our society. Some apparently would like to confine them to service
provision, leaving the formation of political policy to politicians.
Whether or not this is the case, it does raise a fundamental question
at the outset. Why has Part 2 suddenly appeared? What is the problem it
is trying to fix? We are told that it stems from a worry that
American-style big-money campaigning such as Citizens United might come
over the Atlantic. If that is so, however, it would be easily caught by
the present regulations. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, in
the 2005 and 2010 general elections only two third parties exceeded the
new lower limit for the election year. In 2005 it was UNISON and the
Conservative Rural Action Group and in 2010 it was UNISON and Vote for
Change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000179">No
problem has been identified and no reason has been given for this
reduction or the rationale for this figure or any other. For the vast
majority of charities and campaigning groups, it is the new threshold
at which they will they have to register which has given rise to the
widest concern. This has reduced from £10,000 to £5,000 a
year in England and from £5,000 to £2,000 a year in
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. As if this was not limiting
enough, the range of activities which will count towards the sum has
been greatly widened. Until now it has only been the cost of election
leaflets and posters. Now, according to the long list in proposed new
Schedule 8A to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act
2000, it will include all advertising and all costs involved in this,
all unsolicited material addressed to electors and all associated
costs, all expenses concerned with market research, canvassing and

costs, rallies and public meetings generally.</hs_para>

seriously inhibited. It is not that they will be spending big sums; on
the whole, they will not. However, from the beginning of an election
year, if the Bill is approved, they will be very frightened of quickly
going over the limit and doing something illegal. Many trustees of
charities feel that it is part of their fiduciary duty—or they
will do—to curtail severely, if not stop altogether, a range of
activities that might be seen to be on the borderline for fear that the

the Minister explain what the problem is that has given rise to this
severe curtailment? It is rather like offering someone a sum of money

halved while at the same time they will have to complete a number of
other tasks in order to earn the money at all. Surely if there were no

is just one other point I would like to make. The noble Lord, Lord

activity promoting or procuring electoral success at any relevant

charities have not in fact been quite so happy about that as he
suggests. There is still genuine uncertainty because this is a
genuinely difficult area. If, for instance, a campaigning group on
climate change looks at the policies of the different parties and
assesses them according to whether it thinks that their policies are
desirable as far as climate change is concerned, does that count as an
activity for promoting or procuring electoral success at any general
election? It seems to me that people of good will could argue that
either way. Therefore, is there not a need for government lawyers,
Charity Commission lawyers and the lawyers of charities to get together

my 18 months on the Electoral Commission, it is a well run
organisation, with a dedicated staff, and I know that the Government
will pay attention to what it is saying during the course of this Bill
and the discussions around it. The Electoral Commission regulates all
elections and referenda held in the UK. That covers the whole business
of monitoring what parties do with funds: how they raise them and how
they spend them within the compass of electoral law. It does not have
anything to do with parliamentary boundaries or local authority
boundaries, which many people think it does. It does not have anything
to do with those issues and I think that it is rather glad about that.
However, the UK is fortunate to have two such organisations as the
Electoral Commission and the group of Boundary Commissions to monitor
and regulate matters in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000202">If one
looks across the Atlantic to where they have no such organisations, one
sees absolute gerrymandering of seats, which produces the sort of
extreme politicians who have led to such difficulties in Washington
over the past few weeks, and the super-PACs, which distort politics in
the USA. It is this final point which is addressed in Part 2 of the
Bill. I agree with the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries,
that the UK is nothing like the United States. Obviously, that is so;
the political climate is wholly different. But the fact is that
spending in elections by third parties, whether they are single-issue
campaigners, trade unions or voluntary organisations, has become an
issue. Therefore, just as political parties are limited in what they
can spend and how they can spend it, so should these other
organisations be. This is the principle behind this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000203">Nevertheless,
as has been said on many occasions in this debate already, there is a
balance to be struck. It is important not to damage civil society or
freedom of speech. In my view, the original Bill cast its net too wide
as regards Part 2. My noble friend Lord Lang of Monkton said it cast
its net too narrowly in relation to Part 1, and the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries, put forward an effective analogy about the
trawler, which was rather interesting. Clearly we are swimming in
rather deep waters here, and the Government are as well. None the less,
the net was cast too wide in relation to Part 2. Sensibly, therefore,
the Government have already recognised this and made some amendments in
the other place. The definition of controlled expenditure, which was a
matter of contention, is now back to what it was in the Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which has worked well in
two general elections, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter,
mentioned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000204">I
remain concerned about Clause 27 and the lowering of the threshold for
registration. This seems unnecessary. The big spenders—the Bill
is about them—already register and are caught by the reduced cap
and the wider scope of what is to be controlled, but why go so far down
the route to seek to register groups that are spending £5,000 in
England and £2,000 in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? You
do not get a lot of campaigning for £2,000 these days. These are
the “little platoons” that Edmund Burke talked so
evocatively about, and they must be treasured. It is in
everybody’s interest that my noble friend the Minister looks at
this again. If the Government went back some way, at 
<?notus-xml column=918?>least, towards the Act of 2000 in this respect, as they have with the
definition, they will attract a great deal more support than they have
at the moment. It would be a wise move. It would not detract from the

Wigley (PC):</Member></B> My Lords, it falls to me to congratulate the
noble Lord, Lord Horam, on an excellent and thoughtful maiden speech.
We were, of course, fellow Members of another place—at least,
intermittently so—between 1974 and 2001, during which period he
had the highly unusual record of serving as both a Labour transport
Minister and a Conservative health Minister. I respected him as someone
who followed his personal convictions and was brave enough to do so
when that meant reconsidering his party affiliation. He brings a
breadth of knowledge with him to the Chamber and has done so today. He
will undoubtedly contribute considerably to our debates in future. If
he were ever again, in the fullness of time, to feel restless, there is
always a warm welcome on the Cross
Benches.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000209" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000209">Turning
to the Bill, I declare an interest as a patron or vice president of a
number of organisations involved in campaigning on disability issues,
including Mencap Cymru and Autism Cymru, details of which are in the
register of members’ interests. I have grave misgivings about
several facets of the proposed legislation, which seems to be a jumbled
assortment of half-cocked ideas being rushed through Parliament without
adequate consultation with those bodies which will be affected by it,
particularly in the voluntary sector. It also seems to have a
party-political agenda in the way that it aims to impose rules on trade
unions in a manner which is perhaps geared to creating some
mischief.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000210">I
first focus my remarks on the lobbying aspect of the Bill. Let me make
two things clear. First, lobbying undertaken in an open, transparent
and responsible manner is an essential ingredient of the democratic
process. Secondly, it can be of great assistance to those in Parliament
who have to address issues about which they may not have detailed
personal knowledge or experience. Any restrictions placed on the
ability of 
<?notus-xml column=919?>those affected by government decisions to present their case to
decision-makers in the most effective manner is, I believe, an
infringement of liberties. In the same way as those wishing to access
justice through the courts need the help of professional lawyers, so
those wanting to convey to Parliament and the Executive their opinions
about proposed government action may need the help of professional
consultants who know, from experience, the best way to get a message
across to those in
power.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000211">I was a
Back-Bencher for 27 years, and I know how valuable it was for me to
have information presented coherently and concisely from both sides of
an argument. It helped me to make an informed judgment on those many
matters about which, inevitably, I did not have detailed personal
knowledge. For example, when I was serving on a Standing Committee
scrutinising European Commission proposals which impacted on economic,
environmental and social dimensions in these islands, I could not have
done my work without the help of such a consultancy, about whose
assistance I obviously had to make a declaration, but which would not
be permissible under today’s rules. Without that help, I could
not have continued as a member of that committee, as the volume of
paperwork that had to be scrutinised each week was enormous. I
benefited from its research support, but I always made my own
judgments, sometimes contrary to its perspective.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102266000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000212">MPs are generalists. If
they have specialist knowledge, it will be in only a small area of the
wide range of policy on which they have to express an opinion.
Responsible lobbying is an essential ingredient to make the legislative
system work. However, it has to be responsible, and while the majority
of lobbying consultancies no doubt undertake their work in a scrupulous
manner, there is clearly scope for abuse. That is why we need a
legislative framework within which they can operate, a framework which
is open and fair to those wishing to influence decisions, one which
applies to all lobbying organisations, one which is fair to the
Executive and legislators who have to take decisions, fair to
those who work in the lobbying industry and fair also to the general
public including those interests which may not command the resources to
access professional lobbying, but whose viewpoint may be equally valid.
It is against the background of those considerations that I shall
approach the details of the Bill at a later stage. However, I make it
absolutely clear that I support a rigorous, transparent
system of registration, provided that it is equitable and
comprehensive. I believe that this is in the interests of lobbyists
themselves as well as of the democratic process.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102266000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000213">At this point I want to
flag up two or three matters which cause me concern. First, there is a
differential in this Bill with regard to the constraints placed upon
Ministers and Permanent Secretaries on the one hand, and on MPs on the
other. What is the position of a Minister who is approached in the
context of his or her responsibility as a constituency MP? Again, do
these constraints apply equally to Ministers and senior civil servants
in the devolved Administrations? I support the point that the Bill
should be wider in its application with regard to civil servants and,
most certainly, policy advisors—the infamous spads.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=920?><hs_para UID="13102266000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000214">Secondly, my main
misgiving relates to the way in which voluntary organisations may seek
to influence decisions so as to safeguard those on behalf of whom they
campaign. To my mind it is unacceptable to regard these bodies as
acting in a party-political manner and to constrain their freedom when
they put forward a strong opinion on a matter which is in the political
limelight, particularly at election time when policies are rightly
under scrutiny. The testimony which many of us have received from the
Royal College of Nursing is a case in point. I served for three years
on its parliamentary panel, which was scrupulously balanced: two
Conservatives, two Labour, one Liberal Democrat and one “odds
and sods”, which included me. The RCN had a strong opinion, on
behalf of its members, on government policy which impacted on the
delivery of healthcare and associated services. It is not affiliated to
the TUC, nor does it take any part in party-political arguments from a
political viewpoint. It says in a briefing document which I imagine has
been provided to most of us in this
Chamber:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13102266000276" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000276">“We
are deeply concerned by the provisions in Part 2 of the Bill, which
will restrict the activities of organisations that seek to legitimately
comment on and influence public policy in the run-up to a general
election … As currently drafted, the provisions in the Bill may
prevent us from raising important issues on behalf of our members if we
reach the spending limit during the regulated period … The
legislation would significantly restrict on the freedom of speech of
organisations that have an essential and a legitimate role to play in a
free
democracy”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13102266000265" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000265">Those

Bill is incredibly complex and unclear. It may be difficult for
charities and other voluntary groups to understand if any of their

campaigning activity”.</hs_quotefo>

omission in the Bill. I see nothing here that will prevent political
parties rewarding generous supporters with honours or even—it is
alleged—appointment to this Chamber. When the two parties in
government bring forward legislation to hamper voluntary organisations
in the manner I have described, I believe it is quite cynical that
there should be no tightening on those abuses within the political
system. Parties plead that they cannot otherwise raise money to fight
election campaigns, but there is a simple answer to that, which is to
restrict the amount parties can spend on general campaigning in the
same way as there are tight restrictions on spending on constituency
levels, but that is not adequately covered in legislation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102266000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000217">Some would even
advocate state funding of political parties as the answer to their
cash-flow problems. To my mind, that would be an absolute outrage. At a
time when vital services to vulnerable people are being cut because of
the financial squeeze, it would be quite wrong to divert
taxpayers’ money to prop up parties who cannot generate enough
enthusiasm among their own supporters to fund their campaigns. Equally,
there is a valid case to be argued that we must avoid having
individuals and organisations buying influence from hard-up parties by
contributing huge sums towards 
<?notus-xml column=921?>their campaigning costs. That is the balance that has to be struck and
to which we shall undoubtedly return at later stages.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102266000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000218">There are also
questions relating to the way that this legislation impacts on the
political process in the devolved legislatures of Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland and the degree to which there has been political
consensus with political parties and campaigning organisations in those
territories in regard to the Bill. Is it the Government's intention to
invite the National Assembly for Wales to introduce its own legislation
in this field and, if so, will the Government ensure that the National
Assembly benefits from a transfer of powers order to give it the
necessary legislative power to deal with those matters? I hope that
this House will improve the Bill significantly during its
passage and that the Government will listen, particularly with
regard to Part
2.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_22_PT_1/A16279C10E09025944F440B7280866812ABBCCF4" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 October 2013">Tuesday,

Lord Wigley, in welcoming the noble Lord, Lord Horam, and
congratulating him on his maiden speech. I rise to report briefly on
the scrutiny of the Bill undertaken by your Lordships’ Select
Committee on the Constitution, which I have the privilege of chairing.
The House has already heard some powerful points from one member of the
committee, the noble Lord, Lord Lang of Monkton, and a further speech
will be made by the noble<I> </I>Lord, Lord Hart of Chilton. I hope
that between us we will cover the major points that the committee has

Bill last Friday, 18 October, having discussed it at our meeting on 16
October. Somewhat unusually, we decided to publish our report rapidly
and before Second Reading, rather than wait as we sometimes do to

felt that in this case the House should be made aware immediately of
our significant concerns about the content and overall handling of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000221" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000221">The
Constitution Committee accepts the view, widely promoted this
afternoon, that there is general cross-party support for achieving
greater transparency—a greater showing of the light, as it has

both Houses.</hs_para>

are unsure that the Bill will achieve proper improvement in the
immediate concerns of the general policy. We have specific doubts both
about the clarity of the Bill’s provisions and about the
potential effects of aspects of the Bill. Some of these might have been
addressed if, as has been repeatedly said this afternoon, the Bill had
not been introduced in what we describe in the report as “undue
haste”. That obviously led to difficulties of scrutiny, with no
pre-legislative scrutiny and an inadequate concern for time in
the other
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000223">As your

improve the quality of legislation. Perhaps I might take two minutes to

of the problem with the current Bill that the Constitution Committee is
most concerned about. A Bill that directly affects the
electorate’s ability to engage with the Government and to take
part in political campaigning must challenge the fundamental common-law
right to freedom of political expression. There could not be a clearer
constitutional principle and, as the committee report states, given
these factors it is essential that the process accords with the highest
standards. However, the committee concludes that, given the lack of
external consultation, the absence of a White Paper or a draft Bill and
the hasty proceedings in another place, the handling of the Bill to
date is a matter of significant
concern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000225">To
move to our scrutiny of the policy substance of the Bill, in Part 1 we
share the generally expressed concern about the narrow scope of
provisions on the work of lobbyists. Again, I quote from our report,
which in turn mentions the report by our fellow committee in the other
place:</hs_para>
<hs_quote UID="13102266000277" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000277">“The

with many speakers this afternoon, though, it is of course Part 2 that
has most concerned the committee as far as the policy is concerned. I
remind your Lordships that the proposed amendments to the Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act that tighten and extend various
controls, including financial controls, are in Part 2. We have heard a
series of vivid examples and explanations from various speakers today
about the impact of these controls and extended financial regulations
on the charity sector and on the voluntary sector in general. The
potential limits on their campaigning activities have been described as
“chilling” and as a chilling threat to their
constitutional rights. Your Lordships’ Constitution Committee
notes that the House must ensure that the Bill gives absolute and
appropriate justification for interfering with that right. In the
committee’s view, the Government had yet to offer such a
convincing justification for extending the control on third parties and
I suggest to the Minister—although obviously this is a personal
view, as the committee has not met to consider today’s
speeches—that that justification still has yet to be
heard.</hs_para>

conclude that your Lordships will wish to consider whether extended
control is really necessary, given the particularly serious
implications for a basic constitutional right. This is the question of
achieving the balance that several noble Lords have referred to today.
In consideration of the Bill, as the House has heard, the House has the
advantage of several relevant parliamentary reports, including the very
trenchant findings of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee
in the Commons, the report of the Joint Human Rights Committee, which
my noble friend Lady Kennedy of The Shaws has referred to, and that of
the Commons Committee on Standards. All these reports share a similar
disquiet about the way in which the Bill has been handled and serious
concerns about its content. I hope that the combined authority of those
committee reports, together with your Lordships’ own
Constitution Committee report, will give the Government pause and
encourage Ministers to listen very carefully to the debates in this
House.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_22_PT_1/D598442EF5B03E41E79F8F9518D7AED6C490E7FA" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 October 2013">Tuesday,

comments will be directed mainly at Part 2. This Bill has been driven
by two engines, self-absorption and self-regard—self-absorption

it assumes that government and party politicians are more important

is a huge difference in kind between lobbying carried out on behalf of

demonstrators and the like together represents one of the significant
voices by which the public are heard. To curtail these activities, as
many campaigning groups fear will happen, will curtail the
people’s voice, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of

the big difference between parties and their associated organisations

However, I have a pretty good idea why the honour was conferred on me.
It was because I was a campaigner and lobbyist—rather a

me take noble Lords back to the mid-1980s. The word
“carer” was unknown; it was frequently misspelt as
“career”. Nothing of what we now take for granted about
the issue was known. We had no numbers. Estimates were not believed. We
had no idea about the range of activities that carers undertake, or the
distress that caring can cause. There were few organisations that dealt
with caring, no helplines and no legislation. No attention was paid to
carers at all. It is hard to 
<?notus-xml column=926?>believe now, when the word “carer” is added to practically
every document coming out of every government department—and
sometimes, I think, every sentence of every document coming out of
every government department. Think of the Care Bill and the focus on
carers’ rights. Think of what we now know about carers for o1der
people, young carers, parent carers, carers in the benefits system,
carers in employment and so on. It is hard to imagine what it was like
20 or 30 years
ago.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000247" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000247">All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:28:11"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:28:28"></hs_TimeCode>
that we have achieved for carers has been achieved by lobbying and
campaigning by a registered charity, or by several charities working
together. No Minister or department suddenly woke up and said,
“Oh, sorry. This is a group of people whom we have been ignoring
for years. We had better do something about it”. Of course they
did not. They took notice because we drew attention relentlessly to
what the situation was by focused campaigns, getting the media on side
and getting carers to be willing to speak out rather than being a
silent and hidden army. Figures on how many carers there are and how
much money their contribution is worth did not come out of the blue. In
fact, I remember successive Secretaries of State denying that the
numbers of carers that I was suggesting even existed. We got the
numbers because we ran a concerted campaign to have a question about
carers included in the census, and then we used the figures,
which surprised everybody—6 million, since you ask—at
every
opportunity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102266000248" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0001.htm#13102266000248">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:29:18"></hs_TimeCode>
campaigns for policy change were never more concerted and active than
during election periods. I first attended party conferences in the late
1980s—all the party conferences, of course—and at the
1992, 1997, 2001 and all elections since, a carers manifesto has been
produced and all political parties have been lobbied to make
concessions for carers. A very important aspect of this work was the
alliance that was formed to give the lobby the strongest possible
voice. Originally, more than 20 carer, disability, older people and
patient organisations came together to produce a manifesto. This made
the call and the demands of the manifesto so much more powerful. Many
of us have recently been in contact with the Care and Support Alliance,
which played such an important role in both last year’s Health
and Social Care Bill and the Care Bill currently being considered by
this House. If each of those many organisations had had its costs
counted, including its overall admin costs, I doubt whether they would
have come together in such an effective way. Indeed, I am sure that
they would not. The effectiveness of such coalitions has already been
mentioned by several noble

would have been the situation of carers if all these campaigns had not
taken place? Eventually, what was a private trouble might have become a
public policy issue—the one that we know so well
today—but not as quickly or effectively, I would contend. Three
Private Members’ Bills, a national carers strategy, the
Standing Commission on Carers, and the Law Commission report that led
to the Care Bill all came about as a direct result of regular lobbying
and campaigning, much of it focused in election periods. I might add
that the tradition in the United Kingdom of campaigning charities
effectively lobbying for changes 
<?notus-xml column=927?>in policy is the envy of the world—and I do
not exaggerate that, as I know it from my contact with emerging carers
movements in many other countries throughout the

that frightens the Government and makes them put in place this
sledgehammer of a Bill to crack what is, at worst, a very small
political nut as regards charities. The Bill surrounds charities with
an unwarranted amount of bureaucracy, as noble Lords have pointed out,

issues such as poverty, and publishing the results? How are
partnerships and alliances to be defined, and their expenditure costed,
without huge administrative burdens on already cash-strapped

opinion that says that the Bill will restrict organisations’
ability to engage in campaigns or policy debates and will insulate the

Bill is the product of the “something must be done”
response to a particular problem. There is a problem, not least in
terms of public perception of illicit or unethical lobbying of
policy-makers, but that problem requires a considered response, one
that both addresses the problem and is seen to do so. This Bill, as I
shall argue, fails on both grounds. My principal point here, following
other noble Lords, is that the measure has been rushed. I share the
concerns expressed by the Constitution Committee of your
Lordships’ House in its report on the Bill. As it
noted, the Government had announced that there would be a White Paper
and a draft Bill. There has been neither. As has been said, this places
a particular responsibility on your Lordships’ House in
scrutinising the
measure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000003">In
terms of construction, this is a Christmas tree Bill. The previous
Labour Government brought in Bills that were essentially two Bills in
one and sometimes three Bills in one. This Government have continued
the practice. The title of the Bill is something of a giveaway. The
relationship between the three parts is tenuous, to say the least. This
practice places particular strains on the other place in terms of
detailed examination in Committee. This House can adapt its examination
to the discrete parts of the Bill somewhat more effectively, but it is
none the less a practice to be
deprecated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000004">I
turn to the substance of the Bill. Like my noble friend Lord Lang, I
shall focus on Part 1. Much that I say will reinforce the points that
he made. As the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, said, there is general
acceptance that there should be more transparency in lobbying. This
Bill, though, is too narrowly drawn to correct the mischief that has
motivated its introduction. The Bill is concerned to identify those who
engage in lobbying on a commercial basis, and do so as free-standing
entities. I am not sure what that adds to our knowledge. The more one
reads the exclusions in the Bill, the more one recognises the
limitations of the exercise. It excludes small-scale commercial
lobbyists, those for whom lobbying is not the principal purpose of
their business and in-house lobbyists. Some companies have sizable
lobbying teams. One suspects that their activities may at times be as
much a concern to the public as are the activities of dedicated
lobbying firms. Will the Minister tell us why the Government
differentiate between lobbying of Ministers on, say, the duty
on cigarettes by in-house lobbyists of tobacco companies and lobbying
by commercial lobbyists bought in by tobacco companies for the purpose
of lobbying Ministers? From the perspective of the exercise of
lobbying, and how it is perceived by the public, what is the salient
distinction?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000005">That
brings me to another crucial limitation of the Bill. The focus is one
of status and, as I have explained, a rather narrow one. It is not
directed at the actual activity, other than indirectly. It seeks to
influence behaviour through making public who engages in 
<?notus-xml column=929?>commercial lobbying. There is no statutory code of conduct and no
stipulation of principles that should govern the behaviour. In so far
as the Bill influences behaviour, it may be to encourage lobbyists to
avoid making representations in a way that brings them within the scope
of the Bill but, as most are not presently caught within the ambit of
the Bill, it will not make that much difference anyway. All that the
Bill does is to introduce a new layer of regulation for no obvious
public benefit. It tells us, at some cost, what is largely already
known.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000006">The
Bill, in short, is fundamentally flawed. The point has been well made
in the other place by Members on both sides that it is based on a lack
of understanding of how lobbying actually works. It was expressed
especially well by a former student of mine, Tracey Crouch, who spent
several years as a lobbyist. As she pointed out, the lobbying industry
today provides a very different service and is a very different
industry from what it was 10 or 15 years ago. Consultant lobbyists are
more likely to advise clients on how to undertake lobbying of
government rather than undertake it themselves, and if they do
undertake it, they are not likely to be lobbying Permanent Secretaries.
The Government appear not to understand the industry as it now is, most
of which will not be caught by the provisions of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000007">The Bill
is neither one thing nor the other. Either it should go the whole way
and introduce a comprehensive register of lobbyists or it should be
abandoned and the Government should instead address the problem from a
very different, and I believe more effective, perspective. The case for
a comprehensive register has been made by others. I am not persuaded of
the need for a register, comprehensive or otherwise; it may prove
counterproductive with lobbyists using registration as a seal of
approval. More importantly, I do not believe that it would assuage
public concerns about the lobbying of
government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000008">The
other approach, which I commend to the House, is to shift the
emphasis entirely and build on existing practice. In opening the
debate, my noble friend Lord Younger made the point that there is now
more transparency about policy-making meetings, with a
quarterly publication on those meetings. My noble friend Lord Lang also
referred to that. Why not build on that? When Select Committees
produce reports, they publish the names of those who have given
evidence, that is, who made representations to them. It is normal
practice to publish the material submitted to them. Why not require
Ministers, when making policy announcements or publishing Bills or
draft Bills, to list the names of all those who have made
representations to the department on the issue? Listing all those who
have lobbied on the subject would be transparent and comprehensive. It
would not matter whether it was an in-house lobbyist, a paid or unpaid
lobbyist, or simply individuals writing in. It avoids the need to
define lobbying, and we would know who had made
representations.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102274000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000009">There may be a case,
building on existing practice, for publishing the notes of meetings and
written representations, similar to the evidence volumes published by
Select Committees. If this was routine practice, 
<?notus-xml column=930?>drawing material together on a particular measure, it
would properly address the problem. There may also
be a case for extending it to non-decision-making: that is,
when a Minister decides not to pursue a particular policy under
consideration. I appreciate that there may be, indeed no doubt are,
flaws in this alternative proposal, but I have yet to find any that
render it a less desirable approach than that embodied in the Bill.
Perhaps the Minister can explain why my proposal is not to be preferred

Hart of Chilton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, there will be
many echoes and repetitions this afternoon and evening, and I make no
excuse for joining in because the issues are so important. As has been
mentioned, I am a member of your Lordships’ Select Committee on
the Constitution, whose report was published last Friday. On the same
day, the Joint Committee on Human Rights published its report and prior
to that on 5 September the House of Commons Political and
Constitutional Reform Committee published its report. All are
cross-party committees and all are agreed on their conclusions and
recommendations. All are highly critical of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000011">Three
common issues emerge. First, once again, the Government have introduced
a Bill without adequate consultation and scrutiny, not least without
pre-legislative scrutiny. As my noble friend Lady Jay of Paddington
pointed out, the Constitution Committee has repeatedly stressed the
importance of proper scrutiny and consultation. That is important for
the reputation of Parliament and the quality of legislation itself. Any
failure to do so undermines public confidence, particularly in the case
of Bills of constitutional importance. This is such a Bill because it
directly affects the ability of people and organisations who wish to
engage with the Government and participate in political and electoral
campaigning to do so. Freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are
rights which lie at the very heart of our constitution. Any threat to
these would not only infringe Articles 10 and 11 of the European
Convention on Human Rights but be contrary to fundamental common law.
Some say that this Bill does just that, and I have seen a leading
counsel’s opinion which states that there are grounds for a
legal challenge on grounds of
incompatibility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000012">A
second but connected theme emerging from the reports is that throughout
the Bill there are problems of definition, both individually and
collectively, which have caused great uncertainty and could lead to
unforetold consequences. For example, broadening the scope of
controlled expenditure and at the same time lowering its cap, the
definition of consultant lobbying and the scope of the Bill have all
raised fears and concerns which the lack of proper scrutiny and the
speed with which this legislation is being catapulted forward have made
worse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000013">A third
theme, which has already been mentioned, is whether, in the absence of
a clear rationale, Part 2 is necessary at all, and that what is being
proposed is quite disproportionate. The Joint Committee on Human 
<?notus-xml column=931?>Rights states at paragraph 60 of its report, to
which the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, drew
attention:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13102274000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000060">“We
are concerned that the lack of understanding and clarity about the
practical effects of the Bill has led to widespread concern that third
parties may be dissuaded from participating in campaigns with a
potential ‘chilling effect’ on free speech and freedom of
association of third party
campaigners”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13102274000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000058">Judging
by the letters and e-mails that I have received, I believe that it is
quite right. For example, legal aid, access to justice, human rights
and examples of unjust law are all likely to be election issues. Under
current definitions, a third-party campaigner on any of these issues is
exposed to the risk that his or her campaigning activities could be
regarded as intended to promote or procure electoral success for a
party or candidate even though it is accepted that he or she had no
such subjective intention to do so or that he or she did not name any
party or candidate or that he or she was engaging in the campaign for
its own sake. Such a result cannot be intended, but that is an example
of the uncertainty which has been
caused.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13102274000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000014">The

to my personal view, I regret to say that I believe this Bill, and the
way it has been processed, is a rather shoddy piece of work which has
caused in its slipstream much concern and uncertainty. The noble Lord,
Lord Tyler, seems to think that it is a giant torch shining light on
dark cupboards. To me it brings dark clouds and obscurity. I believe
that it requires far more scrutiny than the speed of its planned
parliamentary timetable will permit. Accordingly, I agree with the
Joint Committee when it suggests that the Bill should be paused and
submitted for more extensive scrutiny and greater consultation.
Alternatively, of course, Part 2 could be dropped altogether. There is
a need for a Bill, but this is not
it.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13102274000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000069">5.49

Aberdare (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I will try to outline my thoughts
on the Bill without going into too much detail since most of the points
I wish to make have been made already and may well be made again. I
will address Parts 1 and 2. I have no problem with the principles of
the Bill. I believe that a register of lobbyists is important to ensure
the openness and transparency of lobbying activity, and I also support
the aim of Part 2 to take the big money out of politics, as we have
heard it described. However, I have two broad concerns about the Bill
as drafted. Does it risk going too far and actually taking the politics
out of politics and will it achieve its laudable aims in a workable,
effective and not too burdensome
manner?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000017">On
Part 1, I start from the principle that lobbying is a vital part of our
democratic system. I worked in IBM’s government relations
departments in both the UK and the USA and was then a partner in a
public affairs consultancy, so at times I engaged in lobbying myself.
However, I, and perhaps other noble Lords, might not be able to
contribute to debate on this Bill in an informed way if it were
not for the lobbying 
<?notus-xml column=932?>efforts of numerous organisations interested in or concerned by it. It
is important that lobbying should be open, transparent and above board.
The system to achieve that should be clear, fair, workable, reasonably
straightforward and comprehensive, so I have considerable questions
about how the proposed register is to be set up.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102274000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000018">First, why are only
consultant lobbyists covered? What about in-house lobbyists, other
corporate advisers such as management consultants, law firms and
accountants, trade associations and other such representative bodies?
Consultant lobbyists represent a very small proportion of total
lobbying, perhaps not much more than 10%. In my experience they
generally accompany their clients in lobbying situations, if they take
part in them at all, and it is the client who has the most direct
interaction with the person being lobbied. It is hard to see how the
omission of the bulk of lobbyists and their activities from the
register will achieve the aims of increasing transparency and public
confidence.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102274000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000019">Secondly, why does the
Bill extend only to lobbying of Ministers and Permanent Secretaries? A
huge amount of lobbying takes place at lower levels,
including with special advisers, for example, both before and
after any direct contacts with Ministers or Permanent Secretaries.
Moreover, as we have heard, Ministers and Permanent Secretaries are
already supposed to publish details of their meetings with external
organisations. If the public need to know who those organisations
represent, why could this information not just be added to those
reports? After all, if Ministers or Permanent Secretaries do not know
who the lobbyists they meet are representing, the lobbying effort seems
unlikely to be effective. In this context, I was quite attracted by the
proposal from the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, about turning the
whole thing around and looking at it from the point of view of the
people being
lobbied.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000020">Although
I welcome the evident desire of the Government to adopt a minimalist
approach, I wonder if there is not a danger of ending up—and
here I echo what the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, said about Part
2—with an overlarge sledgehammer to crack a small, though
admittedly irritating, nut. If we are to have a register and a
registrar should they not be a little more comprehensive in their
coverage without, of course, imposing undue burdens on lobbyists or
their employers? Perhaps something can be learnt from existing systems
elsewhere. For example, I have heard the European Union system
described, with some approval, as a “coerced voluntary
register”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000021">Finally,
should there not be some encouragement for lobbyists to sign up,
preferably on a voluntary basis, to codes of conduct such as that of
the Association of Professional Political Consultants, which has been
in existence for some 20 years? Could the system not make some sort of
allowance for lobbyists who show that they adhere to a recognised code
of conduct, as was suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler?</hs_para>

similar situation with Part 2. The aim may be worthy, but its
implementation falls far short of being as clear, workable and
proportionate as it should be. I have been very struck by the number of

<?notus-xml column=933?>significant and reputable representative organisations expressing
concern about this part of the Bill. To pick just a few, there
are: the NCVO, with some 10,000 members; its Welsh
equivalent, the WCVA, with more than 3,000 members; Bond, which
represents 400 international development bodies; 13 faith groups; and
the Commission on Civil Society and Democratic Engagement, chaired by
the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, which was formed by
some 50 very diverse third-sector organisations specifically
in response to concerns about this Bill. Numerous bodies have added
their voices to these concerns such as the CBI, Citizens Advice, the
Countryside Alliance, the National Trust, the National Federation of
Women’s Institutes and the Royal British Legion, to mention just
a few. No doubt briefings are still coming in from further
organisations as we speak. Then there is the Political and
Constitutional Reform Committee in another place, the Joint Committee
on Human Rights, your Lordships’ own Constitution Committee and
even the Electoral Commission itself. Such a breadth of concern, with
little or no countervailing opinion, should surely raise serious pause
for
thought.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000023">The
definition of “controlled expenditure”, even after the
amendments made in another place to bring it more in line with the
previously existing situation, remains complicated and unclear. One
thing that is clear is that Clause 26, combined with Schedule 3,
considerably extends the range of expenses covered, for example to
include staff costs, if not even volunteer time, although I was
reassured by what the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, said on
that matter. While the scope of controlled expenditure is widened, the
thresholds for registration to be necessary are significantly lowered
in the Bill, by half in England, and more than half in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland. The limits on the maximum amounts that can be
spent are also reduced, again by more than half. I have seen no
rationale or justification for these reductions. Several organisations
have said that the previous regime under PPERA was tolerable only
because the thresholds and spending limits were sufficiently high not
to affect the great majority of
campaigns.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000024">The
reduced thresholds and limits are likely to bear down particularly hard
on third-party organisations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
For example, no allowance is made for the fact that in Wales much of
the material now classified as election material has to be produced in
two languages, with significant extra costs. Nearly all organisations
commenting on the Bill, including the Electoral Commission, believe
that the Government’s estimates of the number of bodies likely
to be affected are unrealistically
low.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000025">The rules
on coalition campaigns, where each member of a coalition has to include
the full amount of coalition expenditure as part of its own
controllable expenses, seem likely to have a strongly discouraging
effect on campaigns of this nature, although in most other respects
they seem positively desirable, as well as effective. Given that
charities are already regulated by the Charity Commission under charity
law, which prohibits them campaigning on party-political issues, I can
understand why the question of whether they should not be specifically
excluded from coverage under this new system has been raised.</hs_para>

questions of why the Bill was not subject to greater pre-legislative
scrutiny and consultation, as it surely should have been—and
indeed should still be—or why there is such an unseemly rush to
get Part 2 in place before the next general election, so
that all the third-party organisations newly brought within its scope

deregulation and the big society. Even worse than that, it could risk
causing significant collateral damage to the workings of our civil
society as a whole. I hope the Bill will emerge from your

realise, of course—and I am not trying to win friends and

not yet been given a list of issues from the previous general election,
where there was concern regarding civil society, to justify this
draconian measure. In fact, 33 non-campaign groups registered at the
previous election. In total, they spent £3 million in the year
before the election. The three main political parties spent £31
million in that year. Where is the problem? I repeat: £3 million
was spent in the year before by those non-campaigning groups that
registered. Indeed, the only issue that caused me concern at the
previous general election was when I obtained a copy of the
Conservative manifesto and saw on page 14 a full-page portrait of a

Hardie (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I refer to my entry in the
register of interests as president of Capability Scotland. I will not
repeat the concerns about the effect of the Bill upon the voluntary
sector, which were so ably expressed by my noble friend Lord
Ramsbotham, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Derby, the noble
and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, and other noble
Lords. I agree with those concerns.</hs_para>

behind the provisions in Part 1 about the transparency required from
lobbyists, but I fear that they do not go far enough to restore public
confidence in our political system. Like many noble Lords, I consider
that the provisions confine themselves to the registration of
consultant lobbyists and their dealings with Ministers and civil
servants at the highest level, and they fail to address in-house
lobbyists. Are the public not also entitled to know of these possible
influences in the formulation of policy? The duty on Ministers to
disclose, on a regular basis, meetings that they have with individuals
and the subjects discussed is no answer to that omission. Should that
disclosure not be contained within a central database of all activity
and be available to the public for inspection? In that regard, I agree
with the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. However, what sanctions exist for the
failure of Ministers and civil servants to comply with such
obligations?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000049">The
provisions are also inadequate in another respect. The obligation of
disclosure is confined to lobbying of Ministers and Permanent
Secretaries, Second Permanent Secretaries or persons serving in the
offices listed in Part 3 of Schedule 1. As has been observed by other
noble Lords, the reality is that lobbyists will also have dealings with
civil servants of a lower grade as well as political advisers to
Ministers. Can the Minister tell the House why the need for
transparency has not been extended to people in those
positions?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000050">I

place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000051">Part 2
includes various provisions restricting the involvement of third
parties in elections by altering the definition of controlled
expenditure and by reducing 
<?notus-xml column=938?>the level of such expenditure contained within the
Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. I accept that,
where non-party campaigning takes place on a scale that could have a
significant effect upon elections, it is important that it is
transparent and controlled. However, we must guard against imposing
arbitrary limits that will have the unintended consequence of
discouraging electors from engaging in the democratic process. Any
controls on third parties must be reasonable and a proportionate
interference with the right to freedom of political expression. The
Bill expands the definition of controlled expenditure in the manner
already mentioned by noble Lords and I will not repeat that. At the
same time, it reduces the limit of controlled expenditure from
£10,000 in England, or £5,000 in each of Northern
Ireland, Scotland and Wales, to £5,000 and £2,000
respectively, at which point registration is mandatory, with all the
regulatory and administrative burdens that that entails, not to mention
the risk of criminal sanctions.</hs_para>

congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Horam, on his maiden speech. I share
his concern about these reduced financial limits. Will the Minister
tell the House the evidential basis for reducing the limits set in
2000, given that it is now proposed that the scope of the activities to
be controlled is extended? I agree with the noble and right reverend
Lord, Lord Harries, that the passage of time and the expanded
definition of controlled activities suggest that an increase in the
limits would be more appropriate.</hs_para>

about the substantial reduction in the national limits of controlled
expenditure. Since 2000 those have been £793,500 for England,
£108,000 for Scotland, £60,000 for Wales and
£27,000 for Northern Ireland. Clause 26(2) reduces those to
£319,800, £35,400, £24,000 and £10,800
respectively. Has any assessment been undertaken on whether the revised
figures would permit a reasonable opportunity to non-recognised third
parties to campaign on issues that they consider to be of national
importance? I question whether those limits would permit a national
rally, for instance, if groups wish to campaign against government
action, such as occurred in relation to the Iraq war or might occur in
relation to climate change or other environmental issues.</hs_para>

give us reassurance on that and emphasised that expenditure would not
be controlled expenditure unless it could reasonably be regarded as
promoting or procuring electoral success for one or more parties. The
Minister is correct, of course—that is what Clause 26
says—but what is the practical implication of that? Let us
suppose that a local action group has formed to oppose the closure of a
local hospital in the constituency or to support or oppose HS2 or
fracking. Expenditure on relevant activities, such as advocating the
views of the group, would be controlled expenditure if those views were
opposed by one candidate but supported by another. Is that
consequence not an unacceptable interference in the democratic process
which is disproportionate and which crosses the line of legitimate
control?</hs_para>

difficulty with this part. There are inconsistencies in the statutory
regime that risk confusing third-party campaigners. I refer to
Scotland, where the proposed limit of £35,400 includes
expenditure 
<?notus-xml column=939?>during the year before the general election. In
contrast, the spending limit for a Scottish parliamentary election,
which has been fixed by this Parliament, is £75,800 for similar
activities, but the relevant period is four months. The current
proposal in the Bill before the Scottish Parliament for the referendum
in Scotland is that there will be a spending limit of £150,000
for similar activities during the four-month period before the
referendum. Such variations will confuse third parties in that
jurisdiction who wish to engage in these campaigns. Will the Minister
tell the House how he can justify the inconsistencies that exist in
affording the electorate the opportunity of expressing their
views?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000056">Finally,
the changes to the scope and financial limits of controlled expenditure
will have an effect upon the enforcement regime operated by the
Electoral Commission. Will the Minister confirm that the Government
expect the commission’s regulatory regime to continue to focus
primarily upon retrospective action and that its use of stop notices
will be confined to cases where there is a significant risk of
seriously damaging public confidence in the statutory controls? What
assessment has been made of the likely increase in actions of judicial
review against the commission as a result of the Bill? Will the
Minister also advise the House whether additional resources are to be
provided to the commission to enable it to meet its
obligations?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102274000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102274000057">Like

Donaghy (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I have three reasons for wishing
to speak in this debate. First, I am a former member and acting chair
of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. The noble Viscount, Lord
Younger of Leckie, and the noble Lord, Lord Lang of Monkton, referred
to the work of that committee, which spent considerable amounts of time
looking at the well-being issue. There is no doubt of the importance of
that area. I remember chairing a meeting in which a number of
professional associations connected with lobbying were proposing a
voluntary code of conduct. The real problem is to identify what
constitutes lobbying or a lobbying group. During the meeting it became
clear that those who abused the process would never volunteer to sign
up. We were talking to the good guys. I do not underestimate the
problems that the Government have in establishing clear criteria and an
effective registration system: it is not easy. However, this Bill will
not stop the big players or catch the bad players. It needs a major
rewrite and a cross-party approach.</hs_para>

speaking is as a former chair of ACAS. The certification office, which
is referred to in Part 3 and has not had very much attention up to now,
was part of the ACAS family. I know the excellent work that it does and
I regretted that it was listed in the bonfire of the quangos. Was that
only one or was it two years ago? I fully accept that it was a merger
of two tiny organisations with the loss of one photocopier and that it
was done for PR reasons so that the Government could claim that they
were cutting red tape. The certification officer was and is required to

<?notus-xml column=940?>submit an annual report to the chair of ACAS and to
the Secretary of State at BIS. Just as I received them when I was
chair, the new chair of ACAS will similarly receive those reports. I
wish Sir Brendan Barber a very successful tenure as the new chair of
ACAS<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:20:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

claimed to scale down the certification office, the Government are now
going to increase its role substantially. I understand that Ministers

the increase in administration.
Whatever<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:21:04"></hs_TimeCode> the
Government decide to require of the certification office, I am
confident that they will deal with it in their usual competent way.
However, I have to ask for an assurance from the Minister on a number
of points. Nothing in the Bill will give the certification officer
extra powers to stop industrial action or to issue injunctions. I am
assuming that this will continue to be dealt with by the courts and is
not an extra role for the certification office. I want a categorical
assurance that trade union members in sensitive occupations such as
prison officers will not be at risk of their home addresses being
exposed, particularly those prison officers who work in Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:21:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102277000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102277000004">I
also want an assurance that it is not the Government’s intention
to politicise the post of certification officer. It enjoys a good deal
of trust and confidence, which, once lost, would be difficult to
regain. I remind the House that the certification office registers
employers associations as well. It does not have a political fund, just
like the majority of trade unions do not have a political fund.
Political funds are clearly the focus of this Government’s
attention. For example, if you are an employer in the nuclear power
industry and you succeed in having a full-time secondment to BIS, as
has happened and probably will continue to happen, who needs a
political fund? In fact, who needs to lobby at

It was only when NALGO was prevented by the courts from campaigning for
public services that we decided we should have a political fund. The
vote in favour was overwhelming. The general political fund, as it was
called, gave money to various causes and political parties and
groupings, and continues to do so. It produces an annual report which

when the merger between NALGO, NUPE and COHSE took place did we have to

neither. There were four choices. If noble Lords will excuse the pun, I
am labouring this point because every union has a varied history and

employer, the proposed legislation could see a situation where the
employer provides a list and then complains to the certification
officer about its accuracy. Part 3 is an unnecessary and irritating
diversion from the real issue of lobbying, which is where the power
really lies and who abuses that

this Bill, even from one row back, and to have had the opportunity of
hearing  
<?notus-xml column=942?>the excellent maiden speech from my noble friend Lord Horam. As has been
said, the experience he brings from the other House will be

the Minister said when he introduced the Bill, it has been a
prime concern of the Government to ensure that as much of their
activities as possible should be open and transparent. This Bill, with
its emphasis on openness, is intended to complement the current moves
towards transparency where Ministers and Permanent Secretaries must
publish on the web details of those they meet on a regular basis.
However, they can do that only if they know to whom they are talking
and on whose behalf those people are speaking. Therefore, it seems
eminently sensible that where this is not immediately obvious there
should be ways of ensuring that those companies are known
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102277000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102277000014">Mention
has been made of in-house lobbying and there was a general emphasis on
companies like British Gas. This is not relevant because a company like
British Gas will come to see a Minister on the basis of being British
Gas, unless it is going to go for a big public relations company, in
which case it will then have to be registered. So that is not a problem
and there has been no intention in this Bill to deal with what someone
called management
consultants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102277000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102277000015">So
the Government work on the basis that the electorate have the right to
know what has been done in its name by whom and for whom. The aim of
the measures in this Bill is to do just that. The requirement that
those large organisations whose business it is to lobby senior members
of the Government and Civil Service on behalf of their clients should
have to be registered and declare the names of those on whose behalf
they have made, or are making, representations is long overdue.
Whether, as has been suggested, this should go further down the pay

those working on their own or others’ behalf to influence
candidates or parties at elections should be regulated, and thus
transparent, could be seen as providing more openness to such
influence, as also ensuring that Trades Union members’ records
are up to date. So the three elements of the Bill are all directed
towards the same outcome—that any influence, or attempted
influence on the democratic process should be out in the

other side of the coin is that legislation should also be transparent
to those who are affected by it, or believe themselves to be so, so
that people can understand not only what is intended but that the
legislation is being made to work. Often this has to be left to
secondary legislation or guidance. However, from all the briefing we
have received and from today’s contributions, it is clear that
despite amendments made in the other place there is still a perceived
if not an actual lack of clarity about whom the provisions in Part 2
will affect and how. There is concern on the part of charities in
particular and the voluntary sector about the interpretation and
implementation of the regulation of third parties’ activities
during the purdah year prior to elections. The Government specifically
tried to satisfy concerns in this area by the amendments

still an

least because of the fixed-term Parliament it is obvious where the year
starts, which is not the case under the current provisions in the
Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act. It may be that
one of the things we should address is the length of this
purdah. I remember well the passing of the Political Parties, Elections
and Referendums Act. There was a great deal of consternation about the
fact that there was a year, particularly relating to constituency
associations, in which everything had to be declared and there could be
virtually no political activity within that year. I think that, as the
noble Lord has said, we might need to look at whether this year the
whole year is too long or whether that should be curtailed. Nobody has
briefed me on this; I suggest it entirely by myself as it appeared just
as a thought as we were going

alarmed at the changes being made to the Political Parties and

sure that the Minister will make that clear—during the election
purdah for fear of breaching the proposed provisions in the Bill on
their interrelation with political parties or candidates and the

agree with my noble friend Lord Tyler, who is not in his place, that it
is essential that we tease out the relationship between this Bill and
the charities law to ensure that they are compliant. Charities and
similar organisations have already been excluded from the provisions in
Part 1 of having to register as lobbyists, so they are not affected by
that aspect of the Bill. I have also noted the long briefing from the
Electoral Commission, which in effect supports many of the concerns
which have been made by other bodies as well as how it is to operate in
its new extended remit. It has indicated in the Appendix A to its brief
how it would interpret the likely regulations and provisions but it
does consider that some if not all of the concerns being raised are
justified.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102277000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102277000022">In
principle, I support the aims of the Bill. Greater transparency is
something for which we should all aspire but there is more work to be
done to ensure that there are as few ambiguities, unintended
consequences and unclear provisions as possible because the more of
those that remain the more this Bill can be misrepresented. 
<?notus-xml column=944?>So I hope that we will be able to clear those up as we go along. I am
sure that there will be amendments laid to try to deal with these, most
of which are essentially practical, as noble Lords have said, but which
can be open to misinterpretation. I believe that the Electoral
Commission is still having discussions with the Government and I look
forward to the report being compiled by the new commission of the noble

sure that many of these issues can be ironed out while the Bill is in
this House. I know, too, that even in the short time left between now
and further stages, representatives of the organisations which will
become non-political third parties would want to put their anxieties
directly to Ministers. I know from having dealt with previous
legislation that it is amazing how quickly this House can move. So I do
not think that it will be at all necessary for the Bill to be delayed
and we can work within this

conclusion, at least some of the concerns that have been raised seem to
be justified and I hope that through further discussions, reassurance
from the Ministers or government amendments we will manage to allay
some of them. Knowing the Ministers leading the Bill, as I do, I am
certain that they will be doing just that. At the end, while all
organisations may not be happy, they may at least feel that their
issues are understood, that many have been dealt with and that they
have been listened

individual membership records are distributed more widely, where will

Hollins (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, despite government attempts to
allay fears about this Bill, as we have been hearing today and as our
mailboxes confirm, there are still grave worries from charities,
voluntary organisations and other third-party
organisations—worries that their everyday activities will be
seriously affected by the excessive bureaucracy required by the
legislation. I believe that all non-party political organisations
should be allowed to continue their usual work in raising and
campaigning on issues relevant to their aims and objectives—even
in an election

have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:54:04"></hs_TimeCode> been told
that the Government do not intend the Bill to prevent non-party
political organisations supporting, engaging or influencing public
policy, and that the new amendments were intended to address
misunderstandings about its intentions with respect to third-party
campaigning. But despite these amendments, anxieties about what
third-party campaigners can and cannot do are unabated. I will give a
couple of examples in a
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102284000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000011">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:52:25"></hs_TimeCode>
is considerable uncertainty and ambiguity in the wording of the Bill.
It is still unclear whether third-party campaign groups will fall foul
of the rules if they support specific policies that might also be
advocated by one or another political party. For example, in
healthcare, would organisations concerned about alcohol, tobacco or
mental health issues be able to debate, comment and campaign on these
matters without being so restricted by this regulation that they are
prevented from carrying out these core activities? These are the
questions that people are
asking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102284000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000012">There
are other questions too. It is currently not clear which expenditure
limits amount to “controlled expenditure” and thus fall
within the applicable limit. For example, the Government amended the
Bill to exempt the costs of annual conferences, but the costs of public
rallies, meetings or other events are still included. I therefore have
a question for the Minister. Which category would apply for a
membership organisation that organises a conference for its members,
but which also has a public element with non-member observers and with
an invited media
presence?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102284000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000013">The
summary of all this uncertainty is that many organisations share
massive apprehension that the Bill could severely limit their
day-to-day activities by introducing what some see as an over-the-top
regulation. It is not just charities and voluntary organisations that
have concerns about the changes; politically non-affiliated trade
unions, such as the BMA and the RCN, are concerned that the new
amendments do not go far enough. An excellent briefing from the Royal
College of Nursing explains that during the general election campaign
of 2010, it campaigned on behalf of its members on healthcare issues,
such as maintaining investment in services, improving care for older
people and a focus on public health. Candidates from all parties were
asked to support these priorities and their 
<?notus-xml column=949?>responses were shared online. Campaigns such as
these, aimed at raising standards of care in the NHS, would not be
possible if this Bill becomes law. In the eyes of the RCN, the
reduction of spending limits and the bureaucratic burden imposed would
render this type of activity
impossible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102284000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000014">In
the other place, the Government offered assurances to charities and
voluntary organisations, but I would welcome assurances that they have
fully considered the impact of the legislation on other types of
third-party groups, such as politically non-affiliated trade unions

in campaigning on issues in the public interest. I declare an

Haskel (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, as the Minister has said, we would

why.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102284000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000018">Part 1
calls for a register of lobbyists. In order to deliver transparency,
surely a register must include all those who are lobbying and who is
employing them. At present, there is a voluntary register that tells
you this about some organisations—those that register. The
register in the Bill, however, is so narrow and so full of loopholes
that it frustrates responsible firms while encouraging irresponsible
firms to profit from the loopholes. It muddies the voluntary code. The
acting chair of the UK Public Affairs Council, speaking about the
register,
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13102284000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000079">“People

are these loopholes? As my noble friend Lady Hayter, the noble Lord,
Lord Norton, and many noble Lords have pointed out, only political
consultants are required to register, but we are told that 99% of the
contact between Ministers and Permanent Secretaries is not by political
consultants but by representatives of corporations or special interest
groups, and they are not on the register; nor are those who advise on
how to lobby, a major activity of modern lobbying. This can be an
individual or a small organisation, but small organisations are to be
excluded. “Small organisations” means those not
registered for VAT. The Minister does not need me to spell out the
loopholes in that.</hs_para>

Bill requires transparency only when you lobby a Minister, a Permanent
Secretary or other senior staff. But, like all of us who have worked in
government, the Minister knows that most briefing comes from lower
down, usually from experts in a particular field. Moreover, this is not
the level where most public concerns lie and where much public money is
spent. The NHS, local enterprise partnerships and public services
provided by the private sector inevitably involve more junior public
servants—again, often experts in their fields—but it is
here that many members of the public would like to see the shining
light of transparency. Also, what about special advisers? As we have
heard, their influence has even brought down a
Minister.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102284000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000021">Part
1 of the Bill does little to support the public interest. Property
developers and planning, banks and regulation, education and free
schools are all areas where lobbying affects the public interest, yet
most will fall outside the scope of the Bill. Instead of giving people
confidence in our political system, Part 1 just provides loopholes. We
all know that loopholes attract the irresponsible; they lower standards
and the public interest suffers. Talking about standards, are the
Government satisfied that Part 1 of the Bill will deal with unethical
behaviour by lobbyists? The voluntary register has a code of conduct.
Surely the Government’s register should also have a code of
conduct; otherwise, there will be little pressure to raise
standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102284000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000022">Part
1 of the Bill is not only poor legislation, it is unfair. If a small
organisation wishes to campaign against tobacco packaging or alcohol
pricing, its consultant lobbyist would be far more tightly regulated
than the in-house lobbyists of the drinks or tobacco companies. This
applies in many spheres—for example, in health, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Hollins, has just told us. All this does is protect
vested interests and make it more difficult for the weak to stand up to
the
strong.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102284000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000023">How
can we put this right? First, by defining lobbying properly. We should
respect the existing lobbying registers and give them more force. If
there is to be a Bill, everybody involved in lobbying will have to be
drawn into the net. Figures given in another place estimate that some
350 companies will be caught by the Bill. The UK Public Affairs Council
estimates that 100 would be caught—from about 15,000
people and firms that operate as lobbyists. That is why Part 1 of the
Bill is pointless.</hs_para>

have pointed out, this is a difficult area for lawmaking, partly
because lobbying is difficult to define, as the noble Lord, Lord Lang,
explained. I will give your Lordships one more example. It has been
known for lobbyists to work as researchers for noble Lords and to
provide a secretarial service to all-party groups. Some firms second
staff for particular projects to Ministers and government departments,
and to the Opposition. Are they
lobbyists?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102284000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000025">It
is hard to separate lobbying from campaigning. However, I agree with
the Minister and most noble Lords that lobbying is valuable. The noble

Committee tells us, the Bill is being rushed through without
pre-legislative 
<?notus-xml column=951?>scrutiny and with little debate in another place.

the objections to this Bill of the committees of both Houses, of all
the organisations in civic society that have been cited and of noble
Lords today is due to oversensitivity, suspicion or even paranoia. But,
frankly, the Government have done little to overcome that paranoia.
They hope that during consideration of this Bill they will manage to do

at the wider issue, when the Westminster Foundation or other human
rights bodies promoting democracy in Africa or the former Soviet Union
visit these emerging democracies, one of the key elements that they

co-operatives, charities—all the kinds of bodies that will be

think about this Government’s record. In the third week of this
Government, an instruction went from the Cabinet Office to all quangos
and arm’s-length bodies that they were no longer allowed to
campaign or to try to influence legislators. Then we had the
instruction from DCLG to local government that it had to drop or cut
dramatically its campaigning activity. Then we had the various
restrictions on access to justice, to tribunals and courts, and the
cuts in legal aid. Ministers can defend every single one of these moves
individually, but the totality adds up to an attack on or at least an
undermining of essential elements of our civic democracy. Democracy is
not all Westminster or the big issues; it is what goes on in civic
society down the line and how people express themselves collectively
and individually through those intermediate organisations. The
Government need to reflect on that. I particularly ask the noble Lord,
Lord 
<?notus-xml column=952?>Wallace of Saltaire, to do so, for I know him to be a liberal person of
great democratic credentials. I am not saying anything different about
the other Minister sitting on the Front Bench, but I say that today,

of my points on the Bill have been spoken to. On Part 1, we need
greater transparency in lobbying, but, as my noble friend Lord Haskel
and others said, we are attacking the wrong target at both ends. The
only register and requirements are for consultant lobbyists. Consultant
lobbyists are a relatively new operation in our democracy. Some of my
best friends are now consultant lobbyists, partly because it has been a
bit of a job creation scheme for the wannabe, has-been and never-were
politicos of various sorts, but, as my noble friend said, they are not
the major part of the lobbying industry—far from it. Some
organisations see a need to use consultant lobbyists; some do not
really need to. The really big, effective lobbyists do not need to.
Rupert Murdoch does not need a consultant lobbyist; EDF and the Chinese
Government do not need consultant lobbyists; pharmaceutical companies
and defence contractors do not need them. Some of them use them
occasionally, but they do not need them because they have the power to
address Ministers and senior civil servants
directly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102284000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000032">I do
not know what the solution is to that huge area of lobbying. As the
noble Lord, Lord Lang, said, it is very difficult to have a single
definition of lobbying. As I remarked the other day, sadly, anybody who
wants to talk to a politician is not really there to enjoy their
sparkling conversation, their erudition and wisdom, still less their
erotic allure; people are there because they want something. In one
sense, almost every encounter that a politician has with a member of
the public or a representative of an organisation could be defined as
lobbying. We have to pin it down—I understand that—but
the fact is that Part 1 does not tackle that problem. We are
hobbling the minnows while we let the sharks swim
free.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102284000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000033">It is
also about the other end of the process. We all know from being in or
anywhere near government that it is very difficult to get the ear of
the Secretary of State or the Permanent Secretary, but it is much
easier to buy lunch for the person who has their ear—the spad,
the private secretary, the assistant secretary or the grade 5 who is
actually drafting the legislation or assessing the contracts. They are
completely excluded from the Bill, so the Government have got it wrong
at both ends of how we are to introduce transparency in the lobbying
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102284000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000034">On
Part 2, a lot of points have been made both in the House and outside,
in the literature that we have all received. It is right that there
should be restrictions on third parties in electoral situations. It is
right that we should be worried about an American-style super-PAC
development here. That is why the Labour Government introduced PPERA in
the first place 13 years ago, but Part 2 restricts the activities of
third parties beyond the degree that is necessary to protect democracy.
It reduces the threshold, so that very small organisations have huge
burdens placed on them; it widens the definition of what is to be
electorally relevant or regulated expenditure; and it cuts
significantly the 
<?notus-xml column=953?>amount of money that third parties can pay over a
period of 12 months before an election, not just the four or five weeks
of the election campaign
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102284000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000035">Obviously,
third parties’ campaigning activities can be said to be aligned
with one party or another, or with one candidate or another, either
locally or nationally. The cutting of expenditure and the widening of
the activities that are covered by it will have a drastic effect on
many local campaigns—and very soon, if the Bill goes through. We
are only 18 months off the general election; we know when it will be
these days. Within six months or so, the £5,000 limit on a
constituency basis—we need a limit at that basis—will
prevent a number of local campaigns against the closure of hospitals,
for or against wind farms, for or against particular developments, or
campaigns against HS2. All of those local campaigns could fall foul of
the constituency limit.</hs_para>

several major political events over the past few years could not occur
in future in the 12 months before an election, because they were too
expensive. In that, it is not just one organisation’s limit that
must be taken into account. If several organisations are in coalition
for an event, it is the aggregated cost that is controlled, which
includes such things as staff costs of the organisation. In those
circumstances, for example, at no time in the 12 months before an
election could the TUC organise another March for Jobs. It is highly
probable that the BMA would find it difficult to organise a campaign
about health service reforms. I see my noble friend Lady Mallalieu
here. It would be very difficult for the Countryside Alliance to
organise a march of previous proportions against a foxhunting ban. God
forbid, if we were engaged in some new military intervention, it would
be very difficult for a coalition against the war to organise a march
against it. All such events would come up against a limit for
12 months. That is a serious limitation on our democracy and
something that this House should not allow through without serious
objection. That is not a healthy
democracy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102284000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102284000037">Part
3 has trade unionists specifically in its sights. My noble friends Lord
Monks and Lady Donaghy have already pointed out the absurdity of that
and others have queried why we are doing it at all. Of course, in my
paranoid mood, I think that there are two or three potential reasons.
One is that it might make strike ballots even more challengeable in the
courts than they already are. Another would simply be to impose
additional costs on trade unions, limiting their activities. A third is

extends the scope of what is considered electoral campaigning and
lowers the threshold of spending, at the same time as introducing
double accounting for the spends of organisations that work in

concerned that the Bill’s lack of clarity and need for legal

altogether—particularly further education colleges, which noble
Lords will know have a high number of students from backgrounds not
adequately represented in elite sections of society. Conrad Grant,
president of Goldsmiths Students’ Union, is worried about how

it is the democratic right of students—possibly their

Union membership is already regulated by

many other noble Lords, we are unable to work out exactly what problem
the Government are trying to remedy. Unions already have a legal duty
to keep accurate membership records, and it is in their interests to do
so. Not only do good membership records increase income and minimise
expense, any union involved in an industrial action ballot knows that
an employer is likely to legally challenge the ballot if there is a
suspicion of inaccurate records. Unions also need accurate membership
records in order to carry out their internal democratic processes, such
as elections. Most people would probably agree that people should not
have to reveal whether they are members of a political party to

auditor’s report in the accounts, allowing the certification
officer to compare revenue from dues with the numbers reported, so the

reaction is, “You must be kidding”—but then it
dawned on me what was going on here. There are two groups of civil
servants being instructed by the Secretary of State to provide a case
for this. One set of civil servants, job team A, is asked to write one
set of arguments. In the next paragraph, job team B is asked to

cracked the code on this, I realised that it is all very
logical—right down to the detail of why the sum involved is an
extra burden on the trade unions of £420,000. That has
been arrived at by using the salaries of trade union officials from the
<I>Annual Survey </I><I>of Hours a</I><I>nd Earnings</I>, which says
that the basic hourly median pay for officers of
non-governmental organisations —that obviously implies voluntary
organisations—who are the closest match to a trade union
official, is £12.03 an hour. The basis of all this is that union
officials doing all this stuff are paid that, on average, but I suppose
that the people who have to provide all this stuff in Whitehall have
telephones and might ring up any trade union to find out more

return to the main theme that many of my colleagues have brought out:
why are we picking on the trade unions and making them keep their lists

insisting that we have to do even more for the most openly democratic

extraordinary development, but I have reached the 10-minute limit so I
will leave the issue there. As far as I can see, though, there has to
be much deeper consideration by the Government. As things stand, my
view is that the Bill should simply be withdrawn as an outrage to
democracy. When I go to do work for the Westminster Foundation for
Democracy in Congo or Mozambique, these are some of the practices that

having been unable to be present for the first few minutes of his
opening speech. I hope that the House will forgive me if I pray in aid

discourtesy to the

to the Bill. Like many other noble Lords who have spoken, I share the
view that it is an unfortunate but undeniable fact that public trust in
our great institutions, particularly our political institutions, has
declined in recent years. We can speculate about the reasons for this.
Some say that in some cases it is exaggerated by journalistic
supposition and not always based on fact. Others say there is an
increasing public appetite for conspiracy theories. Last but perhaps
not least, there is the increasing unreadiness of people to accept the
inevitable unfairnesses in life, seeing them instead as the product of
a system that is biased against them. Whatever the causes, the decline
is there, and this is the challenge that we now face.</hs_para>

used the phrase, “sunshine is the best disinfectant”, and
I share that view. A Bill that includes “transparency of
lobbying” has my instinctive sympathy and support. Moving on
from that very general statement, and changing my metaphor, if I may,
we have to ask whether it does what it says on the tin. This is an area
where I and a lot of other noble Lords have some
questions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000004">When
I have been considering the Bill, I have been applying a series of
yardsticks by which I adjudge its efficacy: its comprehensiveness, its
comprehensibility, its consistency and its proportionality. First, by
“comprehensiveness” I mean: do the provisions of the Bill
catch a sufficiency of the target group? If not, we all know how
quickly organisations can and will reconfigure themselves to get around
statutory provisions. Secondly, the Bill will sweep up a range of
organisations hitherto unaffected. By
“comprehensibility”, I mean: will such organisations,
especially small ones, be able readily to understand what is required
of them without devoting a fantastic amount of management time and/or
professional fees and advice to their interpretation? Thirdly, a number
of bodies will be concerned with enforcing this legislation. They
include, obviously, the new registrar of lobbyists, the Electoral
Commission and the Charity Commission. By “consistency”,
I mean: will all the policies of the bodies be joined up? In other
words, will they be consistent one with another? Fourthly, by
“proportionate”, I mean: can we avoid the creation of yet
another huge bureaucratic process-driven machine, so that while boxes
are ticked judgment is
forgotten?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000005">I
need to remind the House that I have undertaken two inquiries into the
charity and voluntary sector for the Government, focusing, inter alia,
on the regulatory burdens that have affected that sector, and that
until about 12 months ago I was president of the NCVO, so it will not
surprise your Lordships that most of my comments are focused on Part 2.
Before I turn to that part, however, I would like to raise a couple of
points 
<?notus-xml column=961?>in relation to Part 1. I note many of the concerns
that other noble Lords have raised about the competence of this measure
and its inability to catch a sufficiency of the target population, and
no doubt we shall explore this in Committee.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102294000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000006">I want to raise a point
about the position of the registrar. The registrar will surely have an
important, indeed key, role to play in this new system. From the
legislation it seems to me that he will be its linchpin, and it will be
very important that he carries out his task properly if we are to move
towards restoring public trust. This may require him from time to time
to take actions that are disobliging, certainly to lobbyists but
sometimes to the Government of the day, of whatever colour it may be.
Indeed, some may argue that if he was not occasionally disobliging, he
probably would not be doing his job very well. Yet when you look at
Schedule 2, you see that his position is very weak indeed: he may be
dismissed by the Minister on the grounds that he is unable, unwilling
or unfit. That seems to be a pretty peremptory way to be able to treat
this official, particularly when you compare it with the protection
that appears to be given to members of the Charity Commission, let
alone that afforded to members of the Electoral Commission. I would
appreciate a few comments from the Minister on that
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000007">I turn
to Part 2. Early in the proceedings on the Bill in another place, we
received some pretty heated comments from charities and voluntary
organisations about the impact of Part 2, suggesting, sometimes in
terms, that it represents the end of the world as we know it. This is
some of the substance that illuminated the background remarks by my
noble friend Lord Tyler. Recent comments seem to have been more
moderate in tone, and I welcome that because in my view merely to have
passed a public benefit test does not excuse an organisation from the
need for some level of scrutiny—rather the reverse, since
charitable status carries with it many privileges, not least an element
of subsidy from the taxpayer through gift
aid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000008">I, for
the reason mentioned above—my work with the sector—am a
passionate supporter of the charity sector and all that it stands for.
However, it needs to keep its credentials burnished bright,
particularly in the eyes of the general public. Its reputation remains
high among the general public, but we are all aware of how quickly
reputations can be lost and of how, once lost, they are extremely hard
to recover. The glory of the sector is that it is of all political
parties but of none. That must be a distinction that we should try to
preserve as we consider the provisions of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000009">Having
said that, the sector has some very reasonable concerns about aspects
of Part 2. Many noble Lords have talked about the confusing nature of
Clause 26 on controlled expenditure. Noble Lords raised the particular
issue that the cost of volunteer time is included. My noble friend Lord
Phillips got up and said that he would shoot this canard; I am not
quite sure if you can shoot one, but he dealt with it very effectively
by quoting from the PPER Act. I hope that he is right. He is a very
eminent charity lawyer, while I am not a lawyer at all. However,

connection with that section of the briefing from the Electoral
Commission which is entitled:</hs_para>

doubt. I will be delighted to be put right and to be told that I have
got it completely wrong, but I seem to feel the ground shifting under
me slightly. Therefore, this and other questions raise the issue of the
comprehensibility test. We need to spend quite a bit of time in
Committee getting the Government to explain in detail the practical
implications of what is intended here.</hs_parafo>

up, my noble friend may be inclined to say that a great deal of
guidance is already available. Of course, that is absolutely for sure.
CC9, which I believe the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, referred to,
which is the Charity Commission guidance, <I>Charities, Elections and
Referendums</I>, runs to 35 pages, with a three-page addendum published
in January 2011. The Electoral Commission’s guidance for
non-party campaigners runs to eight pages, with a further eight-page
addendum. To put it no higher, there are four documents and if noble
Lords read them—and I am sure that many noble Lords have done
so—they are not easy to synthesise. At their heart is the
problem of differentiating between policy work and campaigning, and the
different interpretations put upon those two very important words by
the two different bodies, the Electoral Commission and the Charity
Commission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000011">That
takes me to the point about consistency. We need to find some joined-up
thinking between the Government’s lawyers, those of the
Electoral Commission and those of the Charity Commission. Perhaps at
least a proportion of the steam could be taken out of these issues if
some joint guidance could be agreed between the two commissions and
published. I do not underestimate the difficulties of getting the two
commissions to collaborate—I have been trying for some three
years to get Companies House and the Charity Commission to agree a
common standard form for charitable companies. To describe my progress
as “glacial” would be altogether too rapid a description.
However, my noble friend would do a great deal to reassure people if
those two bodies could be brought together and made to produce
something that made sense and which did not require charities
to produce two separate sets of guidance and pull them
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000012">Finally,
I turn briefly to proportionality. I share the view that the reduction
of limits is unreasonable, particularly that to £2,000. The
£2,000 limit, applied to Wales, is a figure that would exclude
almost any activity. The hire of a hall, some staff costs and publicity
could go over the limit. In his very interesting remarks, the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of Derby talked about the importance of
local campaigns. This is where that particular low level will be most
keenly felt. I invite my noble friend to reflect on how we would deal
with Kidderminster Hospital. That was a single issue, fought in a
single constituency; how would it be dealt with under these provisions,
and what would be the impact? I am not quite sure what it would be, but
I am sure that it would have some important things, and maybe some
challenges, for the people of Kidderminster, who passionately want
their hospital preserved, and that these regulations might make that
much more difficult.</hs_para>

is some important work to be done on coalitions of charities working

watchword of the Bill is “transparency”, and the

register argue that Part 1 of the Bill risks making lobbying
less—not more—transparent. That is because it will cover
only a fraction of lobbying and lobbyists and because the register will
include no meaningful information on the activities of those it covers.

Greaves (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, it is always a privilege to follow
the noble Baroness, Lady Lister of Burtersett, and, indeed, it is
today. I speak with slightly less enthusiasm for the Bill than my noble
friend Lord Tyler. I agree entirely with the objectives of transparency
of lobbying and of the prevention of big money distorting electoral
politics. However, asserting that there are problems and dangers in
these areas and that something must be done does not necessarily mean
that the details of the proposals in the legislation are the way
forward. In one respect at least, this is an awful Bill; it is badly
written. I often judge new Bills by whether an intelligent person with
an interest in the subject, picking it up and reading it, could
understand what it is all about. I do not believe that anybody picking
this up and reading it could do that. I look forward to my noble friend
the Minister explaining lucidly and clearly in Committee the
intricacies of Clauses 28 and 29, which seem to be a
nightmare<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:07:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000035">I
declare that I have a lifetime interest in electoral law because I am a
lifetime election agent. It is more than 40 years since I started
running election campaigns, and I do not suppose that I have finished
yet, so I know about election law—and this is election law. We
have had a stream of lobbying, ironically, on the Bill from all sorts
of people. It seems that the whole of civil society in this country is
up in arms. In particular, we have had a focus on the effects that Part
2 might have on charities. However, this Bill is not actually about
charities. It is about all the third-party campaigners and campaign
bodies. Nevertheless, charities say it will seriously affect
them.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102294000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000036">The
Government’s response is to assert that it will not, but
assertion is not enough. When a whole sector is up in arms like that,
simply telling it that it is wrong is not good enough. There should be
argument and explanation and, I humbly suggest to my noble
friends on the government Front Bench, a willingness to look at
changing the Bill to clarify it, to amend it and to improve it, is what
is required. At the moment we simply have a pantomime argument going
on, one side saying, “Oh, yes, it does”, the other side
saying, “Oh, no, it doesn’t”, and so it goes
on—and as we know from pantomimes, that does not get us

your Lordships’ House we are often told that our job is to
scrutinise, revise and improve legislation. In order to do that, we
also need a substantial willingness on the part of the Government to
listen and discuss with us around the House how best to revise this
legislation—the need for which, it seems to me, is absolutely
certain. As I have just said, this is election law, not charities law.
What charities can and cannot do is not per se the concern of the Bill.
That is defined by charities legislation and regulated by the Charity
Commission, as the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, discussed in detail. This
Bill is about regulation of what all third-party bodies can and cannot
do in relation to election campaigning.</hs_para>

is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:10:00"></hs_TimeCode> that it is
all part of election law, which is complex, obscure and widely ignored.
Those of us who know a lot about it know how to get around it in many
cases—not that I would ever do
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:09:42"></hs_TimeCode>. But the
Bill specifically amends the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000, or PPERA. Having gone back and read that part of
the Act again in detail, for the first time in a long time, I think
that it is poor legislation. I hope that the Labour Party will not get
too much on its high horse about this Bill, because one of the real
problems with it is that it is based on the structure and system set
out in PPERA, which is frankly not fit for purpose. We are lumbered
with it and have to do our best with it—but it will be
legitimate in these circumstances to look in Committee not just at what
the Bill says but at what PPERA says, to see whether a lot of the
vagueness, obscurity and the problems in this area do not actually come
from the original wording in that Act. We are told by the
Government, or by my noble friend Lord Tyler, that over the past 13
years Part 6 of PPERA has been tried and tested—but it has not.
It has largely been ignored; it has never been tested in the courts;
and I think that we should subject some of that to scrutiny in
Committee. It is complex and difficult to understand; it is full of
vague expressions, when clarity is needed; it is untested in the
courts; and it is subject to unsatisfactory advice by the Electoral
Commission over the years. Those comments apply to PPERA, not just the
Bill that we now have to amend
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:11:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000039">The
whole thing is poor, flawed legislation. Whether we can make anything
sensible out of it, we will find out in the next few weeks. This part
of PPERA and these issues have really come to prominence only as a
result of the present Bill—because the thresholds and spending
limits are being reduced and what is defined as controlled expenditure
is being substantially increased. That has put considerable fear among
the campaigning organisations, whether or not they are charities, and
that is what is causing the problems before us today. I suggest to the
Labour Party that the Bill has reached Second Reading and, no doubt, it
will pass Second Reading—although it is fair enough to make
political points in this debate. But all of us—the Opposition,
the Cross Benches and the two government parties, as well as anybody
else in the House who is interested—need to get together and try
to thrash out a way in which to make this legislation a great deal
better than it is
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:12:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:09:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000040">I
want to talk about constituency campaigning, which has a new emphasis
in this Bill. It is a very difficult issue in relation to third-party
campaigning, because it is within the confines of a particular
electoral area, which is obviously considerably smaller than one of the
nations of this country. It is considerably easier, if people have a
lot of money, to throw money at a particular constituency and seriously
affect the election result. This is a serious problem, and it is no
good us pretending that it is not. Yet we live in a changing world, in
which political and campaigning energies are more and more being
directed into single-issue and themed campaigning groups. At the same
time, coming from a different direction is the threat of a large amount
of money and corporate power being used in this country; it is not
necessarily exactly the same as 
<?notus-xml column=968?>the super-PACs that are so distorting politics in the United States of
America, but the same kind of problem is occurring. It is not easy to
find a way in which to regulate all this, and to fit that into the
traditional system of controls and regulation that is based on
political parties and candidates being regulated. These are difficult
areas at national levels; they are most difficult at the level of
individual electoral areas, constituencies or even local government
wards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:14:25"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:09:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000041">In
the past, the system was much stricter. When charities or local groups
called all-party meetings and one candidate dropped out, they usually
cancelled the meeting, because it was thought that spending money at
all in a way that was in any way partisan was contrary to electoral law
and should not take place. That is in the past now—but any of us
who have been in politics for a long time have scars from individual
contests when third-party campaigning has made a difference. We may not
have the scars—we may have the victory medals as a result of
it—but in our party we tend to have the
scars<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:15:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000042">I
remember in the Nelson and Colne constituency in February 1974, nearly
40 years ago, there was a very tight contest in which David Waddington,
now the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, was defending his seat; he held it
by about 135 votes. The candidate who came second was Doug Hoyle, now
the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, and the Liberal candidate was myself. That
election was considerably affected by two lots of third-party
campaigners. There were people from the Society for the Protection of
Unborn Children, who managed to divert a lot of Catholic votes away
from both of us—certainly from me. The others were the local
unions, who used their base in what was then a very strong
manufacturing area, with all the local mills and the factories, to make
sure that the main opposition to David Waddington was the Labour Party
and not me. I am not complaining about it, in retrospect, although at
the time I thought that it was pretty underhand. I have changed my mind
about these things. I have been out on the streets delivering Hope Not
Hate leaflets in Pendle against BNP candidates, and I have contributed
funding to those leaflets. So there has to be a
balance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:16:27"></hs_TimeCode>.

yet finalised. However, having listened to and read all the evidence,
there have been times when my reaction was very much that of Victor
Meldrew in “One Foot in the Grave”: that is, “I
don’t believe it!”. How could a Government, any
Government, make such a hash of an issue on which we are almost
entirely united—that of transparency at election time? None of
us wants money to be able to buy votes. We agree that there should be
clear limits on spending and the public should be told who spends what.
If anything, we should be looking tonight at a short Bill with
all-party support, which makes some amendments to the Political Parties
Act to improve its clarity. That would have all-party support. Instead,
undue haste has produced a quite dreadful piece of legislation which
has managed not only to divide the political parties but has united
charities and organisations of every kind against it. How do you manage
to alienate the Women’s Institute, Mumsnet, the National Trust,
Greenpeace, the British Legion, the Countryside Alliance, the nurses,
the RSPB and so on against you so that they combine together? You could
not do it if you tried, but this coalition has managed it. When
listening to the evidence, I did at times wonder whether someone with a
sense of humour had slipped Part 2 into this Bill to test whether
anyone in this House was awake, but the 40-strong speakers list shows
that we are. If there are notably few Back-Bench coalition speakers, I
can attribute it only to a number of those who normally stand up for
free speech having adopted the maxim, “If you can’t say
anything good, then say nothing at
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:19:54"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000046">Part
2 is not wholly useless. It could serve a professor of politics very
well as an example to his students of how not to legislate. It contains
just about every error that a Government could make. There is not time
tonight to detail them all, so I will take a selection of the major
ones. The first thing you do is legislate in haste. Part 2 seems to
have its origins in a meeting between the Prime Minister and his deputy
in July, when they realised that unless something was done pretty
quickly this autumn, a Bill would not reach the statute book a year
before the fixed date of the next general election. There was no real
urgency whatever about Part 2. We have been told by Members in the
other place that Members of Parliament were not clamouring it, and
neither was anybody
else<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:23:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000047">Although
the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 had its
critics, and various improvements could have been made to it, it has
worked reasonably well in two general elections. We were told that
there has been no raft of complaints about it. There has been no formal
investigation or inquiry and no prosecutions. It is not perfect: there
is some lack of clarity and the Electoral Commission’s 
<?notus-xml column=970?>review has suggested improvements, but it is workable. Nevertheless,
Part 2 was shoved into this Bill and, as we have heard, it was put
before the Commons just as the House rose for the Summer
Recess—indeed, the very day
before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:21:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000048">The
second error the Government made was not to consult those directly
affected. They did not consult charities or campaigning organisations.
Indeed, they did not consult properly those with responsibility for
setting up and policing the new legislation. The Electoral Commission
were, it seems, told what to do, not asked. Of the 50 recommendations
it made in its review, only one was put into the Bill, and that was
done in the opposite way to that which it had suggested. The Electoral
Commission advised that staff costs should come into the equation, but
suggested that if it were done, the limits should be raised. The
Government have, indeed, included staff costs but are now trying to
lower the
limits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:22:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000049">Others
have commented on the next error, which is particularly strange coming
from a coalition which speaks of making “a bonfire of
regulation”: that is, a massive increase in the
regulatory burden and, by lowering the limits, an increase in
the number of those to whom it applies. We should not forget that
criminal sanctions will be applied, which are wholly disproportionate

further error is to try to push through a Bill which is so badly
drafted that a specialist lawyer giving evidence to us told us that she

have to seek expensive legal advice simply to understand what it means.

political involvement of the public who in their
millions—literally in the case of some charities such as the
National Trust and the RSPB—have turned to supporting
extra-parliamentary campaigns is an affront to democracy. The voluntary
sector’s involvement in public debate is to be encouraged, not
stifled. It informs MPs and candidates. It informs the electorate. It
enriches debate and very often, and perhaps most importantly of all, it
provides a voice for groups that are otherwise powerless. Campaigns can
at times, I have no doubt, be irksome to Governments but they are

Adebowale (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, to be honest I was going to
home, because I am number 30 on the list and I have listened to all the
speeches—well, most of them. I was going to stand up and declare
my interest 
<?notus-xml column=972?>as the chief executive of a charity and a social

stake is really quite serious. I have been involved in the
not-for-profit sector, lobbying, for about 30 years and I struggle to
understand what the Bill is about. In those 30 years, I have yet to
come across a member of the not-for-profit sector who would breach the
intent even of this Bill. I would be fascinated to know examples of
where that has occurred other than the one referred to by the noble
Lord, Lord Rooker, who pointed out that there was a picture of a fellow
charity chief executive in the Conservative Party manifesto. So there
is a real problem with justifying what the Bill is about.</hs_para>

referred to as being about transparency. There is an over-hackneyed
phrase about sunlight being the best disinfectant. That may be true,
but partial light creates shadows, and Part 1 creates too many of them.
We all know that if you want to get around this you create in-house
lobbies. The fact is that Permanent Secretaries and Ministers can list
their meetings—we know how it works. The one thing that I find
really quite disturbing and which makes me angry is having my time
wasted and seeing people being treated as though they are not
intelligent enough to know that. Then I sit here and listen to the
speeches, many of which have been absolutely brilliant. The noble Lord,
Lord Rooker, just about said it all when he mentioned the £3
million versus £30 million. I would love to have the kind of
money that I see in the hands of many of the major companies that march
through this House lobbying Ministers and civil servants. It is
nonsense to argue that we are somehow at risk of tipping up

us have a look at social history. Do noble Lords really think that the
suffragettes, the people who campaigned against slavery or, for that
matter, the Tolpuddle Martyrs would have asked themselves, “How
much can we spend in Wakefield on lobbying our local Lord”, who
then was the only person with the right to vote, “to try to
persuade him”—and it was a him—“to take
notice of the interests of the poor and the disenfranchised?”.
Let us be real. It never happened and it should not happen now. It is
ridiculous. Social change occurs because of people outside these
Chambers taking up concerns that we do not yet know of and lobbying
people such as us and those in the other place precisely when the local
and national elections are in the minds of the public and
the lobbyists. And so they should. Why? Because they pay for it
all.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102294000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000061">The

have been a terrible experience but I sat here and thought,
“Tough”. That is democracy; that is how it works. People
either are or are not persuaded and, frankly, the amount of money spent
by people who wish to persuade candidates in a local area is neither
here nor there. I can tell noble Lords that people in middle-class
areas do not spend a penny, but they use their elbows and persuade
people, and they change what happens in local elections. I knew that

saying that this is wrong. It sends the wrong signal about how we value
the opinions of people who do not have the privileges that we have to
pontificate about the nature of democracy. It insults those people who
gather, with or without money, to influence the people whom they put in
the other place and who are paid to sit here. It does not create an

happen to run an organisation that employs 3,000 people—some
people would call us large and well resourced. I tell you now, with all
due respect to noble Lords, that lawyers frighten me, not just because
they are expensive, but because they do not always bring clarity. You
think twice about whether you are going to campaign when you are faced

problem of dealing with this as Back-Bench Peers is as intense in
relation to this Bill, more or less, as to any that I have come across.
It is not so much the length—it is a mere 62 pages—but
that it is mostly written by reference to the 2000 Act, and there is no
Keeling schedule. How on earth are we Back-Benchers, with no assistance
whatever, supposed to get to grips with the fine print of a main Bill

got in this morning there were three documents, totalling another 94

Again, how on earth are we supposed to do our jobs and take into full
account the very careful work done by those various bodies? That merely
emphasises the fact that a Bill of this importance should not be dealt
with in this helter-skelter way, whether or not it comes out of the

Commission can do the job. Perhaps I may read a couple of passages from
CC9, which was mentioned by my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham and others.
It is a long and detailed guidance for charities which has evolved over
40 or 50 years. I have been quite closely involved with it. It gives an
absolutely well thought through, pragmatically based series of
yardsticks. The summary of campaigning and political activity by
charities states
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13102294000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0002.htm#13102294000219">“political

a charity cannot exist for a political purpose, which is any purpose
directed at furthering the interests of any political party, or
securing or opposing a change in the law, policy or decisions either in
this country or abroad. In the political arena, a charity must stress
its independence and ensure that any involvement it has with political

convincing it that we had not, but these are not empty words. If the
Minister says that they are not quite strong enough then give the
Charity Commission more resources. It has had a great deal of its
people power taken from it. If we remove it from this Act, it would be
a big load off the back of the Electoral Commission. It would be a
saving of manpower, not a waste of manpower. It would be an economic

have said it, but the charity world as it is is the jewel in the crown
of our culture. More than half the adult population is engaged in
charity in one way or another. Charities are the engine of civic
engagement at a time when in other respects we are in dead trouble.
They exemplify organic life, volunteerism, communalism, 
<?notus-xml column=976?>philanthropy and trust. They are cherished. Can we claim those
characteristics for the body politic? I fear not. Can big business
claim any of those virtues? I fear not. Yet we are on the brink of
putting into force an Act which will damage the sector, particularly
the smaller part of it. It will demoralise charities, it will cause
bureaucratic overload and it will waste money that is hard obtained and
can be used better elsewhere. I do not see that we have anything
remotely approaching a justification for shackling the charity sector

probably said more than enough, but I hope that when we get to
Committee I will not have to put down 100 amendments because it would
be a waste of time compared to a much more fundamental review. My last
word is to remind the Minister that charity law is severe. A charity
can exist for charitable purposes only. It can act only to pursue those
charitable purposes. It can act only in the public benefit. We do not
need

a grave situation tonight. My noble friend in winding up what I thought
was a very good opening speech, promised that we would work
constructively and hard to try and make this a better Bill. I hope that
that is possible; I have some doubts. The Government will have to do a
lot of work to persuade us that we can make this a better Bill because
there is tonight’s well argued issue about the complete
incompetence and failure to think through and to analyse the
consequences, and the unintended consequences, and how they will be
dealt with. There is also a question about the underlying purpose of
the Bill. At best that could be crudely party political and at worst it
could be quite sinister. I have done a lot of work in the North
Caucasus region and Russia in recent years and I am horrified to be

is important to go back to the grassroots and listen, and I am going to
ask the House to bear with me while I do that. In all the plethora of

isn’t clear which elements of our work could be classified as
campaigning. For instance, we are involved in research on the impact of
welfare reforms. Is that campaigning? We regard campaigning as one of
our legitimate efforts, as our focus is about using voluntary and
community action to improve the lives of people in Newcastle. It would
be impossible to designate/attribute an economic value to this element
of our work. There would be 
<?notus-xml column=977?>potentially disproportionate amounts of
administration involved. The Act would effectively be a deterrent as
there could be confusion over what was classified as campaigning.
Obviously we are bound by Charity Law and do not engage in party
political campaigning, but we have signed up to campaigns previously
which want change or strengthen policy during election time, eg support
for housing homeless people”.</hs_quote>

Lord Tyler, shaking his head. The noble Lord and others have to face
reality. Whatever was intended, the perception is that this is going to

constitutional disgrace. What these remarks indicate is how important
it is to consult, so that you have the good will and involvement of the
people who are doing the work at the frontline; not pontificating in
this House, but actually doing the work at the frontline. I am
absolutely dismayed that this Bill is before us without consultation,
but I am not surprised. It is all too characteristic of the arrogance
which is around: “We know and we can do it”. I am afraid
that for a sane, decent, modern society, we must have a government
approach which says, “Here is a problem that deeply affects
people. Here are real issues of proper accountability during elections
and the duties and responsibilities of trustees”. How can we sit
down together and find a solution that we are all happy with and which
we see as constructive? That is the mature and self-confident thing to
do, not this lack of self-confidence which means that things have to be
driven through rather than gathering up and involving people in a

campaigning and charities is not new. I was director of Oxfam and I
wonder how many people remember where Oxfam started. It started in the
university church in Oxford in 1942. There was the threat of invasion,
with everyone geared up to defeat 
<?notus-xml column=978?>the enemy. I was a youngster at the time and I can remember the signs
and slogans for victory. There was a great atmosphere. A cross-section
of society came together: academics—Gilbert Murray among
them—trade union leaders and church leaders. They were deeply
disturbed about the appalling famine which they knew was happening in
Greece. They went to the Government and said, “We want to get
relief to Greece”. The Government said, in effect, “You
must be mad. Greece is occupied by the Germans. How can you talk about
doing that in this context?”. They said, “It’s not
the Germans we’re concerned about, it’s the Greek
people”. The Government said, “Look, there’s a
blockade of Greece. How can we break a blockade to get assistance
through<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:55:42"></hs_TimeCode>?”.
So in 1942 they went out with a petition and gathered thousands of
signatures in Oxford and beyond. They got the public’s support
and went back to the Government and said, “We want to do
something about these people in Greece”. The Government caved in
and said, “Well, if you can organise something with the Red
Cross and you do it through the Red Cross, we will let you do
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:56:06"></hs_TimeCode>”. How
would that have happened if there had not been a determination—a

ended up in San Cristobal in Mexico. I met the brave Roman Catholic
bishop of San Cristobal. He was a tough guy. Open-necked shirt, wooden
crucifix, but my God, he was a strong man. He was frequently in
conflict with the Government of Mexico because he was standing by the

evening: lobbying, whether by NGOs, churches or companies, can be a
valuable, necessary and, indeed, inevitable part of our democracy. In
my own experience, much legislation and some policies with which I have

exclusive focus on Permanent Secretaries and Ministers. I have a
certain respect for both Permanent Secretaries and Ministers but I am
not naive and the focus surely needs to be much wider than that, and
include political advisers, directors-general, directors and, for
example, anyone in a team working on a new Bill who might be instructed

public when the Bill or the policy is made public. That seems a rather

last role in the Labour Government was as a Cabinet Office Minister
with responsibility for these issues. I am clear that most lobbying
involves citizens and organisations engaging in the democratic
decision-making process of society; that should be encouraged rather
than constrained. From the discussion I had with the lobbying industry
in 2010, we were clear that all lobbying must be conducted
appropriately; it must be open, transparent and accessible to all; and
that either the industry took meaningful steps to regulate itself or
the Government would do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0003.htm#13102294000099">Despite
welcome progress, my view remained that the industry had not got far
enough and that more significant changes would have to be introduced by

hinder and fetter the good and do little to regulate what could be bad.
Are the public really crying out for changes to hinder or stop
charities and campaign organisations from making their case and

haste, which so many noble Lords mentioned? Why was there absolutely no
consultation with the organisations that will be most affected by the

the Minister could tell the House why the register that the Government

in the voluntary sector, in the trade unions and among transparency
campaigners is that this approach is too narrow. Why should in-house
lobbyists, who represent around 80% of the industry, not be
required to register along with all other professional lobbyists? Not
only is this wrong, it is unfair; it discriminates against different
types of lobbyists. The cosy relationship between government and the
tobacco and energy industries will continue, one reason being that

who has been in government, in the Civil Service or a lobbyist would

more junior civil servants—including those who work in

Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a
vigorous debate with a wide range of opinions forcefully expressed
around the House. First, the Government are listening and consulting,
and we will continue to do so. We will take this carefully through
Committee, and we are concerned to make sure that the Bill as it
emerges from this House reassures the very evident concerns,
particularly from the charity sector. The noble Lord, Lord Judd,
rightly said that the charity sector perceives this as an attack. That
is, by and large, a mistaken perception. However, of course we have to
reassure people and make sure, as we take this Bill through the various
stages, that we have a Bill that we are all happy with as it emerges
from this
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0003.htm#13102294000133">Let me
take the three parts in order. First on the lobbying issue, as a number
of noble Lords said, lobbying is a legitimate activity. Indeed, it is
central to any thriving democracy and is an almost universal activity.
Almost every working day Parliament is being lobbied. Those who had
offices on the West Front particularly enjoyed the London Gay
Men’s Chorus lobbying us several nights in a row. We wished that
they would come back more often. It was one of the most enjoyable bits
of lobbying that we have had so far.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102294000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0003.htm#13102294000134">Part 1 is intended to
focus on professional lobbyists, the skilled and the well paid, those
who provide their services for hire. The noble Baroness, Lady Smith,
talked about lobbying companies which do not even declare their
clients. That is precisely what Part 1 addresses to make sure that
lobbying companies declare their clients. That is where we started out
in our consultation in 2010-11. I regret to say that the various
respondents to that consultation came back with a whole range of
discordant and dissentious responses. 
<?notus-xml column=988?>The Government have decided to take the Australian

those are their 40 clients. Anyone will still be in the dark about
which client had set up that meeting with the
Minister.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0003.htm#13102294000136"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13102294000259" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0003.htm#13102294000259">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> I take the point that the noble
Baroness makes. She has said to me off the Floor of the House that this
ought to be reinforced by making sure that in the notes of the meeting
there is a reference to the subject of the meeting so that those in the
press and outside who want to understand what happened are informed
which of the clients the meeting was about. This is therefore a step
towards transparency. It does not claim to provide complete
transparency on all contacts between outside proponents of particular
policies and Ministers or officials. If we were to do that, we would
find ourselves with a huge amount of information of the sort that the
NSA loves to collect for the United States, but might not be beneficial
to British politics. If we were to include all lobbyists, as some of
the answers to the consultation wished, and included all charity
lobbyists, I think that the answer from the charities sector would also
be very negative. However, charities do have lobbyists. For example,
Oxfam has people who actively lobby the public and the Government.
Therefore, we have to be a little careful over how universal one needs
to be. That is the importance of starting—perhaps others will
want to go further—with a register of consultant lobbyists and
of their major contact with the
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0003.htm#13102294000137">The
noble Lord, Lord Norton, suggested that we should start at the other
end by asking all officials and Ministers to register whom they have
met. I see no reason why. In a sense, as transparency develops, the two
come together. I have just filled in my quarterly return of whom I have
met, including a number of people who could be described as lobbyists.
Indeed, Saferworld was one of those that I reported on for obvious
reasons: as I represent the Foreign Office, I talk to Saferworld and
other such charities. That is part of what we already do.</hs_para>

down the list one should go and whether it should include special

turn.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0003.htm#13102294000139">I assure

these controls on campaigning that is not explicitly ‘party

terms of policies. For similar reasons, we do not think the rules
should exclude particular types of organisations, such as charities or
voluntary bodies, as this would create opportunities for political
campaigners to evade the rules and would reduce transparency. However,

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I was about to come to
precisely that distinction because it seems to me to be the nub
of what we will have to discuss when we deal with Part 2. There is a
line to be drawn between the promotion of policies and the promotion of
the success or defeat of particular parties or candidates. Policing the
line between informing and educating the public during a campaign,
promoting particular policies during a campaign and, on the other side
of the line, supporting or opposing particular candidates or parties
during a campaign, is the point on which we need to focus during
Committee and Report. I am concerned that this is not an easy line to
define. We want to make sure that there is as small a grey area as
possible. At the all-Peers meeting, the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, quoted a
leaflet which had been put round his constituency the day before he
lost an election which had a very large headline saying, “We are
not telling you who to vote for”, and then a lot of small print
which did. That is the sort of thing that we will have to look at in
detail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T21:41:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102294000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-0003.htm#13102294000150">This
measure is not aimed primarily at charities. Indeed, of the 30
organisations on the list, three are the campaigning non-charitable
associated bodies of charities, but none is a charity. Charities should
not be caught by this measure. After all, charities law limits how far
charities can become involved in partisan campaigning. Charities should
be involved in political campaigning. I recommend that noble Lords look
at the list to see how far we can come to an agreement on the
borderline. The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, talked
precisely about the borderline between current activities and
controlled activities, and the chilling effect of having an uncertain
definition of that. However, that is where we are. From the discussions
I have had with people over the past few weeks, I have the slight
impression that a large number of charities had not actually read the
Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act until this Bill was 
<?notus-xml column=991?>produced. Having looked at the language of that Act, a number of
charities are telling us that they are not happy with that language as
it stands. We have entered a discussion that we should perhaps have had
earlier. The Government started on the assumption that the language of
PPERA was fine because we

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> I hesitate to go into a definition of
politics as the noble Lord, Lord Norton, will immediately correct me.
The promotion of particular policies, particularly broad policy areas,
is a natural and accepted part of what charities and faith bodies do.
That is a normal part of civil society. Part of my puzzlement, in
listening to one or two of the speeches tonight, is that civil society
is itself broader than the charitable sector. There are campaigning
bodies in civil society which are not, and should not be, charities.
Charities promote particular ideas, developments and social objectives
which are also unavoidably political objectives, but they are not
necessarily partisan objectives. That again is the line that we need to
draw. I note that the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, said
that charities are already unhappy about PPERA. Having looked at it,
there are a number of difficult questions that we

concerned that there is insufficient public understanding when, for

this Bill and to remind the Committee that we have had the invaluable
help of Professor Elizabeth Cooke of the Law Commission, the law
commissioner who led on the initial Law Commission project. I am a
great supporter of the House using its powers in this area to get Law
Commission reports into law. There was a period when, for far too long,
they gathered dust on the shelves. The process that we have adopted
enables us to do some useful work. We are always very grateful to the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, for volunteering to chair
proceedings on these
Bills.</hs_para>

Trustees’ Powers Bill is a fairly short but technical Bill to
amend certain aspects of the law of England and Wales as it relates to
inheritance and trustees’ statutory powers. The fundamental
issue at the heart of much of the Bill—arrangements for
disposing of a person’s property after their death—is not
one that many of us relish engaging in. It brings unwelcome thoughts of
our own mortality. However, these issues must be faced by most of us in
some form during our lifetime.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:32:30"></hs_TimeCode> an ideal
world such arrangements would be set out in a will—and I repeat
that as the first message from this Committee: in an ideal world, the
most sensible thing that individuals can do is set out their intentions
in a will. However, we do not live in an ideal world. Many people, for
one reason or another, do not leave such a document. It is only right
that the law, in the form of the intestacy rules, makes appropriate and
fair provision for the disposal of their
property.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000005">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:33:02"></hs_TimeCode>

Bill will implement, with some modifications, the legislative reforms
recommended by the Law Commission in its 2011 report <I>Inheritance and
Family Provision Claims on Death</I>. The project that culminated in
that report was prompted by a 2005 government consultation on increases
to the statutory legacy. Responses to that consultation included calls
for a wider review of intestacy rules with almost all consultees
agreeing that such a review was necessary. The Law Commission was asked
to examine this area of the law and duly published a consultation paper
in 2009, followed by the report, which was accompanied by a draft Bill,
in 2011. The Ministry of Justice then carried out a public consultation
on the draft Bill earlier this year and then published a response in
July, explaining the changes it proposed to make to the Bill. This
extended and comprehensive consultation process has resulted in a
measure that I believe has broad support and is suitable for the Law
Commission procedure in your Lordships’ House.</hs_para>

aware that the Law Commission’s previous work in this area
included recommendations regarding rights for cohabiting couples on
intestacy. The Government decided that it would not be appropriate to
take these proposals forward in the Bill now before us. Indeed, the Law
Commission recognises that its work on cohabitation raised issues that
do not apply to the Bill. The issue of legal rights for cohabiting
couples is complex and potentially far-reaching. I believe that there
is already more than enough to occupy this House in the Bill as it
stands. In addition, the family justice system is already in the middle
of a comprehensive reform programme and I do not believe that it would
be wise to consider further reform in this area until that process is

first seven clauses of the Bill deal with two aspects of the law on
inheritance: the intestacy rules and family provision. The former
dictate the division of property when a person dies without leaving a
will. The latter permits certain family members and dependants to apply
to the court to vary the distribution of a deceased person’s
property, whether that is under the intestacy rules or the terms of a
valid will. The Bill will streamline and modernise the intestacy rules,
reducing the cost of administering intestate estates and bringing them
into line with public expectations. It will also correct some technical
deficiencies in the operation of the family provision
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000009">Clause
1 amends Section 46 of the Administration of Estates Act 1925 and, most
importantly, makes changes to the entitlement of a surviving spouse or
civil partner of a person who dies intestate. The Bill proposes that in
a situation where the intestate leaves no children or other direct
descendants, the surviving spouse or civil partner will be the sole
beneficiary of the estate. This changes the current law under which a
surviving parent or full sibling or sibling’s issue is entitled
to share whatever is left in the estate after the spouse or civil
partner has received the deceased person’s chattels and what is
commonly called the “statutory legacy”—in this
case, the first £450,000 of the estate. This brings this part of
the intestacy rules into line with public expectations. Empirical
research has shown that the majority of people favour giving priority
to a surviving spouse.</hs_para>

that where the intestate does leave children or other descendants, the
surviving spouse or civil partner is absolutely entitled to the
deceased’s personal chattels, a statutory legacy of
£250,000 and half of whatever remains of the estate. The other
half of the remainder will be shared between the children and other
descendants. Under the current law, a surviving spouse or civil partner
is only entitled to a life interest in his or her half of the remaining
estate. Life interest trusts can be a source of confusion and cost,
often for only marginal gain, and the Bill removes
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:38:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000011">Finally,
Clause 1 makes several technical changes to the rate of interest which
accrues from the date of death of the intestate on the statutory
legacy. Clause 1 simplifies the sharing of assets on intestacy in a way
that is fair to those who have been closest to the deceased: the
surviving spouse or civil partner and any children or their children.
Our aim here is to ensure that spouses and civil partners are
appropriately provided for. By focusing solely on those closest to the
deceased, we aim to simplify the current law on intestacy so that it
can better reflect the arrangements that an individual is likely to
have made had he or she executed a valid
will.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000012">It is
impossible to design intestacy rules which satisfy every view of what
is right or fair. The rules stand as a legal default position. They
should reflect the shape of contemporary society and replicate what
most people think is an appropriate division between family members.
The changes in the Bill are intended to reflect real-life expectations
of what provisions the intestacy rules should
make<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:39:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000013">Clause
2 and Schedule 1 make a number of changes to the way in which the
statutory legacy, or fixed net sum as it is more properly called, is
determined. Under the Bill, this sum is, of course, the amount to which
a surviving spouse or civil partner will be entitled where the
intestate deceased has also left children or other descendants. The
most important of these changes impose a new requirement on the Lord
Chancellor. At present, the Lord Chancellor has the power to set the
level of the statutory legacy but is under no obligation to do so or to
keep the level under review. The Bill proposes to change this state of
affairs by requiring the Lord Chancellor to make an order setting the
level of the statutory legacy at least every five years. As to the
actual level to be set, the Bill provides that, unless the Lord
Chancellor determines otherwise, the level should be set according to a
procedure specified in legislation. The procedure will index link the
statutory legacy by increasing it by an amount that reflects any
increase in the consumer prices index measure of economic inflation.
The legacy can therefore only increase; in the event of no inflation or
deflation, the level of the legacy will not change.</hs_para>

Lord Chancellor to set the level of the statutory legacy without using
this index-linking mechanism such that he is at liberty to set a level
that is equal to or even lower than the pre-existing figure. However,
in such circumstances, he will be required to report to Parliament to
explain why the mechanism has not been used. These provisions create a
legislative framework that will govern the level of
the  
<?notus-xml column=338?>statutory legacy and will ensure that it does not slip behind inflation
and lose its real-world value. The changes will benefit surviving
spouses and civil partners.</hs_para>

statutory definition of personal chattels. Under the current law on
intestacy, a surviving spouse or civil partner is entitled to all the
deceased’s personal chattels that are not otherwise disposed of
under a will. The Bill does not change that but it does propose to
amend and update how these chattels are defined. Personal chattels are
defined in the Bill as “tangible movable property”,
replacing an anachronistic and arbitrary list of property and
categories of property in the current law. The Bill also includes three
defined exceptions to this
definition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000016">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:42:42"></hs_TimeCode>
first is money and securities for money. This is not new. The second
exception is for property used, at the death of the
intestate,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13102265000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000067">“solely

words “solely or mainly” are new and will ensure that
property—for example, a vehicle such as a van that was regularly
used in the course of a business—would be excluded from the
definition. The third exception is wholly new and relates to property
which is held, at the death of the intestate, solely as an investment.
This is a narrow exception that would only apply to property owned as
an investment and which had no personal use whatever. For example,
valuable jewellery which was worn by an individual, even if only
occasionally, would still qualify as a personal chattel and would pass
to the surviving spouse or civil partner, even if it was also bought
and kept in the expectation that its value would increase.</hs_parafo>

3 provides that where personal chattels are referred to in a will or a
codicil to a will, the current pre-Bill definition of personal chattels
will be used if the will itself is executed before Clause 3 comes into
force. This will be the case even where a codicil is made after the
date that Clause 3 takes effect. However, it is also still open to the
person making the will or codicil to expressly state that the new
definition of personal chattels should apply.</hs_para>

protect the position of children who are adopted after the death of a
parent. The general rule in these matters is that after adoption, a
child is regarded as the legal child of the adoptive parents and has no
other legal parents. However, Clause 4 ensures that a child whose
parent has already died before the adoption takes place will not lose,
as a result of adoption, a contingent interest that he or she already
holds in the estate of the deceased parent. This provision is relevant
where a child is adopted, perhaps by other members of his or her
family, as a result of the birth parents’ death. Adoption in
these circumstances is typically open, involving no secrecy. The child
has been tragically orphaned, and an aunt, uncle or other relative
adopts the child. No one intended, in that situation, that the orphaned
child should lose his parents’ estate; yet that is what will
happen in cases where inheritance—as a matter of sensible estate
planning—is contingent on the child reaching a particular
age.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000019">It is
important to note that this provision affects only children who are
adopted after the death of a birth parent. I believe that this is an
important distinction 
<?notus-xml column=339?>and it is right that the law preserves the rights of children who, at
the date of the adoption, already hold a contingent interest in the
estate of their birth parents. The law already preserves vested
interests held by a child at the point of adoption and ensures that
those interests are not lost. Clause 4 simply adds contingent interests
into that existing provision. It is wrong that the law can strip away a
child’s inheritance simply because she has been adopted. Clause
4 will correct that
injustice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000020">Clause
5 proposes to disapply Section 18(2) of the Family Law Reform Act 1987
in certain circumstances. This section provides that where a person
dies intestate and his parents were not married to each other at the
time of his birth, the administrators of his estate may presume that he
was predeceased by his father and any other person to whom he may be
related only by virtue of his father. In the case of a person who has a
female parent other than his mother as a result of Section 43 of the
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008, his administrators may
presume that he was not survived by this second female parent or by
anyone related to him through this parent. This is a pragmatic rule
which derives from a time when it was common for the identity of the
father of a child born out of marriage to be unknown. Tracking such
parents down could present real difficulties to those administering
intestate estates. The rule discriminates against unmarried fathers
and, in practice, can make it less likely that the deceased’s
estate will pass under the intestacy rules to such a parent. Nowadays,
it is quite usual for both unmarried parents to be identified as such,
and the practical justification for the rule is much
reduced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000021">Clause
5 disapplies this presumption if a person is recorded as the
intestate’s father or as a parent other than his mother in a
specified formal register of births. In such a case, the
estate’s administrators will have the same responsibility to the
deceased’s father or other parent as they would to any other
relative entitled under the intestacy rules. This amendment clarifies
that where such a parent has been formally acknowledged as such,
irrespective of the absence of a marriage certificate, that parent
should, in general, have the same rights as his married
counterpart.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000022">Clause
6 amends various provisions in the Inheritance (Provision for Family
and Dependants) Act 1975 by way of Schedule 2. Noble Lords will know
that it was formerly the Government’s intention to create an
additional ground of jurisdiction for family provision claims in this
Bill. This was to enable claimants who were habitually resident in
England and Wales to bring such a claim, regardless of the
deceased’s place of domicile. Scottish Government colleagues
have raised significant concerns about how this additional ground would
operate in practice, particularly its potential to displace Scots law
to the possible detriment of those who had inheritance rights under
that law. We have carefully considered these concerns from our
colleagues across the border. I do not now believe that it is possible
to engineer a compromise on this point that would answer these concerns
and retain the benefits of our original proposal. I am also aware that
there has been a previous lack of consensus on the nature of the
additional ground of jurisdiction—the relevant
provision  
<?notus-xml column=340?>is at variance with both the Law Commission’s original proposal
and the majority view expressed in response to the Government’s
public consultation.</hs_para>

intention is to bring forward an amendment to the Bill prior to
consideration by the Public Bill Committee which will delete the
additional ground of jurisdiction in its entirety. I hope that, by
doing so, parliamentary consideration can be better focused on the
Bill’s other, equally important and worthwhile
provisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000024">The
first of the remaining changes to the procedure for family provision
claims is to extend one of the categories of person who can apply to
the court for adequate provision from a deceased’s estate,
whether distributed by will or intestacy. We wish to clarify that a
“child of the family”—not a biological or adopted
child, but a person who was treated as such—should now be
understood by reference to any family in which the deceased had a
parental role. Such a family need consist only of the deceased and the
potential applicant. Currently, such an individual could bring a family
provision claim only if they could prove themselves to be a child of
the family in relation to the deceased’s marriage or civil
partnership. This provision reflects the Bill’s attempts to
modernise the law of succession to better reflect the realities of
modern family life, and ensures that a claim by a deserving child will
no longer be barred simply on the basis of the status of his or her
parents.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000025">Clause
6 also amends the wording of the 1975 Act, which defines a person who
may make a family provision claim because they are considered to be a
dependant of the deceased. The interpretation of the current law
requires that when deciding such status, the court must balance the
deceased’s contribution towards the applicant’s needs
against any benefits flowing the other way. If the applicant is found
to have contributed more to the deceased than vice versa, the applicant
cannot be deemed to be a dependant. The Bill proposes to remove the
“balance sheet test” while preserving the other, fairly
strict requirements imposed on a person applying for family provision
as a dependant. This reflects the important understanding that
“dependency” can be mutual, and its benefits need not
all, or largely, flow one
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000026">The
remainder of Clause 6 makes a number of fairly technical changes to the
procedure for family provision claims. I do not propose to set these
out individually, but they include changes to arrangements governing a
court’s power to make an order following a successful claim and
changes to the way in which the net estate of the deceased is
calculated. These changes, though technical in nature, have a
significant practical effect and form part of a package of changes
designed to modernise and generally improve the current arrangements
for family provision
claims.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000027">Clause
7 makes various amendments to provisions which require certain types of
grant to be left out of account when one is determining the date when
representation with respect to estate of a deceased person was first
taken out. These are important  changes, but technical, and
they will be relevant in  
<?notus-xml column=341?>only a minority of cases. Again, I do not propose to go through each in
detail. There is some uncertainty under the current law as to which
grants start time running for these purposes and others and
which  do not. Clause 7, by way of Schedule 3, aims to 
clarify these uncertainties by replacing all the current 
provisions in this area with provisions that clearly and
comprehensively set out which grants start time running and which do
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000028">Clauses 8
to 10 deal with trustees’ powers. Clause 8 concerns a situation
where a trustee is able to use income from a trust for the maintenance,
education or benefit of a beneficiary who is under 18. The Bill
proposes that the amount of income that can be used for such purposes
should be a matter entirely for the trustees’ discretion.
Currently, an objective test of reasonableness is applied, together
with a proviso listing factors that the trustees must
consider—for example, a beneficiary’s age—and a
specific restriction on the amount that can be paid out. These
requirements are not necessary. They are sterile technical burdens and
are commonly written out when trusts are professionally drafted. Clause
8 removes them. Given that the trustees must still comply with their
fiduciary duties, the reform presents no threat to the interests of
beneficiaries. It is right that trustees should in future be able to
exercise their discretion flexibly and free from unnecessary
restrictions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000029">Clause
9 deals with a similar situation in which trustees are able to use
their power of advancement to make payments of capital to beneficiaries
where this is thought necessary. Currently, such payments are limited
to one-half of a beneficiary’s future share. The Bill removes
this limit so that trustees could, if they think fit, pay out the whole
of a beneficiary’s share under this power of advancement. This
gives the trustees the flexibility that they would almost certainly be
given if they were acting under a professionally drafted will or trust.
It has no effect on their fiduciary duty to act in a
beneficiary’s best interest, which is imposed by the general
law. However, any such payments may still not amount to more than that
beneficiary’s future share. Clause 10 sets out, in some detail,
transitional arrangements for Clauses 8 and
9.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000030">That
concludes my brief description of the substantive provisions of the
Bill. The Bill will modernise and simplify the law in a number of areas

that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000031">Finally,

Henley (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord
McNally for introducing the Bill in such a comprehensive manner. In my
innocence, I thought that this was a relatively simple Bill that was
not going to cause us too many problems. However, I was naive in that
approach, and I suspect that when we get into proper Committee, Report
and the other stages of the Bill under the Law Commission Bill
procedure,<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:58:18"></hs_TimeCode> we
might have to spend slightly more time on it than I originally
thought.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102281000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000002">I
also thank my noble friend for arranging our meeting last week with
Professor Cooke and the Law Commission, which was very useful. It
helped us to get some understanding of the Bill and explained to us
some of the problems. However, having listened to my noble
friend’s opening speech, I wonder if we did not spend quite as
much time on it as perhaps we should have.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102281000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000003">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:59:50"></hs_TimeCode>
important point, as my noble friend made clear, is that the Bill deals
largely with intestacy. He said, “In an ideal world, such
arrangements would be set out in a will”. I would remind the
Committee of what I am told is a convention among Quakers. Once a year
they say to each other not just, “Have you got a will?”,
but, “Have you got an up-to-date will?”. There is no
point in having a will if that will no longer reflects your views.
Similarly, it is a fairly bad thing if you do not have a will at all.
So we all want to see people taking the trouble to make sure that they
have a will so that large parts of the Bill need not come into effect,
other than those parts that refer to looking after dependants who quite
rightly should be allowed to get something if the will has excluded
them.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102281000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000004">I am
very grateful, as well as for that remark from the Quakers, for a
quotation sent to me by the Law Commission. It is from Cato the Elder,
as quoted by Plutarch. I am going to give it in English, not in
Latin—the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, can probably translate it
back. He
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13102281000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000054">“And
as for repentance, he said he had indulged in it but thrice in his
whole life: once when he entrusted a secret to his wife; once when he
paid a ship’s fare to a place instead of walking thither; and
once when he remained intestate a whole
day”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13102281000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000005">I
think that it is important that everyone remembers the importance of
making a will and making sure that that will is kept up to date, and
for that I am grateful to my noble
friend<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:00:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13102281000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000006">As
one who believes in property and the freedom of testation,
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:55:00"></hs_TimeCode> am also
grateful to my noble friend for covering another matter at the meeting
that we had last week, and that is the fact that, other than that it
makes provision for dependants, the Bill does not impinge at all on
that freedom of testation. Obviously there has to be some protection
for individuals, for partners, spouses and others, but I still believe
that it is right that everyone should have the right, subject to what
they own and whether there are trusts and others, to leave their
property as and how they wish; whether it be to the cats’ home,
to a political party or to their own children or whatever. I make that
point because I think that it is important that we all remember that
freedom of testation is a very important part of everything that we
believe in in this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:01:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

die intestate and therefore there is a necessity for rules in this
area. It is a long time since I did my Bar exams and I cannot remember
what the precise rules were, but having looked through the Bill, it
seems to make a pretty good fist of allocating those resources on the
occasions when there is a spouse or a spouse and dependants. However,
there is something that I cannot quite see. The first question I want
to put to my noble friend—again, I am grateful for the diagram
that he provided at last week’s meeting which set out the rules
before and after reform—is whether I am right in thinking that
for those estates where there is no surviving spouse or children, the
rules continue as they were. I cannot remember the precise details of
these, but those who are more learned in law will no doubt be able to
advise us. So my first question concerns intestate estates where there
is a surviving spouse, civil partner or
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:03:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102281000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000008">My
second question relates to the fixed net sum, as set out in Clause 1.
There seems to be an indication that this is going to be set at around
£450,000, that the Lord Chancellor will have the power to amend
it and that he will have to look at it at least every five years.
However, I think that we would all be very grateful if my noble friend
could say a bit more about the thinking behind that sum—how they
selected it and what they think is likely to happen in the future.
Having said that, I would be grateful for some statistics on how many
intestate estates have more than £450,000 in the bag. I suspect
that it is a pretty small number, because I think that most people who
have assets of that sort will have taken the trouble to take some
advice. I might be wrong in that, but I would grateful to know from my
noble friend just what the statistics
say.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102281000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000009">The third
question I want to put to my noble friend relates to the changing
definition of chattels. I listened very carefully to what he said about
jewellery and whether it was something that had been, say, worn by the
spouse and was therefore part of her property rather than some other
asset. I have some small personal experience of this and have to say
that I see trouble ahead. It is an issue that might be worth exploring
in greater detail on a later
occasion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:05:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

want to be relatively brief in this—is about procedure. I
understand that this is the fifth or sixth Law Commission Bill that we
have had since the procedure was agreed, and I think that most noble
Lords will agree that it has worked pretty well. I remember being
involved in the first one that we ever had; it was of such a technical
nature that I do not think I understood a word of it from beginning to
end, but there were wiser people than me in the Room on that occasion.
All I want is an assurance from the Government that they will ensure
that this procedure is used only for uncontroversial Bills of the sort
that are appropriate, as set out by the Procedure Committee. This is an
area where we do not want to see any drift or growth in how these
matters
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:06:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102281000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000011">I
hope that I have been appropriately brief. There are a number of
questions for my noble friend and I look forward to later stages of the

Wills (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate the Minister
on his magisterial introduction to the Bill, which I welcome. I also
congratulate the Law Commission on the quality of its work, which laid
the foundations for the Bill. I am delighted to see this procedure in
place for ensuring that Law Commission reports do not, as the noble
Lord, Lord McNally, said, gather dust on the shelves. As a Minister in
the previous Government, I was responsible for putting in place this
long-overdue reform of process. It is good to see it working so well
and to see all the excellent work that is done by the Law Commission,
in this area as in many others, being given practical effect in this
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:07:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000033">The

that work and behind the Bill lies the imperative of ensuring an
equitable distribution of the estate of the deceased. Underpinning that
must be the need for such distribution to reflect, as far as possible,
the wishes of the deceased. Society must strive to protect the delivery
of such wishes—it is a debt that each generation owes its
predecessors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:07:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13102265000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000034">The
changing nature of modern families has created a situation where such
protections can be illegitimately thwarted. The Bill offers a rare
legislative opportunity to mitigate such mischief. That mischief can
arise, in particular, in the case of vulnerable, lonely and elderly
people, where an enduring or lasting power of attorney has been granted
and the attorney abuses their powers to plunder the assets over which
they have power. The official line of defence against such abuse is the
Office of the Public Guardian but informal lines of defence are also
provided by family and friends and by those who might legitimately
expect to be beneficiaries of the estate in due
course.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000035">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:08:51"></hs_TimeCode>,
these defences can be of little value in the cases—which are,
sadly, increasingly common—of vulnerable elderly people without
close family or friends to monitor their situation. It is impossible to
know how prevalent a problem this is because it is, by its nature,
often concealed. However, because it is concealed, the Office of the
Public Guardian can often do nothing about such abuse. Even when it
does come to light, it is often after the death of the person
concerned, and the Office of the Public Guardian has no jurisdiction
after
death.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000036">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:09:29"></hs_TimeCode>
mischief can also arise even when no power of attorney has been granted
but when there is fiduciary relationship. The problems here can extend
beyond the obvious one where the person drawing up the will becomes a
beneficiary of
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000037">For
example—and I set out this example solely to illustrate the
nature of the problem—an elderly person, perhaps in a care home,
asks for advice on making a will and the care home refers them to a
local solicitor. In drawing up the will, the solicitor and the elderly
person strike up a close relationship. The solicitor begins to pay
regular visits to discuss the will and other matters. The solicitor
might, quite properly, point out that they need to charge for the
visit, and the elderly person, glad of the company, is glad to agree. 
<?notus-xml column=345?>However, the elderly person may not be aware that the solicitor is
visiting far more often than could be justified professionally and
that, instead of charging a normal hourly fee, they might be charging
double that and then paying themselves those fees out of the estate
that they are
administering<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:10:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000038">It
might be argued—and I think that the noble Lord, Lord Henley,
would agree with me on this given what he has just said—that if
an elderly person wishes to spend their money on company from a
solicitor or anyone else, the state has no right to interfere with that
wish. That is an area where the state should not trespass. However,
disproportionate charges for that solicitor’s visits and a
disproportionate number of visits might, unknown to that elderly
person, exhaust the estate and deprive the beneficiaries, who will
often be charities, of the legacy that the testator wished them to
have. If that had been fully explained to that elderly person, they
might well have decided not to have quite so much company from the
solicitor.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000039">If
the situation is not made clear and there is a breach of fiduciary
duty, there appears to be very little remedy in practice. Again, this
is by its nature often a concealed mischief and will rarely come to
light. In this situation, the beneficiaries of the will, who might be
expected to take a close interest in the administration of their future
inheritance, are charities and will not necessarily be aware of the
will.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000040">The
Solicitors Regulation Authority operates, understandably and
prudentially enough, on a risk basis. It investigates only after a
number of complaints, and the nature of this mischief means that a
significant number of complaints are unlikely to emerge. It therefore
seems that professionals—this will usually be solicitors but not
necessarily exclusively so; it might involve others such as accountants
and doctors—can operate to milk the estates of elderly, lonely
and vulnerable people with a high probability of
impunity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000041">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:12:11"></hs_TimeCode>

serious overcharging by solicitors acting in a representative capacity
such as executor of an estate (but also under powers of attorney)
continue to pose a high risk. The numbers of reports to the SRA of
possible irregularity in probate cases increased from 6 in 2004, to 31
in 2005, 52 in 2006 and 65 in 2007. This problem is particularly
insidious because it can take place over many years without detection.
Beneficiaries, especially charities, are unaware that their money has
been stolen. Sometimes solicitors or their employees take a long-term
view by drafting wills to enable them to steal money from estates in
later
years”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13102265000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000042">It
is therefore clear that
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:13:06"></hs_TimeCode> problem has
come across the radar of the SRA. The numbers are not great, but they
may be only the tip of an iceberg. The problem is compounded by the
fact that, as I understand it, if an estate is of nil value, it does
not have to be published. A sufficiently calculating solicitor or other
person in a position to do so can then time the plundering of the
estate to such an extent that it is exhausted by the time of death.
Therefore, there is no public record of the depletion of the estate. In
the circumstances that I have described, there will be no close family
or friends to be beneficiaries who might question the exhaustion of the
estate. The charities, which are often the beneficiaries in these
circumstances and which, as I understand it, 
<?notus-xml column=346?>scrutinise published wills to check out their legacies, will have
nothing to scrutinise. Such a lack of transparency fosters a culture of
impunity which can only encourage the plundering of estates of the
elderly and vulnerable by those who are malignly intentioned and are in
a position to do
so.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13102265000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000043">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:14:11"></hs_TimeCode>
is clearly a problem here, and the Bill offers  a rare
legislative opportunity to tackle it, although I fully accept that the
main thrust of the Bill is in a completely different area from the one
that I have just described. Before the Minister decides to tell me that
I may be straying too far off course here, I should say that I have
sought advice from the clerks on the amendment that I intend to put
down and they have advised me that what I have in mind is
admissible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102265000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102265000044">Of
course, no legislation can ever guarantee to remove any mischief
completely, but it can often mitigate its incidence and its extent. I
believe that greater transparency can do just that in this case. I tell
the Minister now that I intend to put down an amendment in Committee to
promote such transparency. I am very happy to share this with the
Minister and his officials in advance in the hope that all their
greater experience, wisdom and judgment can improve my amendment and
make faster and securer progress towards tackling a problem that I hope
we can all agree should be
tackled.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_22_PT_1/D9FB55FB422914D94E765FA10E923AE07DBB98A6" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 October 2013">Tuesday,

Claims on Death</I>.</hs_para>

welcome is the improvement of the position of spouses and civil
partners as compared with the position of remoter relatives. It is
entirely right that where a deceased leaves a spouse or civil partner
but no children, the spouse or civil partner should take the entire
estate. It is also right that where there are surviving children as
well as a surviving spouse or civil partner, then that survivor should
take not just the statutory legacy absolutely but also his or her half
of the residue absolutely. The complication and the capacity for
encouraging disputes that was inherent in the existing arrangement,
whereby the survivor’s half interest was held on a life interest
only, should be done away with. I believe that these and other changes
in the Bill chime with contemporary views of family life. They also
accord more readily than do the present arrangements with the economic
realities of dependency. These changes will help avoid the difficulty,
the expense and the time involved in bringing claims for family
provision under the 1975 Act as

the case of family provision, my noble friend has stated that the
Government intend to abandon the provisions presently in the Bill to
reform the domicile threshold for bringing a family provision claim.
Families and family wealth are increasingly international, and not only
among the wealthy. I would suggest that there are cases where claims
against the estate of non-domiciled deceased persons ought to be
capable of being brought. 
<?notus-xml column=347?>It may be that habitual residence of a potential claimant is not an
appropriate test for the reasons of Scots law and practice that my
noble friend gave. But in this respect, as he reminded us, the
provisions in the Bill differ from the Law Commission’s original
proposals. The Law Commission report recommended that the existence of
real property in England and Wales, or property to which domestic
succession law applied, should be the alternative threshold condition
apart from domicile of the deceased, whereas, as my noble friend has
said, the Bill in its present form would have established habitual
residence of the potential claimant as the alternative threshold
condition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:18:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

wonder whether the existence of real property here, or property to
which domestic succession law applies, should, as the Law Commission

implements only one part of the recommendations of the Law
Commission’s 2011 report. As my noble friend also pointed out in
his introduction, the other part comprised its recommendations for
provision for cohabitants to take under the intestacy rules after five
years’ cohabitation, or two years if the cohabitants had
children living with them. Those proposals were incorporated in a

in the previous Session in an attempt to secure the implementation of
these recommendations relating to cohabitation. That Bill fell for lack

fate of those provisions is not my only concern in this area. The Law
Commission in 2007 produced a lengthy and detailed report entitled,

Lord Lester of Herne Hill introduced a Private Member’s Bill in
2008 which would have introduced reforms which were not the same as but

they announced the same day by Written Ministerial Statement that there
would be no action taken by the Government in this Parliament to
implement the Law Commission’s proposals. Those proposals on
financial relief on relationship breakdown are now the central part of

more and more cohabiting couples in England and Wales—nearly 6
million people now cohabit in the United Kingdom—go without the
legal protections on breakdown or death that the Law Commission has
firmly recommended that they should have. This is against the
background of widespread public confusion about the position in law of
people who choose to cohabit. In a British Social Attitudes survey in
2006, no less than 58% of respondents thought that cohabiting couples
who split up were probably or definitely in the same position as
married couples. The myth of the common law marriage is widespread, but
it is just that, as your Lordships know: a myth without any foundation

Commission for law reform should not have to be the stuff of party
politics. I do not disagree with my noble friend Lord Henley that this
fast-track procedure should not be available for every controversial
proposal of the commission, but that does not mean that the proposal
should not be brought before Parliament to be debated in the usual way.

the protocol set out in the Law Commission Act 2009, agreed between
government and the commission, the Lord Chancellor is under a duty to
report annually to Parliament on progress in implementing Law

and indicate a high duty in this area. The progress on cohabitation
reform suggests that such a duty has not been taken sufficiently
seriously to date. The Bill is welcome but does not go far enough. One
is left with an uncomfortable sense that we are implementing the easy

amendments to legislation some of which goes back as far as 1925. They
seek to correct shortcomings in existing legislation that have
appeared. I was prompted to take an interest in the Bill by my
recollection of a family incident some years ago. Our solicitors
suddenly produced a number of short documents for each of us, including
uncles, aunts and the rest, to sign. My immediate response to all this
was, “Why the devil should we sign them?”. So the
solicitors came back to me and I was told that if certain highly
unlikely but entirely possible happenings took place concerning
intestacy—including sudden unexpected deaths and so
on—the intentions of our wills or trusts would not fulfilled.
Having been told that, I did not go into the matter any
further—I just told everyone to sign as quickly as possible.
Presumably all is well and, anyway, I do not think that there were any
sudden deaths or whatever in the family.</hs_para>

Hamwee (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I had friends—not
Quakers—whose favourite activity of a long winter’s
night, when we were all students and young lawyers in practice, was to
make and remake their wills. I do not know whether they filled in the
odd half an hour with the odd codicil as well. Many of us, like them,
at some point in middle age, go from, “I am immortal” to,
“I cannot face thinking about it”. It is no surprise that
the Nuffield study used by the Law Commission reported that family
circumstances and the wish to avoid family arguments, as well as having
assets, is the prompt to make a will. I say “assets”
rather than “wealth” because there is also awareness,
particularly of the cost of housing and the positions of one’s
children and
grandchildren<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:31:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102281000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000016">I
was fascinated by some of the information at the back of the Law
Commission report. I have to say that when I picked it up last night I
thought, be careful what you wish for. The jump in the number of
intestacies in the three years in the middle of the 2000s—or, as
the Law Commission explains, probably deaths five years previously,
when the grant was in those years—is very puzzling. The report
is impressively thorough; one would expect no
less.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102281000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000017">Many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:33:17"></hs_TimeCode>
people think that the law must automatically reflect what they perceive
to be sensible and right, but, as other noble Lords have already said
this afternoon, what you think is right may not coincide with what I
think is right. I was taken by the emphasis the Law Commission put, and
which the Minister has analysed and repeated, on rules, without
affecting freedom of personal decision. The aim of bringing the law
into line with needs and expectations reflects exactly what the law
should do, but there are, as has been explored, new forms of family and
some very complex permutations, given sequential marriages,
step-relationships and so on. I could tell from the Minister’s
speech that that is well recognised. I knew that with my noble friend
Lord Marks taking part in the debate there would be no need for me to
linger on the issue of cohabitation, but I agree with him on the
complexity and importance of international aspects

was particularly interested in the provisions for adopted children who
are part of a new family. I was lucky enough to take part in the recent
work of the Select Committee looking at adoption legislation. It
highlighted for us the importance to many adopted young people of their
sibling relationships and of the maintenance of contact with their
birth siblings. The issue of different rights in the case of children
of deceased birth parents, where some interests are vested and some are
contingent, had not occurred to me, but I realise that it must be very
difficult, both for adopters and for adoption agencies, to handle this
issue. I suspect it may also be pretty difficult if adopters who have a
child whose interests are contingent have children 
<?notus-xml column=351?>who have significantly less wealth than their adoptive sibling but, as
the Minister said, this is typically a very open arrangement.</hs_para>

provisions about maintenance and advancement seem eminently sensible.
Given what applies to which trusts created when, I did wonder whether
this might be some sort of job creation scheme for lawyers, who will
all be advising their clients to make new wills. However, in defence of
the profession, I did not recognise the scenario painted by the noble
Lord, Lord Wills, although I accept there are bad apples in every
profession. I did have a parallel thought in that I object to the
market that the banks have created in wills and probate. The noble
Lord, Lord Beecham, is nodding. It is a good thing that they are not as
creative in their timing as the noble Lord, Lord Wills, has suggested
is possible. I would be intrigued to see his solution to this. It is in
the interest of solicitors—I am a solicitor, despite not having
practised for some time—as well as of clients that there is
simplicity. Dealing with a client at war with his family after a death
in that family is stressful for everyone, including the solicitor. Some

will be points to probe in Committee. Along with the noble Lord, Lord
Henley, I wondered about assets which are classed as investments if
they are only narrowly investments. I was thinking about works of
art—what a pity if they cannot be enjoyed as well as being
investments. I know people who collect works of art who justify it to
themselves as being an investment, but a lot of people enjoy seeing the
works on their walls. I have not thought this through but I wonder
whether there is any interaction here with the inheritance tax
provisions, which are different for personal assets and for the assets
of a trade or business. That comes from having been a partner in a firm

inception<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:42:51"></hs_TimeCode>. In
the old days, Acts of Parliament were sometimes named after the person
who had drafted them; Lord Tenterden’s Act comes to mind. I
would like to think that at some time in the future this Act might
become known as Baroness Cooke’s—I say Baroness; she is
not a Baroness yet—or Professor Cooke’s Act. This is an
admirable report; it is very well set out, very clear and ideally
suited for this procedure. I hope that it will find favour with the

Beecham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I join other noble Lords in
thanking the Minister for the clarity with which he went through this
very technical Bill. He has made it comprehensible, I think, to all who
have heard him address these issues today. Before we began
today’s debate, the noble Lord, Lord Henley, inquired whether I
had any more Dickensian quotations—we tend to bandy them across
the Chamber at one another. I confess that I have not come up with
anything, except perhaps to note that this is after all a Bill about
expectations great and modest.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102281000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000030">The noble Lord also
said that he was pleased that the Bill did not interfere with the
freedom of testation, which of course it does not. It is perhaps worth
reminding your Lordships that the Inheritance (Provision for Family and
Dependants) Act allows for applications to be made in respect of an
estate where a dependant feels that his or her interests have not been
adequately reflected in the will that has been made or, indeed, under
an intestacy. However, this measure does not deal with that particular
set of events.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102281000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000031">The noble Lord inquired
into the numbers involved. The impact analysis of the Bill refers to
there being something like 1,045 estates valued at £450,000 or
more; that was the figure he was looking at, which currently applies
for cases where there is no surviving spouse. However, although there
are 1,000 such estates or thereabouts, the estimate is that only 5% to
10% of those are intestate estates. We are therefore dealing with
pretty modest numbers, although they are obviously significant to
anyone involved with one of those estates.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102281000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000032">I have to congratulate
my noble friend Lord Wills again on the ingenuity with which he manages
to bring into legislative debates matters about which he is
particularly concerned. I am tempted to throw in a slightly Dickensian
reference to King Charles’s head, but will not pursue that at
any length because, of course, he raises a legitimate and interesting
point, which we will no doubt have the opportunity of debating further.
However, when it comes to exploitation of vulnerable people or
misconduct by any adviser—be it a solicitor, bank or anyone else
whose responsibility clearly ought to be to act in the interests of
those to whom an estate has been left—the numbers are again
pretty small. The noble Lord mentioned 65 cases. There are 240,000
grants of representation every year; that figure appears in the
commission’s report. It is a minuscule proportion, but of course
any one case is too many. Not far from where I used to practise in
Newcastle—I declare my interest as a now-unpaid consultant in a
firm in which I was formerly senior partner—there was a serious
case where, I recollect,  a £90,000 bill was levied on a
£100,000 estate by a solicitor who was, of course, subsequently
struck off and also visited with criminal sanctions. I think the office
where he carried out this misfeasance remains to this day unlet and
unoccupied. That is not to say that my noble friend is not right to
raise the issue. It will be interesting to see what proposals he has to
make  about it.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102281000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000033">The noble Lord, Lord
Marks, made some interesting points. He referred to the fact that
dealing with the issue of cohabitees is to be Liberal Democrat policy, 
<?notus-xml column=354?>which must of course give great heart to cohabitees, bearing in mind
what happened to things like student loans and nuclear power.
Nevertheless, hope springs eternal in a Lib Dem’s breast. We
might see some action—possibly—along those lines. I share
the noble Lord’s concern about cohabitation. The commission
argues a strong case for dealing with what is now a growing
number—the noble Lord referred to 6 million although I think the
documentation suggests 7.5 million —of people, about 15%
of families, living in that state. I am not sure why the Government
choose not to proceed—not necessarily in this Bill but in this
Parliament—on a matter which I would have thought would command
support. The consultation responses to the commission’s report
were fairly limited. Although I recall there were some in the part
about cohabitation, they were a relative handful.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102281000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000034">If I have a confession
to make, it is that I did not quite struggle through the entirety of
the Law Commission’s report, but did look particularly at the
section on cohabitation—which, appropriately enough, comprises
about 15% of the report. There were obviously those with particular
religious views who were concerned about the cohabitation proposal but
there did not seem to be great hostility beyond that. I would have
hoped that the Government would look more sympathetically at that. It
need not be in this Bill but they could, at least, pursue further
consultation with a view to bringing forward legislation, whichever
Government assumes office after the next election.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102281000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000035">I agree with the noble
Lord on that issue but am not entirely convinced about his references
to the desirability of the half-share—which, under present
circumstances, may be held on a life interest—becoming absolute.
In many cases that would be absolutely appropriate, but it might be a
bit hard in a situation where the total estate is not that much more
than the statutory amount of £250,000 but where there are
children, particularly if they are from a first marriage or civil
partnership, for example. Such children might see their inheritance
reduced effectively to a quarter of the estate; whereas ultimately,
under the existing framework, it could be a half. If there is a lot of
money, that is less relevant, but if it is a relatively modest estate
there might be some potential hardship to children, particularly in the
case of a second marriage or second civil partnership. Having said
that, I suppose that it is always possible to revisit these matters in
due course, but it would be interesting to see how that plays
out.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102281000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000036">Two
other matters occurred to me. The first comes from the left field, as
it were, and relates to the position where a testator or intestate with
English domicile had two wives. That may be the case if someone of a
certain religion had come from a country where it was possible to have
more than one spouse. I am not sure what the current situation is, let
alone how that would apply in these circumstances. I do not know
whether the Minister, his colleague or those behind him can advise
about that. It is not going to be a huge issue but it might be an
issue.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102281000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000037">I
mentioned the second issue—the potential impact when a joint
tenancy is part of the family’s assets—at the meeting
that the Minister helpfully organised. A joint tenancy is one in which
there is an undivided 
<?notus-xml column=355?>share of property. A husband and wife, or any two people, hold the
property, which automatically passes on death to the other. It is
not included in the estate and is not therefore
taken into account under the present arrangements. That is as opposed
to a tenancy in common, where you have a distinct share that can be
left by will or would pass under the intestacy rules. I suppose it is
possible that the inheritance family provision legislation could apply
in that context; someone may feel that they have been significantly
bypassed and could make an application. I do not know what the
prospects of success for such an application would be. Perhaps I am
overcomplicating things but I wonder whether some notice ought to be
taken of the potential impact of a joint tenancy absorbing perhaps a
significant part of the estate and taking it outside of the regime that
the Bill helpfully provides. Perhaps one might consider that in
Committee or perhaps the Law Commission might want to advise the
Minister before we get to Committee as to whether anything might be
done in that respect.</hs_para>

supportive of the proposals. Subject to possible minor adjustments here
and there, they represent a way forward. I join the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Lloyd, and others in paying tribute to the commission and
particularly to Professor Cooke for the amount of work done and the
clarity with which the case has been made, both in documentation and in
the helpful session that we had. We look forward to completing the work
on the Bill fairly rapidly. It will certainly provide justice for many
people and improve on the current situation. In principle, therefore,
we support the
Bill.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_22_PT_1/C83171DF5FC35B2AC9993B359B905958B2286F3E" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 October 2013">Tuesday,

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, we have had a good debate, which I am
sure bodes well for very interesting discussions in the Public Bill
Committee. I again put on record my thanks to the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Lloyd, for taking on the responsibility as chair of that
Committee. As noble Lords will have gathered, I am also much reassured
by the presence close by of Professor Cooke as I try to give answers to
matters raised by noble
Lords<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:55:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102281000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000040">The
first of my noble friend Lord Henley’s questions was about the
situation where there is no surviving spouse or children. In such a
case, the law remains the same. As to how the fixed sum was reached,
that came out of a study in 2005, which made me think that it might be
ripe for looking at again. On the question of whether this is a
surprisingly large sum, one of the factors is housing, which makes it
relatively easy for an estate to have quite large sums in it.
Nevertheless, I am told that it affects at the moment only 2% of
estates, partly because, as was mentioned, people who have a house and
realise that its value is rising have the incentive to make a
will.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102281000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000041">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:57:50"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:04:38"></hs_TimeCode>
point that my noble friend raised about chattels is one that we may
well explore in Committee. As I think my noble friend Lady Hamwee said,
it is in respect not just of jewellery but of paintings and other
things where there might be a wavy line between investments and
chattels. That is certainly something to look
at<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:57:28"></hs_TimeCode>. For the same
reason that I will refer to when I come to the interventions of my
noble friend 
<?notus-xml column=356?>Lord Marks, I assure my noble friend Lord Henley that this procedure
will be used only for non-controversial reforms. That is
its strength and why Parliament has confidence in
it. We should keep to that kind of
discipline<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:58:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102281000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000042">As
the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, said, the noble Lord, Lord Wills, took us
to interesting areas. However, the noble Lord was right to point out
the danger of mischief and of the abuse of elderly and isolated
individuals. Much of that is the responsibility of the Office of the
Public Guardian, which also comes within my ministerial
responsibilities. Allegations of theft or overcharging by any
professional are serious and concerning but I do not believe that this
Bill is the right place to tackle such misconduct. The Inheritance and
Trustees’ Powers Bill does not directly deal with wills but
instead focuses largely on situations where no will has been made.
Dealing with the concerns raised by the noble Lord would not only
expand the content of the Bill to deal with wills but would mean taking
it into the territory of professional legal regulation, which would be
a very significant step and is already dealt with under the auspices of
the Solicitors Regulation Authority and the Law Society. However, the
Committee will undoubtedly consider the points made by the noble Lord,
Lord Wills, carefully unless the chairman rules that out. Not that I am
not suggesting that will happen—we look forward to an
interesting debate on any amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord
Wills.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102281000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131022-gc0001.htm#13102281000043">My
noble friend Lord Marks gave us a glimpse of the detail into which
Liberal Democrat conferences go in making policy. I cannot quite
remember the debate myself, but I am sure there were many speeches from
the floor that dealt with our policy on this. I have to say to my noble
friend that he used a good deal of his speech to talk about things that
we have not done and were not in the Bill. These are very relevant and
may well need to be brought before Parliament, but he gave the game
away at the end of his peroration when he described the issues that we
have left out of the Bill: he will see when he reads <I>Hansard</I>
that several times he used the word “controversial”. It
is because they were controversial that they fell foul of the request

between controversial proposals of the Law Commission, which I suggest

non-controversial proposals, such as are included in the Bill, which
are suitable for this procedure. I hope I was making it clear that I do
not suggest that this fast-track procedure is suitable for
controversial legislation, but I do suggest that the Law Commission
should not be frightened or intimidated away from introducing
controversial proposals. Indeed, when considering its new,
12th—I think—programme of law reform, it has made it
clear that it does not propose to steer clear of controversial
proposals. I believe that that is thoroughly

recognised that they needed to do more to explain what it means in
