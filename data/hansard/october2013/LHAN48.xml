published <I>Investing in Britain’s Future</I> and <I>Action for
Roads</I>, which set out a package of investment and reforms for the
strategic road network. This work drew on the Department for
Transport’s 2013 national traffic forecasts, published
alongside, to inform strategy for the network. However, the
identification and selection of individual highway schemes

Berkeley (Lab):</Member></B> I am grateful to the Minister for the
reply, but is he aware—he probably is—that the
development of accurate transport forecasts for traffic has not been
achieved in the past 20 years? In fact, if 1990 forecasts had been met
today, we would have 50% more traffic than we do. Therefore, what is
the point of building more brand-new roads when existing ones are in
such an awful state, when we could have more investment in buses,
cycling and walking, and might even be able to fill in some of the
potholes that cyclists regularly fall
into<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T14:53:50"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100819000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Popat" PimsId="5792" UID="13100819000329" xid="2062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000329">Lord
Popat:</Member></B> My Lords, the department produces forecasts on a
regular basis. Modelling is rarely, if ever, perfect, as we are
predicting the future. However, we are confident that the forecasts are
broadly in line with the traffic pattern. We are investing in existing
roads. It is vital that Britain has an infrastructure system fit for
the global race, which will involve investing in new as well as
existing roads, including filling in those potholes. The department has
investigated whether traffic has reached its peak and has concluded
that it has not: nor is it likely to in the near future. The forecast
is for total road traffic to rise by about 43% over the next 30
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100819000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Mawhinney" PimsId="4891" UID="13100819000330" xid="1893" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000330">Lord

in his enhanced responsibility for transport. I hope that he enjoys
Question Time as 
<?notus-xml column=4?>much as his predecessor the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, obviously did.
However, perhaps I may emphasise that he has got off to a rather weak
start, as the roads programme on which he has commented is slipping
drastically. The completion dates of more than half the major schemes
that the Government have announced since the general election have
slipped by more than a year. Why is the money not being spent, as
several noble Lords have already emphasised, on successful maintenance
of our existing road network? It is quite clear that the roads are a
danger to many users, particularly cyclists, and also to cars when they
hit potholes. We need attention and resources given to road

new major schemes to start during this Parliament and invested

to see progress on the first resolution that has been adopted on Syria
in 17 months at the Security Council. Resolution 2118 requires a full

of Chemical Weapons. It sets out that Syria’s chemical weapons
must be effectively eliminated within the first half of
2014—but, of course, I agree with my noble friend that the

means that the opposition and the regime have committed to being part

to be clear on this issue. There are two parts to what has been
discussed over recent months, on the political track. The Government
have always been clear that the matter will be resolved politically,
but the specific incident relating to chemical weapons and on which the
will of Parliament was listened to was a separate situation. Noble
Lords would accept and agree that the Assad regime’s now
voluntary destruction of deadly weapons in the form of chemical weapons
is an important step that has vindicated the threat of military action
by the United States. We would not be in this position if the Assad

contribution to the economy in all parts of the United Kingdom. In
2011, tourism directly contributed £53 billion to the economy
and employed 2.7 million people in full or part-time jobs. The
Government place great importance on this industry as part of their
strategy for growth. That is why we are investing more than £130
million, matched between the public and private sectors, in the GREAT
and other marketing

Governments have treated tourism as a Cinderella industry. If you look
at the rates of air passenger duty and VAT, we are internationally
uncompetitive. On visa requirements, France gets six times the number
of Chinese visitors that we do. Tourism was not mentioned in the
manifestos of any of the parties at the previous election. As a result
of the reshuffle, we are now on our ninth tourism Minister in 10 years.
Is my noble friend aware that 33 tourism bodies have today come
together to form the campaign for tourism to argue that tourism should
be much higher up the political agenda, and that they have written to
the party leaders and are determined that tourism will be supported to
enable it to fulfil its true
potential?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100819000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000037"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T15:09:47"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Gardiner of Kimble" PimsId="5760" UID="13100819000360" xid="2035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000360">Lord

aware that we have at our disposal, at virtually no cost, an
opportunity to increase tourism by at least 10% by introducing a
daylight saving scheme in this country. We have tried this—noble
Lords groan, but it is even more important now with our economy as it
is and given the fact that we have an Olympic legacy, on which it was
said that we would produce a new sporting generation. Daylight saving
would enable young and older people to partake in sport outside for
much longer, it would be much better for all of us and there would be a
saving in energy. It is something that I hope the Minister will take

dangerous territory, which is controlled by the opposition in its many

Of course, there are situations where opposition forces hold that
territory and, therefore, inspectors potentially could be working in
areas which are not controlled by the regime. This is a long process
which will take possibly until the middle of next year to complete. It
has started and we will keep it under review. The fact that all parties

Blackwell:</Member></B> My Lords, before moving on to the amendment,
and as I did not speak at Second Reading, I want to make it clear that
I strongly support the principles of the Bill, and the principle of
ring fencing in particular. My amendment is to deal with some of the
practical issues of making that work in the financial institutions. The
amendment deals with the situation where a financial services group
that is primarily operating ring-fenced activities retains a small set
of activities that may fall outside the ring fence.</hs_para>

consequence of the legislation as it stands is that where a group is
primarily operating ring-fenced activities but retains some
non-ring-fenced activities which may be excluded activities, it would
be required to have a separate board for the ring-fenced subsidiary and
a separate set of directors operating in
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T15:25:59"></hs_TimeCode>—that
is, separate from the group

understand why having separate boards for a ring-fenced subsidiary may
be seen as desirable where the group contains a large non-ring-fenced
activity in investment banking or wholesale market activities in order
to police the separation between the ring-fenced and the
non-ring-fenced activities. The provisions of ring fencing under the
Bill should of course deal with that situation by specifying the amount
of capital and requirements for security in the ring-fenced activity
and its resolution, preventing the flow of dividends controlling the
financing relationships between the ring-fenced activity in the group,
but I can also understand that having an independent board for the
ring-fenced activity where there are other significant activities in
the group provides an added level of security to deal with potential
conflicts of interest.</hs_para>

non-ring-fenced activities are of a very minor nature compared with

situation where the group board with responsibility to shareholders and

assets and capital are within the ring-fenced subsidiary. That would be
a nonsensical situation. It would be poor governance and it would be

type of activities that I am talking about are those where the

amendment would explore that situation where the non-ring-fenced

which this could 
<?notus-xml column=14?>be resolved in a common-sense way. The first way would be for the
regulator to exercise discretion under new Section 142D to the FSMA to
allow a small volume of otherwise excluded activities to be carried out
within the ring fence so long as the regulator is satisfied that
including those activities within the ring-fenced subsidiary did not
put at risk the solvency or ability to resolve the ring-fenced
activities if there were situations that used the capital applied to
the non-ring fenced activities. So one solution would be to allow the
ring-fenced bank to extend its activities. Of course, the regulator
would also need to be assured in that situation that allowing the
ring-fenced bank to operate those activities would not distort
competition with non-ring-fenced banks operating in those markets
without the ability to operate within the ring
fence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100819000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000070">The
second way of resolving this, if the regulator does not feel that it
can include those excluded activities within the ring-fenced
subsidiary, would be for the regulator to use its discretion
under new Section 142H(5)(d) to waive the requirement for
separate board membership of the group and its subsidiary, again where
the regulator is convinced that in so doing it does not put at risk the
ability to resolve the ring-fenced bank where there was a threat to its

probing in nature. The legislation as I have described it allows the
regulator to exercise discretion, but I invite the Minister to provide
clarity that where the legislation says that the separation of the
boards should be “to a specified extent”, the regulator
would have the freedom and indeed the expectation that it should
exercise that discretion with due respect for the proportionality of
the activities within the ring fence and any activities that there may
be within the group outside the ring fence. That seems to me to be a

by my noble friend for the reasons that he has explained very well. I
do not think that I can improve on his excellent explanation, but your
Lordships should consider that governance would not be improved if
there is a situation where the holding company has a completely
different membership from the boards of the ring-fenced subsidiaries,
and that applies most strongly in the case where the excluded
activities comprise only a small part of the activities of the group as
a whole. But even in the case where a relatively greater amount of
excluded activities are carried out within the group, if the board of
the holding company with responsibility to shareholders is comprised of
completely different people from the board of the principal operating
subsidiaries, does that provide for effective governance? I therefore

Amendment 1, which has been proposed by my noble friend Lord

<?notus-xml column=15?>Blackwell. I have much sympathy with the intention behind this amendment
and I hope that I can provide some of the comfort that my noble friend
seeks. Independent governance is of course key to the integrity of the
ring fence to ensure that ring-fenced banks do not simply operate in
the interests of their group’s investment bank, in this example,
or indeed other parts of the bank, but it is important that any
governance requirements are proportionate to the threat to the ring
fence. Where a ring-fenced bank makes up the great majority of a
group’s business and the investment bank is therefore small, so
the risk of the ring-fenced bank being dominated by the interests of
the investment bank is also small.</hs_para>

precise details of ring-fenced bank governance arrangements, along with

sets the objectives that rules must achieve; the regulator then decides
what exact structures or restrictions are needed to achieve those
objectives. This is appropriate because of the highly technical nature
of the issue, and in order to allow requirements to keep pace with
developments in a fast-moving market. Rule-making will, of course,
require the regulator to exercise its judgment, and proportionality
will be central to how it does so. In particular, the regulator will be
obliged to consider the costs and benefits of any rules it proposes to
make, including ring-fencing
rules.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13100819000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000075">In

have a particular subsidiary, then perhaps we don’t need to have
the separation in this smaller subsidiary”. These steady
erosions built up over the years, until by the early part of this

wonder whether it would be appropriate at this moment to take into
account the latest report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee, which has expressed considerable concern about the scrutiny
of secondary legislation that will follow from new Sections
142A, 142B and so forth as we are discussing in this particular

scrutiny proposed by that committee with respect to these particular

with total amendments running at 116 pages and government amendments
accounting for 95 pages of that: more than three times the length of
the original Bill. That tells us something about the process of
legislation. We are dealing with amendments to amendments to amendments

reality, however, is somewhat different. There are recommendations that
HMG have faithfully embraced and provided proposals to implement them.

often<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T15:43:15"></hs_TimeCode>. There is

are locked into this unsatisfactory legislative process, and we will

turn specifically to ring-fencing, which is the subject of the
amendments in this group and the background to it. There was a vigorous
debate within the commission on whether to endorse the ring-fencing
plan of the independent commission, the Vickers commission. By the time
we started work, the Government 
<?notus-xml column=19?>had effectively told us that they were minded to accept it.
Alternatively, should we continue to press the case for full separation
of investment banking activities from commercial and retail banking, in
effect adopting a UK version of Glass-Steagall, which the US had
operated for many years but which was eroded and finally abandoned? The
arguments for this were, first, that investment banking activities are
inherently riskier and so imperilled the continuity of regular
commercial banking and, secondly, that there was cultural contamination
in that there were attitudes to risk and remuneration which were alien
to good customer-focused banking.</hs_para>

arguments put against this were that there was no clear mapping of the
banks that failed against the divide proposed. Some universal banks,
such as HSBC and JP Morgan, survived the financial crash better than
specialist investment banks, such as Lehmans, Bear Stearns and Merrill
Lynch, while some of the most dramatic failures in the UK—HBOS
and Northern Rock—conducted very little investment banking.
Their failure was attributable simply to bad lending, particularly in
retail and commercial property. We also saw signs of poor behaviour and
culture across the whole banking spectrum and it was argued that rather
than being a source of risk, an investment bank could also be a source
of reinforcement.</hs_para>

endorsed the ICB proposal but felt that if we adopted the ring-fencing
regime, we needed to protect it. This became known colloquially as
electrification and was rooted in a belief that banks are limitlessly
ingenious and remorseless lobbyists, so some safeguards should be put
in place. We agreed to this subject to five conditions. First, the
ring-fenced bank should have a substantial degree of independence from
the group, subject to the caveats raised today by the noble Lord, Lord
Blackwell. Secondly, the directors of the ring-fenced bank should have
an additional duty to observe the principles of ring-fencing and
preserve the stability of that bank. Thirdly, we sought to reduce
cultural contamination by tightening up on banking remuneration, with
more remuneration being deferred and for longer and the possibility
that previously paid benefits could be clawed back—and, in the
event of failure and state rescue, reclaimed. Fourthly, there should be
a power to require an individual bank that was abusing the ring-fence
regime to dispose of its non-ring-fenced assets. Finally, after a
review the Government could decide to change the scheme and require
full separation across the whole sector.</hs_para>

us, I would say that we have secured about two-thirds or 70% of the
conditions that the commission was looking for. The Bill provides a
first reserve power to deal with individual banks and
provides for the desired governance of the ring-fenced bank. The
Government accept the principles on remuneration but are still arguing
about whether those should have statutory force. After what
I would describe as a stumble in the Commons, the Government have also
come round to introducing a workable process for dealing with
individual banks which are misbehaving. The scheme as
originally proposed in the 
<?notus-xml column=20?>Commons might be called “Five strikes and you might be out in six
years’ time”. That new amendment is Amendment
6, which we naturally welcome, and there is also agreement on the kind
of behaviours that should trigger separation under new Section 142K. So
where do the issues remain?</hs_para>

should be a periodic review after four or five years; there is an
opposition amendment suggesting a shorter period. This scheme is highly
innovative and very important. We are ahead of a similar scheme that
gets to the same place in a slightly different way and goes under the
name of the Liikanen<I> </I>proposals, so it is absolutely right that
provision is made to review it.</hs_para>

commission, though, the review should be conducted not by the PRA alone
but independently, as in proposed new Section 142JA, and it should be
required to report on its recommendations, as in proposed new Section
142JB. We have also suggested that where a bank is issued with a
preliminary notice, there should be a further independent review of its
relations with the regulator. This is to create a safeguard against the
regulator getting into a relationship where it is picking on a
particular bank. That is in Amendment
10<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T15:50:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100819000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000093">In
the scheme proposed by the commission, these sanctions could be
enforced only after a general review had taken place, but in the
Government’s scheme they could be undertaken at any time. So
there is quite a lot at issue to resolve between the Government, the
Opposition and the survivors of the commission, but I believe that we
can achieve reconciliation before we get to Report. The final question,
about the differences on the second reserve powers, will come later in
the afternoon as it is further down the Order

agreement with what the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, has said about the
importance of the reviews of this process. We have to realise that we
really are breaking new ground here. In a way, this is a leap in the
dark and we have no idea whether it will work. Obviously a lot of
effort has gone into trying to ensure that it will work, but it is such
a novel innovation that we really cannot be sure whether it will, or
indeed whether it will have a whole series of unintended
consequences.</hs_para>

that it is very important that the process be kept under virtually
continuous review. The amendment in the name of myself and my noble
friend Lord Tunnicliffe seeks to ensure that the first review and
subsequent reviews take place within relatively short time periods of
up to two years. The reason for that is that it is only five years ago,
almost to the day, that Lehman Brothers collapsed, and let us think
what has happened since then. If we were to retain the four-year limit,
that would cover almost that whole period, with all the remarkable
devastating changes that have occurred.</hs_para>

Lord, Lord Turnbull, in his proposed new Section 142JA, that such a
virtually standing group should act as an independent arbiter and
assessor of these matters. It certainly should not be, as in the
Government’s proposal, the PRA inspecting itself. That does not
seem to be a very satisfactory structure at all. It is not appropriate
in terms of giving confidence in the reviews, and it is not fair to the
PRA. The PRA should be able to stand up and do its job, and then accept
that it will then be scrutinised by the sort of independent group
proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull. My amendment would simply
ensure that that group had a virtually standing role in assessing these
major changes to ensure that, once we have taken this leap in the dark,
we land on firm ground. On Amendment 5, I shall simply reiterate the
arguments that I have just made. I beg to

Blackwell</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, I must express some
reservations about the arguments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord
Turnbull. It is not that I do not understand the significance of having
continuous and effective review of these ring-fencing procedures, but
it seems to me that we have set up, with a lot of time in this House
and the other place, a regulator that has learnt in that legislation
and its constitution and objectives many of the lessons of the past,
and we have entrusted that regulator with maintaining the stability of
the financial sector and enforcing this legislation, if the Bill is
passed. I think there is a danger in seeking to replace the regulation
of an industry by an independent regulator with what might be in danger
of turning into regulation by parliamentary committee. Parliamentary
committees have many virtues and values, but they cannot engage
dispassionately in the same evaluation of detailed analysis and
commercial information that a regulator can, and they are more likely
to be swayed by current opinions of the day. I pay tribute to the work
of the commission on which the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, and other
noble Lords sat, which did an excellent job. I worry about the
possibility of moving away from regulation by independent regulators,
which are deliberately made independent of the Executive, towards
regulation by parliamentary
committees.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100819000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000098"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Turnbull" PimsId="5004" UID="13100819000399" xid="1913" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000399"><B>Lord

that the chair should be approved by the chairman of the Treasury
Select Committee. That would certainly alleviate some of my concerns.
Nevertheless, the main point is that if we have an independent
regulator, we should trust that regulator to do the job we have asked
it to do. That does not prevent Parliament, or any Select Committee of
Parliament, conducting its own reviews at any time it wishes, or
appointing other reviewers if the circumstances require it.</hs_para>

at Second Reading, which seems rather unusual. I pointed out then, and
I remain of the view, that the way that the Bill is drafted, with so
much reference to a previous Act, makes it extremely difficult for the
House to work out what is happening from moment to moment on an
unbelievably complex matter. Having said that, the briefs that have
been provided by the Treasury on individual amendments and so on are
extremely helpful and do something to ameliorate the problem that I

are going very much into uncharted waters here. There is a lot of doubt
about ring-fencing, its effectiveness and whether it is a sensible way

barbaric. I must admit that when I put all the papers on my dining room

space, including all the so-called explanatory documents. Having said
that, I thank my noble friend Lord Deighton, who has at least listened
to what was said at Second Reading. He has an open mind, which has
undoubtedly led to the introduction of a lot of the measures in the

Chancellor emphasised in his evidence to the PCBS, the Government have
no objection in principle to independent reviews. Indeed, as the House

independent review: that of the Independent Commission on Banking. As I
stated, the Bill provides for regular reviews of the operation of the
ring-fence. Clause 6 provides for the PRA’s annual report to
Parliament to cover the extent of banks’ compliance with the
ring-fence—a provision that Amendment 42 will strengthen, as I
will discuss in a
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100819000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000119">Subsection
(3) of new Section 142J requires the PRA to carry out a review of
ring-fencing rules every five years to assess how well the rules are
framed in order to achieve the objectives set for the PRA in the

changed, it will have the power—indeed, the
responsibility—to do so. Regular reviews of how the mechanics of

response to arguments made in the Commons, we are
strengthening the requirement of the PRA to report each year on

PRA to report annually to Parliament on how ring-fenced bodies have
used any exemptions to excluded activities or prohibitions.
As noble Lords will know, the Bill allows the Government to create
exemptions from the exclusion or prohibition of certain activities, as
long as the exemptions are not likely to threaten the continuous
provision of core services—that is, retail deposit-taking. These
exemptions are necessary to allow ring-fenced banks to enter into
derivative contracts to manage their own risks. The Government also
intend to use this power to permit ring-fenced banks to sell simple
derivatives to their customers,

exemptions created now or in the future. These will include exposures
of ring-fenced banks to financial institutions incurred for the
purposes of risk management, providing payment services or trade
finance services, as well as the sale of simple derivatives. This
amendment will ensure that Parliament has sufficient information to

amendments, it is far less clear to us that we should legislate for
repeated reviews of the whole policy. Amendment 3 would effectively
reconvene the ICB in perpetuity to ask afresh every few years whether
we should continue with the ring-fence at all. I have two main
objections to this. First, one of the original aims of establishing the
ICB was to secure consensus and certainty over the future of the
banking industry in this country. The Chancellor has memorably
described how, before this Government took office, he heard four
different proposals from the then Prime Minister, Chancellor, Governor
of the Bank of England and chairman of the regulator. The ICB process
brought together all these voices and others to produce
recommendations, including for ring-fencing, that commanded wide
consensus support. That consensus gave the industry certainty over the
future regulatory framework, which is so important to enable businesses
to plan and invest. Reopening that consensus every five years, or
indeed even earlier, would undermine that certainty.</hs_para>

from businesses in every industry is, “Please provide us with a
stable and certain framework so that we can plan and invest so as to
sustain this recovery”. As I have implied here, shortening the

also question whether it would even be possible for a review to judge
after only two years whether ring-fencing was working. Given the scale
of the changes involved, any verdict arrived at before ring-fencing has
had more time to bed down would surely be
premature<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T16:12:01"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T16:12:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to this amendment’s prescription that the terms of reference for
these repeated reviews must include considering the case for full
separation. This seems rather like requiring that reviews continue
until they come up with the right answer. I do not believe that that is
appropriate. Given this, I also see no case for delaying the
commencement of the Government’s provisions for a firm-specific
power of separation until after a review, as Amendment 116 would

proposal in Amendments 10 and 14. So that noble Lords are clear, this
is quite a different issue. It is for an external review to form part 
<?notus-xml column=26?>of the procedure for the firm-specific power to require separation. It
is the electrification power. As noble Lords will know, the Government
have accepted the case for a firm-specific separation power, and we
will shortly debate the government amendments designed to make the
separation of power already in the Bill more credible and effective.
That is what I promised when we first discussed this Bill. However, the
Government do not understand the possible justification for an external
review to form part of this power. The PCBS proposed this as a
safeguard for banks against arbitrary or unreasonable actions by the
regulator<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T16:09:59"></hs_TimeCode>, but
the right of appeal to the tribunal already protects against this
possibility. The tribunal, of course, is independent, so an additional
safeguard is unnecessary.</hs_para>

an external review
could<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T16:14:22"></hs_TimeCode> also serve
to undermine the electrification process. The PCBS argued powerfully
that regulators should not be subject to self-serving lobbying by
banks. An external review could easily become an opportunity for banks
to lobby during the electrification process to seek to persuade the
reviewer that the regulator was acting unreasonably or treating them
unfairly. Any bank required to restructure will have a right of appeal
at the end of the process, so why give it another opportunity to
challenge the regulator? I am also concerned that, even if the
bank’s lobbying efforts did not succeed in blocking a
requirement to restructure, they could serve to delay it and slow down
the process for the regulator to require separation. This seems
contrary to the objective, shared by both the PCBS and the Government,
of making the electrification process less lengthy and cumbersome. For
these reasons, I cannot agree to these proposals, and I call on the
noble Lord to

Lawson of Blaby (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I listened very carefully
to what my noble friend the Minister said. I am extremely grateful to
him for the extent to which he has accommodated the points made by the
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, of which I had the
honour to be a member and to which the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull,
referred—and I entirely endorse his remarks. However, the
remarks that the Minister has just made simply do not stack up. Before
going into why that is so, let me put a little perspective on what we
are doing today. It sounds very dry, arid, tedious and tiresome in many
ways. Indeed, it is not a model of how to construct legislation, as my
noble friend Lord Higgins pointed out. Nevertheless, it is testimony to
the fact that the Government have listened attentively to what the
parliamentary commission had to say, and what was said in the other
place in response to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T16:16:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100819000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000128">My
noble friend the Minister has already raised matters wider than the
amendment that we are discussing. He started to talk about the
industry-wide separation power, which we were concerned about but which
was not part of this group of amendments. We will come on to that
later. In this country, we are suffering, as part of the wider
world’s suffering, the after-effect of a most appalling global
recession. There were a number of causes of that problem, but it is
generally agreed that right at the heart of it was a banking meltdown. 
<?notus-xml column=27?>Nothing is more important, therefore, than to do whatever we can to
ensure that a further banking meltdown in future is unlikely to occur

have to do whatever you can. It is a long time since this House has had
such an important role in trying to ensure that it is put right. It is
clear that the legislation that was introduced in the Commons and went
through the other place was wholly inadequate, and as a testimony to
that are all the amendments that we are discussing today and all the
amendments that the Government have moved. It is up to this House to
get the legislation right; that imposes a very great responsibility on
us and we should look at the legislation in a non-partisan

Minister rested his argument on the fact that the Vickers commission
came up with this wheeze of ring-fencing. It was a compromise between
full separation of commercial and retail banking and investment banking

As the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, and others have pointed out, this is
new territory and has never been done before. We do not know whether or
not it will work. We know that separation can work. There was
separation in the United States under the Glass-Steagall legislation
from 1933 to 1999 when it was repealed and for most of that time it
worked very satisfactorily. It was weakened as time went on as a result
of the success of the American banks in lobbying various authorities in
the United States to make exceptions here and amendments and changes
there. We need to watch out for that. It was also weakened to some
extent by the ingenuity of investment bankers in finding ways round it,
to which the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, referred. Nevertheless,
separation worked pretty well in the United States and in the United
Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T16:24:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100819000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000131">I
speak with some experience. It is now more than half a century since I
was the principal writer of the Lex column in the <I>Financial
Times</I> and I have been a close observer of the banking scene
throughout that period. I recall that for most of that period we had a
separation between what were called the joint stock banks, which
engaged in retail and commercial banking for small businesses and so
on, and the investment banks, which were not called that in those
days—they were called merchant banks. They were completely
separate and it worked very well, so we know that separation can work,
and has worked, in the two major banking centres in the

is true that the continent of Europe has always gone in for universal
banking. That is so in Germany in particular but is generally the
pattern in continental Europe. However, it is no accident that the two
major banking centres of the world, London and New York, had
separation. That worked. Whether this halfway house can work or not is
very uncertain. Although the remarks of my noble friend Lord Blackwell
on this amendment showed that he got completely the wrong 
<?notus-xml column=28?>end of the stick on it, as the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, pointed out,
he was absolutely right to point to one of the problems, although not
the only one, with the governance structure. It is a very curious
governance structure in which the two subsidiaries of the holding
company are together but separate. They are meant to be completely
separate even though they both, as boards of directors, have
responsibilities to exactly the same group of shareholders. It is a
very odd system and we do not know the workings of

say that my noble friend the Minister is unconvincing because his whole
point rested on the fact that Vickers said the ring-fence is the right
answer and that because Vickers said that we must stick with it and not
change it. What we are saying, which is surely much more reasonable, is
that we will, of course, give Vickers a chance. Indeed, we will try to
reinforce his proposal by means of the so-called
“electrification” procedures. However, if it is seen not
to be working, we will have to go to separation. One member of the
Vickers commission is already convinced that we should go to separation
without any intermediate step but I am quite sure that nobody on the
Vickers commission wishes to see a failure. Let us give Vickers a
chance and see how it works but if it does not work—it has to be
kept under review—we should go to full separation. That must be
sensible. The fact that the Vickers commission said what it did is

contribute to our debates. One of the things that he has emphasised
strongly—I have tried to explain the importance of
this—is the problem around the culture of banking. This was

of the key problems is that retail and high-street
banking—commercial banking—and investment banking are two
completely separate cultures. It is very difficult, with the best will
in the world. I am not against investment bankers, but I do not think
they should be bailed out by the taxpayer. We may, from time to time,
need to bail out the commercial banks, with their retail depositors and
their responsibility for the payment system. They may need that, even
though they have enhanced capital funds, but it is wrong, I think, ever
to bail out investment banks; they should be like hedge funds, with a
fear of failure restraining what they do. They will be imaginative,
they will be adventurous, they will be creative, they will be exciting
for those who are excited by this kind of thing, and they will have a
totally different culture. To assume that you can get two quite
separate cultures in the same entity is stretching it a

never seen such a shambles presented to any House. As Chief Secretary
to the Treasury, I had the misfortune for five years, as the noble Lord
will know, to take two Finance Bills a year through, mainly because the
first Bill had to be amended because it had not been properly
scrutinised; it had been guillotined by all successive Governments. Yet
I have never seen anything remotely like this Bill and I am grateful to
the noble Lord, Lord Deighton, and his staff, who have done a
tremendous job in trying to present to us what exactly is going on
here. It is very difficult when one is working without a group of

noble Lord, Lord Lawson, is stumbling towards the only real solution.
We will have to debate fairly soon to settle whether the House agrees
to separation—call it Glass-Steagall, call it what you like.
However, while we are stumbling in this direction—I am not sure
from what my noble friend on the Front Bench was saying and whether our
Front Bench is stumbling towards it as well—it seems inevitable
to me that we have to decide this one, major issue. However many times
this is reviewed, ring-fencing can never be the solution to the

impossible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100819000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000139">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T16:29:37"></hs_TimeCode>

with this ring-fencing idea. It is so complex that it makes the
situation even worse, as we have heard in a number of debates. Until we
settle this matter, we will go from amendment to amendment for years on

reduced in that way—reductio ad absurdum. On that basis, we
would get rid of Parliament, which ultimately is the regulator of the
regulator. The regulator is accountable to Parliament. We are dealing
here with day-to-day very complex circumstances. In this great House we
have many experienced people. In my view, the banking commission has
done a brilliant job, as has the Treasury Select Committee in many
respects. I think all of us would agree that that was appropriate and
that that job has been done. However, as I understand it, in the
particular instance of deciding whether this ring-fencing experiment
will work, here we are talking about the need for some kind of process

the noble Lord, Lord Lawson. The particular point that I should like to
make is that if we look at events over the past five years, it was not
derivatives or standard investment banking activity which got the banks
into trouble but unwise forms of large-scale lending. It was the
purchase of blind CDO instruments from the US without knowing what was
in them and the banking practices in particular of HBOS. These were the
areas in which huge amounts of money were lost and which nearly brought
down two of the main banks of this

Turnbull:</Member></B> My Lords, in responding to the points that have
been made, I want to make it clear that the commission is not seeking
to use this Bill to reopen the position we have reached and try to get
us back to a policy of separation. What we have is a policy of
ring-fencing plus safeguards plus vigilance. I listed some of those
safeguards at the start. If that is the policy we are on, we have to
make the safeguards and vigilance work. In response to the Minister, I
do not think that a process in which the reviewing is done by one of
the key players in it, which is the Prudential Regulation Authority,
carries any credibility whatever. Its work is important and it should
be a contribution to a wider study, and the wider study should be
undertaken by someone who is independent of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T16:45:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

by the Minister was that we do not want a state of permanent vigilance.
I do not think that it is possible, in an industry which is highly
innovative—reference has been made to the term
“half-life”—that you can find one system that will
last for ever and therefore you need to be able to keep an eye on what
you have created and make sure that you are taking steps to keep to
that policy until such time—which may be the point of the
amendments we shall come to in another group—that you conclude
that it is not working. But the search for something which you can just
do and then simply routinely maintain is an illusion. If ring-fencing
is to be the policy, it is absolutely essential that it is backed by
maximum vigilance and some high-powered mechanisms for review. I really
do not think that what the Minister has promised us today meets that
requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T16:46:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

out that there are of course two reviews here. The other one is much
less important and serves a completely different purpose. It is to
safeguard a bank that has been threatened with separation against the
arbitrary behaviour of its regulator. You could ask why that is needed
because there are other safeguards, but if you do not have it, you come
to the question of whether the Regulatory Decisions Committee, which is
a step on towards the tribunal, should be beefed up. However, that is a
recommendation we will come to, which the Government have not accepted.
I do not think that the lesser review, the Amendment 10 
<?notus-xml column=34?>review, can be taken off the table. If you do that, you increase the
case for Amendment 91, recommending a new RDC. My conclusion is that we
have not reached an agreement in this area. The debate is interesting,
but what it means is that a lot more work has to be done between the
opposition, the commission, other members and the Treasury to get to a
point of resolution. However, it is essential that the point we reach
has a much more high-powered review mechanism in it than is currently
set out in subsection (6). I am content to withdraw the amendment on
the basis that further discussions between now and Report will take
place and that there will be flexibility on the part of the Government
in their
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T16:48:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, as I have tabled an amendment to the
amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, I believe that it is
for me to withdraw my amendment first and for him to follow. The noble
Lord, Lord Deighton, has two objections to the process of review, both
of which have, I think, been demonstrated to be false. He said that the
first was to secure consensus. From the discussion today, he should be
effectively disabused of the idea that the ICB has secured consensus.
People have settled around the ICB as the best that can be obtained
under the current circumstances, but there is a considerable degree of
uncertainty about whether the ring-fence is actually a good
idea.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13100819000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000166">The
noble Lord also said that he wanted certainty, but he absolutely does
not get certainty in this way because we are very uncertain as to
whether this system will actually work. That is why his second
objection—that time should be given for the system to settle
down and work—is a very dangerous one. As we go through the
process of implementation—if eventually Parliament agrees to
these ring-fence proposals and implements them—we will discover
by sheer practice where the lacunae may be, where things simply go
wrong with unintended consequences, and so

Unfortunately, we will be conducting an experiment and under those

bet that the “up to” will turn out to be about two. None

sections into the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and make a
consequential amendment to new Section 142J. The first new section, new
Section 192JA, gives the PRA a power to make rules over the
parent companies of ring-fenced entities. Ring-fencing will require
banking groups to make large structural changes to ensure the
independence of the ring-fenced bank from other entities in its group.
The PRA may need to make rules to ensure that the groups in which
ring-fenced banks sit are structured and governed appropriately. Rules
over parent companies may be needed to ensure that this is the
case.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13100819000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000170">It is
important that the regulator has the ability and flexibility to tackle
parent companies. They can influence subsidiaries in a number of
important ways—through their attitude to risk management
throughout the group, for example. This obviously has implications for
the incentives faced by a ring-fenced bank. This amendment, therefore,
further enables the regulator to strengthen the ring-fence.</hs_para>

to use this power to require groups containing ring-fenced banks to
adopt a so-called “sibling structure”. This means that a
non-ring-fenced bank cannot own a ring-fenced bank and vice versa. Both
the ring-fenced and the non-ring-fenced bank will sit directly
underneath the holding company. In this way, the PRA will be able to
supervise banking groups more effectively, by having a clear divide
between the ring-fenced and non-ring-fenced parts of a group.

of the ring-fencing policy has progressed, the PRA has identified
additional supervision benefits to a “sibling”

encouraging banking groups to issue loss-absorbing debt from the

banking groups from adopting the sibling
structure.</hs_para>

be insufficient to deliver some of the changes that the regulator feels
are necessary to make a bank resolvable. This is because the regulated
entity may not have the level of control required to make the change.
This may be the case where, for example, capital and debt are issued
out of the parent undertaking before being downstreamed to a bank. It
may also be operational in nature; for example, where a service company
which is not owned by the bank but sits in another part of the group

effectively to provide rules for parent undertakings in relation to the

some of the way to achieving that. However, I should like to ask a
question which I asked at Second Reading and which was not answered
then. The Minister referred to capital and debt being raised at the
level of the parent company and then downstreamed into the ring-fenced
entity. If it can be downstreamed, can it not be upstreamed? If that

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has
raised a very important matter with respect to authorities outside the
UK. The proposals under Glass-Steagall and under Liikanen are different
from the ring-fence—the divisions appear in different places. In
those circumstances, “similar powers” seems to be a very
weak description, because they are similar but not the same. With
respect to resolution powers, which are crucial in the relationship
between the parent body and the ring-fenced entity, that seems to
create a degree of uncertainty. Can the Minister clarify exactly what
that applies to? Presumably, it applies to the home-host division in
regulatory responsibility and therefore subsidiaries of UK institutions
in other jurisdictions will be regulated by the home regulator. If the
home regulator has different rules with respect to the divisions, it
seems to me that there will be a degree of confusion as to what is
actually being

am grateful for the Minister’s clear answer about the valve that
goes one way on the raising of debt and capital. I return to my
previous question. Let us suppose that we have a group in which the
liability structure of the ring-fenced entity is essentially provided
from the parent through the one-way valve and then the parent simply
stops providing. In those circumstances, the security and stability of
the ring-fenced institution would surely be threatened. The ring-fence
would not be working simply because the steady flow of financial

resolution being carried out by a foreign regulator where the bank is
in a different country. It just allows the support of that resolution
going on elsewhere so that we have the kind of international
co-operation which is necessary for these resolutions. On the point
about Liikanen and the convergence in how we are looking at this around

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments streamline the
procedure for the group restructuring powers—the so-called
electrification powers. In another place, following the recommendations
of the PCBS, the Government introduced amendments adding new Sections
142K to 142V. These sections give the regulator the power to require a
banking group to restructure if the regulator believes this necessary
to ensure the objectives of the ring-fence. As the PCBS recommended,
the regulator will have the power to require the group to divest
completely either its ring-fenced bank or its non-ring-fenced bank, or
transfer specific business units out of the group. These extensive
powers may be exercised if the regulator believes that the
group’s ring-fenced bank is insufficiently independent or if the
group’s conduct is such as to threaten the regulator’s
ability to meet its statutory objectives. The amendments made in the
Commons thus provide for the power to 
<?notus-xml column=39?>require the separation of an individual banking group that the PCBS
recommended.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100819000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000191">However,
some concerns were expressed both in the other place and in this House
that the procedure for the regulator to exercise its group
restructuring powers was too complicated and drawn out. It was argued
that the number of steps involved and the length of time required from
start to finish created a process that was so cumbersome as to be
difficult for the regulator to use in practice, and that this risked
undermining the group restructuring powers as a deterrent against
attempts by banks to subvert or game the ring-fence.</hs_para>

these concerns very seriously. As noble Lords will recall, I committed
at Second Reading to bringing forward amendments to simplify and

the requirements for three preliminary notices with just one so that if

restructuring and the action it is proposing to take.</hs_para>

the ring-fence. To legislate for industry-wide separation, however,
would not be a sanction; it would be to abandon that policy. The logic
of requiring all banks to separate would have to be that the ring-fence
had failed to achieve its objectives of delivering greater financial

Deighton:</Member></B> The first point that I would make in response is
that it was the position of the ICB, which did an enormous amount of
work on this, that the ring-fence was not in any sense a compromise but
was in fact superior to full separation because of some of the
synergies available in the universal bank. The essence of the argument
is that the other parts of the bank that may not get into financial
trouble actually provide benefits of diversification and scale that can
protect the ring-fenced entity from any of the problems that they may
have. It is essentially the diversification and scale advantages that
universal banking may bring.</hs_para>

with my noble friend’s underlying suggestion; in much of the

point, others are of course perfectly entitled to the view that the
ring-fence will fail—we have heard that point of view from many
Members here—and a future Government would be entirely within
their rights to propose an alternative policy to ring-fencing. However,
the only proper way to legislate would be for the Government to conduct
research and analysis to match the calibre of the Vickers commission in
support of full separation. I note that the PCBS produced no such
evidence. Let it build a consensus around its conclusions, and let it
come to Parliament with new legislation to be subjected to the full
scrutiny and debate that such a step would
require.</hs_para>

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I echo the words of the noble Lord,
Lord Turnbull. I think this is a significant improvement on the
procedures that were previously outlined. I have a number of
exploratory questions about this procedure. First, the regulator
essentially seems to be judge and jury in this respect. It was
the role of the old Regulatory Decisions Committee and, I
believe, the ambition of the commission with respect to its development
of the Regulatory Decisions Committee to ensure that there
was an independent step in any major regulatory enforcement. The main
reason why that was introduced into FiSMA was because it was
felt that otherwise it would contravene human rights legislation. Are
the Government confident that this procedure does not contravene such
legislation?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100819000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000206">Secondly,
with respect to the publication of notices, in the very thorough and
welcome briefing that the Minister’s staff provided
on these amendments, the Government argued that they would not accept
the commission’s proposal that the existence of a preliminary
notice or of various stages be publicised. Instead, it was felt that
these matters should be kept “secret” until such time as
any impact on Stock Exchange listing rules demanded publication that
the group was being subjected to such a procedure. It seems to me that
this is a slightly dangerous structure. It is a traditional structure
of central banks. It has always been strongly opposed by securities
regulators which believe much more in transparency in this respect.
This lack of transparency is likely to produce rumour and false
information in the marketplace. Consequently, if we are going to have
this procedure—which I think is well thought out, apart from the
one issue that I raised, on which I would like to have
assurances—we should make it a transparent procedure because
rumours and false information are really damaging to markets.
Transparency is always to be preferred, even if that transparency may
be extremely uncomfortable for the firm being subjected to this
process.</hs_para>

the publication of the initial warning, we are all trying to accomplish
the same thing, and it is quite finely balanced as to which way you go.
I point out, for the benefit of noble Lords, that of course the
regulator has the discretion to publish the initial notice but is not
obliged to do so. Therefore, in those circumstances in which it is in
the interest of the market to do that, it would do so. One of the
principal reasons why we are reluctant to do that is because if you
have gone public with the initial warning it may make you reluctant to
issue the initial warning and to begin a process because of the
consequences of that being out in the public domain. This is a tricky
area where the arguments are 
<?notus-xml column=42?>relatively well balanced. We came out with this option for the regulator
to disclose it, which we thought was, on balance, the right thing to
do. I beg to

Turnbull:</Member></B> I referred to the second reserve power, which
would allow that where, in the commission’s view, it was felt
that not just a single bank but the banking sector as a whole was not
respecting the constraints of ring-fencing and the scheme was basically
not working, it could move by steps to full separation. Of course, this
second reserve power was predicated on the assumption that there will
be a fundamental review of the kind that some of us have been arguing
for. If all that we have is the PRA-led review of the kind that the
Government have been seeking, we would certainly not have a
sufficiently strong basis. However, that is based on a view of the
world in which, first, there is continuous innovation and, secondly,
other jurisdictions are making changes—notably in the
EU. At some point that, combined with the
behaviour of a banking sector, may lead to the conclusion that there
should be a further change. Deciding that this scheme is not working
does not necessarily lead you to full separation; it could
lead you to something else, such as tightening the regime or
some other modification.</hs_para>

argument about the review.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T17:23:14"></hs_TimeCode>, then
you get to the real crunch, which is that even if there is agreement on
the review, and the review says that ring-fencing needs to be changed
in some way, this amendment says that the further action that has been
identified and recommended by a son of Vickers could be implemented
under the powers of this Bill. That is the fundamental disagreement.
The Government argue that that means that you are doing something
completely different. I argue, first, that getting legislation is not
an easy thing to do—you have to compete for time; and, secondly,
that not being able to implement the conclusions of such a review
reduces the effect of the deterrence and increases the opportunity for
a log-roll. In any case, the Government would have the last say in the
scheme that we have devised. Therefore, if there was a recommendation
from a Vickers mark 2, the Government would not be forced to act on it:
they could decide that they did not want to act on it and did not have
to accept it. Equally, if they wanted to, they 
<?notus-xml column=44?>would be able to. The position is asymmetrical. Since the Government
have a veto, they cannot be railroaded into a policy that they do not
want. However, if it is a policy that they do want, they have the power
to accept it and act accordingly. That is the basis of Amendment 23,

The way the amendment is drafted, proposed new Section 142VA gives the

As the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, mentioned, we retrenched on this in
discussions on earlier groups. This is something to which I attach
great importance. The noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, said that the
commission had got it all wrong, that ring-fencing could not possibly
work and that there would have to be complete separation. I agree with
her—and this is no surprise. I was speaking out for complete
separation long before almost anybody else I can think of, certainly in
this country. For five years I have been writing and speaking on this:
before the parliamentary commission and before the Vickers report. It
remains my view that this is most unlikely to work, partly for reasons
that the noble Baroness gave and partly for
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100819000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0001.htm#13100819000214">Of
course, as the noble Lord, Lord McFall, pointed out, we on the
commission decided that it would be sensible to have a unanimous
report. There was no majority on the commission—and certainly
not unanimity—for complete separation. Therefore, we proposed
what we proposed. One thing we proposed, which is what this group of
amendments is about, was a route to complete separation. This is what
the amendment is about: a process by which, if it is seen, and events
prove, that the noble Baroness and I are correct, along with many
others who think the same, this procedure, which the Government at the
present time refuse to accept—something I regret—is a way
in which we might get

I asked the Minister what the great advantages were of universal
banking, from which we should in no way depart, his main argument was
that diversity was a form of strength. I am old enough to remember when
industrial conglomerates were extremely popular. In the late Lord
Hanson’s group, and others, there were a whole lot of disparate
industries in the same holding company, and the argument was that this
diversity was a form of strength. In fact, of course, it was a disaster
and nobody argues the case for industrial conglomerates any

at least with industrial conglomerates there is the discipline of the
marketplace and you can allow companies to fail. The problem in banking
is that the conglomerates are much more serious. You get the problem of
“too big to fail”. Indeed, it is not just too big to
fail, but too complex to fail and, as we have seen, too big and too
complex to manage. That problem has proved to be right at the heart of
this. My noble friend the Minister is saying, “Forget about all
that, let us make them even bigger and even more complex”. I am
afraid that he has not convinced me. In certain special circumstances
there may be some slight advantage in having linkages of this kind, as
there were with the conglomerates. However, the balance is
overwhelmingly on the other side of the ledger. It is a huge
disadvantage and a huge risk for the economy, which we should not

also said—I do not know whether the Minister is going to say
this now but a government spokesman has said it in the past, and I
think that the Treasury said it in its response to our
commission’s report—that maybe you are right and we
should go this way, although their heart is not in it. It should be new
primary legislation and not a power under this Act, which, as the noble
Lord, Lord Turnbull said, can be exercised only with the agreement of
the Treasury and the Government who are responsible to Parliament. We
are not saying that an independent committee can decide any more than
the Vickers committee could decide. It had to be accepted by the
Government of the day. If you say that this has to be new primary
legislation the reality is that it will be too much hassle. There will
never be time for the primary legislation and it simply will not
happen. It is an integral part of the logic behind this Bill. That is

two separate issues. There is the issue—which we were all
concerned about and to which reference has been made during the debate
on earlier groups of amendments—of the intense ingenuity of
investment bankers, in particular, who may find ways round it and also
the success in lobbying. Maybe we need to introduce something—at
a later stage maybe; it is too late to do it today—to implement
on the statute book the recommendation of the parliamentary
commission about lobbying in paragraph 262 of its summary of
conclusions. If you look again at what happened in the United States,
intensive lobbying led to a weakening of the Glass-Steagall
legislation, and British banks are just as able to do it as American
ones.</hs_para>

a question of finding clever ways round or lobbying in this instance by
particular banks but also, as has been widely pointed out, that the
whole structure may not work. If it does not, we have to go for
industry-wide separation and that is what this is about. I am not going
to talk now about proprietary trading, because we are going to come to
it later, but as the issue has been raised I will just mention it now
even though it is not really relevant to this group. Proprietary
trading has been separated out in the United States. We made
recommendations about that too in an earlier report. The final report
was not an attempt to sum up everything: we did it in tranches. 
<?notus-xml column=46?>This comes back to the question of culture. Maybe I am old-fashioned but
I regard one of the essential elements of banking culture to be service
to clients. As the whole essence of proprietary trading is that there
is no client, the culture of service to clients cannot possibly exist.
It is totally alien and the banks are literally in it for themselves.
That is a separate issue. The important thing now is that there should
be a route to complete separation if too much ingenuity is shown, if
there is too much successful lobbying or if the whole system is shown
to be flawed, which I suspect will be the case for a number of reasons
which noble Lords have already mentioned. We will abandon this route at
our peril. I fear that if we do, we will deeply regret it in the
future.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_08_PT_1/DAEE5B7A3EB542A205CC4ECFF939FBCEF9BD8597" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 8 October 2013">Tuesday,

have already heard the problems expressed very clearly about the

Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards is that separation is
almost as hard to work out as a ring-fence, because you have to decide
which bits get separated into which bits. The next thing that happens
is that the brilliant merchant bankers, as it was put a few minutes
ago, get between the wall and the wallpaper—that, I think, was
the memorable phrase—and start putting other bits into the wrong
bit. They game the system just as much with separation as with a

amendment—and this is why the element of culture is so
important—increases vastly the voltage of the ring-fence. If it
has to be used, like much of these forms of regulation, it will have
failed to some degree. But it says that, if the industry loses its way
in ethics and culture, as it did in the early years of this century,
there is catastrophe in regulatory terms. Banks will be split up;
people will come in and take them apart. The Government have argued
that such a drastic step should require further primary legislation,
but that argument seems to carry very little weight. The amendment is
merely a rational extension to existing provisions and ensures that the
banking industry realises that poor culture leads to fatal shocks, not
to a little buzz in the fingers, or to lengthy debates in future on
primary legislation. It will concentrate

is no doubt that we are seeing good things happen in the culture of a
number of banking institutions. The new leadership in a number of banks

self-interest but, in many cases, a deep sense that there needs to be a
change of culture and values. But that is what is happening in this
generation, now; it must be reinforced with firm boundaries to the ring
fence, with very serious consequences if you walk into it to see what
will happen. The amendment will reinforce that change of culture and
act as a permanent reminder to the banking industry of the danger of
slipping back into the bad old ways. Not to have that reality
signalling the boundaries of acceptable ethics and culture is to
encourage behaviour that looks first to what is legal, as has happened
for a number of years, and never to ask the question, “What is
right?”. To have banks ask what is right rather than what is

friend the Minister that the writing is on the wall here, and it is
absolutely clear that if we do not have in this Bill a clear provision
that gives the Government power to deal with the sector as a whole,
most banks will decide to go with the culture and try to make it work.
But they are in competition with each other; one will come up with a
clever scheme and the others will say, “They’re getting

from experience. I have seen this attempt at ring-fencing in the past.
When you have ring-fenced or non-ring-fenced entities—it does
not matter which—reporting up to a group head, at the end of the
day that group head can manipulate things at an investment level or at
all sorts of other levels to influence the outcome in a way that is
unexpected. It does not work, the moment that you have a group, because
that is outside the ring-fence. I could give noble Lords instances, but
it might cause problems if you did. I would rather say that I totally

Higgins:</Member></B> My Lords, what underlies this whole debate is a
feeling that the so-called advantages of the universal bank do not
outweigh the dangers and disadvantages. My noble friend referred
earlier to preserving the advantages of the universal bank, but there
is no doubt that such advantages as there might be, regardless of the
risks, are significantly reduced, if we have an effective system of
ring-fencing. Many of us here feel that the ring-fencing proposal is
wrong and unlikely to be very successful. We came up with the Vickers
report and the Government have gone along very largely with the
proposal that was made, but the reality is that we are going to have a
situation whereby we should really be going in the direction of full
separation. This is bound to take time. Therefore, an amendment of the
kind that my noble friend has proposed would effectively give us a
means to get out of the present impasse to a situation where we move
towards full
separation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T17:49:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100819000233" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0002.htm#13100819000233">I
return for a moment to a point that I made earlier. Where does all this
leave us in relation both to the United States and with regard to the
European Union? This is clearly a global industry. It is no good our
legislating for the situation with regard to British banks if quite
different rules are being applied in Europe, or applied to us from
Europe, or the rules are different in the United States. There is a
strong case for trying to get an international consensus on this, but
the ring-fencing proposal seems significantly different from what I

Blackwell:</Member></B> My Lords, given some of the recent speeches, I
again sound a small note of caution. While I understand the need to
electrify the ring-fence, the Government and this House should be
cautious about legislating on a presumption that universal banking is
the wrong commercial or organisational model. I share many of the
concerns that have been expressed about the difficulty of having a
common culture in an organisation that embraces too many different
activities. However, it seems to me that it is primarily a commercial
judgment for the management and shareholders to decide whether or not
they can make that range of activities succeed. The primary duty of the
Government and the regulator is to ensure that whatever is done is not
a threat to the financial stability of the system. As I said in my
introduction to the first amendment, I support ring-fencing which seems
to me to be targeted at that purpose, which is to define the capital
and risk exposure of the ring-fenced bank and ensure that it is
regulated in such a way that the other activities of the group do not
impinge on the capital and solvency of the ring-fenced activity. So
long as the Government and the regulator can do that—I
understand that people are raising questions about that—it seems
to me that the question of other activities in the group is not
something on which the Government should rush to
legislate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T17:52:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

commission’s report, especially its final report, is the way in
which it presents a coherent package of measures. This amendment fits
together with the review amendment that we considered earlier as those
two elements reinforce each other. As Amendment 117 makes clear, the
review element is the key trigger for Parliament to consider whether
this measure of separation should be introduced. There is coherence
here. What is distressing about the Government’s rejection of
the nature of independent review and hostility towards this amendment
is that by removing that internal coherence of argument they
significantly weaken the overall approach to financial regulation which
we are attempting to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T17:54:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310092000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0002.htm#1310092000004">In
anticipating this discussion on separation, the noble Lord, Lord
Deighton, asserted that the arguments for separation had not been
considered and that if you wanted an amendment of this sort you ought
to have another commission to consider the arguments. That is just not
so as the arguments were considered extensively, first by the
independent commission and then by the parliamentary commission. The
main point that came out of those discussions was that there was a
strong case for separation. However, the experiment of ring-fencing was
felt to be worth while as, if it worked, the trauma of separation would
not be required. The idea that this issue has not been considered is
not the case as it has been considered very thoroughly. It has not been

ensure that they are not drawn into this final total separation. The
people on the inside who really know what is going on will have a
strong incentive to make the ring-fence work because if it does not
work they know that there is a reserve power in the Bill. If you really
want the ring-fence to work, you need this clause. It is a contingent
clause and a reserve power but if we really want the ring-fence to

these issues as it has been extremely difficult to avoid talking about
full separation when discussing the other amendments. However, I pause
to review the most reverend Primate’s reminder that the most
important thing in these institutions is culture and that we can make
as many rules as we like but if we do not force a cultural change
bankers will find their way around the rules. Separating banks is
absolutely not a recipe for ensuring a better culture. If you look, for
example, at the experience at HBOS, which was a pure retail player,
there was clearly a massive cultural problem there. Culture is quite
independent of some of the structural issues that we are talking
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T17:57:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310092000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0002.htm#1310092000007">I

should be a reserve power for industry-wide separation. Inevitably, the
discussion seems to be about ring-fencing versus full separation but
that is not the debate we are having. It is difficult to avoid
confusion around that issue. The high voltage or the extent of the
electrification and the incentive to banks is extremely strong in terms
of individual bank separation. I outlined in our amendment how quickly
and effectively that can be deployed. A bank needs no further incentive
than to know that it will be completely restructured if it seeks to
game the system. The notion that banks will watch each other is not how

regards the point made by my noble friend Lord Higgins, the ring-fence

sure that they are compatible with EU and US law although the way each
country deals with the issue structurally is different. I remind noble
Lords that we are legislating to ring-fence retail from investment
banking. That is what the Independent Commission on Banking
recommended. The Government oppose this amendment as a matter of
substance and process. The complete separation of retail and investment
banking which this amendment would provide is not a sanction or
deterrent but a different policy. It would not support or reinforce the
ring-fence; it would abandon it in favour of an alternative. We can see
this in the terms of the review that the noble Lord proposes which
might trigger full separation. That review must decide how far the
provisions in the Bill—that is, the ring-fencing regime
itself—deliver the policy objective so that even if no bank
gamed the ring-fence full separation could be
triggered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310092000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0002.htm#1310092000009">Having
established this as an alternative policy, let me set out two simple
reasons why we do not support the amendment. First, if a future
Government did decide to switch to a new policy, it could not be
appropriate for that change to be effected simply by commencing a
reserve provision. That would entail no more than a single order with a
single brief debate in each House of Parliament. There would be no
detailed scrutiny, no opportunity to consider amendments and no chance
for Parliament to assure itself that the circumstances justified the
new policy. There would be no development of an extensive evidence
base, no cost-benefit analysis and no opportunity to build an extensive
domestic and now European consensus. This proposal may therefore be at
odds with the desire expressed in both Houses to enhance the process of

Deighton:</Member></B> Yes, there would be a review, but not a proper
parliamentary process. The argument I am making is that this is such a
switch from ring-fencing to full separation that it should benefit from
that full process. While I obviously bow to the experience of my noble
friend Lord Lawson, these things, if the circumstances dictate, can be
done extremely rapidly, where the circumstance demand that kind of
urgent
move<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T18:01:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310092000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0002.htm#1310092000012">I
think it is instructive to compare the process of developing the
ring-fencing policy to that of this proposal for full separation. The
ICB went through an extensive process of deliberation and analysis,
carefully collected data, prepared a full cost and benefit analysis and
compared that to full separation. It found that a robust ring-fence
will insulate essential retail banking services from shocks originating
elsewhere in the financial system. It will enhance the
authorities’ ability to manage the failure of a ring-fenced
bank, or its wider corporate group, in an orderly way. It will,
therefore, deliver the financial stability benefits of separation.
Ring-fencing will also preserve some of the benefits of universal
banking. I made the argument of diversification and scale, not simply
diversity. Customers will be able to access the full range of services
from a single group: that is a marketing advantage as well. The
frictional costs to the economy of ring-fencing are therefore lower
than those of full separation. That is, of course, the reason we did
not go for full separation. Further, in the event that the ring-fenced
bank runs into trouble while the rest of the group is doing well, other
group members can support it. That, of course, would not be possible
under complete
separation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310092000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0002.htm#1310092000013">On
a comparison of the costs and benefits, the ICB chose ring-fencing as
the superior policy. The PCBS did not provide any new evidence to
contradict this position. In this respect, the noble Lord’s
proposal for an independent review of ring-fencing is an admission that
the evidence base for full separation does not yet exist. The amendment
asks us to put a policy into law and then establishes an independent
review process in the hope that it might justify it. For us, this is
lawmaking done backwards.</hs_para>

Government’s second and perhaps more powerful reason for
rejecting this amendment. Let us imagine that a future Government
decided that not ring-fencing, or full separation, but a third policy
was appropriate. Imagine, for example, that it decided that a Volcker
rule was the right policy, or a shift to full-reserve banking. In
either case, a review that was limited to deciding whether to enact a
reserve provision for separating ring-fenced banks from their groups
would be no use at all, and the power would need to be repealed, along
with much of the rest of the Bill. Coming back to Parliament would be
the only way to give a future Government wanting to change policy the

here. The straw man is that there is a quite lightweight review,
possibly of the kind that he is recommending, rather than the kind
others are recommending, and then there is a day in the Commons and a
day in the Lords and, bingo, this huge change takes place. What the
commission envisages is a resurrection of the ICB. It is not a
coincidence that the number five was chosen, as that was the number
that worked on the ICB. The ICB went through all the steps that he
claimed, of looking at the options, the cost benefits and so on, and
evidence was taken in various Select Committees. Therefore, there would
be an enormous amount of public discussion, inside and outside
Parliament, before this was enacted. That seems to me to be the process

other point is that the Minister downplays the incentive effect. If you
have one bank which has no incentive to test the system and is very
happy with its niche in the market and it sees another bank pushing
very hard at the limits, what is its incentive? Does it simply turn a
blind eye? Under this arrangement it has an incentive to support
suggestions that the other bank should be reined in, otherwise it then
brings big change on the sector as a whole. So it produces, it seems to
me, the right incentive set for all the players in the banking
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310092000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0002.htm#1310092000018">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T18:09:36"></hs_TimeCode>

the start, the prior condition of all this is a proper review
arrangement. If that is in place, this is, in the opinion of many, a
sensible power to have. It can be enacted, but if the view is that some
alternative to separation is better, there is no problem; the
Government can go down a different channel. If they want to extend
separation, they have the power to do so. As with the first reserve
power, further discussions need to take place. I think the divisions
here are more fundamental, but, equally, I think the strength of

Secretary of State regarding these points on the work of the committee
of the Privy Council is to see whether in these two areas in particular
there may be reasonable and responsible adjustments, if the
representatives of the three parties agree, which may make more
practical sense. I should, however, like first to confirm that, as the
Secretary of State said in the other place, the version of the
cross-party charter will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses this
Friday and that, if the three parties cannot agree to the thoughts of
the committee that there may be this area of further consideration, the
version of the 18 March will stand. The point is to see whether there
can be some reasonable adjustments, particularly on the arbitration

and the promise is there. The parliamentary version of the royal
charter, which is designed to underpin the new independent
self-regulator, was approved by Parliament in March. Even that charter
was a substantial departure from the Leveson report, which called for
statutory underpinning. It had 10 concessions to the press. Will the

press freedom. Indeed, Geoffrey Levy will remain free to publish his
opinion, as will those who disagree with him. This charter addresses

Parliament’s agreed charter? That delay was seven months and
there is now another month’s delay. Is he aware that the way in
which the press have beaten all six recommendations of the inquiry is
simply by building in delay after delay after delay. If there are to be
further consultations, we will be getting near to the general election
when all leaders get pressed by the press and will decide that they
have no time or political courage to implement the recommendations.

that we are having a royal charter precisely because state regulation
is not an option that the country or indeed parliamentarians generally

the <I>Daily Mail</I>, I think that honest exchanges and robust
differences of view are all legitimate, but I have always thought that

Deech (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, has legal advice been taken about
the statutory underpinning of the charter? My recollection is that it
says that the charter cannot be changed without a two-thirds majority
in Parliament. In the very first lesson that law undergraduates ever
have, one learns that one Parliament cannot bind another. No amount of
saying that there needs to be a two-thirds majority can stand up if a
future Parliament simply decides to change it. Has advice been taken on

because everything seems to be going one way, is there a note of

There have been robust exchanges with party leaders and
parliamentarians across the parties trying to seek some resolution. I
absolutely do not think that the whole process is seeking to stop the
press in its legitimate task of holding us to account, holding
institutions to account and ensuring that wrongdoing is exposed. That
is the very essence of why we should champion a free press. But what
has happened and why we are here is that elements of the press have
been hugely irresponsible and

Government’s commitment to look particularly at access to
arbitration. Are the Government listening to the concerns of the
regional press, which is particularly exercised because none of the
problems that we have been talking about over the past couple of years
derives from its work? Indeed, the regional press is the one part of
the press that has followed the spirit as well as the processes of the
regulation process, but now it is to be involved in a very expensive
regulatory procedure. It is very worried about free access to
arbitration, which could undermine the existing processes for
settlement and, when the regional press is already in severe financial
difficulty, could draw it into an additional cost
burden<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T18:38:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Commercial Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Deighton)
(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I turn to Amendments 24 to 37. A central
principle of ring-fencing is that ring-fenced banks must be independent
from the rest of their groups, so that the failure of another member of
the group cannot spread to—and bring down—the ring-fenced
bank. Under existing pensions law, if a ring-fenced bank continues to
share a pension scheme with other parts of its group then, if another
group member were 
<?notus-xml column=64?>to fail, the entire liability for the scheme could fall on the
ring-fenced bank as the “last man standing”. If this
liability were sufficiently large, it could then threaten the viability
of an otherwise healthy ring-fenced bank. Allowing ring-fenced banks to
remain liable for a group pension scheme would thus leave open a
potential avenue of contagion from the group to the ring-fenced
bank.</hs_para>

for this reason that the ICB recommended that ring-fenced banks’
liabilities to group pension schemes should be removed or mitigated.
Proposed new Section 142W, as currently set out, therefore gives the
Treasury the power to require that ring-fenced banks make arrangements
to ensure that they cannot become liable for the pension liabilities of
any non-ring-fenced entity, or that they minimise such potential
liabilities if they cannot entirely prevent them arising. This could
involve segregating an existing pension scheme into discrete sections,
or splitting it into two separate schemes. Restructuring would largely
be executed through the existing means allowed for under pensions
legislation.</hs_para>

amendments to the powers as currently set out do not change the
overarching policy objective. They simply ensure that the powers are
wide enough to make sure that that objective is met in all scenarios.
Under the existing drafting, the Bill allows the Treasury to make

relation to potential statutory liabilities they have to multi-employer

amendments expand the scope of the power, allowing the Treasury to make
regulations requiring that a ring-fenced bank ensure that it cannot
become liable for the pension liabilities of non-ring-fenced banks, or
at least minimise its potential liabilities to them, whether the
liabilities are statutory—such as those which arise under the
employer debt legislation—or non-statutory, such as can arise
under contractual arrangements such as guarantees. The amendments also
allow the Treasury to make regulations including provisions to help the
banks to achieve the required separation of pension schemes, such as
enabling the trustees to split the scheme or transfer assets and
liabilities to a new scheme; and providing that a ring-fenced bank can
make an application to the court if it is unable to reach agreement
with a third party about the terms on which it should be released from
a contractual arrangement or guarantee giving rise to potential pension
liabilities.</hs_para>

addition, the amendments enable the Treasury to make regulations
requiring banks to do all they can to obtain clearance from the
Pensions Regulator for any restructuring undertaken to comply with
ring-fencing, to ensure that pension scheme members are adequately
protected. This strengthens the existing provision in the Bill which
only allows the Treasury regulations to require that a bank apply for
clearance.</hs_para>

the amendments introduce a power, allowing the Treasury regulations to
modify, exclude or apply legislation—including primary
legislation—for the purposes of achieving the required
separation of pension liabilities. Pension arrangements are inherently
long-term in nature, and the Government must be able to respond
flexibly to unforeseen developments as banks restructure their pension
schemes if they are to ensure that the 
<?notus-xml column=65?>economic independence of ring-fenced banks is preserved. Regulations
made under this power, like all regulations made under proposed new
Section 142W, will be subject to the draft affirmative resolution
procedure, and can be made only for the specific purposes outlined
above. These amendments therefore ensure that proposed new Section 142W
is effective in making the ring-fence

Eatwell (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord
for introducing this set of amendments about pension schemes. The
argument for the amendments raises two significant questions. We are
talking here about transitional arrangements: about moving from a group
pension scheme to what might in future be deemed to be necessarily
separate schemes for the ring-fenced and non-ring-fenced components of
a group. There must therefore be other transitional arrangements as
well—for example, property leases which are relevant to a group.
Are they, too, to be separated and decomposed? What are we going to do
about all those group liabilities similar to pension liabilities during
the period between the implementation of legislation for ring-fencing
and the conclusion when ring-fencing has been in place for some time?
Over that period, there have to be transitional arrangements. Clearly,
pensions are a very special case because the people will presumably
stay where they are, but there must be other elements of liabilities
which are also rather difficult to untangle. My first question is
therefore: what is the Government’s thinking about such
transitional
problems?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100826000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0002.htm#13100826000068">The
second question, which is much more specific to pensions and
immediately arises, is whether the separation will be to the detriment
of members of the pension scheme. This is precisely an area in which
scale can become enormously important in a pension scheme, especially
with respect to diversifying risk. The sheer scale of a pension scheme
can be a component of the commercial success of that scheme. If the
scheme is to be broken up, will it be to the significant detriment of
the pensioners? There must surely be some consideration of whether it
is to be their detriment and, if so, of what measures are to be taken
to remove that
detriment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T19:14:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100826000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0002.htm#13100826000069"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Higgins" PimsId="962" UID="13100826000152" xid="1263" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0002.htm#13100826000152">Lord

Deighton:</Member></B> On the noble Lord’s question about
transitional arrangements, the structure with respect to group
liabilities will generally to be to ensure that liabilities that are
particularly relevant to the newly structured organisations that fall
out of the ring-fencing arrangements are consistent with the businesses
that they are in, so that an operating unit is created which has
liabilities which match the business that it is running. If there was a
lease at the group level and the ring-fenced bank was the organisation
leasing the building, you would expect there to be an inter-company
arrangement which would pass the cost down to that level. That is the
principle and I think that most banks operate on that basis anyway
because one is trying to put the 
<?notus-xml column=66?>costs and revenues where the business is. There is a provision under
Part 7 of FiSMA which allows for transfer of business schemes if one is
moving other businesses, but that is a separate
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T19:16:24"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T19:16:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100826000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0002.htm#13100826000072">On
the question of banks and trustees, it is for the banks to work out the
practicalities. The legislation defines the objectives to make sure
that the ring-fenced bank is protected and that the trustees and
pension arrangements are protected in each case, which is why the
provisions here ensure that the regulator is contacted in each case.
Essentially, the cost of making this work, so that the pensioners are,
at a minimum, indifferent to the outcome, will sit with the bank. That
is the principle behind this. There may be some costs involved for the
banks to leave the pensioners no worse than indifferent, and those
costs are an intrinsic part of this separation and the advantages that
it brings

Deighton:</Member></B> We will certainly review the question in that
light. The principle behind this is that they would be separate pension
schemes. They may be very similar schemes which are separated, but the
notion here is that the ring-fenced bank would have one scheme and the
rest of the group would be under different arrangements, the key
objective being that the ring-fenced bank would not have an exposure to
the pension liabilities that arise elsewhere in the group. That is the
key principle
here.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13100826000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-0002.htm#13100826000171">Amendment

into line with the new senior managers regime recommended by the PCBS.
The intention behind Clause 5 is to make sure that directors of
ring-fenced banks always have regulatory approval to perform their
functions. The clause was introduced before the PCBS made its
recommendations about the new senior managers regime. It required
directors of ring-fenced banks to be approved persons when they carried
out designated significant influence functions, in the terminology of
the old regime. The Bill now introduces the senior managers regime, in
which the concept of a significant influence function has been
replaced. 
<?notus-xml column=68?>A technical amendment to the clause is therefore necessary to
require that the regulator, which can be the PRA or the FCA, always has
to designate directors of ring-fenced banks as senior managers, which
removes the references to the old

set to become a vital part of Britain’s infrastructure. This new
high speed line will open up opportunities for the UK that we have not
seen in generations. Its scope to transform this country is enormous,
bringing our cities closer together and reshaping the economic
geography of this country.</hs_para>

benefit the whole country, the Government understands the impact that
these proposals have on property owners affected by the route. We have
had a discretionary scheme in place for Phase One since 2010 to allow
us to buy properties from people experiencing exceptional hardship and
unable to sell because of our proposals. However, the Government has
always been clear that it intends to go further than this in order to
assist affected property owners. The proposals laid out today are
designed to do just that.</hs_para>

on long-term property compensation for Phase One. However, some of the
decision-making about the Government’s preferred schemes was
challenged in a judicial review and, in the light of the High
Court’s judgment in March 2013, the Government immediately
undertook to re-consult.</hs_para>

the new consultation, seeking the public’s views on a package of
measures designed to assist individuals in a range of circumstances,
whether their property is directly on the line of route or further
away. Though similar to the package consulted on previously, we have
taken a fresh look at the options available and introduced a number of
new ideas.</hs_para>

outlined two potential options which would provide further assistance.
One option is for the Government to issue property bonds, a
transferable guarantee that the Government would act as the buyer of
last resort for those living close to the Phase One route. We are also
seeking the public’s views on a voluntary purchase scheme for
owner-occupied properties within 120 metres of the Phase One
route.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310014000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-wms0001.htm#1310014000012">We are
committed to fairly compensating those who are affected and we want to
hear people’s views on the generous and comprehensive measures
we have set out. By supplementing the measures that are already 
<?notus-xml column=2?>available through the compensation code, these proposals go
significantly above and beyond what is required
under statute. Owner-occupiers within the safeguarded areas who sell
their homes to the Government would receive the payments laid down in
the compensation code. Those further away would receive 100% of the
unblighted value of their properties—that is, its value if there
were there no proposals for
HS2.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310014000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-wms0001.htm#1310014000013">Also

amendment to the Children and Families Bill that will make significant
changes to the legislation regarding young carers.
This is in line with the commitment made at Commons Report by my
colleague the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Children and
Families (Mr Edward Timpson) to look at how the legislation for young
carers could be improved. This amendment will be considered during the
House of Lords Committee stage of the Children and Families
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100825000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-wms0001.htm#13100825000005">Improving
outcomes for carers is a priority for this government as we said in
2010 when we published Recognised, valued and supported: next steps for
the carers strategy. We are clear that effective whole family
approaches to assessment are essential to improving support for adults
and young carers alike. My Department has been working with voluntary
sector partners for several years to encourage local services to adopt
‘whole family’ approaches to supporting young carers and
their families. In that time we have funded and shared some excellent
good practice examples and delivered numerous workshops and seminars.
While we have seen plenty of appetite for working in this way and some
changes to the way local services are designed and delivered, change
has been slow. Meanwhile, data from the National Census show us that
the number of young carers is
rising.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100825000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-wms0001.htm#13100825000006">Recent
evidence from the Children’s Society’s Hidden from View
report indicates that young carers are no more likely to be in contact
with support agencies than their peers. Carers Trust found that the
majority of those that are identified as young carers still do not get
an assessment of their needs or access to the support they and their
families need. The consequences can be serious and long lasting. Hidden
from View also found that young carers achieve on average nine grades
lower than their peers at GCSE which can have consequences for their
long term economic prospects and life choices.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13100825000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008-wms0001.htm#13100825000007">It is clear therefore
that we need to do more to support young carers. With the Care Bill
also under consideration by Parliament, this is an ideal opportunity to
ensure that young carers get equal consideration and protection. That
is not to say that they should be treated the same as adult carers. We
are committed to ensuring that young people are protected from
excessive or inappropriate caring responsibilities. The best way to
achieve that is to ensure that the person being cared for, whether that
is an adult or a child, is assessed and has all their eligible needs
met first. To do this effectively requires local services working
together across the statutory and voluntary sectors to consider the
whole family’s needs. Edward Timpson has worked and will
continue to work closely with Norman Lamb, Minister for Care and
Support at the Department of Health, to ensure that our respective
pieces of legislation and associated guidance work together to deliver
support to the whole family.</hs_para>

worked closely with interested parties over the summer, including the
Association of Directors of Children’s Services, the Association
of Directors of Adult Services, the National Young Carers Coalition,
the Local Government Association, practitioners and young carers
themselves. Our proposals reflect these discussions. We have also
identified key principles to consider in the drafting of regulations 
<?notus-xml column=4?>and statutory guidance about a whole family approach to
assessmentof adults under the Care Bill. Draft
regulations and guidance will be published for consultation in the
Spring.</hs_para>

to the Children and Families Bill we believe we have arrived at a
solution that will deliver four things: it will consolidate and
simplify the legislation relating to young carers’ assessments,
making rights and duties clearer to both young people and
practitioners; the right to an assessment of needs for support will be

“right to ask” for a PHB will be enshrined in secondary

it clear that clinical commissioning groups will need to develop the
capacity and capability to deliver PHBs, as it imposes an obligation to
give serious consideration to requests for PHBs. The “right to
ask” for a PHB is not the same though as an automatic
entitlement to a PHB. There will be some people for whom a PHB is not
appropriate because, for example, their existing package of care is the
best way of managing their needs.</hs_para>

to the House that the position is to be strengthened for those groups
who gain the “right to ask” for a PHB in April 2014, as
from October 2014 this group will further be given the “right to

people in receipt of NHS CHC and those transitioning in from social
care or children’s services will have continuity of care in the
services they receive. Those already on NHS CHC will be able to
continue to access the services they are familiar with as they will be
in control of how their budget is spent and have the confidence to
exercise choice. Similarly, those who are new to NHS CHC, those who
transition in from social care budgets or those who transition from
children’s services will be able to continue to access the
services they are accustomed to without the fear that this power to
choose will be taken away from them when they move to a new package of
care. There will continue to be people for whom PHBs are not
appropriate but by giving a “right to have” we will
ensure that they will only be declined on clinical or financial grounds
which are deemed to make a PHB unviable.</hs_para>

mortgage guarantee scheme is open to all lenders with permission to
enter into regulated mortgage contracts in the UK. The scheme rules set

contain safeguards to ensure that lending under the scheme is
responsible. For each loan, participating lenders will need to
demonstrate that the borrower was subject to an affordability test,
that the loan will remain affordable if there is a rise in the interest
rate, and that the lender has verified the borrower’s income.

the borrower was not “credit impaired” (using the
definition from the Financial Conduct Authority).</hs_para>

responsible lending are complemented by other features of the scheme
which ensure that the taxpayer is protected. If a lender chooses to
participate in a given category of lending, they will be required to
put all eligible loans that they originate in that category into the
scheme. There are nine categories in total, with participation in each
LTV band (80-85%, 85-90% and 90-95% LTV) split into three categories
depending on whether the lender chooses to participate for loans for
new house purchase only, or also for different types of remortgage
transaction. This approach, whereby all eligible loans must be put into
the scheme, ensures that lenders cannot only use the scheme for their
riskiest loans.</hs_para>

today published the fee that lenders participating in the scheme in
2014 will pay when purchasing a guarantee. The fee charged to

set out in the scheme outline document published alongside the Budget,
the fee have been calculated so that the scheme is
self-financing and adheres to European Commission guidance on State
Aid. The fee therefore contains three elements: administration cost,
cost of capital and expected losses. The fee will be reset on an annual
basis to take account of any changes in the macro-economic forecast and
using data on mortgages already guaranteed under the scheme. Lenders
will be given the final fee for the following year 3 months in advance.
The fee levels for 2014, which will be charged as a percentage of the
original loan balance, will be:</hs_para> <hs_WAIndent>• 90

Following that annual assessment he has proposed that the FPC advise
him on whether the key parameters of the scheme—the house price
cap and the fee charged to lenders—remain appropriate. At the

threat to our national security. It includes drugs trafficking, human
trafficking, and organised illegal immigration, high value fraud and
other financial crimes, counterfeiting, organised acquisitive crimes
and cyber crime. It costs the United Kingdom at least £24
billion each year. Crime groups intimidate and corrupt and can have a
corrosive impact on our communities. Cybercrime undermines confidence
in our communications technology and online economy. Organised
immigration crime threatens the security of our borders. We regard
human trafficking as a pernicious form of modern slavery. Financial
crime may undermine the integrity and stability of our financial
markets and institutions. Overseas, organised crime undermines good
governance and the stability of countries of strategic importance to
our national security. Organised Crime Groups can facilitate or engage
in terrorism.</hs_para>

the single authoritative intelligence picture of the threat to the UK
from serious and organised crime and it will have cutting edge
capabilities. It will work closely with the police and others, and have
a mandate to lead and coordinate the national response. We will also
ensure that new local partnership boards bring all available powers to
bear against organised crime; there is more capability in Regional
Organised Crime Units; there are new powers to attack organised crime,

raising awareness of the reality of serious and organised crime through
new education and communications programmes; using existing
intervention programmes (such as for gangs and troubled families) to
prevent people from being drawn into different types of organised crime

Prevention Orders. And at the same time, we will better manage the

sector about the threats we face. We want to see better collaboration
between law enforcement and local authorities to contain the risk of
organised crime benefiting from local authority procurement and the
public to be better informed. And we are proposing a range of new

allegations of impropriety very seriously. The Department stripped the

found:</hs_para><hs_WAIndent>• During the winding up period
there had been serious control weaknesses in the Corporation leading to
irregular payments in lieu of notice because of a failure to issue
redundancy notices in good time, and failure to seek and obtain
explicit approval for such payments from the

and the purchase of software incurred in the period
from April 2012 to closure was not in accordance with the
Corporation’s policy and was novel and contentious. Approval
should have been sought from the Department to incur this expenditure
but this was not done.</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>• The Chairman
and Chief Executive set up  a company together in May 2012
while still employed by the Corporation. The involvement of the
Chairman and Chief Executive in the company was not reported in the

Rt. hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced the splitting up of the

reporting to Ministers; an immigration and visa service and an
immigration enforcement organisation. The immigration and visa service
will provide a high volume service that makes high quality decisions

businessmen and visitors who want to come here legally. This new
service has already started making encouraging progress in reducing
substantially the stock of permanent and temporary migration
applications awaiting decision. The Government is determined that this
progress should be maintained but given the deep seated problems which
beset the former UKBA, as described in the Home Secretary’s
statement on 26 March 2013, Official Report, columns 1500-1510, it is
likely to be some years before the system is functioning smoothly with

Obligation (RO), the small-scale Feed-in Tariffs (FiTs) scheme, and in

obligations on energy suppliers. Electricity suppliers can recover the
costs they incur by meeting their obligations under these schemes by
passing through this cost to their consumers—DECC does not
dictate how they should do this. Suppliers will determine the share of
these costs recovered from different types of consumers. The assumption
used for DECC's analysis is that costs will be spread evenly over each
unit of energy consumed. Given the respective shares of electricity
consumption, this implies households will face approximately one-third
of the costs and non-domestic consumers (including businesses, industry

overseas in order to check the authenticity of UK passports.

reference to individuals or their personal information. There is no
requirement for these certificates to be treated confidentially. Some

Senior Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local
Government &amp; Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness Warsi)
(Con):</Member> There are six recommendations of the European Court of
Auditors (ECA) report, four of which concern the EU's Rule of Law
Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) in particular. These are: stronger
benchmarking; better coordination; that Common Security and Defence
Policy (CSDP) missions operate at maximum capacity; that CSDP missions
have a legal personality. Many of these recommendations have been
implemented following the 2012 strategic review of
EULEX.</hs_para><hs_WAIndent>a) On stronger benchmarking: the UK has
led the drive for stronger benchmarking for EULEX, and the mission is
now monitored according to these benchmarks every month. The UK has
pushed for benchmarking across all CSDP missions.</hs_WAIndent>
<hs_WAIndent>b) On better coordination: The Joint Rule of Law
Coordination Board established in 2012, has enhanced communication
between EULEX and the EU Office. The double-hatting of Samuel Zbogar,
as Head of the EU Office and EU Special Representative (EUSR), means
that the EUSR can now provide political guidance to
EULEX.</hs_WAIndent> <hs_WAIndent>c) On CSDP missions operating at
maximum capacity: Staffing issues have been improved
by allowing Member States longer to recruit, and through more strategic
planning for EULEX’s longer term staffing needs. This allows for
unmanned posts to be cut where there is no demand for them. There is
more work to be done. For example, EULEX still has too many unoccupied
positions and the rate of staff turnover within other Member State
secondees is too high.</hs_WAIndent> 
<?notus-xml column=24?><hs_WAIndent>d) That CSDP missions have a legal personality:
We understand that the European Commission 
and External Action Service (EAS) intend to  make a change to
the legal identity of missions. This would ensure that Heads of Mission
are not personally responsible for the mission itself, particularly in
terms of EULEX expenditure and staffing. This is a proposal that the UK
is broadly in favour of, but which we need to consider carefully
because of competence
issues.</hs_WAIndent><hs_para UID="13100829000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008w0001.htm#13100829000188">The
UK has sought to support these recommendations in our contribution to
EULEX. For instance, the ECA report criticized EULEX for an unhelpfully
high turnover of staff. The UK actively supports the extension of
contracts for high-quality secondees, and UK staff (excluding police)
often deploy for three years or more. The UK continues to push for more
streamlining of the EULEX mission in Brussels, and we have lobbied for
benchmarks, end states and exit strategies in all CSDP missions. We
have also insisted that CSDP missions are coordinated with the wider
range of EU
instruments.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13100829000477" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008w0001.htm#13100829000477">Legislation</hs_DebateHeading><hs_DebateType>Question</hs_DebateType></NewDebate><hs_TabledBy UID="13100829000525" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131008w0001.htm#13100829000525">Asked

Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member> The rise in Civil Service Pension
Scheme joiners recorded between 2011 and 2012 is mostly as the result
of organisations joining the Scheme from elsewhere in the

are several factors that can influence numbers leaving active
membership, including individual choice and departmental planning, and
these numbers will therefore vary from year to year as will the number
