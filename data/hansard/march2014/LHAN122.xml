number of EU member states, and was discussed at the EU CITES
management meeting in December. We continue to consider what measures
the EU can take. For example, parties to CITES can place a reservation
on a species, which means that they are not bound by the CITES controls
relating to that species. We will, through the EU, continue to
encourage countries such as Japan and others to withdraw their
reservations on, for example, whale
species.</hs_para>

number of cohabiting relationships. It went up over the last Government
from more than 
<?notus-xml column=1216?>600,000 to 1.1 million. It is somewhat flattening now; it currently
stands at 1.2 million. The noble Baroness is right in that the actual
figure is that those couples are four times more likely to split when
their child is under three than if they are married. However, there are
some structural and major societal changes behind those trends, and it
will take an enormous amount of effort to start putting marriage back
into its rightful place. That is exactly one of the things that we are
looking to do with the family stability

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord
Nash) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, within the Department for Education
we have a very tough process of performance management for academy
chains. The vast majority are sponsored academies—that is,
schools which have in most cases previously been allowed to languish in
failure for years. Sponsored academies are now improving at double the
rate of local authority-maintained schools. In the small number of
cases where an academy is not performing well, we hold the trust to
account and challenge it to take decisive action. We have a
zero-tolerance approach to failure. Since 2011, we have issued 41
pre-warning notices to underperforming academies and these have proved
highly

Hughes of Stretford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the question here is
not individual academies but chains that have been allowed to take over
very large numbers of schools. In fact, it is reported that E-ACT, the
subject of my Question, has now lost control of 10 of its 34
schools—a third after damning Ofsted inspections of those
schools. Over the weekend, we heard that another big chain has claimed
£1 million for so-called ghost pupils. Has not the Secretary of
State been reckless in allowing big business to take over such 
<?notus-xml column=1221?>large numbers of our schools without any continuing oversight of its
ability to do so? Will he now agree with us, with Ofsted and apparently
also with his Schools Minister, David Laws, that to protect the
interests of children, parents and teachers, Ofsted should be allowed
to inspect not just the schools but these very big sponsoring

lot of schools which were failing and in very challenging situations.
Personally, I think that big business being involved in the academy
programme is an excellent idea, and it was of course the noble Lord,
Lord Adonis, who introduced this. As I said, this programme, which we
are extending, is working extremely well, and we have extremely
rigorous oversight of academy chains. We welcome Ofsted’s batch
inspection of schools in academy chains and the support that it gets
from those chains. However, Ofsted has a lot to do and, given the very
tight grip that we have on the central management of these chains, we
do not think that it is necessary for it to go any further than
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:02:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

That is not the case with local authorities, among which there are many
unfortunate failures. Nearly 400 local authority schools are in special
measures and 30 have been in special measures for 18 months. As my

discussed this matter on 24 February. It is difficult to think of a
greater threat to European security in the recent history of the
continent. This incursion by Russia into the sovereign territory of a
neighbour, far beyond the bases in Ukraine for which it has lease
arrangements, breaks a raft of international laws and obligations. The
Statement repeats them: it is contrary to the Charter of the United
Nations, the Helsinki Final Act, the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 and
the Russia-Ukraine bilateral agreement of 1997 on military bases. It
breaks all the agreements guaranteeing Ukrainian territorial
integrity.</hs_para>

by the Foreign Secretary and his visit to the Ukraine are to be
applauded. The visit to Paris tomorrow is also important for carrying
the process forward. It is helpful that Secretary Kerry has been so
directly involved, as is the EU generally, and of significance that
Chancellor Merkel has taken a leading role. Efforts at NATO are also of
the first importance. Security co-operation is now becoming a
non-credible option as far as NATO and Russia are concerned.</hs_para>

step back. I think we all fear that it will not. It has no
justification for its actions. The justifications it purports to
provide—a letter from a fleeing and discredited President and
the ever more extravagant denigration of the people and the interim
Government of Ukraine, using fanciful and, on occasions, grotesque
language—are raucous and synthetic. It is language that I
suspect is constructed largely for a Russian domestic audience,
designed to arouse popular memories of what was indeed a terrible
period of Nazi invasion of Soviet territory and the unspeakable loss of
lives at the hands of the Nazis. But it is not a credible description
of the present and it runs the manifest risk that all such exercises
do: that a belligerent state gradually comes to believe its own
rhetoric. If Russia continues its current line of approach, it must be
viewed as a threat to the south-east of Ukraine as a whole. Precisely
this trajectory was discussed in your Lordships’ House last
week.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14030462000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000098">First,
this should not be allowed to drift, by accident or design, into armed
conflict. The restraint of the Ukrainian people, state and forces is
exceptional and commendable. I am sure that that will be felt right
across the United Kingdom. It has been statesmanlike. As a result,
there is no excuse for Russia to move from its current level of
aggression to out-and-out violence. What we all need now is a process
of de-escalation. All efforts at diplomacy must be made and the
multinational institutions must step up to the mark—and quickly.
It is clear that diplomacy has had little traction so far. However,
appeals not to isolate Mr Putin have followed and, perhaps predictably,
they have been unsuccessful. Nevertheless, nobody can be put off from
making the
effort.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000099">I say
the efforts have been unsuccessful. Chancellor Merkel found herself
talking to a leader living, as she put it, in a parallel
universe. Despite Germany’s dependence on Russian gas, the
chancellor appears to have pulled no punches in what she said and I
applaud that. Mr Kerry encountered a policy mindset that reminded him
of the 19th century in its attitudes of large states to smaller
ones—I confess that I have reached back to study Bismarck to try
to find parallel language. Beyond dispute is that discussions setting
out what President Obama called the consequences of continued military
intervention fell on deaf ears. President Putin disregarded them, as he
did proposals for an internationally mediated process to ensure the
rights of Russian speakers in the Crimea and a formal special status to
protect them. Indeed, President Putin talked to President Obama having
already secured a unanimous vote in the Duma for military intervention.
The only conclusion it is safe to draw is that this is about
retrenching the Ukraine inside Russia’s sphere of influence
rather than anything else. It goes further than securing 
<?notus-xml column=1229?>Sevastopol, which was not in any case under threat.
The hurt that may be felt by a diminished global status is the target
Mr Putin seeks to address. The risks of the consequences do not appear
to be that great to him, and that should cause us
concern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000100">What
is needed now is a process of stabilisation. Russian leaders must be
able to calibrate—and do so on the basis of clear statements
from all the rest of us—the balance of diplomatic and economic
risks they face; that is, what have been described as the consequences.
Ukrainian leaders must also and clearly opt for inclusiveness. The
rights of populations within the country, including those speaking
Russian, must be protected and those peoples need to know they are
protected. I welcome the assurances that the Foreign Secretary received
about the status of Russian language legislation. That should be a very
helpful step. That is a basis for both the Ukraine and Russia moving
forward in some form of dialogue as soon as possible. A role in
defusing the crisis must be seized with both hands. Did the Foreign
Secretary raise other issues with the Ukrainians that might go in the

right honourable friend Douglas Alexander said in another place, Russia
needs to be clear and to understand the consequences of its actions.
His main point was that the rest of us need to understand the

assume that is going ahead and that we will attend it. What was said by
the Foreign Secretary at yesterday’s EU Foreign Affairs Council?
Is a process taking place of building from words about what the
consequences may be to taking action? Are Her Majesty’s
Government able to clarify what they advocate as the
“costs” and “consequences”? Again, I make

needed and the IMF itself needs to take an important role. That role
will be taken against a background, as the Statement says—again,
I am glad that this is in the Statement—of dealing with poor

which people will be more attentive to what is required of them than

the rhetoric that we are hearing through some media channels in Russia

concerns that there may be in relation to, for example, the Russian

comprehensive and detailed Statement and for all the efforts that are
being deployed on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government to try to
stabilise and resolve this situation. The noble Lord, Lord Triesman,
mentioned Mr Putin’s propensity to expand his reach with what is
beginning to appear as a dangerous frequency. However, the lessons for
him in doing this will impact not only on international peace and
security in Europe and in Ukraine but across the world. We have
territorial disputes in the South China and East China seas, which will
be watched extremely carefully by the parties to those disputes, and by
China.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14030462000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000113">My
noble friend did not mention one specific point, which I wonder whether
she could respond to. It concerns the status of the referendum in
Crimea at the end of the month and, should that referendum go in the
direction of independence, the danger of what will happen in
humanitarian terms to people who wish to be on the Ukrainian side of
that argument. Can she reflect—perhaps not today but the next
time we come back to this, as I am sure we will—on whether the
international community, through the OSCE and the United Nations, can
offer protection and safe passage for Ukrainian military personnel
deployed in Crimea to get back to Ukraine, and for those citizens who
for whatever reason, such as disturbances, riots or violence, may need
to be evacuated and relocated? Thought and contingency planning should

Warsi:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend for her words of support
and for the specific issues that she raised. The Foreign Secretary made
it clear in the other place earlier today that, all over the world,
there are situations where individual communities in areas of a country
feel that they have a right to self-determination. That is right within
the parameters of the constitution of a country; indeed, this
Parliament has passed legislation allowing parts of a country to have a
referendum in relation to their future. However, we are talking here
about a completely different situation, which to some extent takes away
from what may have been planned for the future of Ukraine, and for
Crimea as part of it. This is the violation of the territorial
integrity of a sovereign nation and it is therefore important that, at
this stage, we keep pressing to make sure that Russia recognises and
respects that. It should certainly adhere to the statements that were
made in

Davies of Stamford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, there is a very
widespread feeling in the world that Vladimir Putin’s ultimate
ambition is to restore the frontiers of the Soviet empire and the
Tsarist empire. If he succeeds in de facto occupying—or even,
one might say, de facto annexing—the Crimea, that surely will be
a great encouragement to him to proceed with that agenda a bit further;
in fact, he would probably become a great hero to nationalist sentiment
in Russia. Against that background, is it not important that not only
do we have the right sanctions to apply if it is not possible to
achieve some diplomatic solution over the next few days and weeks, as
we all hope, but also that we look again at the long-term signals that
we are sending to Russia? We should review two things in particular:
first, the dependence of the European Union on Soviet, or rather
Russian, natural gas—surely as an urgent strategic priority we
should try to reduce that—and, secondly, the deplorable signal
that we, along with many other EU countries, have been sending in
reducing our defence expenditure. Terrible tragedies have happened in
history because the wrong signals were sent to a potentially aggressive
party.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000119"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warsi" PimsId="5263" UID="14030462000402" xid="1971" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000402">Baroness
Warsi:</Member></B> My Lords, no doubt there is previous history in a
very similar matter. We can draw parallels between Russia’s
intentions in what is happening now with what happened not so long ago
in relation to Georgia. That is something that we are acutely aware of.
Only last week we were talking about sanctions with regard to Ukrainian
politicians and now here we are talking about sanctions of a completely
different kind. That just shows how quickly the situation is moving on
the ground. We have already seen some of the consequences of sanctions
and economic costs in what is being felt within Russia in relation to
both its currency and its stock exchange. As to what is now happening
and the consequences of Russia’s actions, it is important that
we keep up that pressure. I do not 
<?notus-xml column=1233?>think that a military option is on the
table—the noble Lord opposite was kind enough to refer to
that—and therefore I do not draw any parallels in relation to
defence
expenditure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000120"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hannay of Chiswick" PimsId="3746" UID="14030462000403" xid="1625" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000403">Lord
Hannay of Chiswick (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I hope that the
Minister accepts my warm support for the careful enumeration at the
beginning of the Statement of the international obligations and
breaches of international law that have taken place. That is absolutely
vital. Since it is quite clear from the Statement that Russia has not
fulfilled its obligations as a member of either the Council of Europe
or the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, will the
future position of Russia in those organisations be one of the areas
under consideration? Would she also accept my very strong agreement
with her that there is absolutely no parallel with the peaceful
separation of the Czech Republic and Slovakia? Many years before, of
course Slovakia had been the object of something that much more closely
resembles what Mr Putin has been doing in the
Crimea.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000121"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warsi" PimsId="5263" UID="14030462000404" xid="1971" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000404">Baroness

and I thank him for his warm words. I agree with him that
Russia’s membership of organisations has to be because Russia
agrees with the values of those organisations regarding democracy and
human rights. When it clearly appears to be violating the very values
that it seeks to espouse in those organisations, then of course they
have to consider whether such membership is appropriate. However, these
are all matters that will be discussed and will be part of the package
of options available to the international community. I return to what
the intention is: it must be to de-escalate the situation and do
whatever is needed to get to that

have these interests in Russia and Europe that we feel it is important
that it is in our

de-escalate the situation and return to a politically stable Ukraine.
Of course the EU and the United Kingdom need Russia, but it is also
important to stress that Russia needs the EU as much as the EU needs
Russia, and Russia has to be reminded of the cost of not being part of,
and playing its role as part of, the international

a member of NATO, we would be stepping towards a situation where we
could actually go to war. I am not suggesting for a moment that we
should use military force in this situation, but we could, and I share
my noble friend’s view about the dangers for Europe of having
cut defence expenditure. My question relates specifically to so-called
smart sanctions. Broad sanctions seem to me to cause real damage to
Europe, ourselves and everybody, not least to ordinary members of the
Russian population. What is the Government’s view on so-called
smart sanctions on leaders who have taken certain decisions within
Russia, such as freezing their assets and stopping their visas, and do
they believe that they would have an impact in making them think about
what they are doing?</hs_para>

point. Although Ukraine is not a member of NATO, it has a long-standing
relationship with NATO and contributes to NATO operations, and has done
so for many years. I am, with my wide portfolio in the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office, responsible for sanctions and therefore have
spent some time considering what we call smart sanctions: well judged
and well targeted sanctions that have impact. Sanctions should not be
to make us feel better; they should be put in place so that they work

accept that we should be cautious about being quite so dismissive about
the military implications of what has happened in Ukraine? I am not
referring to military intervention in Ukraine by this country or other
members of NATO, but about current members of NATO. Some of our most
recent members have a memory that does not need to stretch back very
far to create a great shadow of fear of Russia. Having worked very
closely with some of these nations, I can assure your Lordships that
that fear is very real and very existent. Some of these nations have
Russian-speaking minorities. Will the UK Government do everything
within their power to ensure that in the ongoing negotiations and
discussions, NATO takes every possible action to demonstrate
unequivocally to Russia its commitment, its capability and its will to
defend all of its members under Article

was being dismissive in relation to potential military action; I was
trying to say that it is important that we do not hypothesise 
<?notus-xml column=1235?>about whether certain things—for example, if
defence spending had been done differently or a certain decision on
another foreign policy issue had been taken differently —would

the Russian Black Sea fleet being based there. It is against that

Putin’s press conference late this morning, as I did, they would
have been left in absolutely no doubt whatever that he is unimpressed
by all the threats that are being made against him. He may not in his
heart of hearts believe that, but that is what he is saying. He is not
impressed by sanctions, or by this or that with which we are
threatening him. Is it not the truth that, as the noble Lord, Lord

it not be far better if we stopped constantly saying that territorial

Putin will get a lot of what he wants? In the end, Ukraine cannot exist
if a part of that nation is in constant turmoil and being threatened by
Russia. It would be far better, in my view, if an arrangement was

and Ukraine. However, we must also not forget that a sovereign nation
has been violated, and this cannot be the way in which we conduct

Empey (UUP):</Member></B> My Lords, two potential processes can affect
the size of the Assembly. The noble Baroness has mentioned one process
but, of course, there is a second, over which the Assembly has no
control whatever—that is, if a future Parliament decides to
reduce the number of seats in the House of Commons, as was the case in
this Parliament. The net effect of that would have been to reduce the
size of the Assembly by two constituencies, thereby reducing its
membership by 12. If the Assembly decided to reduce itself to
90 Members, which would be the proposal if you reduced by
one seat per constituency, it would have no control over the fact that
it could subsequently be reduced to 80; that would be an entirely
separate process over which it has no control. Incidentally, I do not
accept that the size of the Assembly is exclusively a matter for the
Assembly. The size was determined by agreement, and therefore is at
this point in time not a matter exclusively for the
Assembly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:02:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000149">I
just make the point to the noble Baroness that there are two processes
that can affect the Assembly’s size. The Assembly may have
control of one, but it most certainly does not have control of the
other. That needs to be borne in mind. While the noble Baroness has
repeated to us on a number of occasions that there is no
consensus on certain things and therefore we cannot proceed with them,
I point out to her that there is no consensus on this in Stormont
either. It is merely setting out a stall, and I think that she was
trying to respond to some of the concerns that a number of us raised. I
still think that it is a tricky issue, and I caution the fact that
there could be a two-stage rocket here, and that the Assembly has no
control over a reduction in the size of the House of Commons, which
would have a subsequent effect on the size of the

in a more generic sense about what is literally going on at the moment
and what is being contrived. I was grateful to the Minister for turning
up at the meeting with the Secretary of State yesterday evening. I am
somewhat disappointed that she has not preceded the amendment with a
statement that would have clarified some of the points that we raised.
It appears to me—and I think most people would
accept—that we are being asked to legislate on Northern Ireland
affairs while they are being blanketed over by secret deals and
arrangements that are not in the interests of the people of Northern
Ireland, certainly not in the interests of the victims of the Troubles
in Northern Ireland, and not in the interests of those soldiers and
policemen who, to try to bring peace to our part of the United Kingdom,
gave their lives in considerable
numbers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:04:46"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:04:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000151">The
reality is that eight years ago, in the aftermath of the St Andrews
agreement, secret deals were carried out not with one section of our
society in terms of nationalist or unionist, but with one little caucus
within one section of our society. Those arrangements were
dishonourable in the

I had had a relative die in Regent’s Park, I would not have a
great deal of sympathy for a Government trying to build the future of
Northern Ireland, given their attitude to one of the perpetrators of
that outrage. I was closer to those victims than most in this Chamber,
and that is why I challenge the Minister on this issue on their behalf.
It is not always the case in another place but I always believed that
this House was an exemplar of democracy and doing things correctly, not
a place where we would seek to build on deceitfulness and sleight of

the Minister goes any further, will she address the reality of deceit
that pervades the relationship between Northern Ireland and the rest of

myself, people in Northern Ireland and, not least, the relatives of
soldiers and members of the Army who may still be subject to
investigation by the PSNI in respect of that unfortunate situation
40-something years ago, when we put young soldiers with no experience
of crowd control into a very difficult situation in Londonderry.
Perhaps she can tell me whether they are still under investigation by
the PSNI. That situation was more than unfortunate; it is something of
which we have been ashamed over the years. Some 40-something years on,
people in my age group are sitting at home wondering when they will be
hauled in front of the courts while the terrorists—the people

Alderdice (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, from the start when there was
discussion about reducing the number of Members of the Northern Ireland
Assembly, I have expressed some concern about it. I have never bought
the proposition that 108 Members was too large for Northern Ireland,
because of the complexity of representation and the running of affairs
in Northern Ireland. However, in a time of austerity, when the Assembly
and Executive have not exactly distinguished 
<?notus-xml column=1240?>themselves by the volume of quality legislation or governance that they
have produced, there is without a doubt public pressure to reduce its
size. At the same time, there is a substantial reduction in the number
of elected representatives at municipal level and an increasing
complexity in the running of events in Northern
Ireland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000155">One
thing that is clear, which we shall consider later, is that the
Government want to give more and more responsibility to the Northern
Ireland Assembly. If the Assembly were functioning well I would have no
objections, but it has not been functioning well. Indeed, over the past
week or two, given the recent events that were referred to by the noble
Lord, Lord Maginnis, relationships between the parties at the most
senior levels are worse than they have been for a long
time<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:10:11"></hs_TimeCode>. I
therefore want again to express concern about this whole question of
reducing the number of Members of the
Assembly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000156">However,
I value the amendment brought forward by the noble Baroness. It at
least makes it clear that you cannot simply keep on salami-slicing the
Assembly’s representation. However, there are often rather
superficial views of the work and value of Assembly Members, as
compared with the situation in Wales or Scotland, where the issues are
completely different. Devolution was not brought to Northern Ireland
for the same reasons for which it was introduced in Wales and Scotland.
There were different requirements and functions in addition to all the
important issues about making sure that governance is as close to the
people as possible and so on. I want to flag that
up<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:10:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

ignore the fact that the whole structure is now somewhat shaken by the
recent revelations about the on-the-runs letters issue. This is serious
because for the past few years there has been within the unionist and
loyalist community a sense of alienation. Whether that is justified is
not the issue, but we all know that it is there. At the same time, we
have elections coming up this year, next year and the year after, over
which there are all sorts of anxieties and concerns within the unionist
community and, indeed, more widely.</hs_para>

troubles me somewhat about the general drift of the Bill is that it
feels like some measure of disengagement. It is as though we are
saying, “We’ve got a resolution with the Good Friday
Agreement. These are big boys and girls, and it is time to let them get
on with things”. Not to be too trivial, it seems to me that it
is much more like bringing up teenagers and adolescents, whereby you
have to be there and not be there. There is no right way of doing it,
but you always have to make sure that you are available because, as
sure as eggs are eggs, problems will arise, and if you are not there to
help out there will be tragedy.</hs_para>

administration, the Northern Ireland Office is a tiny affair. It is not

Northern Ireland when Sir John Chilcot, who now has other
responsibilities, was a junior official at the Home Office and part of
his responsibility was all the Northern Ireland issues. It is not now
quite at that level, but it is getting there. Even within the Northern
Ireland Office as it is, there are very few people who remember what
was necessary for the peace process. The institutional 
<?notus-xml column=1241?>memory is almost threadbare. That is not the fault of the people who are
there; it is just the reality of what happens over a period of

Events<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:13:35"></hs_TimeCode> over the
past week or two have made it clear that there are serious issues to be
dealt with. Why were Mr Haass and Dr O’Sullivan brought in? It
was because there were problems regarding the legacy of the past that
had not been resolved and were unable to be resolved by the devolved
Assembly and Executive. So we did what we have done in the past and
asked people to come in from outside to help us. However, it is clear
that that did not
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000161">If the
Assembly and the Executive are unable to address the issue, and if
those eminent, thoughtful, committed and knowledgeable people who were
brought in were unable to resolve it, it seems to me that it is
incumbent on the British and Irish Governments at the highest levels to
address the question of how we deal with the issues of the past.
Although there are lots of matters that one can bring up regarding the
on-the-runs letters, this is fundamentally about how we deal with the
issues of the past, not just in terms of republicans but in terms of
loyalists, and particularly those who served in the security forces
over a long period, who still wonder what the future holds for
them.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14030462000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000162">Without
wanting to drag this out, I emphasise that it feels—although
this may not be the case—as though there is an element of
pulling back and disengagement in the drift of the Bill. What has
happened in the past week or two has been a very clear demonstration
that this is not a time for disengagement, emotional or otherwise.
Rather, at the highest levels of government— I am
talking about the level of Prime Minister and Taoiseach—there
needs to be some responsible re-engagement between the British and
Irish Governments and the leaders of the Executive in Northern Ireland
to address the issues of the past and all that they mean. There should
not be a feeling that we can simply shovel them back over the water and
hope that everything will work out well. That is what happened between
1921 and the late
1960s.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000163">For

in that way. We all know that it is absolutely essential that teenagers
with delinquent tendencies have clear boundaries. In that situation,
nothing is worse than letting people think that the boundaries can be
blurred and that they can get away with things. Unfortunately, that has

Conservative Ministers were engaged in the decision. The decision to
continue doing this was made by Owen Paterson. I wonder what advice he
received to lead to that. I am very disappointed that it did not occur
to him or to the other Ministers involved to say, “This is
something which we should not have anything to do with. The previous
Government may have done it but this is not something which we should
put our hand to at all”. I have to say that I applaud what David
Ford has said on this matter that he is not going to tolerate it in his
department. Of course it should have been devolved to his department in
2010 but it continued after that being run by the Northern Ireland

O'Loan (CB):</Member></B> I wish to speak first of the reduction, the
possible reduction and future reduction in the number of
constituencies. The constituency in which I live is some 75% or 80%
unionist. Of the original seats, two managed to elect nationalist,
non-unionist politicians. The boundaries were withdrawn. One of the
nationalist seats disappeared, so we are now down to five unionist and
one nationalist seat. I declare an interest because my husband held one
of those seats in the

point is that the impact of reducing the number of seats on the
possibility of there being any purpose at all in voting in Northern
Ireland is something of which the people of Northern Ireland are very
aware. There are whole constituencies on both sides of the divide where
people feel that at present there is little purpose in voting. We have
single transferable voting so there is some purpose but I would very
much endorse the words of my noble colleagues in regretting any attempt
not to preserve the current numbers of Members of the

about a matter which other noble Lords have addressed; namely, the
crisis—it is a crisis—in the justice system in Northern

throughout our
community.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000175">There
has been no discussion in your Lordships’ House about what was
done. Last week, a man walked free from court because he had had a
letter that said the police had no interest in him. As the noble Lord,
Lord Trimble, said, we believe that there are 187 such letters. I heard
one former Secretary of State talk of the possibility of 200 such
letters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000176">The
problem is that letters of comfort may or may not have had the effect
of removing the possibility of any future prosecution—not least
because their very existence gives rise to the possibility of an abuse
of process application in the event of any attempt to prosecute, but
also because the letters of comfort have generated such consternation.
There was no knowledge of these letters of comfort among the general
population of Northern Ireland. It was a betrayal of the
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000177">Great
courage was needed to do some of the things that had to be done, and I
pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, for what he did to bring
peace to Northern Ireland. However, it was a very difficult time, and I
have said repeatedly in your Lordships’ Chamber that this deal
is not done and settled; it is a very fragile state of affairs. The
noble Lord, Lord Trimble, told us that Adams said it would be better if
it were an invisible process—but it was an invisible process. I
know, because in 2001 I was investigating cases involving IRA men who
were acting as agents of the state for the police. In investigating
those cases I had to look at the criminality of the IRA personnel. The
HET is investigating the criminality of the IRA personnel, and the PSNI
currently is also investigating that criminality. Neither the HET nor
the criminal investigations branch of the PSNI was informed of the
situation. None of us knew who we might have in our sights, if you
like, and who would have been taken out of the sights of the Director
of Public Prosecutions by virtue of a letter that may or may not have
been issued, which may or may not have been correct in its terminology
but which ultimately might have the effect of compromising any
possibility of
prosecution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000178">In
such circumstances, the Government are spending huge sums of money to
sustain a criminal justice system in Northern Ireland that is based on,
to some extent, very significant failure. Throughout the Haass talks,
there was a lot of talk about how we would deal with the past; it was
one of the three strands of the talks. As I understand it, the

of those, from all parts of the community, who were fighting very

essential ingredient in coming to the Good Friday agreement was trust,

without, therefore, a fair number of secrets. I make no complaint about
the fact that I and my committee were not privy to all the secrets, but
I have to say that I was profoundly disturbed last week when, for the
first time, we became aware of these letters. The reason I was
particularly concerned was that it created a retrospective imbalance
between the communities in Northern Ireland: “Oh, if
they did that, what else might they have done?”. A breakdown of
trust could undo all that has been achieved, painfully and
courageously, over the past 15 or 16

am glad therefore that the Prime Minister responded very quickly and

judicial figure. That is right. I am glad also that Mr Hain made the

this afternoon by other noble Lords. However, we have to go forward in 
<?notus-xml column=1246?>Northern Ireland without constantly wondering who
let down whom in the past, and I very much hope that we can reach an
agreement in the Province whereby there will be no more digging up. We
have to know precisely what happened with the letters and to whom they
were sent but we do not want to have another Saville, which took so
long and cost so much. My committee had seven Labour members, four from
the Province, myself as chairman and one other Tory. We were as one in
feeling that commitment to major further public inquiries was not
necessarily in everyone’s best interests. We made an exception
in our report on the Omagh bombing, where we said that further
consideration must be given, but even there we were not advocating a

dealt a very severe blow, and I am grateful to my noble friend for
allowing us the latitude that we have this afternoon. It would have
been wrong if this House had not had the chance to reflect on these
matters, but I hope that we can now move forward and soon have a wider

comments about delinquent children. As a product of the Province about
which he was talking, I have tried to keep my delinquent tendencies
under control. He and I spent many a happy hour together talking about
the foundations of what was eventually to be the Good Friday agreement,
and he will recall that there was always a tendency to say at a certain
point, “This really ought to be moved up the chain of command to
the very top”. There is a well established political ambience in
Northern Ireland where, when things get particularly difficult, the
inclination is to say, “Let the Prime Minister of the United
Kingdom and the Taoiseach sort it out for us”, or at the very
least to give them the opportunity to put pressure on us local
politicians so that we can use them as an excuse for doing what is
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000187">I hope
my noble friend will not mind if I say that I did not quite buy the
analogy. There has to come a time in Northern Ireland when, no matter
how difficult it is, the locally elected people see it as being in

take on the very difficult stuff. I yield to no one in my understanding

too, want to show my appreciation for the work that my noble friend
Lord Trimble did. He was key to this process and, as is frequently the

to them for what I was able to learn from their leadership. But their
leadership consisted of us dealing with the Northern Ireland political

necessarily say that about all of the build-up to the agreement. I
remember the first time that my noble friend Lord King told me about
the proposed details. He asked me, as an Ulsterman, for my reaction and
I said, “The unionist community will not like”—and
I mentioned three things. I went on to say, “They will not like
it very much”. His reply is burned into my memory:
“That’s not what my officials are telling me”. Of
course, those officials, by deliberate decision, excluded all Northern

could argue that whatever within the law had to be done to move forward
the possibility of a better relationship between the two Governments
and the two parts of the island of Ireland, was worth it. Personally, I
take that view. I understand how difficult the agreement is, but it was
a historic net plus for the island of Ireland and for the people of
Northern Ireland. However, there is all that has been
said—including by my noble friend Lord Maginnis, if he will
permit me to call him that—about the hurt, sacrifice, bloodshed,
killing and lack of being held responsible on the part of so many
people. Not even your Lordships’ House in all its strength,
wisdom and experience can sweep that emotion under the carpet as if it
is of no concern. That is why over the past week I have
been—what is the diplomatic word that would pass your
Lordships’ approval?—disappointed in the former Secretary
of State, Mr Hain. To argue that because people understood that there
was a problem about on-the-runs meant that everybody knew exactly what
was happening was disingenuous to the point of, well, being
really disingenuous. People knew there was a problem but did not know
what the solution to that problem
was.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000192">The
second thing that bothers me greatly is the claim that these letters
were only an administrative process. As we have heard this afternoon,
the Attorney-General was involved in repeating that claim.
When I was Minister in the Northern Ireland Office we did not
do administrative processes: a Minister was responsible and had to say
“yes”. Nobody has told us which Northern Ireland
Ministers and which British Ministers said “yes, go
ahead” to this. I do not want to hear anything more about it
being “only a bureaucratic activity” or
“administrative process”. That is not the constitutional
way in which the British Government operate. Let us come clean on this.
I look to my noble friend on the Front Bench to come clean at the end
of this debate. If people are to have confidence and trust, they must
be treated not as delinquent children but as grown-up adults who can
take the truth and handle that
truth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000193">One
final thing: I am pleased that we are debating this. I share my
noble friend Lord Trimble’s disappointment—I think he
used a stronger word—that Ministers in our party have continued
to behave following 
<?notus-xml column=1248?>the bad example of the Minister in the preceding
Government. However, maybe because I am getting old and
cynical—I hope not—I am also seriously disappointed that
my noble friend on the Front Bench did not address this issue at the
start of proceedings rather than at the end. I heard her say that she
would reply after she had heard the views expressed. What your
Lordships’ House needed was a definitive government statement
that would have set the framework for the rest of us to express views,

to the debate this afternoon, I am reminded of two factors that I would
beg the Minister to keep in mind when she responds to this debate.
First, it is not just political voices that we must listen to today.
We have to listen to widows. We have to listen to little
children who are now adults. We have to listen to those who are not
here to make their voice heard from Northern Ireland but who, through
those tremendously devastating years, hoped that they could make trust

some<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:47:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000197">The
events of the past few days have not just shattered the trust of so
many of us but have raised questions that, in their turn, have raised
other questions: questions about misleading; questions about lies; and
questions of a lack of trust in high places. Whatever we argue about
this afternoon, and whatever we disagree about, of course there was a
price to be paid for peace, of course things had to be done which were
in a grey area, rather than black and white. I accept that, and I know
something of the agony through which many decision-makers had to pass
to make those decisions and to make those policies a possibility and a
brick towards peace, but there is a limit to the way in which the
elastic of public trust can be pushed or pulled. I beg the Minister to
recognise that in listening to the voices that she has heard in this
debate, the voices that she will not hear in this Chamber are saying,
“Who do we trust, who can we depend on and what is the honest
emotional answer to the grievous memories we have of the
past?”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000198">Secondly,
I ask the Minister to remember this. While of course we have to look
forward and have our hopes for the future, and while so much has been 
<?notus-xml column=1249?>achieved in the political process for which we must
be thankful, I beg the Government to realise that we are talking about
a very fragile situation and that one little incident can be multiplied
out of all proportion and used to build on mistrust. I therefore share
the view that it would have been helpful had we had a Statement at the
beginning of this debate, rather than allowing our emotions to build up
with other questions. I look forward to the Minister’s response

consultative group on the past of Northern Ireland. We produced many
suggestions. I venture to suggest that some of those proposals should
been given more serious consideration five years ago than in fact
turned out to be the case. Many are now recognising, as they say to me,
that we should have given more consideration to some of those proposals

Lexden (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Trimble spoke
for me regarding the events of last week. I associate myself completely
with his remarks.  
<?notus-xml column=1250?>I have two questions arising from what he said, and
to which he himself gave voice. I shall repeat them and ask the
Minister for replies to them. First, how was this dishonourable and
disreputable policy allowed to continue under the current Government,
from whom I and many others hoped for better standards and a better
approach? Secondly, why was all knowledge and all information about
this policy withheld from the devolved institutions when security and
justice were passed to them? We have been told repeatedly in this
debate that we must respect the devolved institutions and that they
must have entire responsibility for those things that are in their
Province and devolved to them. Now we hear that the Government
themselves have not adhered to that principle.
Why?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000204"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McAvoy" PimsId="5756" UID="14030462000431" xid="2033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000431">Lord
McAvoy (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak briefly to the
amendments. The Opposition welcome them. In Committee, concerns were
expressed by several noble Lords about the current provision in Clause
6 to make a reduction in the size of the Assembly a reserved matter.
These amendments would limit any reduction in the size of the Assembly
to five members per constituency, and would make it clear that any
reduction must have cross-community support in the Assembly. They would
also prevent the Secretary of State putting forward for Royal Assent
any Bill passed in the Assembly to reduce its size if that Bill did not
have cross-community
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000205" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000205">I
place on record the Official Opposition’s respect and admiration
for the contributions made by several noble Lords in the House today.
The situation over the past week has been extremely difficult, and it
is good to have an opportunity to discuss it. The House has served
Parliament and the country well with the tone and content of all the
comments, which have been reasoned, informed and constructive. They
have looked forward, with no great hassle about delving into the past
but recognising that the past is presenting problems. As we have all
discussed before, Northern Ireland is on a journey, and this is a
particularly bumpy part of the road.</hs_para>

particularly the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, about
disengagement. The message must go out from the Chamber today that
there is no disengagement. The message must go to the UK Government,
the Republic of Ireland Government and all parties in this House and in
the other place that we cannot allow this situation to derail the whole
process. There are legitimate questions to be asked and it is right
that they are, but today’s contributions give me hope that we
will collectively get over this situation because of the reasoned
response of so many Members with so much experience in this House and
in Northern Ireland itself, and we will move on.</hs_para>

flexibility and maturity that other places are perhaps too strict to
deal with. This is not at all meant as a criticism of the Minister but,
in line with a point that has been made, I ask that in any future
Statement on this issue adequate time is allowed, rather than the usual
10 minutes that we would get. This debate today has showed that,
without taking overlong, the contributions have been extremely well
made, and I ask that any future Statement be that 
<?notus-xml column=1251?>little bit longer. As I say, that is not meant as a
criticism of the Government or the Minister, but the maturity and
dexterity demonstrated today by all concerned show that this House is
the place to deal with these

noble Lord, Lord Empey, made a point about the potential impact of
boundary changes in Westminster constituencies on the Assembly in
Northern Ireland. This issue could be looked at again in the
context of any reduction in the number of parliamentary
constituencies. Indeed, we would expect that to happen. Under the
provisions of the Bill, it would be open to the Assembly to reverse any
reduction if the number of Westminster constituencies were to be
reduced. Therefore, it could restore the number of representatives per
Westminster constituency to six, for example, to restore the overall
size of the
Assembly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000210">I
take issue with the point that the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, made
about this not being the time to give the Assembly additional powers.
It is important to reassure noble Lords that there is no plan
immediately to introduce all these potential changes. The Northern
Ireland Office and the Government are acutely aware of the importance
of timing and of dealing with this in the appropriate manner at the
appropriate time. As one or two noble Lords have said, it is important
that we develop and trust devolution. The point was made that the
problems we have had in the past week are problems associated not with
devolved government but with the UK Government. Therefore, it is not
appropriate to say that because we have a problem now we should not
trust devolution. It needs the opportunity to
grow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000211">I now
turn to the letters issued to so-called on-the-runs. One or two noble
Lords made a point about the timing of what I shall say in relation to
the debate as a whole. I remind noble Lords that we have tried to keep
the House informed. We have issued two Written Statements, and in the
other place there have been questions to the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland and the Attorney-General about them. I used the
opportunity of the Bill to try to overcome the procedural constraints
which I understand are frustrating noble Lords. I am trying to make the
best use of the time available. I assure the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy,
that I will do my very best, within the constraints of the procedure in
this House, which is agreed with the Opposition, to ensure that there
is adequate time to satisfy noble Lords on the various points that they
have raised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030462000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000212">I
entirely understand that many noble Lords are very keen to set on
record their deeply felt concerns about recent developments in Northern
Ireland. The Bill, of course, does not directly bear upon those
concerns, but it does indeed touch on the issue of confidence in the
institutions. It is important to bear in mind that, throughout the past
week, it has been 
<?notus-xml column=1252?>clear that Northern Ireland is no longer in a
position in which our business can be derailed by political
disagreements in quite the same way as was possible in the past. It is
essential to the peaceful and prosperous future of Northern Ireland
that ordinary, good government goes on. I acknowledge that this House
has not yet had the opportunity for debate that many noble Lords are
still seeking<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:05:33"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, I point out that, since the High Court judgment in the case of
John Downey was delivered on 21 February, there have been,
as I said, two Written Statements by the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland on 25 and 28 February. The Attorney-General has also
made a Written Ministerial Statement.</hs_para>

at the substantive facts as far as they are known, on coming into
office in May 2010, the Government were made aware of a list of names
submitted by Sinn Fein to the previous Government under an agreement
they had reached to clarify the status of OTRs. These were people
living outside the United Kingdom who believed that if they returned
they would be wanted by the police for questioning in connection with
terrorist offences committed before the Belfast agreement. One or two
noble Lords have asked why such a scheme was not available to
loyalists. It is my understanding that there had been no request for a
similar scheme.</hs_para>

the scheme, the police and, in some cases, the Public Prosecution
Service for Northern Ireland checked whether sufficient evidence
existed in each case at that time for these individuals to be
questioned, arrested or prosecuted if they returned to Northern Ireland
or any other part of the United Kingdom. If it was found that they were
not wanted by the police and that there was no prospect of any
prosecution based on the evidence available, the individuals were
informed of that fact by a letter from a Northern Ireland Office
official. The letters did not amount to immunity, exemption or amnesty
from arrest. I say to the noble Baroness that they were not letters of
comfort. They were factual

an investigation there would have had to have been a proper review of
the investigation file in respect of specific events and the

Lordships’ House is not worthy of an answer, but I am anxious
that the answer should be legally consistent and robust. This situation
has arisen in the last week. It is important that the Northern Ireland
Office and the Government are able to check their records to look in
detail at the history of the scheme. They will do so as part of the
evidence that they give to the inquiry. It is obvious that both civil
servants and current and previous Ministers will give evidence to this
inquiry, and it is important that the overall picture is taken to make
sure that it is accurate. I am sure that, once this inquiry reports,

finalised its report, which will be published on about 11 or 12 March.
When that happens, I ask the noble Baroness to draw it to the attention
of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, because there are
things that will be in that report that will bear very much on the
inquiry that has just been announced, in the light of which it would be
wise to make some changes to the way in which the Government are
proceeding. I do not want to go into further detail. I happen to know

Baroness is coming to the end of her response. She has clarified the
issue about the soldiers involved in the 1972 incident in Londonderry,
and I understand that answer. However, I still fail
to understand the issue of the 187 letters because
she was not clear on that. She said that they are not
letters of comfort because the people concerned can
be further investigated. When I asked her whether she had
knowledge of the police investigating any of those 187 cases, she
talked vaguely about the Historical Enquiries Team. Therefore, I extend
the question: are 
<?notus-xml column=1256?>any of the 187 people currently being investigated by the

Randerson:</Member></B> I will, however, answer the noble Lord’s
question. I am not speaking of specific numbers because that is also
for the inquiry, but the issue is this: letters were sent following
inquiries from a number of people. Those who received a letter that
said “There are no known issues against you” were
therefore free, if they wished, to return without fear of prosecution.
Not everyone who made an inquiry received a letter of that nature. Does
that make it clear to the noble Lord? By implication, therefore, there
were ongoing inquiries in many cases. That is an important fact that
reveals the nature of the exercise; there were and are ongoing
inquiries in many

provided for the people who sought that status. The amendment asks for
guarantees to be provided only if the Secretary of State was asked to
do so by the Assembly. Therefore no offence is done to Sewel, and no
direct interference is done to the Assembly. Indeed, only upon a
request being received would this amendment take
effect<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:29:37"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:29:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14030462000317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0001.htm#14030462000317">5.30

ironic that some of the amendments, including the previous one and the
subsequent amendments that we are going to discuss, have never been
asked for, yet we are bringing them forward. Throughout this process,
the people who have proposed these amendments have wagged their fingers
at us and said, “We must respect 
<?notus-xml column=1258?>the devolution settlement and ensure that we do not impose anything on
Stormont”. I understand that. However, the parties that have
done the most disservice to devolution and have shown disrespect for
devolution and for the settlement are the Government and their
predecessors. A grave disservice has been done. In 2010, the powers of
policing and justice were devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly,
and I believe that the powers pertinent to these letters were also
devolved. Perhaps the Minister can help me but it is not clear under
which legislation the Northern Ireland Office has been dealing with
these matters since 2010. As I understand it, this is a devolved
matter, and indeed the Secretary of State would say that any future
letters would be a devolved
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:31:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

forward is that any letters that came in prior to devolution were dealt
with by the Northern Ireland Office, even if that took them past
devolution. A number of Members here have become Ministers, both
devolved and national Ministers. Where there is a change of government
or Minister or where there is a transfer from direct rule to
devolution, you always know that whatever is outstanding in a
department at that point becomes the responsibility of the Minister who
takes over. Matters are not carried over in that sense. A department in
Whitehall which gives devolved power does not keep on dealing with bits
and pieces; the relevant matters are handed over to a devolved
institution. I took over from two direct-rule Ministers: John McFall,
now the noble Lord, Lord McFall, and Maria Eagle in the other
place<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:32:30"></hs_TimeCode>. Anything
that was outstanding in the department at that time was transferred to
me, and the same went for every other Minister. So why were these
matters not transferred in this case? The first document that every
person gets on becoming a Minister is the first-day brief. That brief
should have clearly stipulated that this issue was afoot, but the
Minister of Justice who came into office was unaware of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:33:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

other point. The Permanent Secretary at that department, Mr Nick Perry,
is the chief adviser to the Minister of Justice. Apparently he knew
about this matter but he did not tell the Minister because, allegedly,
there was a Civil Service rule that you did not say anything. The
Permanent Secretary at the department is a Minister’s principal
adviser. In my opinion, the principal duty of Mr Perry—I know
him and he is an excellent civil servant—is to his Minister and
he should have told
him<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:33:54"></hs_TimeCode>. Therefore,
the irony is that, on the one hand, we are being told that we have to
respect devolution and, on the other hand, the Government have
disrespected it. That is why we have this crisis of

other thing about Haass. I am probably the only person here who was
involved. We sat talking about the past. The noble and right reverend
Lord, Lord Eames, clearly identified the huge emotional capital that
people have invested in this issue. People in both Northern Ireland and
the rest of the United Kingdom are horrified by what is unfolding here.
As I said, we were discussing the past and talking about setting up
institutions such as the Historical Enquiries Team, which would have
had a mini-police force and would have been able to conduct inquiries.
Some people in those discussions knew about 
<?notus-xml column=1259?>these proposals but nobody said anything. I can tell
the House that this has done huge damage. Who will now sit down with
any confidence and discuss these matters when something like this was
going on behind our backs? Not only that but does anybody seriously
believe that this is the only outstanding issue? It is very corrosive

course, he was correct in that, but within 24 hours we had a
mini-crisis. It was a resignation that never was, and I am glad that it
never was, but the fact is that we ended up with a potential crisis. We
should not forget that if the First Minister resigns, he automatically
takes out the Deputy First Minister, and I think that there are only
seven days in which to replace
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:36:20"></hs_TimeCode>. Therefore,

the noble Lord says, although huge issues relating to the Human Rights
Act and the Data Protection Act surround some of the conditions that
were attached by his colleagues to the First Minister’s
potential resignation, such as the production of a list of names.
Somebody else suggested that the letters be rescinded. They have not
been rescinded and I do not believe that they will be. The possession
of those letters is the issue. The people who possess them can always
go to the court and those Acts will be their defence. I doubt whether a

return to the amendment. Without doing injury to the devolution

Secretary of State would

guarantee that opposition status could not be arbitrarily changed by
the activities of majority parties at some point in the future. The
purpose of the amendment is very simple. I would encourage the Assembly
to go down the road of creating an Opposition but it still needs that
extra guarantee. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that that
guarantee is sought by the Assembly. It is much weaker than I would
have liked but, nevertheless, it does what it says on the tin. It is a
response to a request from the Assembly to the Secretary of State after
a cross-community vote. Therefore, I believe that it is perfectly

would be established in the Northern Ireland Assembly. As he has

that have gone before. It still seeks to give effect to the
fundamental principle, which is extremely important, on
constitutional grounds, as I have said previously. My noble friend and
I have listened to the Government’s view. We have held
discussions with the Secretary of State. We have sought to meet the

at Second Reading, in Committee, on Report and now again at Third
Reading. The creation of an Opposition in the Northern
Ireland Assembly already has been discussed extensively at every stage
of this Bill but I need to apologise if my remarks sound repetitive. I
maintain the position that the Opposition has held before. This
amendment acknowledges the powers of the Assembly regarding an
Opposition. Behind it there is an understandable concern to prevent the
Assembly withdrawing anything it were to grant. However, as I have said
so many times before, the Northern Ireland Assembly is a special
creation designed to have as many representatives of the community in
different shades as possible. It is not the time for this

repeat that unfortunately this is not the time to accept this
amendment. In June 2013, the Assembly and Executive Review Committee
concluded that, as yet, no cross-community consensus had been reached.
This followed a government consultation in 2012 that reached the same
conclusions. The Assembly must reach a cross-community consensus on the
creation of an Opposition before Parliament can consider legislating in
this way. Consensus cannot be created retrospectively as this amendment
would seek to do. It is for the Assembly to make the first moves
towards creating an

Should it be our Parliament making this decision or should it be by

position, the

political parties in Northern Ireland, all of which are in the
Government, to resign to become the Opposition. What incentive is there
for any of the five parties to resign from the Government? The answer

is answering a debate on an amendment that one has not actually
tabled. The amendment is based on the assumption that the Assembly is
the initiator. That was to ensure that no harm would be done to the
convention. The Minister also said that of course the Assembly has not
been consulted. That is a fair point. However, neither has it been
consulted—to my knowledge —about reducing in size to 90.
It has not been consulted —nor did it seek to be—on the
content of the next two amendments. It appears that we have a law for
one process and a totally different law for
another.</hs_para>

is hardly surprising, and dare I say to the Minister—although it
is not her responsibility—that the one big thing that the
Assembly was not consulted about was what was going on behind its back.
That is the elephant in the room, and has been since last week. One can
be very picky about what one decides to use as a mechanism for saying

and always has been a devolved matter, but a decision was made in 1998
not to devolve the Civil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland for

it has become clear in debates, as we have carefully noted, that there
were acutely felt concerns about the implications. I think we are all
in agreement that impartiality and merit in the NICS are of paramount
importance and that the commissioners, whatever their constitutional
status, should be in a position to protect those principles.
Protections for the Home Civil Service were enhanced in the
Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010, but there is nothing
similar for the Northern Ireland Civil Service. I outlined on Report
some elements that we envisaged incorporating in an amendment, and I
have previously indicated that any future devolution of responsibility
for the Civil Service Commissioners would be subject to prior public
consultation. This is not a statutory matter, but I
reiterate that commitment here
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000032">This
amendment requires the Secretary of State to lay a report in Parliament
at least three months prior to bringing any order on the devolution of
responsibilities in respect of the Civil Service Commissioners. The
intention of that time restriction is to ensure that there is adequate
time for both Houses to debate the matter and influence the
Government’s proposals before any devolution order is brought. A
number of noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Butler, and my
noble friend Lord Alderdice, had concerns that a vote on any order
would be on a simple yes or no proposition and therefore a blunt
instrument. Our new proposal is intended to guarantee time for a wider
debate in advance of a devolution order being brought forward. I
confirm now that we as a Government will facilitate such a debate if
and when the time comes and take into account its outcome in deciding
whether to bring forward a devolution

the amendment than our initial proposals. The responsibility
for the Northern Ireland Civil Service is a transferred matter, and
changes there would be for the devolved institutions. However, the
amendment recognises that the House would wish to take into account the
overall arrangements governing the Northern Ireland Civil Service,

a certain disconnectedness from the affairs of Northern Ireland. The

originally piloted by the noble Lord, Lord Empey, because of our
concern about the impact at home in Northern Ireland. A number of
things that my noble friend has said, and which are in the amendment,
are extremely helpful. First, there is the fact that the Secretary of
State would be required to produce a report. The contents required to
be in the report are also spelt out, as is the fact that it
would have to be done three months beforehand. Furthermore, my noble

forward for discussion. There is no doubt that the proposals in front
of us are infinitely better than the ones that were in the Bill as
originally drafted. However, I am still not clear what the driving
force behind this is. It was left as an excepted matter quite
deliberately and for very good reasons, and in my opinion those reasons
are as valid today as they were then. It would be impossible for me to
avoid pointing out to the noble Baroness that there has been no
consultation with the Assembly on this, and it is not an issue that has
any traction except within the small group of people who are directly
affected. But the proposals in front of us today are a lot better than
what was there before. Some protections have been put in. I am quite
sure that reference to the 2010 Act could very well have been the
mechanism to sort the whole thing out at the end of the day.
Nevertheless, I thank the noble Baroness for listening to us and for
acting on what has been said. At least we have put in some protections
that were not there before and, I hope, will be of benefit in the long

key differences between the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the
Westminster Civil Service. Senior civil servants in Northern Ireland
have a higher profile than their counterparts in the rest of the United
Kingdom. This is partly because, particularly when the Assembly has
been suspended or there have been different governance arrangements, it
has often been a civil servant who has undertaken the role that
Ministers have here in defending or promoting policies and engaging
with the public. The difference is cultural and practical. Due to these
marked differences, the Northern Ireland Civil Service would benefit
from a requirement for the Secretary of State to produce a report that
outlines the effect such an order would have on the impartiality of the
Civil Service, including the merit principle for appointments and
independence of the Civil Service Commissioners. I am delighted to

Specifically, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Bew, for the very
constructive comments he has made on this throughout. My response to
his specific question is that so much of the Civil Service in Northern
Ireland is already either devolved or reserved and this was the one
aspect that was still within the purview of the UK Government.
Therefore, it is the logical next step to put this in the same category
as the procedures and functions of the Civil Service

now strong safeguards on the condition and position of the Civil

the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, in an earlier debate.
The noble Lord, Lord Butler, has not pursued those issues with me
directly but I hope that he is now content, particularly because of the

believe that those concerns deserve a very serious response. We have
revised our approach in a similar way, so, as I said, I will make my
comments as brief as is in accordance with being clear—I hope.
As with the Civil Service Commissioners, I outlined a possible approach

recap, responsibility for appointments to the Northern Ireland Human
Rights Commission is currently an excepted matter, as are the
commission’s functions. Clause 11 moves these responsibilities
from the “excepted” to the “reserved”
category. The Bill does not, however, propose the devolution of these
responsibilities at this time. In previous debates, concerns were
expressed in respect of the commission’s independence should it
ultimately be devolved. Your Lordships regard this as being of great
importance. We share those concerns and are clear that they must be
addressed before devolution. I indicated previously that any future
devolution of responsibility for the Northern Ireland Human Rights
Commission would be subject to public consultation. That remains the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000051">These

the approach being taken in Belfast before a devolution order is laid.

embodied in the Paris and Belgrade principles. My noble friend Lord

brought forward by my noble friend the Minister. I accept what she said
about this device or resolution being similar to that in the previous
question on the Civil Service Commissioners. However, the matter at
issue here is very different and one of much more substantial
importance. Indeed, the Minister will recall that at Second Reading
this issue was one of two that I identified as being absolutely
critical. In Committee, I spoke against the question that the clause
should stand part of the Bill. On Report, I came back with an amendment
on the question and I am very grateful to my noble friend the

the
question.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000055">I do
not want to repeat what I said before but I point out the signal
importance of this issue and its difference from the previous one.
Right back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, there was pressure in
Northern Ireland for a Human Rights Commission. In 1973, when the
legislation was passed, a Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights
was established. That was not sufficient but it was the best that could
be achieved at that particular time. It produced some very worthwhile
reports, some of which were acted upon in part and some more fully.
Some very distinguished colleagues, not least my predecessor as leader
of the Alliance Party, Sir Oliver Napier, was a chairman of the
Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights. Eventually, we moved on.
We had a Human Rights Commission for Northern Ireland. The point is
that this is not something that came in with the Good Friday agreement.
It did not arise lately. There was absolutely critical demand and
pressure for it from the 1960s and onwards. It continues to be
of signal
importance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000056">In
her amendment, my noble friend has very helpfully identified a similar
procedure to the previous issue. The Secretary of State would, at least
three months in advance, bring forward a report identifying three very
important issues: the independence of the Human 
<?notus-xml column=1271?>Rights Commission, its relationship with the
Northern Ireland Assembly, and the international commitments and
responsibilities of Her Majesty’s Government. That is extremely
good. She has also said, again very helpfully, that in the event that
your Lordships’ House wanted to debate such a report, it would
be given an opportunity by the Government to do that, and that the
content of that debate would be taken seriously in the construction of
the draft legislation. That is all extremely helpful and very
welcome.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000057">However,
I feel strongly about the significance of this issue. If the Government
did not bring forward a satisfactory report or set of proposals, this
is of such significance that it is the kind of thing that one would be
prepared to vote down. Not many things come forward here in terms of
Orders in Council where your Lordships’ House is called on to
use what we might describe as the politically nuclear option. This
matter of the Human Rights Commission is of such importance that a
Government—not just this one; it is likely that a subsequent
Government might find themselves in this position—should not be
under any illusion that if this matter were to come forward in an
unsatisfactory way, they would face very serious opposition. I would be

Act—paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 —is not yet in
force. The proposed change to commencement is intended to avoid a
situation where the amendment to the order-making power in
Clause 24 comes into force before the power itself, which would have no
practical effect and which I understand is technically undesirable.
This is a technical change to the clause which I hope that the House
will feel able to support, as it is not an issue that has raised
concern previously.</hs_para>

technical aspects of the amendment, but I cannot let the opportunity
pass without saying something about my appreciation of and gratitude to
my noble friend Lady Randerson. Perhaps it is because of her
distinguished service and experience in the Welsh Assembly, perhaps it
is just because of the person that she is, perhaps it is because of the
conscientious way in which she approaches her work, but, for
whatever reason, she has shown great sensitivity to the difficult
issues in devolution in a provincial part of our United Kingdom and to
the complexity of the issues concerned. Nowhere was this better shown
than in your Lordships’ House today, where she dealt with such
extraordinary patience with all the difficulties, which were not
immediately difficulties of the Bill, but were certainly difficulties
with the context in which the Bill is passing in Northern Ireland. The
patience that she showed in her responses reminded me a little of
George Mitchell and the sort of patience that he had to show at a much
earlier stage in the whole process. She has been an exemplar in that
regard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000075">It

Ireland. The Minister, her officials and, indeed, the Secretary of

as they felt able. Even to our questions today, I think that she
responded as far as it was possible to do given the difficulties and

Brooke of Sutton Mandeville (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I would like
to make a brief footnote to the debates that we have just had. My noble
friend Lord Mawhinney made reference in debate on Amendment 1 to my
noble friend Lord King of Bridgwater and myself. I did not intervene in
that debate, especially on the subject of secret deals, but certainly
my basic attitude to such matters was learnt at my mother’s
knee. I mention this because I recall that the Reith lectures given by
the noble Baroness, Lady O’Neill of Bengarve, treated on the
same matter. It is happy that she is here so that she can reprove me if
I misrepresent her. Her view on behaviour was that those people with
whom one has contact react and respond to the way that you treat them.
If you communicate liking, they are likely to behave in a likeable
manner while if you show that you trust them, they are likely to behave
in a trustworthy manner. In both these examples, the converse is true.
Secret deals are therefore fundamentally counter- productive. I once
worked for a great American who taught me that the strongest argument
against falsehoods is that the truth is much easier to remember. I am
not seeking a response.</hs_para>

Howe of Idlicote (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 1 is in my name
and that of the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson. It would give the Gambling
Commission a discretionary power to block financial transactions
between people living in the UK and online gambling websites that have
not secured a UK Gambling Commission licence. The aim is to prevent
funds being transferred to illegal operators, thereby creating a
disincentive both to the company to operate illegally and to UK

first glance, this seems absolutely right because the Bill, for the
very first time, requires all online gambling providers based outside
the UK who want to access the UK market to get a UK Gambling Commission

<?notus-xml column=1277?>licence. For this to constitute a meaningful bid for greater protection,
however, it must be connected to a parallel provision preventing those
providers which do not have a licence from selling to UK consumers. The
Bill before us contains no such provision. In the absence of a credible
enforcement mechanism, the primary implications of the Bill are
twofold.</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="14030473000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000081">First, there would be
significant liberalisation of online gambling advertising. At present,
only providers located in a limited number of whitelisted and European
Economic Area jurisdictions can advertise in the UK. However, under the
Bill any provider based anywhere in the UK will be able to advertise in
the UK, so long as they get a UK Gambling Commission licence. This
significantly widens the scope for online gambling advertising. Not
only that: it would be advertising liberalisation for a form of
gambling which is associated with a significantly higher problem
prevalence figure than gambling generally. The 2010 general problem
prevalence figure was 0.9% but it was more than 9% for online
on an annual basis and more than 17% on a monthly
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T18:45:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is that of providing a framework for increasing the tax take in
co-operation with the 2014 Finance Bill. The 2005 Act created a tax
loophole by allowing providers based in EEA or whitelisted
jurisdictions still to advertise in the UK. All but one moved to
whitelisted jurisdictions under more generous regimes. The Bill
corrects this loophole by providing the Treasury with a framework to
address the problem. It requires all providers accessing the UK market
to get a licence, while the Finance Bill requires all online gambling
providers with a UK licence to pay UK tax. It will come as no surprise
to your Lordships that, as the wife of a former Chancellor of the
Exchequer, I have absolutely no problem with seeking to close a tax
loophole. However, the good news is that that tax loophole can be
closed at the same time as providing a robust enforcement regime that
upholds the consumer protection objective set out by Helen Grant. We do
not have to choose between one and the
other.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000083">The

problem with this is that neither clamping down on illegal advertising

problems with the enforcement mechanisms highlighted by the Government,
it has been clear to me since the first day when the Bill appeared that
it is crying out for a proper enforcement mechanism. In this context,
as I have said previously, Amendment 1, which gives the Gambling
Commission 
<?notus-xml column=1278?>discretionary financial transaction blocking powers to protect UK
consumers from transacting with illegal providers, crucially restores
integrity to the Bill. Far from being a curious add-on my amendment, in

admit that financial transaction blocking is not 100%
successful—very few public policy solutions are—it is my
contention that it is the best available enforcement mechanism, and one
that would greatly enhance the Bill. In making this case, I want to
make some points. First, I shall briefly consider the experiences of
other jurisdictions. In the USA, the Unlawful Internet Gambling
Enforcement Act 2006 prohibits any person, including a business,
engaged in the business of betting or wagering from knowingly accepting
payments in connection with the participation of another person in
illegal remote gambling. In practice, this means that credit and debit
cards and banks do not allow their services to be used in relation to a
merchant code associated with remote gambling. This means that if a
person tries to gamble on an illegal or unregulated website, they will
not be able to transfer funds directly into their gambling account.
These merchant codes are used as a matter of course and as part of
agreements made between gambling entities and the financial
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000087">My
conversations with online gambling providers suggest that, while this
approach has not been perfect, it has made a very significant positive
difference. Indeed, such is its success that other countries have since
followed its lead; in Europe the most notable is Norway, as well as
France, Belgium and Estonia. Other jurisdictions have also implemented
policies that reflect the blocking of the financial flow to illegal
websites—for example, in Israel, Turkey, Singapore and
Malaysia.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000088">Secondly,
having looked at the experience of other jurisdictions, I want to
reflect on the appropriateness of financial transaction blocking in a
British context. In considering all the jurisdictions that have
implemented FTB, it is vital to appreciate that they operate closed or
relatively closed markets. For example, the US does not allow remote
gambling across state borders or from overseas. Norway, meanwhile,
operates an even more restrictive
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000089">If one
operates a closed or relatively closed market, one faces two
challenges. First, one has to block lots of transactions. That would
not be the case in the UK, where we operate an open market. Then there
is a greater incentive in closed or relatively closed markets for
punters to seek to evade the blocks than in an open market, where the
available odds should be relatively competitive. In a market like the
UK, where there is a need for less blocking and where—on the
occasions when it is used—financial transaction blocking is more
likely to be effective, FTB is likely to be more successful than in the
jurisdictions where it has been employed thus
far.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000090">Thirdly,
mindful of the above, I want to reflect on the huge irony of the
position that the Government have adopted. They have rejected financial
transaction 
<?notus-xml column=1279?>blocking on the basis that the results are “mixed”, citing
instead their preference for prosecution. Given that, while not
perfect, FTB has encountered some considerable success, and given that
it is more likely to be successful in the UK than in any other
jurisdiction where it has been used, I find it a little extraordinary
that the Government should reject it in favour of prosecution on the
basis that FTB is not perfect. Prosecution is far less likely to be
successful than FTB. As we have seen by the Government’s own
admission, prosecution does not work. The idea that the UK Government
can afford to chase multiple small online providers through the courts
of multiple jurisdictions is, surely, fanciful. The providers in
question know that the chances of their ever being successfully
prosecuted are tiny, a calculated risk that they can afford to take. By
contrast, FTB is likely to have a significant deterrent effect on small
illegal providers, as the experience of Norway has
demonstrated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000091">Yesterday

demonstrates that alternative payment mechanisms spring up to do the
job in place of the big names that are persuaded in the name of social
responsibility to adopt a different approach on a self-regulatory

from the main purpose of the Bill, my Amendment 1, by providing a
credible enforcement mechanism, is absolutely key to that central
purpose. Rather than placing the simple integrity of the Bill in
jeopardy, the amendment’s key mission is actually to complete
that integrity—to ensure that rather than being half a Bill,
alienated from an enforcement mechanism, it is in fact a whole Bill,
very much at one with its enforcement mechanism. My modest
discretionary financial transaction blocking amendment would restore
integrity to the Bill, in my view, something that is urgently needed. I

it sets out very clearly, and with which we agree. There have been very
clear calls for strong enforcement measures to accompany the Bill. The

effective if it does not have these additional measures. In addition to
the points made by the noble Baroness, which I do not wish to repeat
because she made a very positive and clear endorsement of the position
that she is trying to adopt, we have to have regard to the fact that
there will be people inside the industry who will hold licences who
deserve to be supported, who are trying to do the right thing and who

will he address two issues that concern me about the amendment? The
first is the ability to control what the noble Baroness referred to as
illegal websites. It seems to me that websites spring up and have an
almost infinite ability to replicate themselves. I am not sure how the
Government could control them, even if they wanted to. Secondly, there
seems to be evidence in other countries that financial transaction
blocking has not been terribly successful. Will the Minister comment on
whether that is the case? If we were to have this amendment, it is
important that it is workable and would achieve its purpose. Otherwise,
we have to look at other alternatives to achieve the same

Browne of Belmont (DUP):</Member></B><B> </B>My Lords, I am very
pleased to speak in support of Amendment 1 because it is of fundamental
importance. If this Bill is not endowed with a credible form of
enforcement so that unlicensed operators are prevented from accessing
the UK market then, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, has explained,
the notion that this Bill is about consumer protection breaks down. Its
primary impact will instead be a truly dramatic change to online
gambling advertising in the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000099">I am
particularly grateful to the noble Baroness for raising this issue
throughout the passage of the Bill and particularly for the excellent
seminar that she hosted for Peers last week, which was fascinating. It
comprised two central presentations, one from the online gambling
provider Paddy Power explaining why, from the perspective of online
gambling providers, the provision of proper enforcement is absolutely
key, and a second presentation from a charity, CARE, whose prime
concern is the care of problem gamblers, which also argued passionately
for the provision of credible
enforcement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000100">In
managing to create a coalition between the online gambling industry and
problem gambler charities, the Government have really accomplished
quite a feat. On a more serious note, it seems to me that if such
disparate groups with such disparate aims and objectives are prepared
to come together to present basically the same argument, the Government
need to pause and take note. Paddy Power made it very clear that the
online gambling industry is growing very quickly right across the world
and that there are lots of small providers which will be tempted to
access the United Kingdom market without getting a licence. The point
was made very powerfully that the Government cannot possibly hope to
chase these multiple small providers through the courts of multiple
jurisdictions. It would cost far too much and take far too long. The
small providers know that the chances of them being prosecuted, let
alone convicted, are absolutely tiny and that it is a risk well worth
taking.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14030473000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000101">In
this context, the online gambling industry and the charity sector are
very clear that financial transaction blocking is the best way forward.
The Government, of course, have resisted this argument, claiming that
the evidence for FTB is mixed. If by this they mean that it is not 100%
successful, then I agree with them, but the notion that in order to be
suitable an enforcement mechanism must be 100% effective is problematic
for two reasons. First, in my experience, very few public policy
solutions can make that claim. Secondly, the enforcement mechanism
promoted by the Government—prosecution—is far less likely
to be successful than FTB. Of course, I read with interest the letter
from the Minister yesterday announcing that, despite earlier
statements, the Government have now consented to a self-regulatory
approach to prohibiting payments with three providers. That is a very
welcome turnaround, but it is not a credible solution. The integrity of
this Bill clearly requires a statutory solution that covers all
providers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000102">This

consideration. With the introduction of the internet, we are living
through a revolution that is probably more powerful than the invention
of steam power or the internal combustion engine. One does not want to
be critical of the many benefits that flow from the internet revolution
but it brings with it, at every point, corresponding dangers of which
the Government need to be very aware. If in doubt, I would say that the

wide-ranging and constructive series of discussions as the Bill has
progressed to this stage. As we said earlier, this is a small,
five-clause Bill focusing on consumer protection. As a result of it,
all overseas operators selling to British consumers—around 85%
of the market—will be required to hold a British Gambling
Commission licence. That will mean that those operators will be subject
to robust and consistent regulation and that will increase protection

it had been introduced with a distinct focus on new licensing and
advertising arrangements for remote gambling activities, we have

Noble Lords will have seen some of them announced by the Secretary of

by these debates, in which some very important matters arose, while
ensuring that the core of the Bill, which I think I can say is widely

issue is in relation to enforcement and I thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Howe, for her amendment. It would enable the Gambling
Commission to give direction to financial institutions to stop
financial transactions with operators which do not hold a Gambling
Commission licence. This is known as financial transaction blocking.
The Government share the overall objective articulated so clearly by
noble Lords, which is at the centre of this amendment, but the Bill
must be enforceable. That is central to achieving the consumer
protection purposes that lie at the heart of the Bill, which will
extend the existing enforcement provisions to offshore operators

Bill includes three important tools. First, the Gambling Commission can
take action against illegal advertising. That is important as
advertising is the

advertisers to identify what can and what cannot be advertised into the

Secondly, player education is another important tool. The current
system makes it impossible for the Gambling Commission to advise
consumers to buy from commission-licensed operators, as operators from
anywhere in the world, subject to a range of different regulatory
regimes, can transact with consumers in Great Britain. Thirdly, the
Gambling Commission has powers to prosecute, so the commission will
have the legal powers to pursue any unlicensed operators, wherever they
are based. It is also worth noting that, although the collection of tax
is a matter for HMRC, it has extensive powers of its own that may be
deployed in the case of unlicensed operators, where this is
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000108">However,
alongside this, I can announce a further mechanism. I am pleased to
confirm that the Gambling Commission has reached agreement with major
payment systems organisations—notably MasterCard, PayPal and
Visa Europe—to work together to block financial transactions
with unlicensed operators which seek to use these payment systems for
illegal purposes. What does this actually mean in practice? It means
that when a consumer uses payment facilities for illegal gambling this
may amount to a breach of the payment system’s terms and
conditions. These require that all transactions must be legal in all
applicable jurisdictions. Such a breach may result in the operator
having its payment facilities withdrawn by the payment system. This
process will disrupt revenue to unlicensed gambling operators selling
into our British
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030473000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030473000109">We
have heard the arguments in detail throughout the passage of the Bill
as to the effectiveness of financial transaction blocking. We believe
that the approach I have just outlined is a good way to test and
evaluate this mechanism. The mechanism provides an efficient way of
achieving blocking in a single case, which is mostly where we expect
this approach will be used. The reason this approach is efficient is
that the Gambling Commission has a direct route to the payment
organisations and does not need to go through a potentially lengthy and
expensive court process.</hs_para>

agreed in this debate, the landscape can change quickly. Technology
moves faster than legislation. The nature of these arrangements is such
that they will be adaptable and can respond to the very latest
developments. That is why the Government believe this is the most
appropriate way to proceed: working in partnership with these
organisations that share our determination to tackle illegal activity.
We want to ensure that the enforcement arrangements continue to be
effective and have asked the commission to report on its enforcement
activities in relation to remote gambling. The Gambling Commission will
provide an assessment of the effectiveness of these arrangements in
enforcing the Bill in its annual report to Parliament. The Government
and Gambling Commission will use this to assess the success of this
approach and monitor the implementation of the new regime. This will
enable the Government to ensure that the Gambling Commission continues
to have all the enforcement tools it needs.</hs_para>

noted, to date the Bill has passed unamended through the Commons and
also until Report stage in the Lords. Increasingly, everyone
acknowledges that we are here as a revising Chamber to spot problems
and to try and put them right. I would argue that we have identified a
significant problem here that cannot be addressed by a voluntary
agreement between just these three providers, which may or may not at
some future stage give rise to
litigation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:16:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, the promotion and
upholding of integrity is one of the key functions of all sports
governing bodies and event organisers. The whole concept of sport is
based on what is described as fair competition between participants
under agreed rules. A vital principle for any sport is that all its
participants are competing to win and that its officials are honest,
and are seen to be
so<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:28:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000002">This
amendment deals with a situation which could not have been forecast
when the Gambling Act 2005 passed through this House and into law. At
that time, the idea that people would somehow be able to vote without
ever being close to or involved in a game was not thought of as likely
to happen, and we certainly did not see, or have evidence to suggest
that we had seen, any ideas that people involved in the betting
industry—not the industry as a whole—might seek to use
means to try to fix matches. The situation that emerged out of the 2005
Act is not one that we could have predicted; times have moved on.
Therefore, we need to think hard about how to protect sports integrity
as we move forward. Those who seek to influence the outcome or progress
of sports events to secure rewards through betting undermine the very
principles that I have been talking about. Worse than that, any
suspicion that that is happening is almost as bad as the event itself
happening. So some action needs to be
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:30:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government have been working with the Gambling Commission—and I
give them credit for this—on how best to ensure that information
flow is made available to those with responsibilities in this area. As
a result, there is a series of regulations that operate, particularly
licence condition 15.1, which ensures that information about practices
that might be redolent of an event that has been fixed are brought
quickly to the attention of the sports governing bodies and authorities
so that action, if necessary, can be
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:30:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000004">During
the passage of the Bill in another place, my colleague in the Commons,
Mr Clive Efford, spotted a gap in the overall approach being taken
here, which is that the responsibility for spread betting is and
continues to be with the FCA, which does not have the licence
conditions—including licence condition 15.1—that apply to
those organisations registered through the Gambling Commission itself.
However, in the period since then there have been meetings and
discussions, and I am very pleased that we have now got to a situation
where, in respect of those bodies that are involved in regulating
sports events, which include spread betting operated under the auspices
of the FCA, the effect will be that licence condition 15.1 will apply,
so that all information can be channelled to those who require it in a
way that will allow them quickly to take action if required. This is
terrific—and, if I am going to hear that from the other side, we
will welcome it. It may influence how we take forward this
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:31:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000005">However,
in closing I make one point. The situation that we will find ourselves
in if what I hope is the case comes through is that those in scope to
the Gambling Commission will have the effect of licence condition 15.1
applied to them. But if there were a situation in which a spread
betting organisation were to start taking bets on gambling activity but
was not in scope to the Gambling Commission, the information flows
would be interrupted. Can the Minister reflect on that point and give
us some information, if he has it, on that issue? Subject to hearing
more about that, I am very happy to move this amendment and look
forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in
response<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:32:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Heyhoe Flint" PimsId="5922" UID="14030479000131" xid="2132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000131">Baroness
Heyhoe Flint (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, this
amendment returns us to an issue that has already
received considerable scrutiny. As we have heard, it is vital that
national sports governing bodies receive information and intelligence
about any untoward betting patterns as a matter of urgency so that they
have the greatest opportunity to prevent corrupt activities and
behaviour. Spread betting needs to be regulated just as effectively as
fixed odds betting. Yesterday, the Minister informed noble Lords that
the Gambling Commission is to extend the remit of its licensing code
15.1 to include spread betting in its information reporting
requirements, as is placed on those who have a fixed odds
betting licence.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:33:36"></hs_TimeCode> commend this
remit, because it will address most of the issues that sports bodies
have raised. Presently, the two companies that offer spread betting
also offer fixed betting and thus have Gambling Commission
licences. Could my noble friend tell me when the Gambling Commission
will introduce this new licensing
code<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:33:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000007">I
am also pleased that in recent weeks the FCA has finally agreed to take
responsibility on this issue, no doubt following pressure generated by
noble Lords—  
<?notus-xml column=1289?>I say, immodestly. It has come forward with
proposals for its own industry guidance for spread betting companies
that take bets on sport. This guidance will be broadly similar to that
issued by the Gambling Commission, but there are two main areas where
it will be deficient in comparison and concerns
remain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000008">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:34:34"></hs_TimeCode>
first is that the guidance will not be made public. I find that
somewhat curious. Surely, regulatory requirements set by public bodies
should be open, transparent and accountable. How is the sports sector
to have confidence in a regulation if it does not know what it says?
How can it be used as educational material or act as a deterrent in the
sporting world if we cannot show people the actual guidance? Can the
Minister give an assurance that a way will be found to make sure that
this guidance is made publicly available to those in the sports
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:35:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000009">Secondly,
the industry guidance issued by the FCA will not require as a
statutory requirement that the spread betting company must
share any information that it has, not just with the FCA but, most
importantly, with sports governing bodies. Sports bodies understandably
have ongoing concerns about the quality of information that they might
eventually receive and the speed at which it will be made available. I
gather that the reason for this is that the FCA says that its own
statutes do not allow it to instruct spread betting companies
to share information directly with sports governing bodies. That would
be a major anomaly and a threat to sports integrity, should a spread
betting firm operate without having a fixed betting arm. That means
that it would not fall under the regime being proposed by the Gambling
Commission<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:36:05"></hs_TimeCode>. Can
the Minister tell me what action the Government are taking to ensure
that any future spread betting company that is established and does not
have a fixed betting operator licence will still be subject to the same
requirements that the Gambling Commission is
introducing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:36:20"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000010">The
easiest way in which to guarantee a level regulatory playing
field between traditional and spread betting companies would be
to transfer responsibility for sports spread betting from the FCA to
the Gambling Commission, as the amendment would seek to do. I
understand that there are powers contained in a Treasury-regulated
activities order that would enable the transfer of sports spread
betting from the FCA to the Gambling Commission, which may be a more
suitable route to address the issue than in this Bill. Could the
Minister give a commitment that that option will be further explored as
a matter of urgency, and that, should there be any development of
standalone spread betting companies setting up, we could expect to see
the application of a transfer of sports spread betting from the FCA to

detection and disruption of any such corruption by regulators and

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:46:48"></hs_TimeCode>My Lords,
Amendment 3 calls for a review of the effects of online gambling
adverts shown to children before the 9 pm watershed. Our amendment
calls on the Secretary of State to conduct an investigation into
whether there are sufficient controls, and report back to
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000027">Our
amendment recognises that the world of gambling adverts has changed
dramatically since the 2005 Act, which gave exemptions to adverts for
betting on televised sporting events and for bingo. Since then,
televised sports coverage has multiplied so that it is now possible to
watch sports programmes 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This has
coincided with the massive growth in online gambling, so rather than
place a bet in a betting shop on the outcome of a race or a match,
gambling is now carried out at home. It is instant, compulsive and has
become more complex. It is no longer enough to bet on the outcome of a
game, you are now encouraged to bet on the first no-ball, the first 
<?notus-xml column=1293?>corner, the first goal scorer and so on. This has
been fuelled by the growth of spread betting with high stakes and
winnings, but also potentially high
losses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000028">As we
have already identified, these days, viewers of televised sporting
events are bombarded with betting adverts in the
commercial breaks, with all kinds of tempting, and often
misleading, offers for correctly predicting the run of play and the
outcome. They capitalise on viewers’ excitement and emotion in
the
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000029">Equally,
in 2005, I do not think that anyone predicted the rise of online bingo.
In its original form, bingo had a strong social aspect, providing a
safe community activity, particularly for women, in predominantly
working-class areas. However, online bingo has none of these
attributes: it is solitary, repetitive and addictive. It is not
surprising to discover that most online bingo adverts are on daytime
TV, targeting those who are home
alone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000030">There
is a third development which was also not anticipated, which is the
rise of gambling adverts throughout the day on social media and music
websites, which by their very nature are targeting a younger audience.
We know that gambling adverts are profitable and increasingly prolific.
For example, between 2005 and 2012, while the total number of TV
adverts almost doubled, over the same period the number of gambling
adverts increased eightfold to more than 4% of the total adverts shown.
It may be that a more general review of the regulation of these adverts
is necessary, but our amendment seeks to address one aspect of
particular concern, which is the exposure of children to these ads
before the 9 pm
watershed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000031">Of
course, these adverts are not specifically targeted at children, and
there are codes of practice that prevent adverts seeking to exploit
young people or appealing to children. However, this is not the point.
The fact is that children are being increasingly exposed to remote
gambling adverts as they watch TV sport or daytime TV, or listen to
music channels. We know that children will often be accessing these
programmes without their parents being present, and we know that
children are more computer savvy than their parents and can therefore
be tempted to find ways to participate in these betting opportunities.
We also know from other studies how susceptible children can be to
adverts, which is why there are already restrictions on other adverts
before 9
pm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000032">Following
Committee, the Minister wrote to us on this issue and I am grateful to
him for the letter. He referred us to an Ofcom report published in
November last year and went on to say that its research suggests that
the current arrangements are working well. I have to say to the
Minister that I have looked at the report and it was far from
reassuring. Instead, it showed that since 2005 children’s
exposure to gambling ads has increased by 272%, whereby in 2012 there
were 1.8 billion views of these ads by children. Moreover,
in 2012 children were exposed to more than 8% of all the lottery and
scratchcard ads on music channels. I could quote more examples but the
point is that I do not see anything in that Ofcom report that suggests
that these statistics are
acceptable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000033">The
truth is that we do not know the extent to which children are
influenced by these ads but we know that sports, bingo and social media
ads are 
<?notus-xml column=1294?>multiplying and becoming more sophisticated. This is
why our amendment calls on the Secretary of State to initiate an
investigation into the impact of these adverts on children and report
to Parliament on her findings. We were therefore pleased to read at the
weekend that the Secretary of State has now accepted the need to look
again at the regulation of gambling advertising with the aim of
providing better protection for children and the vulnerable. We were

the nature of the amendment is much narrower in scope than the review

the sudden switch that has taken place. The noble Baroness referred to
the letter of 22 January from my noble friend, as compared to the most
recent letter of 3 March. There has been quite a turnaround,
and we had the article from the Secretary of State in the <I>Sunday

has to be firmly rooted in the evidence. I absolutely share what the

the exposure of children to these gambling adverts but I do not want us

activities that take place, whether in casinos or remotely, are
legitimate and it is legitimate to advertise them. Unless there a
clearly established connection between advertising and problem
gambling—from the research so far, it does not appear to be a
major factor—I hope that this debate will be devoted largely to
looking at the impact on children. There probably are conflicting views
on the nature of the Ofcom evidence: the Advertising Association seems
to be saying that only 42 seconds of advertising out of nearly 17 hours
spent watching television each week is seen by 10 to 15 year-olds. I do
not know whether that is the case or whether the figures that the noble

not a mathematician; in fact, I am virtually innumerate but I know that
if you use percentages such as that it can sometimes be from a very low
base. Let us face it, between 2006 and now, remote gambling of the kind
that is advertised so heavily has grown hugely as an industry, and it

Lordships’ rather empty House at this late hour, I see that I am
the only Member who sat on the joint scrutiny committee on the 2003-04
Bill, which became the 2005 Act. I remember the tortuous hours of
evidence that we heard about the effects that this new phenomenon of
gambling advertising would have. I do not make this as a
party-political point but as a general political point: the Government
of the day swept that aside. I heard my noble friend give a figure of a
600% increase but that was of course from a low base, which was zero;
there was no advertising of this sort at that time. It was introduced
under the 2005 Act, amid a lot of people—some sensible and some
not so sensible—saying that it would cause awful mayhem. Of
course, there is no mayhem and nightmare because the background is that
we were also advised that we should take into account what is now
called evidence-based policy, which is introduced on expert advice and
allows the Minister of the day to avoid exercising his political
judgment—probably the reason for which he was elected, but that
is neither here nor there.</hs_para>

what Parliament does from time to time. However, that is the history

amendment in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, and the noble
Lord, Lord Stevenson. Having listened to everybody’s
contributions, I think that what is really important here is the effect
on children of this increased access to advertising. It provides an
early start to children getting gambling problems,
which then have to be sorted out, and that is 
<?notus-xml column=1296?>what my amendment was seeking to address. I do not
feel one way or the other about what other noble Lords have said but I
think that the age of the children being exposed to this advertising is
important. A 10 o’clock watershed would be ideal if
only it could be applied to online activity, although we all know
that it cannot. Nevertheless, other ways of checking this
should certainly be looked at in

Government recognise that the relaxation of restrictions on gambling

seen significant innovation in the gambling industry since the current
regulatory controls were established in 2007. The codes, including the
industry voluntary code, which govern gambling advertising are now
applied across a much changed gambling landscape with the availability
and promotion of new products which were not anticipated when the codes
were devised. These technological developments have led to intense
competition in remote gambling advertising, which has coincided with an
increase in complaints about gambling advertising to the Advertising
Standards Authority. It is timely, therefore, that the codes are
re-examined to ensure that existing controls keep pace with
developments in the market and that they remain consistent with public
expectations about gambling advertising.</hs_para>

Lady Jones, that this work includes both remote gambling advertising
and other forms of online gaming activity, including online bingo. As a
result of these discussions, I am now in a position to explain the four
strands of work being undertaken, and to what timetable, to ensure that
the regulatory controls on gambling advertising are properly examined,

first of the four strands is that the Government have asked the Remote
Gambling Association to co-ordinate an industry-led review of the
voluntary Gambling Industry Code for Socially Responsible Gambling. As
noble Lords will be aware, this code supplements the principal
regulations on gambling advertising by providing industry standards in
certain areas, including educational messaging and the 9 pm watershed
arrangements for television advertising. The Remote Gambling
Association has agreed to complete its review with a view to coming
forward with any proposed revisions by the summer of this
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000051">Secondly,
the Committee of Advertising Practice and the Broadcast Committee of

evidence on gambling advertising and its relationship with problem

evidence and empirical research, which has been somewhat lacking in the
past. Therefore, there is a rather urgent need to address that issue.
Nevertheless, I welcome the change in mood and position from the
Secretary of State and the Minister over the past couple of months. It
has been a very welcome conversion on the road to Damascus. I also
welcome the detail that the Minister has spelt out in terms of the
steps that will now be taken. I suppose I have a remaining concern
that, although the Minister described them as four strands, there very
much is a need to pull those four strands together and to pull them
into an ultimate set of recommendations. I am taking him on slight

time to replace the levy and that a reform was needed to be considered

it is on-course betting, off-course betting, offshore or onshore

amendment is simple. It allows the Secretary of State to bring in
legislation to encompass offshore bookmakers who do not presently pay
the levy. Racing is losing about £10 million a year that it is
entitled to. That word “entitled” raises the question of
why. There is a simple analogy. If the Government are going to regulate
those based overseas on areas such as problem gambling and integrity on
bets on UK sports, that shows that there is already that reach and the
entitlement. My amendment does not force the Government to do anything
but if they want to support racing they could use it. It does not cost
any money and, in fact, it would provide an addition to the Treasury
coffers. The reason it is important for racing is that we know that
there is no time to legislate this Session. Therefore, the earliest
time will probably be half way through the next Session of Parliament,
by which time racing will have lost out on nearly £100 million
of income.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000061">I

I look forward to the Government widening and improving it. The
Minister said that the levy is regarded as state aid by the EU. I think
we all agree with that. However, my amendment does not change anything.
It just allows the levy to be collected as it used to be from all
bookmakers. It is not necessarily a substantive change to the existing
system as some have claimed. If permission is required from the
European Parliament, the Government can ask for clarity before they
proceed. After all, that is what the French did and it worked. If
accepted, the

discussions I have had with the Minister of Sport, Helen Grant, I

It would allow the Government, if they wish, to remove the unfair

racing. I beg to

without the opportunity to make desirable amendments, because we know
that there will not be another gambling Bill for another five years or
so. This is one of the issues that we face. I hope that the Minister
will be able to give us an assurance on the ability of the

with the view that while we still have a statutory levy, it
should be fairly applied. Furthermore, we are persuaded that including
a clause about extending the levy to offshore remote operators
is fully in keeping with the context and purpose of the Bill.
We will therefore bring forward a government amendment at Third Reading
which will remedy your Lordships’ concerns about ensuring a
level playing field between onshore and offshore betting operators in
terms of the levy. With the consent of the House, this amendment will
give the Secretary of State power to use secondary legislation to
secure extension of the levy to offshore remote operators. I shall
ensure that all noble Lords who have expressed an interest in this
matter during the Bill’s passage are invited to a briefing on
the detail of the amendment before Third Reading. Bringing forward a
government amendment will complement the work which, as I mentioned to
your Lordships, is already under way to seek clarity on the

secondary legislation is brought before Parliament.</hs_para>

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, as I pointed out in Grand
Committee, during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, the Culture,

casinos to offer their online gaming products within their own

a regulatory anomaly means that people can play on remote internet
sites using their own mobile phones, tablets or laptops, whether in
their homes, on the move or in any public or private place, including
inside a casino. However, while under existing regulations onshore
casino operators can and do hold remote licences which permit them to
advertise their online products in their casinos, these licences do not
allow operators to indicate that the product is available from any
internet-linked computer within their casinos or advertise their online
sites on or around an actual computer with internet access supplied by
the operator. In other words, it is currently illegal for a casino to
offer a customer access to their own legitimate online business if the
customer is inside their bricks-and-mortar
business.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000082">It
seems commercially illogical that the most rigorously controlled
premises, intended by statute to be at the top of the regulatory
pyramid, are not permitted the most up-to-date technological products.
This amendment would simply provide a synergy between the
casino’s online and land-based products, already recognisable to
casino customers, in a similar way to land-based bricks-and-mortar
retailers, such as John Lewis, which offers its products in store and
via an online facility inside its land-based stores.</hs_para>

also a missed opportunity to undertake research and player protection
in that the product itself will not be available in terrestrial
casinos, which are required by law to have the most rigorous control
measures. All casino gaming staff are licensed by the Gambling
Commission; all staff, including all food and drink and administrative
personnel, are trained annually in responsible gambling practices; and
effective 
<?notus-xml column=1304?>policies are in place to protect the young and
vulnerable. UK terrestrial casinos already provide their customers with
laptops, iPads and computers, which are available in their

intention appears to be to continue to categorise internet terminals
supplied by operators in casinos as gaming machines—probably
category A machines—while allowing the use of precisely the same
devices owned by customers in those casinos without restriction. The
idea that consumers accessing their own accounts on a gambling website
should have the content controlled simply because it is in a different
area of the same building and on something called a category A gaming
machine provided by the operator rather than on their own internet
access device adds nothing to player protection and is confusing for
the
consumer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000085">In
Grand Committee the Minister raised a number of concerns, notably
around the perceived lack of controls over how remote terminals might
develop. This new amendment seeks to respond to all those concerns. It
defines the exact nature of a remote gaming device and addresses the
concerns raised by the Minister by placing the responsibility for all
associated decisions solely with the Secretary of State. It provides
the Secretary of State with the power to stipulate not only the maximum
number of remote terminals within a casino but the location where and
the circumstances in which a remote terminal may be used, as well as a
remote terminal’s specific use and appearance and the fact that
these machines would not be capable of accepting or processing any form
of payment. To go one step further, the revised amendments would even
enable the Secretary of State to provide for any other

proposals can realistically be achieved only through primary
legislation. I noted what the Minister said in his letter and
understand that he still says that the changes the industry desires to
allow remote devices in casinos can be achieved by the secondary
legislation route. However, that is very much not the preferred route
of the industry. As I said, it leads to all the complications of
designating these machines as category A. I believe that that position
has been repeated to the National Casino Forum by officials and the
department’s lawyers, but without any detail given about how
secondary legislation could be effective. There are considerable
uncertainties about this route. Surely trying to do this via just
secondary legislation would add an unnecessary layer of complexity and
uncertainty, whereas this amendment would give clear definition to the
changes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030479000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0002.htm#14030479000087">I
very much hope that my noble friend will agree that this amendment
offers and provides all the necessary safeguards, including going
further with the provision for the Secretary of State to regulate on
any other matter. In conversation, the Minister used the phrase
“unforeseen consequences”. However, as an enabling piece
of legislation that does not necessarily need to be brought into
effect, it is simply there for use if it is decided that that is the
way forward. That would seem 
<?notus-xml column=1305?>to cater for all unforeseen circumstances. In many
items of government legislation—I think of the Digital Economy
Act as merely one—quite often sections are not brought into
effect where the Government, on mature reflection, believe it is right
to not do so. I very much hope that the Government will accept this
amendment on the basis that it is perfectly possible to have a clause
in the Bill and then maturely reflect on whether it is the right way of
dealing with an issue. I believe that it is. Eventually, if the

existing machine rules—I think I have quoted him correctly on
that. It was that which

history on legislation in gambling regulation. That is the sort of
thing that leads to ineffective and bad regulation. That is exactly
what the previous Government tried to do when a new class of gaming
machine came out. That is the problem that we now have with what are
called fixed-odds betting terminals, which are not betting terminals at
all: they are gaming machines. It is really important when new machines
and new forms of gambling appear that we regulate them correctly and do
not try to fit them into boxes that are not really there. That is what
I would call the DCMS’s attempt at the King Canute style of
regulation, holding back the waves of new technology. That is what we
did before and we must be very careful not to do it again in this case.

is better to put it in primary or secondary legislation. I know that,
originally, the Government’s view was that this was not the
right legislative vehicle. I have heard that before so many times. I am
not quite sure what the right legislative vehicle is, but I am
absolutely certain that the general public do not care; they just want
it done. As my noble friend Lord Astor said, the right legislative

it is impossible to amend. If that is the route that the Government are
determined to go down, my understanding is that the industry is not
happy with it and would much prefer primary legislation but, obviously,
like any industry, it will take what it can get. It seems to the
industry, and it certainly seems to me, that primary legislation is the
right vehicle for this. Unless the Minister can give us a very good
reason why it is not, that is what we should do. There is quite enough
flexibility in the provision. I think that your Lordships deserve the

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank my noble
friend for his amendment and all my noble friends who have spoken to
it. It is intended to allow the casino sector to introduce its specific
remote gambling product into casino premises. As I said in Grand
Committee, the Government are not opposed in principle to that,
provided that appropriate player protections are put in place. We
remain concerned that any changes should be effected within existing
machine regulations so that appropriate controls can be put in place,
rather than outside them in primary legislation, which this amendment
would cause.</hs_para>

have looked into this issue carefully and particularly because, on the
face of it, this seems like a simple change to current arrangements by
allowing casinos merely to promote their own online games within their
premises. On further reflection and in reality, however, this is a more
complex change that would introduce credit card play into the casino
environment for the first time and permit far broader sports
betting. It could also allow casinos to develop even more sophisticated
remote gaming machines without the proper controls afforded by machine
regulations.</hs_para>

able to offer remote gaming devices in their premises within existing
machine controls. Those regulations create a carefully crafted
hierarchy to ensure that machine-based play can be offered only with
appropriate player protections in place. Player protections are a key
part of this; they include restrictions on the number of machines,
their location and the circumstances under which they can be used. I
acknowledge that my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones is absolutely right
to say that casinos are at the top of the regulatory pyramid. However,
I also hope that noble Lords will agree that it is incumbent on the
Government—indeed, that the Government have a
responsibility—to consider carefully the impact of any new
gambling arrangements, to ensure the avoidance of unintended
consequences and an increase in problem gambling. My noble friend Lord
Mancroft mentioned the way in which developments can take us and given
the pace with which gaming technology develops, this is not merely a
theoretical risk.</hs_para>

recognises that any changes need to be made subject to appropriate
player protections. We welcome this, as it reflects the very
constructive dialogue that officials have had with the industry to date
on this issue. This is also acknowledged in my noble friends’
amendment, which gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations
for the nature and circumstances in which remote gaming machines can be
used in casinos. This brings us much closer to the current regulatory
structure and, in our view, it is difficult to see the need for primary
legislation. Indeed, there would be a real risk of introducing
regulatory anomalies in the existing primary legislation
route.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14030479000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030479000100">For
these reasons, the Government do not think that taking remote devices
outside existing regulation is the right route to tackling this issue.
The Government consider that this issue is best progressed instead
through the ongoing and very constructive discussions with industry,
and that any changes implemented can be done through secondary
legislation. I emphasise that the Government are actively engaged in
constructive discussion with the casino industry and the Gambling
Commission to consider the appropriate legislative and regulatory tools
that would need to be put in place. I understand entirely that the
industry would like to have primary legislation as its first objective
but it has acknowledged that secondary legislation is a viable option
to pursue these proposals.</hs_para>

very much a live discussion

also emphasise to your Lordships that the Government are not ruling out
change but that we think we need to approach this in the right manner
and ensure that such changes are made through an existing regulatory
framework that applies to gaming machines while bringing proper
scrutiny, assessment, consultation and—this is
paramount—consumer protections. It is for these reasons and

understand what my noble friend would prefer, I ask him whether he

that response, albeit that it was somewhat disappointing in the
circumstances. It was somewhat circular, in that he said that we must
have appropriate player protection and the appropriate protection is
that provided by secondary legislation, so we go around the loop that
says that secondary legislation must be the way forward. Yet the

the discussions taking place with the industry as ongoing and
constructive, but to date the industry itself has found them to be
ongoing but frustrating because of the insistence on bringing the whole

machines subject to all the existing secondary legislation, rather than
finding a new and more flexible way of dealing with them. However, it
is not incumbent on me to keep bashing my head against a brick wall. I
very much hope that the Minister’s discussions will be rather
more fruitful than they have been to date. From the timescale, I fear

main effect of the Bill, far from enhancing consumer protection, is
actually to place it under greater pressure by dramatically widening
the scope for online gambling advertising in the UK. Rather than
enhancing consumer protection, the Bill’s principal implication
will consequently be to make the British people more aware of gambling
opportunities, and not just any such opportunities but opportunities
associated with a far higher problem gambling prevalence figure than
gambling generally. While the basic 2010 problem prevalence figure was
0.9% for online, it was over 9% on an annual basis and over 17% on a
monthly basis.</hs_para>

the intervention of the Secretary of State over the weekend rather odd.
She has said that she wants to clamp down on gambling advertising, yet
her department is at the same time introducing dramatic online gambling
licensing liberalisation. I am genuinely at a loss to know how these
two commitments fit together. Estimates differ, but it is widely
recognised that the UK embraces about 450,000 problem gamblers. That
may not seem very many as a proportion of the total population, but it
is a very significant number of people in absolute terms. We rightly
devote very considerable care and attention to other social challenges
that affect similar numbers of people, yet we do not seem to
accord problem gambling the same level of concern or
attention.</hs_para>

very debilitating condition that takes over people’s lives and
destroys them. Last week, I was privileged to hold a briefing on this
amendment in the Palace of Westminster that was addressed by two
recovering problem gamblers who bravely shared their stories. Justyn,
aged 45, and Dino, aged 36, developed gambling problems relatively
recently, within the past four years or so. Of particular interest for
the purposes of the Bill, which liberalises online gambling
advertising, is that they both began online gambling in response to
adverts they had seen promoting free bets. In one case, the advertising
was at a sporting event; in the other, it was on a bus. The destructive
impact of problem gambling on both was remarkably similar. They got
into difficulty relatively quickly and ended up losing their jobs and
families and became hugely involved in debt.</hs_para>

of the problems with online gambling is the fact that it is available
24/7 with no natural barriers, such as those pertaining to a 
<?notus-xml column=1310?>betting shop. You do not have to leave the house to gamble, and there is
no closing time. They also highlighted that it is an enormously
solitary experience without any kind of accountability to fellow
humans. One of them even ended up selling his son’s christening
presents to raise funds to feed his habit. It is a matter of great
concern to me that this Bill, which is supposed to be about consumer
protection, not only proposes making life much more difficult for
problem gamblers, such as Justin and Dino, but completely fails
to take any balancing or compensating steps to help them.</hs_para>

failure to do so is further compounded by the fact that online gamblers
are already seriously disadvantaged in terms of the support available
to them when compared with terrestrial gamblers. One of the key
mechanisms for helping problem gamblers is self-exclusion. Problem
gamblers, like other addicts, experience days when they are stronger
and days when they are weaker. On a stronger day, a problem gambler can
get around the five betting shops in his town and self-exclude for a
fixed period—say, six months—and thereby cut himself off
from local gambling opportunities for the period in question, during
which time he can seek help and try to put his life back together
again. Crucially, however, the same provision does not have the same
effect for online problem gamblers. On a strong day, the online problem
gambler can self-exclude from five online gambling providers, but he
cannot cut himself off from all locally available online gambling
opportunities because there will still be hundreds, if not thousands,
of online gambling providers that remain equally accessible from his
bedroom.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14030480000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000095">Not
only do online problem gamblers have to exclude themselves far more
times to cut themselves off from locally available gambling
opportunities, they would have to self-exclude to an extent that is
physically impossible. Mindful of the fact that self-excluding once is
a difficult step for a problem gambler to take, the idea of doing it
hundreds, if not thousands of times, simply is not credible.</hs_para>

is my firm belief that we should provide online problem gamblers with
the credible form of self-exclusion promoted by my amendment. Amendment
7 proposes that instead of trying to self-exclude from multiple online
gambling websites, online problem gamblers should have the option of
self-excluding just once to the Gambling Commission. The Gambling
Commission would then relay the self-exclusion to all online providers
with Gambling Commission licences and all such providers would be
required to honour the terms of the self-exclusion as a condition of
their licence.</hs_para>

shop online self-exclusion mechanism was demonstrated clearly through
the testimony of the online problem gamblers who came to Parliament
last week. Justyn Larcombe said that had a one-stop shop self-exclusion
mechanism been in place in 2012 it could have saved his
marriage. Justyn, with the support of his wife, made the difficult
decision to self-exclude from the online gambling site he had been
using. The reality of his self-exclusion provided both Justyn and his
wife with a real sense of security. It was, however, only a matter of
time before he saw adverts for other online gambling websites and, 
<?notus-xml column=1311?>three months on, he had been fully set back into using alternative
sites. When his long-suffering wife found out, that was it; she left

he was adamant that a one-stop shop self-exclusion mechanism would make
a real and practical difference to their lives. Of course, neither was

relatively simple step that could be taken and would make a clear,
positive impact on their lives. They could not understand why the

Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendment.
Gambling is an extraordinary business, and it is never more so than
when otherwise sensible, able people become addicted to it. I was
present at the meeting kindly organised by the noble Lord, Lord Browne,
and I was very moved by the testimony of the two men there who had
fallen prey to this addiction. One was a Regular Army officer who was
thereafter a senior figure and shareholder in a City business; the
other was an engineer who had been a broadcast disc jockey. Listening
to those two men—who were being extraordinarily brave,
forthright and frank—drove home to me the sheer loneliness and
social isolation that goes with the addiction to gambling and what an
awful business it
is<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T20:59:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

see what objection there can be against a one-stop shop as described by
those two gamblers. It is an opportunity, by a single voluntary act of
self-exclusion, to be safe from all the gambling outlets. That, of

and which others may feel about it—namely that it tinkers with
the freedom of the subject. It does no such thing because the
subject—the addict—has to self-exclude. Nobody is forcing
it on the addict. Surely we must help the addict self-exclude where
they want to do so, and not leave a vast vista of opportunities

closely with the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Browne, and that of the

Noble Lords will realise that it is quite rare for Members from this
Bench to quote the scriptures. For understandable reasons we are a bit
coy about doing that. However, I cannot avoid going to a verse from the
First Epistle to Timothy, which says
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14030480000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000109">“the

is great truth in that. The lure and attraction of wealth so often lies
behind the person who turns gambling from an innocent pastime into an
obsession, an addiction or whatever. A responsible society has to do
what it can to protect people against these false gods and false goals.
When you get into the digital world, you simply raise the stakes, to
use a gambling analogy. If I am a problem gambler and I have to walk 
<?notus-xml column=1313?>down to the betting shop in Chester, there is a
natural restraint—there may be only two or three people there
and they will wonder what I am doing when I walk through the door. But

very greatly—the way in which the internet is used in relation
to pornography. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, has talked about this on
previous occasions. I have had a particular problem with two or three
clergy in my diocese who have innocently thought that accessing child
pornography on the internet was somehow not as serious as interfering
directly with an actual human being. Of course, the law quite properly
says that accessing child pornography on the internet is to be
complicit in the actual original abuse. People have that sort of
innocent view of the internet so often. The more checks and balances

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord,
Lord Browne, for introducing the amendment. We are also signed up to
it. The noble Lord spoke at length about the issues that he wanted to
raise, building on the meeting that he kindly organised, at which I was
also present. I endorse what has been said by other noble Lords who
were there, including the noble Lord, Lord
Phillips<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T21:06:57"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T21:06:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000022">The
interesting thing about gambling, to me, coming to it relatively
unskilled in this area, is that it is one of those areas about which we
make a set of assumptions when we approach it, then we discover as we
get closer to it that they do not stand up. For example, one thinks of
addiction very much in terms of what substance people are taking that
has a chemical effect on their body which makes them addicted. But with
gambling, all the signs, evidence and research suggest that we are
dealing with addictive activity, but there is no physical substance. Of
course, it may well be, as the right reverend Prelate was saying, that
something about the internet has a way of interacting with our neurons
and has an effect that we do not yet fully understand. There is
absolutely no doubt, from the reading that I have done for these
debates, and from the evidence that we heard at that powerful meeting,
that we are talking about something really rather serious and
deep-seated worries should flow from
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T21:07:59"></hs_TimeCode>. It is not
that the problem is extremely widespread—it is not—but
the numbers are still significant. If we are talking about 450,000
people in our society, of course, we as a responsible society should
take action to try to help
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000023">The
situation, as I understand it, is that the regulatory position is very
clear. There has to be a process for self-exclusion, because it is
recognised that it is a 
<?notus-xml column=1314?>helpful way to do it. It may not be the only way to get people away from
gambling and it may not be sufficient on its own, but at
least—as long as the evidence is there that it is
helpful—we must make sure that the regulatory framework supports
it. It is obviously right that, for those who obtain a licence to
operate in current systems, and in future systems envisaged by this
Bill, we need to see the self-exclusion procedures in place. I do not
think any of us would be against that, but I have a problem in
understanding why it is sufficient for the Government to argue that
simply having a voluntary scheme operated by those who perpetrate the
harm is sufficient in this case. The evidence that we have—and
the very moving testimony that we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord
Browne—suggests that those affected by this, those who are
addicted and those who are trying to help, say that simply having the
mechanism available on a case-by-case basis, on every website that they
go to, as it may be regulated in future, and therefore having available
the ability to self-exclude, is not
sufficient<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T21:09:39"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T21:09:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T21:08:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000097">If
it is not sufficient, what system can we put in place to make sure that
it works? Again, the evidence shows that the detailed proposal of the
noble Lord, Lord Browne, seems to work for those with whom we have been
in touch. Therefore, it seems to me a bit perverse for the Government
to continue to say that they do not think that any further action is
required in this regard. But what are they saying? I hope that when the
noble Baroness responds, she will try to tease out the wording in the
letter that we received yesterday from the Minister, which
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14030480000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000110">“But

seems to suggest that there is at least the option of having something
that will meet the criterion emerging from this evening’s
debate—namely, that there must be something that will work for
those people who are addicted. It must be something that does not mean
they are constantly coming across additional websites which are not
part of the scheme. It should, if possible, work with areas that are
not yet regulated, although I understand that will be difficult.
Certainly, if it were possible to keep open the proposal of the noble
Lord, Lord Browne, until such time as the review is completed, that
would help us a lot in dealing with the issue behind this

are not saying that that is the only way in which this issue can be

Browne of Belmont, for his amendment, which seeks to create a
centralised self-exclusion scheme. I seek to reassure him with regard
to the Secretary of State’s letter and with regard to the noble
Lord’s suggestion that gambling is being liberalised. The
Government do not see this as a liberalising Bill. It ensures that all
operators who currently advertise in Britain, and wish to do so in the
future, are required to have a Gambling Commission licence. This is
consistent with what the Secretary of State was
saying.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000028">Problem
gambling is debilitating and I reassure noble Lords that the Government
take this extremely seriously. I am in absolutely no doubt about the
commitment of the noble Lord, Lord Browne, to this. Problem gambling is
not only debilitating for the gambler himself or herself, but creates a
heavy burden on their families and on society at large. I was not at
the relevant presentation but I have heard that it was very powerful.
Strategies to prevent and address problem gambling are key aspects of
the social responsibility obligations set out in the Gambling
Commission’s licence conditions and a priority within the
Government’s approach to gambling more generally. Self-exclusion

while there are practical and legal difficulties associated with the

<?notus-xml column=1316?>the aim of making significant progress within six

Further, it will bring together learning from the remote and non-remote

the Responsible Gambling Trust is reviewing the effectiveness of the

Board, in its 2013-14 strategy, identified self-exclusion as requiring
further research—in particular, on how effective it is and on
what changes could improve its usefulness to those who wish to control
their gambling. The Responsible Gambling Trust is expected to report in
May 2014. This work will provide an analysis of the effectiveness of
self-exclusion, its limitations and the challenges to creating enhanced
systems. It will also review experiences in other jurisdictions. We
welcome the Remote Gambling Association’s announcement this week

self-exclusion mechanisms as accessible and easy to use as possible,

local betting shop, and their exclusion would apply to all shops in
that chain and all other chains within the UK. We are therefore
confident that all this work will result in real progress on allowing
consumers to exclude across multiple online sites—which is what
the noble Lord is looking for; the concept of a one-stop shop, as is it

Browne of Belmont:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to
everyone who has spoken in this debate and I have listened carefully to
what the Minister has had to say. I very much welcome the fact that the
Government have moved a long way on one-stop shop self-exclusion since
the beginning of the passage of this Bill in another place—from
clear opposition in the Commons to commending research in the
Lords—and they now talk of making significant progress in the
next six months towards creating a one-stop shop self-exclusion
mechanism.</hs_para>

have a number of questions for the Minister. First, can she clarify
that it is the clear and deliberate intention of the Government to
establish a national self-exclusion scheme for remote gamblers? Can she
confirm that it will happen? Secondly, can she provide a little more
detail on the timing? In the letter from the Minister, the noble Lord,
Lord Gardiner, reference was made to making significant progress in the
next six months but there was no reference to when the Government hope
that the arrangement might be in place. Finally, can she confirm that
the new arrangement will be statutory in the sense that it will be

the legislative framework, it would become an exemplar nation on this

Australia. Perhaps it might catch up in cricket a little later as well.

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I have taken no
part in proceedings on the Bill so far, but I will take the opportunity
tonight to say a few words in support of what I consider to be an
important and significant amendment. My noble friend Lady Heyhoe Flint
ran through the technicalities with great precision and the hour is
late, so I will not repeat her arguments but will restrict myself to
three separate
points.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000055">I
asked myself why people consider a couple of years’ imprisonment
a relatively light punishment and not a serious deterrent for a serious
match fixer. For many people, it seems a victimless
crime—except, perhaps, for the bookmakers, who as a group do not
command much public sympathy. When I began my career in the City, there
was another victimless crime—or rather, a crime that was
believed to be victimless—which was insider dealing. In my
generation it was perhaps not as widespread as in the previous
generation, when you were not paid much money because it was expected
that you would trade inside in order to make good your rather
inadequate wages. Undoubtedly quite a lot of it went
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000056">When one
asks why people accepted that situation, it was because the crime was
believed to be victimless—and, if it was not victimless, it was
extraordinarily difficult to prosecute and eradicate, because one could
never catch up with insider dealers. Any law would be unenforceable,
and an unenforceable law would have no merit. More importantly, if it
was unenforceable it ran the risk of bringing the wider law into
disrepute.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000057">I
have not had a chance to glance over the Minister’s shoulder to
see the notes that he will use in a few minutes, but I suspect that
there will be a good deal about the issue of unenforceability as a
reason for not wishing to accept my noble friend’s amendment.
However, to go back for a moment to the example of insider dealing,
over a period of years, as the legal framework changed, the attitude to
enforcement changed and the reputational risk increased, the
prevalence and acceptability of insider dealing diminished. While I
will not claim that it does not exist now in the City, its instance is
pretty
small.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000058">That is
what this amendment seeks to achieve: a higher penalty, linked to a
higher reputational risk for engaging in this crime, so that its
frequency is likely to be very much reduced. For match fixing
is not a victimless crime. Its victims are not, of course, those on the
inside, be they investors or gamblers; it is usually the smaller,
poorer and less experienced people who suffer.</hs_para>

second point. If I could see further down my noble friend’s
speaking note, I think I would see that he will emphasise not just the
difficulties of domestic enforcement but the much greater challenge
posed by the extraterritorial nature of so many of these crimes, which
seem to have overseas origins. Leaving aside the desirability of our
making the greatest possible effort to root out match fixing completely
in the UK, my noble friend on the Front Bench should remember that Her
Majesty’s Government have not always found extraterritoriality
to be an insuperable bar. The Bribery Act, although not
uncontroversial  
<?notus-xml column=1323?>in its application, requires UK companies to take
responsibility for their agents overseas, even where the agent is not
directly employed by them. There are precedents and experience in this
area which we could build on to develop our activities to inhibit,
prevent and eradicate match fixing in the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T21:34:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000060">To
conclude, it seems that this modest amendment sends a clear signal that
the heat is being turned up as regards this crime: 10 years on
conviction, not two years, could not be clearer. I shall of course
listen very carefully to my noble friend’s reply in due course.
The Hippocratic oath says, I think, “First, do no harm”.
I want to hear from him not why the enforcement of this amendment will
be difficult—I am sure it will be—but why its existence
on the stature book would do any harm or not take us in the right
direction towards eradicating this extremely unpleasant and,
apparently, increasingly prevalent

Grantchester (Lab):</Member></B> I speak in favour of Amendment 8, in
the names of the noble Baronesses, Lady Heyhoe Flint and Lady
Grey-Thompson, the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, and my noble friend Lord
Stevenson. This amendment not only comes from all sides of the House
but is in the names of great sporting personalities who have
participated at the highest level of elite sport. I support them in
their contention that sport must maintain the highest levels of
integrity and be recognised to be fair and honest. Sport governing
bodies have been relentless in stamping out cheating, whether through
drugs, unfair equipment or fraudulent activity, in order to maintain
the public’s interest and trust. We all enjoy the pursuit of
excellence and recognise that competition is the spur to improvement.
The public will turn away, sponsors withdraw funds and participants
lose interest if they detect any level of cheating or corruption, or
any lack of fair
play.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000062">The
amendment creates a clear and specific offence of cheating that covers
all activities that fixers may engage in. All sports would have this
offence available under the Gambling Act. Recently, we have witnessed
the difficulties cricketing authorities had to face in prosecuting and
getting convictions regarding the bowling of no-balls by Pakistani
cricketers. This situation could easily occur with throw-ins and other
events in professional football. I understand that the authorities had
to go to great lengths to enforce fair play and that they went ahead
under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906. This offence will enable a
strong deterrent from stricter penalties to warn and educate all
sportspersons. Professional bodies such as the Professional
Footballers’ Association in soccer can underline to their
members the dangers and risks associated with being caught
cheating<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T21:37:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000063">I

apologise for intruding on their party but I do so because this is a
really interesting amendment, and I am rather annoyed we did not think
of it ourselves on this side of the House. The 2005 Act was much
castigated earlier on in our debates but is still a rather good Act in
its way. It goes out of its way to make it clear that it is not dealing
with the integrity of sport—this point has been made
already—and does not attempt to try to deal with the actual
issues around the playing of sport. Its actions are about gambling, and
sport is only one of a number of things that people can gamble on. We
should not therefore expect that Bill to carry us all the way to where
we want to get to in this new area, which is about trying to make sure
that the sport that we all love and enjoy is played to the highest
standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000066">I
talked earlier about the need for integrity. It is an issue that we
need to think very hard about. It is not necessarily the case that if
you follow the argument that I am about to make through to the end we
would end up with simply amending the current Bill; I suspect our
ambitions are a bit broader than that. When the Minister responds,
perhaps he could reflect on the question that has been posed implicitly
in the speeches we have heard today and explicitly outside by a number
of people who are now saying that there is something slightly odd about
the way in which we pay so much attention to the process of gambling
around the sporting activity but we do not think hard enough about what
we need to do to ensure that the sporting activity itself is as clean
and above suspicion as it should be. That is the way in which I want to
approach
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000067">The
noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, said that we were talking about something
that is called a victimless crime and pointed out that that was a

in running a sports club of great distinction, knows all too well about
some of the issues that have arisen there.</hs_para>

the only serious case we have seen in recent years, which involved
spread betting rather than fixed-odds arrangements, was prosecuted
under a conspiracy to defraud offence and not under the provisions of
the Gambling Act. On my reading of it, that is not unreasonable because
the Gambling Act does not go in that direction but, if that is the
case, the point was made earlier about the need to
level up the tariffs on all these approaches to try to clean up
sport—they need to be the same. So we are talking about a
10-year penalty being the standard for crimes against sporting
activity. If anybody affects the integrity of the sports that we are
concerned about, we should be able to use a range of penalties and
approaches to ensure that the person is
nailed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000069">We
have looked at the number of prosecutions for match fixing in sport and
there seems to be about one a year at the moment. Although, as I have
said, there

that they do take place. There is evidence that there is quite a lot of
match-fixing activity going on, not necessarily all related to
gambling, and that is one of my
points.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000070">The

is on the DCMS to come forward with proposals on this. The European
Parliament and Commission have called for all member states to have
specific match-fixing legislation. Again, one might ask the Minister
what action the department will take to respond to that call. The

with gambling-related match fixing. The Government will consider any
such evidence when it is supplied. We have received two case studies to

we have yet to see robust evidence demonstrating a problem with Section

Section 42 in the context of negotiations on the Council of
Europe’s draft convention. The Government recently reviewed
Section 42 in that context. All the legal teams and others came to the
conclusion that Section 42 as currently drafted, together with other
fraud and corruption offences already on the statute book, gives
prosecutors the tools required to deal with the circumstances that
might constitute match
fixing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000079">As the
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, said, there have been some criticisms of
the 2005 Act and, perhaps, some of its consequences. At the time,
Section 42 was deliberately crafted to be a broad offence in which
“cheating” was intended to have its normal, everyday
meaning. The provision expressly extends to actions that involve actual
or attempted deception or interference with the processes involved in
the conduct of gambling or any other race, game, event or process to
which gambling relates. That was done precisely to ensure that it could
be used in a wide range of circumstances. That is why we are concerned
about changing it. I emphasise that
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000080">Section
42 also clearly spells out that the offence is committed not just by
the person who cheats but also by a person who does something for the
purpose of assisting or enabling another person to cheat. That means
that Section 42 already covers all the ground that my noble
friend’s amendment seeks to add. Section 42 already
applies to both remote and non-remote types of betting, whereas this
amendment applies only to remote betting. We therefore believe the
amendment could create confusion and that it is better to retain the
existing provision for that
reason.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-03-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_03_04_PT_1/301BEBDB8E9B036FB5B296C0FB0C8E71553221EC" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 March 2014">Tuesday,

amendment would also raise the custodial tariff for Section 42 offences
from two to 10 years. It has been argued that an increase in

Lordships why we believe that there is no need for a change in the
tariff. The Government consider that the penalties in Section 42 remain
proportionate and appropriate, and are consistent with other offences

two-year jail sentence is not a sufficient deterrent or that law

UK has a number of legislative tools at its disposal to combat
corruption of sports competitions. The toolkit naturally includes
Section 42 of the Gambling Act 2005, where there is a link with
betting. We can also use other fraud and corruption offences where that
link with betting cannot be established. It does not mean that Section
42 is inadequate simply because it cannot be applied in every
situation. When a sportsperson is found to be engaged in match fixing
not linked to betting, the penalties under the bribery and fraud Acts
are severe, as your Lordships have already
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030480000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-0003.htm#14030480000084">The

accept the assurances from the Minister in true sporting spirit. I came

Council began with a discussion about industrial competitiveness.
Member States were asked to outline their priorities for improving
industrial competitiveness, achieving a balance between climate, energy
and competitiveness policies and how to mainstream industrial
competitiveness into all policy areas. In its presentation, the
Commission outlined its overall approach, noting that: all policy
proposals should be competitiveness proofed; support should be given to
innovative SMEs; and the Competitiveness Council should play a greater
role on industrial policy. The Commission also reiterated its proposed
target to boost industry’s share of EU GDP to 20%. The UK called
for: the EU to focus on creating the right single market conditions;
reduced burdens; a strong state aid regime; free trade agreements; a
cost effective and flexible energy and climate framework; a reformed
Emissions Trading System; robust action to prevent carbon leakage; and
a single energy market. The UK also emphasised that the EU should not
be distracted by artificial targets on
industrialisation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030463000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140304-wms0001.htm#14030463000008">This
was followed by a discussion regarding the Annual Growth Survey. The
Commission noted the progress many Member States had made on their
Country Specific Recommendations, but argued that too many service
sector barriers remained. Key sectors where action should be taken
included business and professional services, construction and retail.
The UK emphasised the need to fully implement the Services Directive,
called on the Commission to urgently provide guidance on
proportionality, and suggested following a sectoral approach for
further services liberalisation (e.g. professional business
services).</hs_para>

and space issues were covered on 21 February. During research

Space Agency and establish a new Agency within the EU with similar

national minimum wage legislation in the social care sector. The
Department of Health is developing statutory guidance for local
authorities which refers to employment law and the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) guidance on payment of travel
time. This will enable local authorities to assure themselves that the
care companies they contract with comply with NMW regulations. This
guidance should be available in the Autumn.</hs_para>
