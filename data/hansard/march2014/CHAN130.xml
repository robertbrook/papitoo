Japan will then be taken at the end of the Human Rights Council and we
will work with colleagues there to ensure that we have the best
possible mechanism to hold the DPRK to account. Incidentally, I believe
that when the curtain is finally lifted on that country, we will see

political issue. Having witnessed the bilateral meeting between the

nothing naive about it. The Prime Minister forcefully put the case for
Sri Lanka to mount its own inquiry and forcefully made it
clear that he would press for an international inquiry if it did not do
so. That is what he is doing in his contacts with other Heads of

protection plan, which was endorsed during the conference by five key
African states, now needs to be implemented in those states, and funded
by other states and by the private sector. If that happens, it can
become a game-changing agreement on preserving the African elephant. I

right to emphasise the importance of bringing the parties back to the
table. For that to happen, the Assad regime has to be ready to discuss
the creation of a transitional governing body. The offer that Lakhdar
Brahimi made to both sides when the talks last ended was that they
would discuss terrorism, as the regime describes it, and a transitional
governing body, as the Opposition wanted, in parallel. The regime
refused to do that, but it needs to become ready to so that for the

reaffirm specifically that for the United Kingdom not only all

more, than the EU needs Russia. We need to have the common political

the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr Gray) is right to point to what
happened on the Moscow stock exchange and to the value of the Russian
currency yesterday. There are major risks for Russia economically. I
expressed the view a few moments ago that, in the medium to long term,
Russia needs the economic co-operation of European nations just as much
as or more than they need the co-operation of Russia. That has to
become part of Russia’s calculations in the coming

Peter Hain</B> (Neath) (Lab):</Member> Given President Putin’s
increasing international and domestic malevolence, is there not a
danger that the west will get caught between saying strong words and
taking no action on the one hand and, on the other hand, allowing
Russia’s legitimate interests, such as its interest in the port
of Sevastopol and its Mediterranean port, and its economic interests,
to provide some spurious legitimacy for his actions? Is there not a
case, therefore, for a new more global deal that addresses the
legitimate Russian interests—although not the illegitimate
ones—but protects self-determination around Russia’s
border? That might provide some comfort to the President, and more
importantly to the people, that NATO has limited ambitions around
Russia’s border, because I think that that is part of the
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0001.htm#14030455000091"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Hague" PimsId="3707" UID="14030455000527" xid="245" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0001.htm#14030455000527">Mr

hon. Gentleman correctly refers, and we must be prepared to be
imaginative about long-term frameworks and solutions. We have already
made the argument—I made it only a week ago to Foreign Minister
Lavrov—that we recognise those Russian interests and are not
seeking a zero-sum strategic game, and that there will be ways for the
Russian economy, as well as the Ukrainian economy, to benefit from
closer ties to the European Union. However, the response to us and
other countries making that argument has been what we have seen over

It was being discussed with the Yanukovych Administration, because they
wanted to discuss it with the European Union. I assure my hon. Friend
that from everything I have seen in Ukraine, having been there on
Sunday and Monday, there is strong political unity in that country that

produce less NATO presence in countries that border Russia—far
from it. The countries in close proximity to Russia will be anxious to
have a stronger NATO presence in future. Russia’s action is very
counter-productive from that point of view. NATO membership has not
been in prospect for Ukraine. In any case, as so many right hon. and

what they have done. Therefore, I urge my right hon. Friend to push for

in Ukraine was a major reverse for Russian foreign policy. In many

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T13:54:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone), there have been previous
Russian actions in Georgia and Moldova which might be considered a
model for this action, and Russia has not felt sharp consequences as a
result of them. That is no doubt an emboldening factor, but I think
Russian policy has also been driven by the imperative I referred to a
few moments ago of trying to alleviate, or reverse in some way, the
major setback for Russian foreign policy that took place only 10 days
ago in Ukraine, and also possibly by the desire—which I referred
to much earlier—permanently to impair the free and democratic
operation of Ukraine and its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. There is a
mixture of motives, and I entirely accept that it is important that we
raise the penalties and consequences for acting on those
motives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000156"><Member ContinuationText="Mark Lazarowicz" PimsId="1440" UID="14030455000590" xid="351" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000590"><B>Mark

lurking outside stadiums trying to sell spare tickets to becoming
sophisticated people, harvesting thousands of tickets just seconds

see what sort of prices the secondary sites command, I took a look at
the prices for a rugby world cup game that I will be watching with
great interest—Wales’ victory over England. Tickets are
not even on sale yet, although the organisers have said that they will
range from £75 for the cheaper seats to £315.
However, a quick search on Google turned up a range of prominent
secondary sites already offering tickets at prices ranging from
£920 to £1,725. That kind of ticket touting is parasitic.
It leeches off fans who are desperate to see their heroes and
organisations that are charging fair prices.</hs_Para>

be more than £100,000 a year. The National Theatre spends tens
of thousands a year, as does the RFU. The misleading nature of online
ticket touting means that many people buy tickets believing that they
are coming from fellow fans. The first web page they come to may be a
secondary sales site and the uninitiated could believe that they are
buying from the only outlet or paying a fair price, when really they
are being ripped off. Unfortunately, despite evidence of touting in the
secondary market, the Government refuse to designate the rugby world

important leadership on consumer rights. Our concerns include the

pressed it on its supply of tickets from the power sellers and the
public selling tickets they cannot use. It said there was none. We are
also concerned that the secondary market and its exorbitant prices are

my hon. Friend, I believe we can only address the industrial ripping

fairness to fans.</hs_Para>

England and Wales but because of the nature of the Bill itself. I
suggest that the hon. Gentleman starts off by looking at the report,
which was produced in the last Parliament, of the Culture, Media and

that the secondary ticketing market was perfectly legitimate.

misapprehension is that ticket touts and people in the secondary market
are guaranteed to make a substantial profit, but that simply is not the
case. For example, 50% of tickets sold on Viagogo are sold at face
value or below and people can make a loss. As far as I am concerned,
this is a matter of clear principle. If someone buys a ticket, that
ticket belongs to them and they should be able to do what they please
with it, just as they should with any other commodity that they buy.
For argument’s sake, there are times on the high street when
designer handbags come out in limited edition. Some 30 or 40 may be
available. It is first come, first served. People rush into the shops
to snatch one. They then immediately put them on eBay to make a massive
profit. I do not see what the difference is between that and those
people who want to sell on a ticket at an inflated price if they think
that demand outstrips
supply.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000201"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T14:19:08"></hs_TimeCode>That
also happens with toys. One Christmas, Buzz Lightyear was an especially
popular toy, so people bought the limited stock and immediately sold
the toys on eBay at a huge profit. I do not understand why tickets
should be treated differently, but perhaps the hon. Gentleman wants to
restrict people’s ability to resell any commodity above the
price that they paid  for
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T14:19:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000202">The
hon. Gentleman fairly made the point—he then disagreed with
it—that a promoter or organiser does not lose anything as a
result of the secondary ticketing market. If a promoter puts on an
event for which there are 50,000 tickets and charges £20 for
each, they have decided that they want to realise £1 million
from that event. After all the tickets have sold, that £1
million has been made, so whatever happens subsequently makes no
difference to the event’s viability or that promoter. The hon.
Gentleman talks about people spending money on policing the secondary
market, but I suggest that they do not bother, because they then do not
waste money doing so and can realise the amount that they get in the
first
place<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T14:20:42"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T14:20:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

absolutely essential that there is a resale mechanism for tickets for
the rugby world cup. The supporters of the some of the successful rugby
teams, such as the All Blacks, are likely to buy many of the tickets
for the final in the expectation that their team will reach it. That
might well be the case, but the All Blacks could equally find
themselves knocked out in the semi-final and if that happens, surely it
would be in the best interests of the competition for there to be a
mechanism through which New Zealand supporters may sell on their
tickets to the supporters of the teams that reach the final. If those
All Blacks supporters are not allowed to resell their tickets in the
way that I would like, we will have the ridiculous situation that the
crowd at the final is full of people who do not support either team,
yet the people who want the tickets cannot buy

hon. Gentleman talked about real fans, but I am not sure what the
definition of a “real fan” is. I suggest, Madam Deputy
Speaker, that if someone is prepared to pay £1,200,
£1,500 or £2,000 for a ticket, you can bet your bottom
dollar that they are a real fan. I do not understand the suggestion
that selling tickets at inflated prices stops real fans attending
events because if people are prepared to pay such prices, the chances
are that they are especially keen fans. There is a simple premise that
if someone does not want to pay the price that a seller asks, they
should not do so. No one forces someone to pay an inflated price for a
ticket—it is a free choice. If I decide at the last minute that
I want to attend a sold-out event, the secondary market is the only
place I can go to access a ticket. I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman
wants to remove that choice from people. If I think that the price
being asked is too high, I will just walk away and not attend, but at
least I will have had a chance to go to that event, although I would
have had no such opportunity without the secondary ticketing

to use the Monty Python example that the hon. Gentleman cited? Why do
not they sell a few tickets each week so that tickets are still
available at face value in the week before the game or concert, meaning

<?notus-xml column=786?>that no one would have to pay inflated prices through secondary
ticketing? If this is such a big issue for the organisers of events,
sporting fixtures and concerts, they could do something about it at the
drop of the hat. However, they do not anything about it, which can lead
us to conclude only that they are shedding crocodile tears and are
actually rather pleased that they can sell all their tickets in 43.5
seconds because that is good for their cash flow and guarantees a

investigated cyber-security as a discrete topic, although in 2009 we
had looked at Georgia and Estonia, and visited Talinn, as part of
another inquiry. The UK Government had identified cyber-threats as one
of four tier 1 risks to national security, and in November 2013
published a UK cyber-security strategy, updating its 2009 strategy and
setting out four objectives: first, to make the UK one of the most
secure places in the world to do business in cyberspace; secondly, to
make the UK more resilient to cyber-attack and better able to protect
our interests in cyberspace; thirdly, to help to shape an open, vibrant

possible vulnerabilities, which runs all the way down the supply chain.

Friend the Secretary of State also talked about how the UK was
developing a full spectrum military cyber-capability, including strike
capability. This is an interesting and novel declaration. Everybody
knows it has happened but nobody has been prepared before now to
announce it. Will this declaration act as a deterrent or will it make
the UK a more likely target for hacktivists and foreign states? What
about the legal implications of establishing a strike capability for
the personnel involved? The necessary rules for engagement for
cyber-attack need to be put into place, although of course we will not

that cyber is just another military domain and that we can expect to do
everything in cyberspace that we do in the air, on land or at sea to
prevent, deter coerce or intervene. But has the distinctiveness of the
cyber domain been fully grasped? It is not clear, for example, that
deterrence is a concept that can apply to a domain where there are real
difficulties in discovering quickly who has perpetrated an attack and
for what purpose, or even that an attack has taken place. Neither is it
clear that everyone has grasped how important it is to avoid a silo
approach to the cyberworld. It is essential to break down the dividing
lines between civilian and military, among Government Departments,
between Government and the private sector, and between our country and
other countries, and therefore to approach the issue in an holistic
way. Paul Dwyer of Mandiant came to brief the Defence Committee and

because the threat cannot be neatly categorised, it may be unrealistic
to expect a neat categorisation of the responses. Everything we have

am pleased to say that the Government are taking action to make the UK
more resilient to cyber-attacks. It has established a new computer
emergency response team in early 2014, CERT-UK, to improve the
co-ordination of national cyber-incidents and to share technical
information among countries. The Government set up a new cyber-incident
response scheme in GCHQ to help organisations recover from a
cyber-security attack. They have extended the remit of the Centre for
the Protection of National Infrastructure—the CPNI—to
work with all organisations that may have a role in protecting the
UK’s critical systems and intellectual property. They have
agreed with regulators in essential services a set of actions to make
sure that important data and systems in our critical national
infrastructure continue to be safe and resilient. As I have said,
responsibility for cyber-security rests principally with companies and

education, skills, thinking and policies that take into account both
the opportunities and the vulnerabilities that cyber presents. It is
time the Government approached the subject with vigour. I am pleased to
see the actions that they have taken since we issued our report.

Dai Havard</B> (Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney) (Lab):</Member> I would
first like to say something about the debate. I agree that the Defence
Committee is perhaps remiss in not applying for debates more regularly.
This debate is taking place on an estimates day. It is a really serious
debate that should be taking place in the Chamber in its own right. Our
report is now more than 12 months old—it was published in
January 2013—which says something about how quickly these things
move. The Government published their response in March 2013 and then
made a series of announcements last September, but here we are today
with the first opportunity to talk about it. That is an issue we need
to look
at<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T14:55:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000261" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000261">I
will not repeat what my colleague who chairs the Defence Committee,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T14:55:06"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot), said about structure,
but I would like to say something about structure, about
investment—we are talking about money, after all—and
about accountability. The statement made in September was very
interesting from two points of view. First, it set out a structure for
how the Ministry of Defence, along with the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills, the Cabinet Office and others—this cannot
be done in isolation—can start to look at its relationship with
industry and at protecting itself through its relationships with the
rest of the British community. I think that is hugely
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000262" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000262">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T14:59:32"></hs_TimeCode>
is a lot of work being done on achieving proper standards. We took
evidence from industry representatives on that, and they were all over
the shop, frankly. For example, they did not want standards, or they
wanted 
<?notus-xml column=794?>their own standards. The question of standards is absolutely at the guts
of the whole issue of defining cyber, and not just for the Ministry of
Defence. Industry must now have a compliance process with the Ministry
of Defence, and I am sure that the Minister will say something about
how that is to be done. That is hugely welcome, because it is vital.
How we then do that in relation to our allies, NATO, the EU, the
French—with our treaty—and others is a big issue that
needs proper discussion. We need to have proper compliance and
assurance mechanisms, as we do with our “Five Eyes”
colleagues and many others, because we are all trying to understand the
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000263" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000263"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T14:56:44"></hs_TimeCode>Most

country to come out and say that. I have spoken with some of our
international allies about that, and they say, “Well,
that’s a very interesting statement for the Brits to
make.” How we actually do that will be a matter for discussion.
I am not necessarily against the investment or the capability, but I
think that we need to be very clear about what we are saying and how we
are going to do things. There will need to be a doctrine and rules of
engagement. If we are saying that this is a new domain, I do not think
that we can run away from some of these questions. If we do and we keep
it too secret, we will lose legitimacy for the activities that we wish
to undertake. That is a difficult balancing act, but it is absolutely
crucial.</hs_Para>

exercise. I do not know how much it cost, because I am not supposed to
know who did it. Well, we do not know who did it, or we all suspect

the process of weaponisation alongside all the other things we are
talking about. How will we procure, what will we do with regard to
research and technology, and how will we keep a sovereign capability in
these areas? I suspect that those are big questions that Parliament

questions about international law, humanitarian law, extra-territorial

“We don’t need anything to be separate. This is a
different domain, but all the current legal constructs are good enough
and we do not need anything different.” I come back to my

Lopresti</B> (Filton and Bradley Stoke) (Con):</Member> I welcome the
chance to debate the UK’s cyber-security defence. Cyber-security
is a particularly wide-ranging subject and cyber-attacks are a growing
threat. Without stating the obvious, a cyber-attack could impact on
everyone’s lives in so many ways. We are now all so reliant on
technology and the internet; without our mobile phones or when our
e-mail goes down, we almost cease to function.</hs_Para>

cyber-attack on any of this country’s main utilities, such as
transport, energy or the banking system, would cause chaos. It would
be, at the very least, very bad for the economy; it could, in the
worst-case scenario—if we did not have the means to transport
food and fuel, for example—cause social breakdown in a short
time. South Korea, for instance, has suffered huge jamming attacks,
launched by North Korea, against its GPS systems. They affected major
airports and shipping 
<?notus-xml column=797?>lanes. The travel of more than 1,000 ships and 250 planes was
disrupted by North Korean jamming attacks in
2012.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000283" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000283">Cyber-security
needs to protect us against so many threats: criminals attacking
personal data, small-scale political activists—or
“hacktivists”, as somebody said earlier—and
state-sponsored hostilities. The Government’s cyber-security
strategy is along the right lines and has led to the national
cyber-security programme, which has clear
objectives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000284" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000284">Cyberspace
is often compared to the wild west and thought by some to be beyond the
rule of law. However, our Government have made it clear that it is not
and they have encouraged law enforcement teams to use the existing
legal framework to prosecute. When cyber-crime emanates from overseas,
the Government are working with the G8, the United Nations, NATO and
the European Union to help shape the standards and norms of behaviour
for cyberspace. Obviously, the solutions have not all yet been found
but the discussions are ongoing and the work is slowly evolving. I am
pleased that the work has started in
earnest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000286">Part
of the solution is normal, sensible protocol for cyber-security on the
domestic agenda and it can be addressed through simple best practice.
There is a knowledge gap and the Government are addressing it in the
long term via the development of education in cyber-security; teaching
materials on cyber-security are being produced for GCSE and A-level
students. Academic centres for cyber-security have been set up in 11
universities. Investment in education is far-sighted and will position
the UK with experts in the cyber-security
arena.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000287">The
Government have also gone some way to engaging with industry by setting
up the Cyber-Security Information Sharing Partnership. Furthermore, the
Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, or CPNI, is
working with businesses to encourage them to make cyber-security a
board-level responsibility. The current work on the development of an
official cyber-standard will help stimulate the adoption of good
cyber-practices among
businesses.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:09:38"></hs_TimeCode>
Given the risks to our infrastructure as a whole, the Government have
highlighted the role of regulators in overseeing the adoption of robust
cyber-security measures. The companies that supply essential services
such as power, telecommunications, water, transport and banking, need
maximum
protection.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000288" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000288">I
praise the many organisations that are tasked with upholding the
Government’s cyber-defence plans. However, as has been said, the
threat is so great that I worry that as a nation we are not doing
enough, fast enough. An industry study produced by BT last month found
that British companies are lagging way behind rivals in other major
countries in addressing cyber-security risks. The survey found that
only 17% of UK businesses see cyber-security as a priority compared
with 41% in the US. Nearly 90% of directors and decision makers in the
US are given IT security training, but in the UK it is only around
37%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000289" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000289">On

Defence Committee noted that the Army has between 35% and 40% too few

the reserve forces will play a crucial role in our future capability.
The Government have instigated broadly sensible long-term solutions
such as apprenticeships to fill the staff-skills gap in industry and
business, but how can we attract more trained staff immediately,

further concern is that the threat is so wide and imminent that the
command structure is not resilient. I understand that the global

is absolutely right. Within the chaos of a potential attack, I am not
sure how the disparate groups would communicate with one another, how
there would be a uniform chain of command and how it would work in
practice. GCHQ seems to be in charge, but in other countries the matter
would fall under the Ministry of Defence. It is fine that the MOD seems
to be still developing its own basic cyber-security techniques with the
armed forces setting up separate units, but it is the responsibly of
the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure to take the

Gentleman. I share his concern about an attack on our national
infrastructure, but we sometimes focus on things such as banking and
transport when we should perhaps look at our food supplies or our
hospitals. The impact of such an attack on the civilian population and
the country’s morale would be huge. We must address resilience
to a cyber-attack and we must engage the civilian population in
understanding and preparing for
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000306" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000306">T
he Chairman of the Defence Committee and I were given a book for
holiday reading: “One Second After”. That delightful
read, which probably wrecked my summer, 
<?notus-xml column=800?>was a description of the United States after an electro-magnetic impulse
attack had taken out all its computer-based systems. Everything went.
No cars could go on the road and nothing would work. It was a scary

Chairman runs a car that does not have a computer in it. I am sure the

book also made me aware of the very narrow issue of who is the enemy.
In traditional warfare, we tend to know who we are fighting, but in
future we may be fighting criminals who are holding the country to
ransom. We could be fighting terrorists, because a state is not needed
to manufacture a cyber-attack, or activists or anarchists. It has been
suggested that some of the attacks in Estonia were by third-party
actors. At the bottom of the list is the potential for a state to
attack, because states like rules and the rest do not follow rules.
That is why they must be our focus, our worry and our
concern.</hs_Para>

was very interested in that statement, so it sent me off on a little
tangent, as such things often do. As the Minister, who has received
many of my quirky little requests for information, will know, I sent
off a parliamentary question to every Department asking them how many
specialist IT staff they employed who had a PhD in computer science,
who had a master’s degree in computer science, and perhaps who
even had just a basic bachelor’s degree in computer science. It
did not bode well, I have to say. The Ministry of Defence can rest on
its laurels; it came second to the Department for Work and Pensions,
with 1,625 such members of staff. None of the Departments could break
the information down by qualification across Departments, which could
explain why Government are not very good at commissioning
cyber-capability and improved computer networking capability. Only
5,088 people, in total, held a degree-level capability in computing. It
was depressing to note that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport

about the figure of £650 million over five years, which is a
mere fraction of the figure for the annual economy, which is set to

thought that I would then have a look at how well we were doing in this
area. I discovered, rather alarmingly, that the Government had
withdrawn from a new cyber-warfare project called Project Cipher, which
was intended to scrutinise fully complex programmes to ensure that they
had the potential to meet our needs. After thorough assessment, it was
decided that Cipher would not meet the full defence capability required
to offer long-term value for the taxpayer, and so the programme was not
taken forward. The costs of the stalled project, in the assessment
phase alone, had been £66 million, so we have lost a large
percentage of the money set aside for cyber, and they were £47
million above the original budget. Overall, this was a major disaster.

for Bridgend (Mrs Moon): this is an extremely important issue and
addressing cyber-security rightly sits at the top of our national
security agenda. Cybercrime and cyber-attacks are not only
tomorrow’s dangers; they are a very real and growing threat
today. As others have already made clear, Governments, business and
members of the public come under sustained attack from cyber-criminals
and foreign powers. There were an estimated 44 million incidents in
2011<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:29:41"></hs_TimeCode>

we become ever more reliant on the internet, our vulnerability
increases. Cyber-threats take two primary forms—cybercrime and
cyber-attack, although sometimes the distinction is blurred. Cybercrime
was estimated by the Association of Chief Police Officers to have cost
£57 billion globally back in 2009, while Detica estimated that
the 2011 figure for the United Kingdom alone was £27 billion. It
is difficult to believe that that there has not been a geometric
increase since
then<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:30:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000326">Large-scale
cybercrime is an issue of national security. Cyber-attack and
cyber-espionage also present a serious threat both to the state and to
the community, and the state should be acting to protect both. As we
know, cyber-attacks have had real-world effects, as exampled by the
denial-of-service attacks in Estonia in 2007 and the Stuxnet attack on
Iranian nuclear development capability, although there appear to be
disagreements about the degree of its
effectiveness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000327" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000327">Cyber<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:31:05"></hs_TimeCode>-espionage

addressing the danger of cyber-threats today is real, not academic. The

the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr Gray) has made clear, defence is
only one small component of the pan-Government effort and by no means
the most important. I wonder whether the bracketing of cyber-security
and defence is in fact wise, given the MOD’s relatively limited
role. The MOD has only two formal responsibilities: to ensure that
armed forces operability is maintained both at home and abroad by
securing its networks, and to enhance military operations by developing
future
cyber-capabilities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:35:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000339" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000339">Cyber-capability
is immensely important for the armed forces: it is a battle-winning
asset. In the same way that military operations become difficult if not
impossible without air supremacy, cyber-superiority if not
cyber-supremacy is required. What differentiates cyber-security is that
it also applies to nearly every aspect of modem civil life. Not many
businesses need to worry about the effectiveness of the F-35 and the
Eurofighter in their daily operations, but the defensive
cyber-capability is a daily national necessity for our financial
system. Defence against most high-end cyber-threats, including those to
critical national infrastructure, is the responsibility of other
Departments, not least GCHQ and the Centre for Protection of National
Infrastructure. Given that fact, the conflation of cyber-security with
defence is possibly misleading, in that it obscures a complex and much
bigger picture. However, we are debating cyber-security in the context
of defence, so I shall focus on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000340" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000340">Other
hon. Members have outlined the threat, so I simply want to say that the
armed forces are increasingly vulnerable to highly targeted forms of
cyber-attack, given the networked nature of modern military systems and
the increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles and robots on the
battlefield. Adversaries may seek signals interception to distort
intelligence, disrupt logistical supply chains or, most worryingly,
render major platforms and systems, such as ships and aircraft,
dysfunctional<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:37:36"></hs_TimeCode>.
If we now regard cyber as a fifth domain of warfare, we must expect
other countries to do so too. Britain is a world leader in defence
technology, but we must expect emerging powers to be keen to shrink the
development gap by stealing what they cannot easily or quickly develop
for themselves. The need to protect the operability of our armed forces
and the integrity of our defence establishment is thus abundantly
clear.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000341" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000341">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:38:05"></hs_TimeCode>
the £650 million set aside to transform Britain’s
national cyber-security capabilities over the next four years, the MOD
will receive £90 million. That funding is not intended to secure
MOD networks, because that is assumed to be business as usual, but I
know that the Department is securing its supply chain against
cyber-attack. The point has already been made about the importance of
the need for a resilient industrial base, which must form part of the
goal of the national cyber-security strategy. The MOD has
responsibility to help to manage the security of its suppliers, and I
note the work that has been done to that
effect<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:38:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

the emphasis on reserve forces, which other hon. Members have
mentioned, and I welcome the establishment of a joint cyber reserve
unit. That is exactly the sort of imaginative use of civilian-qualified
reservists in the armed forces that we will want in times of need, but
we must bear it in mind that if the armed forces need them at a time of
crisis, so will their host employers. On a separate point, I am
encouraged by the assurance that spending on cyber will automatically
be increased in the budgets of future
programmes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000343" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000343">Cyber
is part of how our armed forces will wage war in future, so the
Department must be able to continue to enhance its military
cyber-capabilities. I therefore want to touch briefly on cyber-attack.
Inevitably, developments in technology will always be highly classified
because the possessor of the latest technological advance is likely to
have a battle-winning capability. I therefore understand why
information in this area is restricted. However, I emphasise to the
Minister that the military should understand that this House expects
them to possess cyber-attack capability alongside the ability to defend
their own networks from
cyber-attack.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000344" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000344">This
area is highly sensitive because such technology can be applied against
other states’ non-military assets in a way that makes it
difficult to be clear about whether the laws of war apply. I will
finish by discussing this international aspect. This area sits in the
grey area between espionage and conflict. That is why, in 2009, I
called for us to co-operate internationally on cyber issues to regulate
the relations between states in respect of cyber-conflict. I am
delighted that that is recognised in the 2013 statement on aspects of
state behaviour in cyberspace. We must try to identify the future
international rules of the road that will govern relations between
states in this
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000345" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000345">I
will end by reiterating three questions. First, by bracketing
cyber-security with defence, are we in danger of misleading ourselves

brilliant National Museum of Computing, which was celebrating 70 years
since the Colossus machine, arguably the world’s first
programmable computer, started breaking the Geheimschreiber codes at
Bletchley Park. A lot was said about the technical expertise of the
Government code and cipher school, which became GCHQ, and the genius of
Alan Turing and Tommy Flowers, the great engineer who led the Colossus
team—I proud to say that my father was one his Post Office
engineers. However, it was emphasised that human error allowed many of
those codes to be broken. It was not just human error in the sense of
mistakes that gave away code keys, but the fatal underestimation of
Bletchley Park’s capabilities on the part of Hitler and the
German high command. Right up until D-day, Hitler held back Panzer
divisions in the Pas de Calais because he simply did not believe
that  the Normandy landings were the real deal—he
believed the misinformation and the false intelligence that was being
fed to him. It never occurred to him that the Geheimschreiber codes
were being broken and that our side had that
capability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000365" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000365">I
am pleased that GCHQ is in the lead on cyber-security and that it
provides that technical expertise, but we need to spread the culture

estimates to support that and other defence work, having that expertise
has benefits for the UK economy. GCHQ has enormous links to academia,
business and other parts of Government, but it supports cyber-skills at
all levels, including encouraging maths, science and engineering in
schools. I saw that at the Cheltenham science festival, although it
encourages those subjects in many other ways. It also recognises
academic departments that specialise in cyber-security. As has been
said, they are now present in a large number of universities. That
focus on high-tech skills, and research and development, could, and
should already, make the UK a centre of global importance in
cyber-security skills. In turn, that builds resilience, not just in
Government but in businesses, making Britain a

is a slight sting in the tail. GCHQ and its expertise are widely

inadvertently gained as a result of Mr Snowden’s recent

to poach very expert people from GCHQ and, perhaps, from the Global
Operations Security Control Centre as well. The Government need to
value the people in GCHQ and GOSCC, and others across Government, who
have those extraordinary skills, and—sometimes, I am afraid, in
material terms—try to ensure that we hold on to the best people,

The director of GCHQ has described how cyberspace is contested around
the clock. In the United Kingdom there are over 20,000 malicious
e-mails on Government networks each month, 1,000 of which deliberately
target that very department. The Security Service estimates that at

present a security risk. First, the company could insert undetected
malware into its equipment, either to disable the system at will or at
least to monitor it. Secondly, there is a possible security risk from
the Chinese managers and technicians who man the system.
Thirdly, allowing Huawei to dominate the field takes away our sovereign
ability to deal with matters ourselves. Recently, there has been

cyber-security evaluation centre. It offered its services at knock-down
prices—no western firm could match them, and our economy was and
is in a poor position to resist the temptation of accepting what looked
like a very good deal. So we could be setting a thief to catch that
same thief. Of course the suspicions I voice may be erroneous and our
cyber-security services could be totally on top of this one, but
without access to classified information I have no way of checking.

Fovargue</B> (Makerfield) (Lab):</Member> Labour Members welcome the
increased focus that cyber-defence is receiving. The report by the
Defence Committee is evidence of that focus, so I congratulate its
members on their excellent work. Cyber-attacks are at last properly
acknowledged as a serious threat to our national security and are
rightly prioritised as a tier 1 risk in the Government’s 2010
national security document. As the Committee’s report says, the
threat is liable to grow and evolve at “almost unimaginable
speed”. Indeed, the pace of technological change is faster than
traditional Government structures and time lines can cope with. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:19:34"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock) said, five years is a
long time in the cyber-world 
<?notus-xml column=815?>and the threat from cyber-attack is rising exponentially. The number of
global web users in 1995 was 16 million; it is estimated that by 2015,
there will be more interconnected devices on the planet than there are
human beings.</hs_Para>

communications technologies spread and as the UK critical
infrastructure networks become even more heavily based on IT networks,
cyber-defence becomes an increasingly pressing security concern. There
will be even more attacks.
According<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:20:27"></hs_TimeCode> to the
Government’s own national security strategy document, the UK
faces up to 1,000 cyber-attacks every hour, which is estimated to cost
the UK £27 billion a year. Cyber-attacks are now a constant
reality, with the Government, the private sector and private citizens
all under sustained cyber-attack from both hostile states and
criminals, as my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:20:38"></hs_TimeCode>

Government have committed £650 million over four years to the
cyber-security programme, which seems like a significant sum, but only
14% of that was allocated to the Ministry of Defence, while the total
investment equates to only 0.6% of the £27 billion that the UK
loses through cybercrime every year. In its report, the Defence
Committee questioned whether enough was being done to secure the supply
chain and the industrial base. We know that supplies of armed
forces’ equipment are increasingly being targeted, and are
especially vulnerable to cyber-attack. In their response, the
Government say they are working closely with industry on matters such
as information sharing and incident reporting, but give precious little
detail. The Government need to go further, and Labour is calling on
them to ensure that every company working with the Ministry of Defence,
regardless of its size or the scale of its work, signs up to a
cyber-security charter. That will ensure that hackers cannot use the
small suppliers to get into the systems of the major defence companies.
As my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:22:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie) said, the risks from
cyber-attacks are huge and growing; we need to do everything we can to

Government also refer to progress on the joint cyber reserve—an
initiative to involve reservists in the delivery of
cyber-security—but give little detail. Will 
<?notus-xml column=816?>the Minister say what progress has been made in that important matter? I
would particularly like to hear his thoughts on recruitment. The cyber
reserves are not likely to be a traditional military outfit: the skills
are entirely different. Is it essential that those reservists meet the
usual fitness standards of the armed forces? A senior US officer said
it was not essential that they were able to march 3 miles with a pack
on their back, and I think most people would agree. It would be
interesting to hear the Minister’s thoughts on the requirements
for the new force and how its personnel will fit into the military

is the Minister doing to attract recruits? We have heard that a lot of
the top universities are running cyber programmes with top computing
graduates. Is the Minister attending those events or approaching
careers fairs? Is there a career path that will be attractive to young
graduates—we need not only to recruit but to retain those
graduates. A recent study by the Army Families Federation shows that
large numbers of married Army personnel want to leave the service. That
will be all the more problematic with cyber personnel, as there are
many lucrative private sector jobs tempting them away. But of course
many of the skills and experiences required for this are prevalent in
the defence industry. What steps is the Minister taking to encourage
firms involved in Government contract work—not just in the
defence but throughout Government—to encourage their staff to
become reservists? What responses are there from such
firms?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000411" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#14030455000411">The
new joint cyber-force is described by the Secretary of State in terms
of its offensive rather than defensive capabilities, enhancing our
ability to strike back in cyberspace against enemies who attack us. But
as my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr Havard)
said, what are the rules of engagement? Land, sea and air have been the
traditional theatres of war. Cyberspace is new and untested. What
constitutes a cyber act of war and, equally important, what would be a
proportionate response to an act of aggression? For example, if all
London’s systems were knocked out by an electromagnetic pulse
device, would that be an act of war? What would we do about it? As my
hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend said, how would we know who did it?
In short, what are the rules of
engagement?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000412" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030455000412">It
would also be interesting to hear whether the Minister believes that
the concept of deterrence applies to cyber-defence as it does to
conventional defence as perhaps those with the most ability
to attack our cyber-capabilities have the least reliance on their
own cyber-capabilities. What role does he envisage offensive
cyber-capabilities playing in this? Do we work alone or in concert with
others? The Secretary of State has made much of cyber-security being a
sovereign capability but we have been working with other nations in
supranational bodies for some time; for example we are a member of the
“Five Eyes” group, which includes the USA, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, and we have also been working with NATO. The
report cites the important work of the NATO cyber-defence centre of
excellence. Of course this is based in Estonia and was created as a
direct consequence of the cyber-attacks on that country in 2007. There
is excellent work undertaken there and I am glad that the Government
are committed to participation in the centre, although some may doubt
whether the contribution of £20,000 per annum will 
<?notus-xml column=817?>have much impact. But the lesson to be learned here is that we cannot
afford to wait until an attack happens before we act. We have to be
proactive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000413" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030455000413">Since
the publication of the report, we have seen developments within the
EU’s common security and defence policy. The European Council
meeting on 19 and 20 December last year led to a call for
the development of an EU cyber-defence policy framework in 2014. I
would be interested to hear what talks have been taking place about
this. Working with, and within, bodies such as the “Five
Eyes”, NATO and the EU is vital, not only for intelligence
sharing but for developing common rules of engagement. We must be aware

are accustomed to thinking of security in terms of three forces; army,
navy and air force. But in many ways cyber does add a fourth strand.
Just as the creation of the RAF in 1918 demanded a whole new way of
thinking about defence and war, the increasing cyber threat means that
we need to do some fresh thinking now. We have to think seriously about
how we can combat this new threat because one thing is certain; it can

might interest Members to know that the term “cyberspace”
is usually credited to the 1980’s science fiction writings of
William Gibson. He used it as a buzzword to describe an all-pervasive
virtual realm. Although there are many interpretations, we generally
use the term to mean the interdependent network of IT infrastructures
and the data that move therein.
Cyberspace<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:31:34"></hs_TimeCode> has
become an essential part of most of our lives, from communications to
shopping, and from life saving to war fighting. In 2013 some 21 million
households in Great Britain had an internet connection. That degree of

ignore.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000421" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030455000421">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:32:02"></hs_TimeCode>
the MOD runs its own cyber-defence programme—I will say more

Office playing a key role, as it does with all potential crisis
management situations. All public and private sector organisations have
a stake in addressing the threat, across international and domestic
boundaries. To co-ordinate that effort, the Government created the
Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance within the Cabinet
Office, which runs our national cyber-security programme. Alongside the

number of hon. Members asked about MOD structures, as indeed did the
Committee’s report, so perhaps I can provide some clarification.
Since the 
<?notus-xml column=819?>Committee’s report was published, the Chief of the Defence Staff
has issued direction to the four-star commander of Joint Forces Command
to empower him as the defence authority for cyber. On a day-to-day
basis, that responsibility is delegated to the three-star Chief of
Defence Intelligence in his unifying role to plan and develop cyber
capability. Under CDI sits the joint forces cyber group, stood up
formally in May 2013 to deliver that capability. The joint forces cyber
group plans and directs the activity of the joint cyber units at
Cheltenham and Corsham, including the reserves.</hs_Para>

responsible owner for the defence cyber programme is the two-star
director for cyber, intelligence and information integration, currently
Air Vice-Marshal Jonathan Rigby, who gave evidence to the
Committee’s inquiry in 2012, and remains accountable to the
Chief of Defence Intelligence for those responsibilities. I hope that
that helps provide absolute clarity about the chain of
command.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030455000426" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030455000426">Our
armed forces use some of the most sophisticated equipment in the world.
The downside of the capability we possess is the potential exposure to
emerging threats from our adversaries. We have to see those as an
intrinsic part of modern military operations and put measures in place
to mitigate or deal with them. The Global Operations and Security
Control Centre, or GOSCC, is a key part of that protection, with its

to read in the report that the GOSCC’s performance impressed the

Committee also rightly identified the importance of promoting good
cyber-security practice. I fully accept that technology is only one
part of the equation; we need the right people to do the right things.
As cyber professionals often say, the majority of the threat that we
face could be overcome by good practice on the part of our people. That

of the Government response to the Committee’s report, we had
already recognised the need for good practice and had included a
specific cyber module in our mandatory training for defence personnel.
Since then, we have gone further and developed a cyber primer—an

its report, the Committee noted the importance of exploring options to
develop military capabilities. Since then, the Secretary of State for
Defence has announced, on 29 September 2013, that Britain will build a
dedicated capability to counter-attack in cyberspace as part of our
full-spectrum military capability. As we set out in the strategic
defence and security review, the UK views cyberspace as a domain in
which we can carry out military operations to support national
objectives, as we would on land, at sea or in the air. The hon. Member 
<?notus-xml column=820?>for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr Havard) asked questions about the
legality of that. I reassure him and the House that we are looking to
develop a range of cyber capabilities that would be used in accordance

for the business of all public sector delivery, and that is no less the

Clive Betts</B> (Sheffield South East) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure
to speak about the report on the private rented sector by the
Communities and Local Government Committee—its first report of
the 2013-14 Session. The report was produced through the Committee
taking formal evidence in a number of sittings. Some of those featured
more informal discussions and some involved landlords and tenants
together, which was interesting. There was a visit to Leeds to look at
how the council was operating with regard to the private rented sector,
and a visit to Germany to look at the sector in a very different sphere
of housing circumstances. On behalf of the Committee, I particularly
thank Christine Whitehead, who was the Committee’s special
adviser for the inquiry, and Kevin Maddison, the lead specialist from
the Committee staff working on the
inquiry<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:47:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000042">We
chose the subject of the private rented sector not because of any
particular initiative that the Government were proposing at the time
but because of the sector’s increasing importance to our
constituents. According to the latest figures for 2012-13, 18% of
households now live in the private rented sector. That growth did not
suddenly happen following the banking crisis of 2008; it had been
taking place before that over a period of time. Indeed, it has been the
only growing housing sector since 2002, when owner-occupation started
to fall as a percentage of households. That is an interesting
fact.</hs_Para>

Committee saw the growth of the private rented sector not as a
short-term issue but as something that is likely to continue in the
longer term. We also observed that it is changing in that it is home to
a wider range of households, particularly families with children who
might, in other times, have chosen to be in a different sector but are
now looking for a different housing experience, and particularly for
more security. When people with children change their home, that often
means changing schools, and that creates substantial disruption to
family life.</hs_Para>

we went to Germany, we saw a very different situation that we are
probably not likely to get to any time soon. People literally have
tenancies for life; many of us could not quite get our heads around
that. Someone with a tenancy in Germany has it for life and can pass it
on so that their family members can succeed to it. We learned that
there were good standards in the private rented sector that we ought to
seek to emulate in this 
<?notus-xml column=824?>country. Tenants and landlords had an awareness and understanding of
rights and responsibilities that is perhaps not always shared in this
country. There was an equilibrium between demand and supply to which we
aspire but recognise realistically that it will take some to achieve.
Those factors create a very different market indeed.</hs_Para>

identified five main areas to concentrate on in our report: awareness

longer-term agreements and greater security; and, in

previous year—increasing the housing

was a great deal of consensus right from the beginning. The Government
have subsequently produced their “Review of property conditions
in the private rented sector”, which includes many of
the Committee’s ideas. Indeed, having initially dismissed our
recommendations for mandatory carbon monoxide and smoke alarms in
private rented homes and for five-yearly checks of the electrical
installations, the Government are now consulting on them. Of course,
consulting does not necessarily mean agreeing, but at least it is a
step in the right direction, which we should recognise and
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:51:49"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:52:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000048">There
are two areas on which we have not reached agreement and to which we
need to pay more attention. The first is the flexibility of local
authority powers to raise standards and to deal with rogue landlords in
particular—I will say more about that in due course—and
the second is the regulation of letting agents, on which the Government
have not gone as far as the Committee wanted them to. I will explore
that as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:52:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000049">On
raising awareness, in Germany it struck me and, I think, other
Committee members that tenants and landlords seemed to understand the
rules and their responsibilities. That is not always the case in this
country. Our report notes that there is a bewildering array of
legislation and regulation relating to the private rented sector.
Different Acts of Parliament are cross-referenced in new Acts and it is
very difficult for any professional, let alone any lay person, to get
their head around the situation. A professional landlord might
understand some of it, but small landlords and tenants probably do
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000050">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:52:52"></hs_TimeCode>
therefore called for a review on the potential consolidation of
legislation, but the Government rejected that, which is disappointing
because I think it would have helped to simplify things. We were not
asking for more regulation; we were asking for simpler regulation.
There is a difference. The Government could have scrapped some
regulations if they had gone about it in a different way and that may
have earned some brownie points for Ministers past and
present<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:53:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

him for putting that clearly on the record. That is exactly what the
Committee agreed. Some of the changes will be incremental and there
will be opportunities for either this or a future Government to come
back and look at the totality of regulation and legislation, which I
think would be helpful for everyone
involved<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:54:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000055">On
raising awareness, the Government have accepted some of the
recommendations. The Committee called for easy-to-read fact sheets and
model tenancy agreements. The Government have already produced a draft
tenants charter and we look forward to their model tenancy agreement.
That is entirely in line with what the Committee recommended, which was
to try to make things easier, particularly for people who do not easily
understand legislation and regulations, and to have something that is
easy to operate. We felt that that would really help not only tenants,
but many landlords, particularly non-professional, occasional landlords
who have a few properties and would welcome such an
approach.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000056">We
asked for a review of the housing health and safety rating
system. Again, it is valued by many professionals, but it is very
difficult to understand for many landlords, let alone for tenants. I do
not think that the Government are prepared to go so far as a wholesale
review, but we note that they are now trying to produce guidance for
tenants and to update the methodology. There are problems in relation
to local authorities wanting to act against a property if the tenant is
elderly, but not if they are young, and landlords can get confused
about an authority requiring them to do work simply because they have
changed tenants. It is certainly worth looking at that complication in
the new guidance and new
methodology<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:55:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000057"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Jim Cunningham" PimsId="2803" UID="14030474000466" xid="147" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000466"><B>Mr

while others blatantly break the law and think that they can get away
with it, and we particularly want to bear down on them. There was
general agreement about how to bear down on the really bad landlords

time of financial constraint for local authorities, to enable them to

help them manage the property on the spot. We will come on to agents a

local authorities that the squeeze on their resources was affecting
their abilities in respect of the private rented sector. We tried to
look at how authorities could deal with the challenges that they face
most effectively with the resources that they have. One thing that we
looked at was
licensing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000073">On
balance, the Committee did not come down in favour of a national
licensing scheme. That is essentially because, over a number of
reports, we have tended to be localist and to believe that local
authorities should be allowed to make such choices for themselves. We
went to Leeds, which has a very good accreditation scheme, under which
there is good training and advice for landlords, which the landlords
really appreciate. However, we were told by landlords and tenants that
the problem is that it is the good landlords that join such schemes.
They said, “It’s those landlords down the road you want
to get hold of and they’re not going to
volunteer.”</hs_Para>

selective licensing approach tends to be cumbersome, time-consuming and
bureaucratic, and the criteria are very restricted. The Committee
therefore asked whether we could relax the criteria and make them more
flexible so that local authorities could engage in selective licensing
if they wanted to. We also asked whether, in a more general sense, a
local authority could have an accreditation scheme that was mandatory,
so that it would include all landlords, including those who do not want
to
join.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000075">Unfortunately<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:04:04"></hs_TimeCode>,
on both issues, the Government’s response was not as helpful as
we would have liked. They said no to mandatory accreditation schemes
and no to a review of the flexibility of selective licensing. The
Government’s recent consultation document does include changes
to selective licensing, but they are talking about tightening the
criteria, rather than making them more flexible. That seems to be a
retrograde step. All our evidence suggested that that was too
cumbersome and does not work, and authorities that want to make it work
find it difficult to make it happen.</hs_Para>

local authorities another set of powers and another way to deal with
rogue landlords who are causing problems. If those landlords who
persistently cause problems with individual properties have to become
part of a mandatory registration scheme, that could be perhaps not a
complete response to the Committee’s request, but at least a

Betts:</Member></B> Yes, and the Government are consulting on
retaliatory evictions as part of their consultation document, which is
to be welcomed. One other issue that the Committee report dealt with
that we must consider is how to encourage longer term tenancies.
Families in particular want greater security. They may not want to be
in the private rented sector, but if they are there and have a property
they like, they probably want to be there for five years rather than
six months. Considering how we can change the culture—that is
what it is, as much as anything else—to get landlords and
tenants to understand that there are possibilities within the framework
of the existing assured shorthold tenancy for a tenancy longer than six
months or a year, is a step forward. We must also consider how to get
letting agents to recognise that they should be advising on
that—letting agents often have a vested interest in regular
reviews of tenants and tenancies because they make a profit and receive
a fee every time they do
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000084">We
must also deal with the fact that many lenders prevent landlords from
having a tenancy of more than a year. Nationwide is now, I think,
prepared to accept a three-year tenancy, which is a good step forward,
and the Government are trying to bring lenders together to try to make
that change happen. I entirely accept the point made by my hon. Friend
the Member for Islington North about retaliatory evictions when tenants
complain. However, if landlords are to accept a tenancy period of three
or even five years, they must have a way of getting the tenant out,
rather than waiting until the end of the tenancy period. Shelter has
accepted this and the Government have established a working party on
it. That is being looked at as a quid pro quo. Shelter accepts that; it
is not only landlords associations that have been pressing for
it.</hs_Para>

We also say that, when a landlord lets a property in an unfit

housing benefit paid or any rent paid by an individual. We are pleased

additional matter that the Committee did not get into—we might
have a look at it in the autumn—is what happens when landlords
are taken to court. That goes back to the fact that authorities are
strapped for cash, as many are, and have limited resources. If a
landlord is found guilty, the court should award the authority the full
cost of the action. Sheffield, my local authority, advised me the other
day that it has brought five successful prosecutions of landlords in
recent months. On each occasion, it has not been given its costs
back—it got back roughly 50% of its costs in total. That is not
acceptable. We ought to put pressure on the courts—perhaps the
Minister’s colleagues in the Ministry of Justice could do
this—to recognise that, when effective action costs money and
the landlord is found to be responsible for and guilty of an offence,
the costs should be returned to the

of affordable housing for rent in the private rented sector, and the
difficulty experienced by many people—including many young
professionals in London—in moving into market housing are
increasingly presenting a potential bar to London’s economic

Neill:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is entirely right. That is the main
point that I wanted to make in my speech. It is precisely because there
have not been funding models to attract institutional investment that
money has not been invested for long enough periods to underwrite the
longer-term, more stable tenancy arrangements that we would all like to
see. I think that what has been done so far is an important step
forward, but it is ironic that under Governments of both political
persuasions we have lagged somewhat behind other countries when it
comes to leveraging institutional money into the private rented sector.
REITs—real estate investment trusts—have never taken off
in this country as they have in many others, and I think that that is a
shame. Some adjustments to the fiscal treatment of those vehicles would
be helpful.</hs_Para>

Neill:</Member></B> I think that this is a classic case of “It
is not an either/or scenario”. We certainly need to take steps
to improve the image of the sector, which I believe is often unfairly
castigated. A good deal of action is suggested in the report, and I
would probably agree with the hon. Gentleman on some helpful steps that
we could take. However, I think that we must do that in parallel with
creating mechanisms that will bring in the institutional money. The two
go hand in glove: they are two sides of the same strategy that we
should be adopting.</hs_Para>

a little about what we could do to improve institutional investment in
the private rented sector. There are obstacles, and this brings us back
to the point made by the hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy
Corbyn). In some cases land for private sale may be worth more than
land for long-term rental. There are issues with speculative costing
and valuation methods. We also need to look at whether there is some
scope for using the private rented sector to create an income stream
that could generate a source of cross-subsidy for affordable housing
units, particularly in regeneration schemes, as rents rise. The current
models we have tend to put the subsidy at the beginning of the system,
in effect through the planning gain being taken out with the
consequence that the landowner takes a lesser price on the sale or the
market housing will be inflated a little to pay for the subsidy that
comes via section 106 or the planning gain.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030474000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000108">That<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:20:40"></hs_TimeCode>
does not help in respect of the longer term funding streams
we would like to see, however, and I hope the Minister will think about
the following. I recently had the opportunity to talk with
representatives of the New Economics Foundation. They have been doing
some very interesting work in this field, and I commend the work in
particular of Alicia Weston who has been doing some very interesting
research. They have come up with a model that merits further
consideration. It is a model for a defined income scheme that is
designed to bring forward more rented housing. It allows private rental
incomes to subsidise the rents of affordable units on a 
<?notus-xml column=833?>rolling basis and therefore gives the ability to have
a long-term income
flow<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:21:17"></hs_TimeCode>. Indeed, it
almost gives a bond that can be available to back up the
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:21:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000109">The
housing that is created stays in the rented sector for the life of the
scheme. One cannot guarantee beyond that, but that would none the less
give valuable supply increases. A new form of contract would be
required, which would be perfectly doable within current English law,
between the local authority and the housing association, so that rather
than setting a specified level of affordable housing on the site, the
allowable income from the site is what is set. That income is made up
of a combination of market and affordable rents and their levels are
allowed to flex in order to make up the defined income. Provided there
is the income, which is guaranteed and is therefore a quasi-bond, there
is the stream to
cross-subsidise<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:22:15"></hs_TimeCode>.
Under those circumstances, if market rents were to rise, as they have
in London recently, the excess income would cross-subsidise more
affordable housing. Conversely, if there is a revenue shortfall some
affordable units can be switched to market rent, but the integrity of
the income stream is preserved, and therefore the integrity of the
investment model. That will give local authorities a semi-guaranteed
stream that is not guaranteed by the public purse, but which creates
something almost as good as a bond. I hope the Minister will look
seriously at
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:22:49"></hs_TimeCode>. There are
some practical issues that we will need to deal with, but pilot schemes
are being considered around the country and I hope the Department will
give schemes such as this one a fair
wind.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000110">There
is an advantage for housing associations there, too, because that more
stable income stream is worth more to them and the increase in value
will allow them to subsidise more housing or to unlock further sites
and land for rented housing, either using a mix of the private rented
sector or just affordable. This also encourages housing associations
into the private rented sector, co-operating with institutional money,
which might be an interesting approach to pursue.</hs_Para>

applied sensibly, this scheme could lead to increased institutional
investment in the private rented sector. I hope the Minister will look
at that and encourage it. That can be done in respect of the whole
scheme or simply the section 106 element. There is a degree of
flexibility. I do not pretend it is a silver bullet, but we do need to
think outside the box in leveraging in institutional money. There are a
number of possible routes, and I think this particular one may be very
timely.</hs_Para>

a healthy private rented sector is an important part of the housing
mix, especially in large cities such as London, where the nature of the
population frequently means that for a period of their lives people may
well want the flexibility of living in the private sector before moving
on to house purchase. They are likely to be earning incomes that mean
they would never qualify for social rented housing, but they cannot at
the moment access the market readily. Finding models that produce
adequate housing supply for people in that situation is crucial for the
health of London, my city, and of all the major conurbations in this
country. So I hope the Minister will think about that as a model that
is worth pursuing and that this report will generally find favour with
the House. I also commend the Government’s response to it, which
is a constructive

the borough that I have the privilege of representing, there are twice
as many privately rented homes as there are properties owned by
registered social landlords. That dwarfing of the social rented sector
gives rise to a series of problems. In London, and especially the outer
London suburbs, owners no longer sell properties, but vacate them and
rent them out privately. The properties are often rented as houses in
multiple occupation, but without them being registered as such, which
creates the problem that many single individuals are renting properties
collectively. Such people are often young men from eastern Europe who
live together in one big house. There are many properties in which beds
are rented out for eight hours a day, meaning that three individuals
will occupy one bed in a room in sequence when they are not fulfilling
their jobs and roles in
society<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T17:38:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000137">The

more than 89, but they are unregistered, and therefore unlicensed and
unregulated. As the report shows, we clearly need to deal with the
problem of standards, and the Government need to take more action on
the registration and regulation of

takes me on to the problem of beds in sheds, because the fact is that
unscrupulous individuals are using relatively high rents and high
demand for housing—throughout the country, but especially in
London—to force people to live in substandard accommodation. I
made a long speech about the private rented sector in the pre-Christmas
recess debate. I will not repeat some of the points I made about the
condition of properties and the problems in the sector, but I commend
what Slough council did to draw up a heat map of its borough
to ascertain the number of properties in which it was likely that there
were bed in sheds. My own borough, Harrow, was not given
Government money for the purpose but has just done a heat map of the
area. We discovered 329 properties with buildings outlying
or adjacent to the main house that are occupied. I am told that, as a
result of the exercise, the police have also found a number
of cannabis farms, which are another threat, not only because the
domestic properties in question are no longer available to rent, but
because cannabis farms lead to illegal trade. Clearly we need much
stronger government intervention and much stronger Government support
for local authorities to ascertain all the unscrupulous landlords who
are not registered with anyone, but who are cramming people into
substandard accommodation and ripping them off in the rent they

relatively few properties and, sure enough, few properties have been

the stages of producing our report, the Committee looked at evidence
from a wide variety of sources. One of the concerns expressed was about
the regulation of managing agents, and I want to draw out the absolute
scandal of the charges that unscrupulous managing agents levy not only
on landlords but on applicants for rental properties. Frequently those
charges are excessive, going beyond reasonable costs, and are levied
multiple times, as the agents charge both the landlord and potential
tenants. For example, we heard evidence of hundreds of pounds being
charged for credit checks that, broadly speaking, would cost between
£8 and £10 to conduct. That is a scandal. There is a need
for clarification and more regulation in that

certain areas, the bureaucracy involved in registering is also a
problem. The borough of Newham has introduced a policy of registering
every single private rented property and requires landlords to fill out
the same complicated form for every single property they rent out. The
Select Committee has not yet had a proper answer from the Government
about whether that is actually a requirement. I would welcome the
Minister stating his view, not necessarily at the Dispatch Box tonight
but in the future, that people do not need to do that. If
the landlord in question is a large-scale, reputable landlord, the
simple fact of registering their ownership of a property in the borough
should be sufficient, but there is no reason why a small-scale
landlord—one with, say, fewer than 10 properties—should
not fill in the necessary forms and register properly, because it will
need to be checked and verified that they are acting in a particular

rate would lead to an increase of almost 20% increase in the amount of
money people are paying their lenders for their mortgages. Think of the
effect of that on rents. Given that the yield is only 3%, imagine if
there were a 20% or 25% increase in what landlords must pay in interest

issue that I want to raise briefly is the key issue of the length of
tenancy that applies. One of the key issues from our report was that we
should have longer tenancies and more settled arrangements for families
with children in schools who are building up a community of interest,
rather than potentially having families being evicted after a six-month
shorthold tenancy. However, that must go hand in glove with the ability
of landlords to be able to evict tenants who do not pay their rent or
who badly misbehave. That has to be one of the things where we will
need intervention. We need the Government to take action to promote
longer tenancies, and we need more responsibility from landlords and
from tenants. We then need applicable rates where rents will rise with
inflation so the position is more flexible for everyone in the housing
market. We need lenders to recognise that longer tenancies are to their
benefit, and to the benefit of their borrowers and of the people who
reside in the properties.</hs_Para>

will always say that a good tenant is worth keeping and worth keeping
happy. A good tenant will say that they are happy in a property, that
they want to stay and that they want a long-term relationship with the
landlord. Bad tenants who do not pay their rent or who misbehave or
cause antisocial behaviour clearly need to be evicted, and quickly, at
the lowest possible cost to the landlord. If we can get some answers
from the Minister tonight on those issues, that will be of great help
to the sector and the rest of the
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000149">Finally,
we have to be clear that this is a market. If we intervene in a market,
it can have untold consequences and possibly consequences that one was
not anticipating. This is one of the areas where we have to proceed
carefully because we do not want to distort a market and
cause further problems. With certain targeted interventions comes the
potential for improving the market and for improving the lot of tenants

is worth repeating that 
<?notus-xml column=840?>we continue to build less than half the number of homes we
need to keep up with demand, if only to hammer home the severity and
scale of the problem. All the while, private landlords, many of whom
leave much to be desired in the caring and service department, continue
to hike rents, often at the expense of the taxpayer, who has to foot
the bill for many people forced by the failures of Government to claim
housing benefit.</hs_Para>

I cannot say the same for the Secretary of State’s response. He
writes of burdensome red tape hampering private landlords,
proportionate regulation that will let them off the hook and measures
that will give tenants the know-how to demand longer-term tenancies,
stable rents and better quality accommodation, to avoid hidden fees
when renting a home and to demand better standards, but all without any

I sit on the bus each evening going to my Battersea flat, I am amazed
by the number of apartments being built along Battersea Park road, each
a tiny box costing several hundred thousand pounds. On behalf of the
people of north-east England, I envy London the thousands of jobs
and—in this apprenticeship week—the hundreds of
apprenticeships that have been generated on those sites. It is just a
shame that the vast majority of Londoners will never be able to buy and
live in those apartments and will have to rely on the private rented
sector instead. I could advise those people to move north, even to my
constituency, where they will be able to secure a family home for a
fraction of the cost of some of the box-sized apartments in London. The
cost of living and quality of life is better, too. But why would I
advise them to move 
<?notus-xml column=841?>to a region starved of housing investment, despite the efforts of our
local authorities, and where unemployment continues to rise in most
parts?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000158">I
would offer a solution. The Government could work to restore the
north-east by encouraging some of the multi-million pound investment in
housing and industry we see in the south-east to move north. Do that
and build on the region’s successes, which include being a huge
exporter of manufactured goods, including petrochemicals, steel, cars
and a whole range of other goods. If houses could be delivered across
the north-east at just a fraction of the rate in the south, we could
have our own boom

is most alarming about the shift away from home ownership is the
simultaneous shortage of affordable and social housing. That extends
far beyond the scarcity of one-bedroom properties that is blighting the
socially rented sector as a result of this Government’s
malicious bedroom tax and reaches past the confines of London, where
rents are increasing by as much as 10% a year. Across England, 5
million people are on local authority waiting lists for social housing.
As a result, the private rented sector plays and will continue to play
an important role in meeting our housing needs. However, all too often
private renting is unaffordable, unstable and subject to poor
conditions and bad
management.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000160">The
recent English housing survey for 2012-13 has shown that, for the first
time, the private rented sector has grown larger than the social
housing sector, with 4 million households compared with 3.7
million. The trend towards growth in the private rented sector is
self-reinforcing, driven by the combination of factors that confront
aspiring buyers looking to get on the housing ladder. People want to
buy, but cannot do so as little affordable housing is available. They
cannot even save a deposit while renting because of the shortage of
low-cost social housing. To make matters worse, that all comes at a
time when real wages have fallen at a rate of 2.2% a year since
2010—the longest such period in half a
century.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000161">One
of my primary concerns is that so many homes in the private rented
sector continue to fail to meet the decent homes standard. Although the
number of houses in all sectors failing to meet the required standard
has fallen in recent years, one in five households—almost 5
million properties across the country—are still substandard. In
the private rented sector, however, a third of all properties fail to
live up to the expected benchmark, the highest proportion of non-decent
homes in any
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000162">Some
in the private rented sector would have us believe that they have been
cleaning up their act, as the proportion of private rented sector homes
classed as non-decent has fallen from 47% in 2006 to 33% in 2012. That
is all very well, but that statistic conceals the fact that the
absolute number of non-decent dwellings did not decrease over the
period. Private landlords could take a lesson from the social rented
sector, just 15% of whose properties miss the decent homes
standard—although that, of course, is 15% too
many.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000163">Proportionally,
roughly three times as many homes in the private rented sector failed
to meet the decent homes standard as a consequence of disrepair or poor
thermal comfort—two key indicators of housing
quality—compared with the social rented sector. Private
landlords

is a broad consensus that the reputation of responsible landlords in
the private sector is being undermined by a minority of criminal
landlords who deliberately prey on the vulnerable, but there are
problems that we cannot overlook and sweep under the carpet. There are
the “couldn’t care less” landlords, the absent
landlords and the anonymous landlords who are happy to take the rent
but do nothing for their tenants. Some let properties to anyone
prepared to pay, and in some areas create misery for neighbours and the
wider
community.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000165">Just
a week ago, a distressed woman was in tears in my surgery after years
of trouble from one set of aggressive and noisy tenants after another,
placed next door to her by a landlord who takes no responsibility
whatever. The situation is all too common. We know that when standards
reach unacceptable levels, regulatory and enforcement tools are
available to local authorities. However, using those tools is often a
last resort, partly because of regulatory red tape, meaning that poor
standards can persist for too
long.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000166">Yet
of the 4 million households in the private rented sector, 25% received
housing benefit in 2012-13 to help with the rent, up from 19% in
2008-09, as wage values drop, low paid part-time jobs replace well paid
full-time ones and people are forced to fall back on the state. That
means that the Government are, in effect, increasing subsidies for low
quality homes. That would rightly be considered a scandal at any
time—even more so when the money could be used to boost house
building in the social rented sector and benefit some of the millions
of people in need of high quality affordable
homes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000167">Over
the past three decades, in excess of 1 million council properties have
been sold through the right-to-buy policy and its variants. About a
third of the ex-council homes sold in the 1980s are now owned by
private landlords charging rents more often than not staggeringly
higher than rents in the social sector. In the social rented sector,
the average household rent in 2012-13 was £89 a week, while the
equivalent figure for the private rented sector stood at £163, a
difference of £74 a week. In some local authority areas in the
north-east, as many as 72% of those in the private rented sector are
entitled to rent support through housing benefit. With 80,000
households renting private accommodation entitled to housing benefit
across the north-east region, private companies are benefiting
massively from the welfare system. For example, Stockton Flats has
taken more than £1.7 million from councils throughout the
north-east, the north-west and north Yorkshire, including
£775,000 from Stockton-on-Tees and £260,000 from Redcar
and Cleveland. Similarly, Castledene Property Management has benefited
hugely from Durham and Newcastle

desirable for people who are trying to create deep links with local
schools and other links with local communities, and it is our job as
Members of this House to recognise that. The housing charity Shelter,
which does excellent work across the piece but particularly on this
issue, says that two thirds of renters in England want the option to
stay in their properties for longer periods, and eight out of 10 want
to know that they are not subject to the annual unpredictability of
rent rises. This shows that

One characteristic of both Alf Morris and Paul Goggins was that they
commanded rather a lot of respect and affection on both sides of the

<?notus-xml column=845?>most of us have not pulled off over the years, I have to say, and I hope
he manages it. I pay tribute to some of the work that got
him here, including his work on promoting a living wage and on trying
to undermine and replace the loan sharks who batten on a lot of poorer
people. I am sure that he is very

welcome the report by the Select Committee and commend the hard work
that it has put in, but I am afraid that I do not think it
goes anything like far enough in dealing with the problems of the
private rented sector in London. Londoners are being priced out of
London, and young Londoners are suffering most. Whether they are
seeking to buy or to rent somewhere to live, all the options are being
taken out of the reach of ordinary people. Over the years, housing
policy in London has been a failure, and there is now a housing crisis

read another <I>Evening Standard</I> headline, “Super-rich from

use them as homes; they are simply an investment that is better than
putting their money in gold. They cause a double damage or
blow to people in London: they drive up prices; and they take a lot of
housing out of supply, because the places that they buy and do not

people talk about immigration, they say that there will be all sorts of
burdens on the infrastructure. The suggestion seems to be that there
will be such a burden only when poor people come here. The fact is that
the people who are recruited by the City from abroad also want

important that there is a breakdown of the fees that tenants are
paying. There is a view that there should be a national licensing
scheme, but although I agree that national guidelines could be useful,
I think that is done better by local authorities. Local government

localism, local authorities should be given more powers to tackle rogue
landlords, but we should bear it in mind that there are also rogue
tenants, as has been pointed out. There are 1.2 million landlords, many

but there are a few rogue landlords who treat people badly and prey on
vulnerable people, particularly the old, students and immigrants. That

wanting longer term tenancies. The Government can do something to help
and assist that, perhaps by looking more closely at Germany in creating
longer term tenancies, particularly for families and those who want to
stay in a location for a lot longer than they currently do. Finally, in
the long term more broadly we need to start
building more

brief, you will be pleased to hear, Mr Speaker, because
those on the Front Benches wish to wind up the debate. Like my Friend
the Member for Holborn and St Pancras, who has the
neighbouring constituency, I represent inner London where the housing
crisis is acute beyond belief. I hold regular advice bureaux, as all
Members do, and my walk-in advice bureau on the third Friday of the
month frequently lasts for anything from six to eight hours. The vast
majority of the people who come have housing issues, and they are
devastated by the situation they are in. They are often people who have
been placed in the private rented sector by the local authority, which
must house them because they are in desperate housing need and the
family is in danger of homelessness, or has medical needs and so on. I
do not blame the local authority for that. People’s rent goes
up, their housing benefit is capped, they cannot afford to meet the
gap, and the only alternative for them is to be moved out of the area
to a distant place. At the moment, my borough does not place people
outside London, but I suspect it is only a matter of time before all
London boroughs decant people outside London because they simply cannot
find the private rented accommodation to house them. Schools are
disrupted when families are moved out and the community is weakened.
The flats are then rented to somebody at an even higher
rent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000221">I
am pleased that the Communities and Local Government Committee has
decided to concentrate on the private rented sector. I agree with much

conditions in the private rented sector, the guaranteed return of

they have the temerity to complain to local environmental health

those measures to be introduced, but we must address the elephant in
the room—the rents levels in the private rented sector. In
answer to a question from me yesterday, the Minister asserted that
private rented sector rents in London are going up by 1.4% per year. I
tested that out on a few people last night in my constituency. The
answers ranged from, “Which planet is he living on?” to
“Did he mean 1.4% per week?” There is a total disconnect
between the figures the Department works on and the reality of life for
people in the private rented
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000223">Government
Members say, “We cannot interfere with the market,” but
we are already doing so. As my Friend the Member
for<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T18:31:42"></hs_TimeCode> Holborn and
St Pancras has pointed out, the public are putting £9 billion a
year into the hands of private landlords. That is market interference.
I support housing benefit, but it has an effect. No rent regulation is
associated with housing benefit, and there is no control on rent
levels. That must be addressed. I recognise that, in most of the UK,
private rents are not excessively high. In many parts of the country,
they are lower than council rents. When I talk to colleagues about
supporting my ideas on the regulation of private rents, they say,
“It’s not an issue in my area.” I fully understand
that, but in London and on the fringes of London, and in one or two
other cities, it is a massive issue. A third of my constituents live in
the private rented sector. They ask me, “How much
longer can I afford to stay in your constituency?” Some of
those people are not poor—their salaries are quite
good. They are young professionals who want to live in an inner-city
area of London but can no longer afford to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000224">There
is a knock-on effect on the London labour market. I have been to the
Royal Mail sorting offices in my constituency, the local
hospital—on many occasions—the fire station, the police
station, social services, the council departments and other places, and
have asked people where they live. If they are under 40, the chances
are that they live at home with their parents. They do not want
to—the parents often do not want them there either—but
are stuck in that situation. If they have managed to buy a place, it is
a very long way away from London, and they spend an awful lot of time
and money on commuting, which has an environmental effect. A
few years down the line, where will the nurses, the teachers

for people who need houses and places in
London?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000225">To
my local authority’s great credit, it is building
council houses. It hopes to complete about 2,000 with the housing
associations on affordable or social rent models. That is making a good
difference to a lot of people’s lives. It is a great pleasure
meeting families who have lived in grossly overcrowded, poor-quality
accommodation when they get a decent, permanent, reliable and secure
council flat. That has changed their lives, and has changed
the attitudes of the young people involved. However, we are not doing
enough of it; instead, we are letting the market rip, and allowing all

have introduced a Bill under the ten-minute rule procedure, the
Regulation of the Private Rented Sector Bill. I think that the majority
of Members would find most of it unexceptionable. It deals with the
need to regulate letting agents. We could start with Criminal Records
Bureau checks—in some cases, that would be quite
helpful—and then move on to full regulation of 
<?notus-xml column=851?>the way in which agents charge, the extent of their transparency, and so
on. Not all letting agents are bad, just as not all private landlords
are bad, but there are some pretty seriously rogue elements.</hs_Para>

discriminate blatantly not only on grounds of ethnicity and
race—as “Panorama” discovered—but against
people on benefits. They say “We will not allow anyone who
collects benefit to rent a flat through this agency.” Why do
they do that? It is an interesting question, because someone who pays
part or all of his or her rent by means of housing benefit will
actually be a very reliable tenant. The answer can only be that the
agencies do not want the attention of HMRC to be focused on the levels
of income they are receiving.</hs_Para>

regulation to deal with that, we need transparency in regard to how
deposit schemes work and how tenants get their deposits back, and we
need serious attention to be paid to the longevity of tenancies. Six
months for assured shorthold tenancies is far too short; at least five
years strikes me as a reasonable basis, although obviously there should
be an appropriate form of get-out clause for people who, for instance,
get a job in another part of the country. That can be worked
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000229">Other
countries manage to regulate rents. Germany has a very regulated and a
much bigger private rented sector, and, in general, private rented
properties are owned by much larger landlords—co-operatives,
insurance companies or others. When the Minister without Portfolio, the
right hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps), told me that
regulation of the private rented sector would bring about the economic
ruin of Britain, I asked him whether that was a parallel with the
economic ruin that Germany was facing as a result of its regulation of
the sector. I am still awaiting his answer; I do not know when he will
be able to give it to
me.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000230">My
Bill proposes that local authorities should play a key role, because
they understand the communities they represent. Newham council, Oxford
city council and a number of other authorities have introduced
registration schemes, and have sought to introduce some degree of
regulation of the private rented sector. Of course, as the hon. Member
for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts), the Chair of the Select Committee,
pointed out, the problem is that it is the good landlords who tend to
register voluntarily, and it is the rogues whom we want to be
registered. Nevertheless, that is a good initiative and a good step
forward. Moreover, if local authorities introduced their own private
letting offices, they could use them for their own purposes when they
have to house families in the private sector because they do not have
enough council houses to deal with the demand.</hs_Para>

proposes that a combination of the Mayor and London boroughs should be
given the opportunity to introduce a rent registration and rent
regulation regime across London, which would have some bearing on the
affordability of properties. That would give access to housing to a
range of people who are currently excluded from it, and would thus
create more stable, more harmonious communities.</hs_Para>

work that the Select Committee has done, and I welcome the fact that we
are beginning to have a serious debate about the private rented sector.
It should be remembered that more than a third of the communities in
many parts of London are already

will grow a great deal. I very much hope that this will become a big
issue at the next election. I hope that parties including my own will
understand the need for regulation and the need to limit the excessive
rents that have been charged, so that we can bring about some sense of
harmony and decency in this sector of the housing market throughout the

consolidation of the legislation relating to the private sector, which
is currently dispersed and complicated, and such action would make it
simpler for tenants and landlords to understand their respective rights
and responsibilities. Clarity will also make things more accessible for
both tenants and landlords and may help to reduce some of the problems
that arise, and consolidation would also make things easier for local
authorities. What is absolutely vital, however, is that councils are

same applies to the Government’s attitude towards the licensing
of landlords. At the moment, local authorities do not even know how
many landlords are in their area or how to contact them. We want to
help local authorities identify those bad landlords whose housing is
not up to scratch and who break the law. That is why we have proposed a
national register of landlords, but we have been clear that our aim is
to empower and enable local councils to have tools to achieve that
locally. The Select Committee’s report recommends giving local
authorities the flexibility to license in their local area and to
require landlords to be part of a regulatory scheme. The report
proposes lots of different ways of doing that, but the important point
is that local authorities need the powers. We want to ensure that if a
local authority knows that poor standards are a significant problem in

them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000244">Labour-run

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T18:47:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk), this is a particularly thorny
issue. The report considers HMOs in some detail, with
paragraph 63 on page 26 considering article 4 directions. I
know that the Committee received some evidence that article 4
directions could be used to limit the number of HMOs in a particular
area, but I am not sure that article 4s are the right approach or the
right tool for this purpose. Many local authorities tell us that they
are a clumsy way of trying to control HMOs and that there should be an
easier way for councils to regulate HMOs in their area. So we want to
make it easier for local authorities to address local problems more
simply and
directly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#14030474000247">Similarly,
we also want to make is easier for local authorities to deal with
letting agents. According to estimates, some 4,000 managing and letting
agents are entirely unregulated, in that they do not even belong to
voluntary bodies that encourage a responsible approach to letting and
management practice. It is a peculiarity of current policy that while
estate agents, who hold very little money on behalf of their clients,
are regulated, letting agents, who hold significant sums on behalf of
landlords and tenants, are not. Good letting agents have a worthwhile
role in providing professional input and support, but too often tenants
and landlords alike are ripped off by unscrupulous letting agents. We
have said we will regulate letting and management agents, and bring an
end to rip-off fees. The Government’s moves to require letting
agents to be part of an approved redress scheme are welcome, but their
action comes only after prominent campaigning by Labour and, in
particular, by my colleague in the other place Baroness Hayter. We

pancreatic cancer. It will become apparent why we are so pleased to get

want to start by reiterating some points I made about this dreadful
disease in a debate in Westminster Hall last May that might help to set
the context for this further debate today. Before I do, may I put on
record my thanks to Pancreatic Cancer UK, Pancreatic Action, the
all-party group on pancreatic cancer and others who have highlighted
the impact of this disease? These include that great Lancastrian
actress Julie Hesmondhalgh, who recently gave the disease some
publicity in “Coronation Street”. More sadly there is the
example of Kerry Harvey, who died at the age of 24 on 22 February and
did so much in her last months to highlight the impact of this disease
with the assistance of Pancreatic Action.</hs_Para>

cancer is the fifth-most common cause of cancer death in the UK.
Approximately 8,500 people will be newly diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer this year with around 7,900 people dying from the disease
annually. Pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival rate of the
21 most common cancers. Five-year survival rates are less
than 4%; a figure that has barely changed in nearly 40
years. Pancreatic cancer five-year survival rates lag behind many other
EU countries and are almost half of what they are in the US, Canada and
Australia. Only 1% of the National Cancer Research Institute Partners'
total research spend is directed towards pancreatic cancer. By way of
comparison, £3,613 per death per year is spent on breast cancer
research compared to £553 per death per year on pancreatic
cancer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000312" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000312">Some
50% of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed as a result of
emergency admission; nearly twice that of other all other cancers
combined. Patients diagnosed as a result of emergency admission,
compared to other routes to diagnosis such as routine GP referral, have
significantly lower rates of survival. Pancreatic cancer patients have
one of the least satisfactory NHS experiences of all cancer patients,
evidenced by National Cancer Patient experience
surveys.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000313" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000313">If

combination with standard chemotherapy was licensed for use in patients

the drug has not yet been approved by the National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence it is not yet available on the NHS as a
standard treatment. Pancreatic Cancer UK is very keen to ensure that
patients are able to access Abraxane through the cancer drugs fund. The
House will now see the importance of the debate tonight; the decision
will be taken on Thursday 6 March—that is this week. Along with
others in the Chamber, I would like to see the drug approved by the CDF
this week and then eventually by NICE so that access to it is more
readily available. We know that Abraxane is due to be reviewed by NICE
very soon but this process takes a great deal of time, and it is time
that pancreatic cancer patients do not always
have.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000317" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000317">One

Shannon</B> (Strangford) (DUP):</Member> I thank the hon. Gentleman for
giving way and for bringing this important matter to the House’s
attention. It is surprising how many of us know people, both personally
and from our constituencies, who have been affected by pancreatic
cancer. I have some figures from Northern Ireland that might help his
argument. Only 14.2% of males and 10.3% of females live longer than a
year after diagnosis. When we get to five years, those figures drop to
2.8% and 2.9% respectively. Early diagnosis is key, along with new
treatments. That would increase the survival rate by 30%.

the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland would be

want to talk today about the new drug, Abraxane. The vast majority of
pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed so late that the benefit of
any new drug can be measured only in months, rather than years. Our
worry is that, compared with other cancers, that benefit might be
deemed insufficient simply because it is measured in months and might
not register highly on the quality-adjusted life years measurement
scale.</hs_Para>

also want to put on the record two other emerging possibilities. A
useful and emerging new technology is NanoKnife. It carries out a
process called irreversible electroporation, which destroys parts of
the tumour while avoiding damage to vital tissue nearby, such as blood
vessels. The process shrinks the tumour to a more manageable size,
which might then allow more permanent surgical solutions. NanoKnife is

treatment via that route, we continue to argue for a long-term
solution. In that context, we are worried about Andrew Dillon’s
statement that, under the new system of value assessments that NICE is
due to introduce in the autumn, only six out of 20 treatments assessed

clearly not the long-term solution expected from the original concept

and setting the scene so well. Pancreatic cancer needs all our efforts
if we are to make a difference. I pay tribute to pancreatic cancer
patients up and down the land, including my good friend Sir John Mason,
who is battling the disease, and all the families and friends of those
with pancreatic cancer, as well as those working with and supporting
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000340" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000340">As
the hon. Gentleman said, survival rates from the disease have not
changed for 40 years. Abraxane gives the opportunity not only for two
more months, but to bring about change and transform how the disease is
dealt with in future. In the United States, there is already innovation
in how the disease is being tackled. I hope that the people having to
make these difficult decisions listen to this debate and take it into
account when making the decisions in a proper and objective way.

goes without saying that cancer is a terrible disease, and my hon.
Friend spoke movingly of his experience, but all hon. Members know ways
in which it has touched them and their families and friends. I pay
tribute to the work that he and colleagues in the all-party
parliamentary group on pancreatic cancer have done to raise awareness
of the disease. Its excellent report, “Time to Change the

disease.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000344" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000344">My
hon. Friend drew the House’s attention again to the particularly
poor outcome for people who get the disease and the challenges in
diagnosis. If we could match the best survival rates in Europe we could
save an additional 75 lives a year. Clearly, if we exceeded those
survival rates, more people would be
saved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000345" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000345">Before
I tackle my hon. Friend’s specific point about Abraxane, it is
worth giving the context of other work that the Government are doing to
support earlier diagnosis. We committed more than £450 million
in funding over the four years to 2014-15. Sadly, there is currently no
easy way of detecting pancreatic cancer and it can be particularly
difficult for GPs to detect and diagnose it, especially in its early
stages. However, to try to address the situation, the
Department<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:21:56"></hs_TimeCode>
helped to fund a six-month pilot with Macmillan Cancer Support of a
cancer decision support tool for GPs to help them to identify patients
whom they might not otherwise refer urgently for this suspected cancer.
Evaluation of the pilot is under way, and if it is found to be helpful,
we will work with NHS England actively to promote its use. That tool
was highlighted at a recent parliamentary event that some hon. Members
might have
attended.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000346" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000346">We
need to do more about earlier diagnosis and public awareness
of the symptoms, which are often limited. As is often the way, I
suspect that the recent “Coronation Street” story line
has done more than many public health campaigns could have done to
raise awareness. Yet again, well done to our broadcasters for covering
some difficult issues and providing through Hayley’s sad story
some important health education. It has reached many people, and we
thank them for
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000347" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000347">On
Abraxane, I am obviously aware of Pancreatic Cancer UK’s Two
More Months campaign, and I congratulate my hon. Friend on this
particularly well-timed debate. I am fully sympathetic to his points.
As he says, two more months can mean so much to those who are affected
by this cancer, and he gave some moving examples. We do not associate
the disease with younger people. Sufferers are predominantly older but,
as he illustrated, many people suffer at a younger age. I thank those
who contributed to the report details of loved ones they have lost. My
hon. Friend bears witness to his own loss, which we feel keenly with
him.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000348" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000348">I
listened to my hon. Friend’s request that the recently licensed
drug, Abraxane, should be made available from the cancer drugs fund. As
he says, in the light of new evidence from the manufacturer, NHS
England’s cancer drugs fund expert clinical panel is reviewing
its earlier decision not to add it to its national list. One criterion
in the scoring tool used by the panel is evidence of a drug’s
impact on quality of life, which is what my hon. Friend 
<?notus-xml column=868?>spoke about. While I cannot in any way pre-empt the panel’s
decision, I can fully understand how important this will be to people
with pancreatic cancer. I will ensure that NHS England is made aware of
tonight’s debate and the very good attendance. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:24:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin) said, that reflects the impatience of
parliamentarians, on behalf of their constituents, to see progress on
this issue, which we seem to have been stuck on for so long. I
undertake to do that immediately in the morning to ensure that the
information is with the panel ahead of its
deliberations<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:25:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000349" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000349">My
hon. Friend will be aware that Abraxane has not yet been assessed by
the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Partly
because of these situations, we established the cancer drugs fund to
ensure that cancer patients in England have better access to
life-extending or life-improving drugs that are not routinely funded by
the NHS. He may also be aware that Novartis’s drug Afinitor is
included on the national list for the cancer drugs fund, alongside two
other treatments for treating pancreatic and neuro-endocrine
carcinomas. More than 44,000 patients have benefited from the cancer
drugs fund since October 2010, and we have recently announced an
extension to funding for the
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000350" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000350">Looking<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:25:38"></hs_TimeCode>
further ahead, NICE is appraising Abraxane for untreated metastatic
pancreatic cancer and expects to publish its guidance to the NHS in
January 2015. That may seem a long way away, but, as been mentioned,
this reflects the robust, evidence-based technology appraisal programme
that NICE provides to ensure that clinical effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness is taken into account when we look at drugs and
treatments. The Government believe that clinically appropriate drugs
should be routinely available to NHS patients, and we remain committed
to the rapid uptake of NICE-recommended drugs in the
NHS.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000351" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000351">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:26:26"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend referred to recent decisions on cancer drugs made by NICE.
I am sure he appreciates that there will naturally be fluctuations in
the proportions of drugs recommended by NICE each year, and so a more
accurate picture can be gained from looking at all NICE decisions on
cancer drugs to date. That shows that almost two thirds of its
decisions on cancer drugs have recommended their use for all or some of
the eligible patient population. Far from making appraisals tougher,
the most significant change to NICE technology appraisal methods in
recent years has been to introduce greater flexibility in the appraisal
of potentially life-extending treatments for patients at the end of
their lives, and that has helped NICE to recommend a number of new
cancer drugs for use on the NHS.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:29:15"></hs_TimeCode> speaks
directly to the extremely pertinent points that my hon. Friend made
about how someone who has had such a diagnosis will see an extra two
months in the context of the end of life, given that the progress of
the disease can be very rapid from the point of certain
diagnosis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000352" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000352"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jim Shannon" PimsId="650" UID="14030474000547" xid="1218" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000547">Jim

Ellison:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman has made that point in other
contexts before, and it is a perfectly good one. Of course, health is a
devolved matter, but as regards research and what we know about drugs,
there are lots of aspects on which England has taken a lead and on
which the devolved Administrations co-operate. I regularly have
exchanges of letters with my opposite numbers. When there are important
lessons to be learned on behalf of all our constituents, we would
naturally share that information and expect it to be looked at in all
parts of our United Kingdom.</hs_Para>

is to make sure that we get the best possible results for all NHS
patients with the resources we have. That is why we have asked NICE to
look at how drugs are assessed to ensure that patients can get the
treatments they need at the best value for the NHS, and that the price
the NHS pays is more closely linked to the value a medicine brings.
These can sometimes sound like quite cold decisions, but they are
designed to help us to have a sense of objectivity in what are always
very difficult decision-making processes. I assure my hon. Friend that
NICE will carry out a full public consultation before implementing any
changes in the way that it makes these
assessments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000357" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000357">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:28:46"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend referred to NanoKnife, which was also mentioned in an
intervention. I am advised, I am afraid, that NICE has published
guidance on that procedure which states that current evidence on the
safety and efficacy of irreversible electroporation for treating
pancreatic cancer is inadequate in quantity and quality, and it
recommends that the procedure should currently be used only in the
context of
research.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000358" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000358"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:29:12"></hs_TimeCode>My
hon. Friend mentioned research funding. We are often asked about the
amount of funding put into one area or another and I always like to
make the point that, rather than specifying subject areas, the National
Institute for Health Research welcomes funding applications for
research into any aspect of human health. These applications are
subject to peer review and are judged in open competition, with awards
made on the basis of the importance of the topic to patients and the
NHS, value for money and scientific
quality<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T19:29:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030474000359" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#14030474000359">I
have no idea whether parliamentary interest is part of that mix, but I

north-east of England. In six months’ time, the Scottish people

the north-east of England share an economic and industrial history, one
based on shipbuilding, coal mining and steel works, for example. It is

and Scotland share, and that economic history is important to the
north-east of England even today. At Durham Tees Valley airport, some
35,000 passengers a year travel from my constituency to Aberdeen for
the gas and oil industry, which shows how close Scotland is

Wilson:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman has raised the point that I was
going to make next with some statistics. At present, more than 23
million vehicles, 15 million tonnes of freight and 7 million rail
passengers a year cross the border between England and Scotland in both
directions. If Scotland becomes an independent state, the current
border will become an international border. Scotland will have to take
control of its border and introduce the relevant regulations to manage
it. The present UK is a true domestic single market: businesses in
Scotland have easy access to customers throughout all parts of the UK,
as does the north-east of England. Anyone who has the people and their
benefit in mind will surely see that as a key reason why Scotland
should not be independent, and why we should work together for the
benefit of all the people who live in the UK.</hs_Para>

international border would create a barrier to all that. For example,
as I have said, 40,000 people travel each way across the border every
day to work. An independent Scotland would not have the membership of
the EU or the common travel area that it now enjoys. It would have to
renegotiate travel arrangements with the rest of

It can only cause additional burdens to the Scottish and English people

That is, of course, contingent on one thing. It is rare for a
Conservative MP to praise a man called Barroso, but I am grateful to Mr
Barroso for his amazing contribution to this debate, because the

north-east is catching up, but it has significant economic problems.
The north-east needs a much larger private sector and more jobs, but it
has not had the resources that Scotland has had over the years.
Successive Governments have failed to reform the Barnett formula, which
gives between 10% and 15% more money per head for Scotland to spend on
public services. The Barnett formula does so because it simply locks in
the distribution from many years ago and applies it formulaically year
after year when the needs of the north-east should have been recognised

depends on the connectivity between the north-east and Scotland. One of
the most obvious aspects is that it is absurd that we still do not have

Parts of the road have been dualled over the years, but the job is
still not completed. The previous Government dropped two very good
schemes that would have dualled the road significantly. There is
increasing trade between Scotland and England that requires good road

connectivity is also important, and I am beginning to be concerned that
the High Speed 2 proposals have led Railtrack to propose ideas for the
future of the east coast main line that would provide unsatisfactory
services between the north-east of England and Scotland. Those services
have greatly improved in recent years. We now have very fast train
services from Edinburgh and Newcastle to London. We also have a much
improved service from Alnmouth in my constituency, which is an
important part of our connectivity. If Railtrack wants to ensure that
MPs in the north-east of England, and indeed eastern Scotland, support
HS2, it must not pursue daft ideas that would undermine the service.
That also means that we have to improve the east coast main
line’s capacity, particularly to handle freight. There are
possible investments, such as on the Leamside line, that could greatly
improve the capacity of the east coast main line and cater for
potentially growing freight traffic between the north-east ports and
for links between the north-east ports and

are issues that would be of very serious concern to my constituents if
there were to be a yes vote in the referendum. The debate so far has
been about an idea, and only now are we beginning to consider the
realities and facts. Of course Scotland could be independent, but there
is a price to be paid by both countries if that were to happen. That
price includes serious problems at the border. If the United Kingdom,
minus Scotland, did not have control and did not know what
Scotland’s 
<?notus-xml column=224?>immigration policy will be, it could not commit itself to an open border
with Scotland. If the rest of the United Kingdom did not have any
control of security in Scotland, it could not have a completely open
border. Whether the rest of the United Kingdom has a continuous border
control or just introduces a border control when it considers there to
be a particular danger, there will from time to time be border controls
to address the fact that the United Kingdom will have no control over
who is admitted to Scotland. I am talking about, for example, a

point. In my limited time, I will address another issue that affects
border controls—fiscal policy in Scotland. An independent
country might wish to have different VAT rates from those that apply in
England. That raises the other issue of Scotland’s relationship
with the EU, which has already been covered so I will not say any more.
If different taxation rates applied, there would be issues at the
border and a need to control goods coming across the border. That would
further impair trade and cause further difficulties for people whose
everyday life means constantly crossing the border. Those things are
not impossible to address—they are dealt with in many
countries—but they add to the difficulties of areas that have
enough economic problems as it is and certainly do not need such
artificial

right hon. Gentleman has got to the crux of the matter. Those who
support independence for Scotland tell us that they want to see open
borders and no change whatsoever from the current arrangements. If
Scotland was to become independent, I am sure that most of us, so far
as we would have a role in the matter, would want to see as open a
border as possible. The fact is, however, that we can only guarantee
open borders and the present arrangements by being part of the same
state, and that could change with independence. People can debate how
real that is and how far they would change, but we can only guarantee
the open border by maintaining the same state
arrangements.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030447000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0001.htm#14030447000101"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sir Alan Beith" PimsId="3936" UID="14030447000168" xid="38" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0001.htm#14030447000168">Sir
Alan Beith:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman puts the argument very well
indeed. The Union is a guarantee of free passage across the border,

that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030447000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0001.htm#14030447000102">There
is another kind of problem—we get it even under the existing
system, although it would be significantly worse if Scotland became
independent—which is the administrative difficulties people face
if they want to access public services across the border. If I ring up
a plumber, he does not say, “I am sorry, but I cannot help you
because I am on the wrong side of the border.” When public
services are involved, however, those difficulties 
<?notus-xml column=225?>start to arise. We have managed to minimise them in health, for example,
where many people on the Scottish side of the border go to GPs in
England and vice versa. Many people from my constituency use the
Borders general hospital. There are, however, always problems just
around the corner, and I spend a lot of time fighting to ensure that
new barriers are not erected. They would be much more likely to be

day to day in my area, but it also happens elsewhere with specialised
treatment. That activity is not impossible with independence—we
should not overstate the case—but it would become more difficult
and the likelihood of administrative barriers being erected is that
much greater. There are a whole series of reasons why anyone living
near the border, unless they see their future entirely as a town of
currency exchange kiosks and smugglers, would think that we are much
better together. That leads many of my constituents to say, “Why
can we not vote on Scottish independence?” I have a lot of
sympathy with that, but I hold as a matter of principle that, having
joined the Union, Scotland is entitled to leave if that is the will of
the Scottish people. They would be ill-advised to do so, and I do not

some other Members—particularly

barriers. I hope that the Prime Minister will not be erecting any
barriers, and in the absence of either side erecting any barriers,
there will be no barriers and we can continue to flow and interact with
each other freely. The thing that will change is that the Government
will move from Westminster to Holyrood, with the most democratic forum
representing the Scottish people. I do not know what people can have
against that, but I am shocked that people cannot be international. It
is great to be an internationalist and fantastic to respect the
independence of other nations and to look to engage and co-operate in
an international manner. With that, I encourage people who feel that
they cannot interact with people outwith their borders to think bigger,
to hope for better and to look for a greater future. I am sure that if
they search the depths of their hearts, they will find a way to look

work in its advantageous employment environment. That would not happen
if Liechtenstein was not independent. The people living around
Liechtenstein would not have the possibility of finding employment in
that area and would have to travel further afield. I am sure that the
benefits that accrue to many places on the borders around Europe will
also accrue to the north of England. If the hon. Gentleman was to look
deeply at the issue, I am sure he would find many advantages, but it is

the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man will have to give up their

individual, and I do not think that he will go down that route. The
argument about the euro is fallacious, because there are vastly
different levels of productivity within the eurozone. The strains

want to address the point that has been made about Canada and the

populations of Canada and the United States are more contiguous,
particularly in Canada, running east-west rather than north-south, and
that is where the problems are. I am pleased to see that

for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie) was not encouraging Canada, which became
independent of the United Kingdom, to become part of the United States
of America. We must realise that 100 years ago, the world had 50
independent states. It now has 200 independent states—Europe
alone has 50 independent states—and it is better for it.
Intergovernmental organisations and others come together to deal with
things, and the approach is far more mature than the 
<?notus-xml column=228?>one that existed in the days of empire. I encourage the hon. Gentleman
to take further his support for the independence of Canada, of which I
am a fervent supporter, and to realise that just as Canada is better
off being independent of its 10-times-larger neighbour to the south,
the same is true for Scotland. I do not see any animosity between
Canada and the United States of America; I see friendship and people
trying to get on with each other.</hs_Para>

the idea that we would be diminished were no doubt present when Ireland
and some of the Dominions were moving towards independence, but I argue
that they were wrong. There is more trade between the UK and Ireland
now than there ever was when Ireland was part of the UK. Things are
better, and the aggregate GDP of the British Isles is higher because of
an independent Ireland and an independent Isle of Man. It will be
higher still when we have an independent Scotland, because of the giant
suction machine that the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation
and Skills alluded to. There is an issue, but the best way to solve it
is to create a successful second centre of gravity in the island of
Britain. The island of Ireland probably benefits from having two

the UK. In addition, inequality in Norway is lower than it is in the

which we would set up an oil fund and ensure that the gains of
productivity were distributed far more equally in our society than they
are at the moment in the UK. Inequality in the UK is the fourth highest
in the OECD, and that is not something that he should be defending. He
should join me in making Scotland a more egalitarian and wealthier

final point is that when we put all the scares and fears aside, we see
that independence offers opportunities not only for Scotland but for
the north of England, and that it will increase the aggregate GDP of
the British Isles. Nobody would roll back the independence of any other
countries that have become independent, and I wager that when Scotland
becomes independent, nobody will roll that back either. The voices that
try to scare us about independence are the same ones that endlessly
tried to scare us about devolution. They repeat the same fears as
before when it comes to independence. None of them wants to reverse the
independence of any European country, however, and when Scotland has
become independent, they will support it wholeheartedly. Those in the

<?notus-xml column=231?>however, about the way in which the referendum has come about, and about
its legitimacy, given who will be voting. I have never quite been
resigned to the anomaly that allows 400,000 English people living in
Scotland to vote, but 500,000 Scottish people living in England not to
vote. It is strange that many of the Scottish people whom I represent
will have no say, but my mother who lives in Hamilton will get a
vote—she will, I am sure, vote to remain part of the United
Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T10:30:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030453000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0001.htm#14030453000040">We
are primarily present, however, to discuss not the referendum, its
format or how it came about, but what it might mean. There are two
possible options. Scotland could, of course, vote to leave the United
Kingdom. That is unlikely, because the Scottish people are sensible
enough to want to remain part of the United Kingdom, but the
possibility remains. They might be persuaded by the slogans and
rhetoric of those who legitimately make the argument for independence.
As we have discussed this morning, though, there would then be all
sorts of problems and unanswered questions. How would they deal with
taking a share of the national debt? How much would that share be, and
what would the deal look like? What would the currency be, if it cannot
be sterling? What would Scotland’s relationship with the

Banks:</Member></B> It was not any better than the speech, at all. The
hon. Gentleman really needs to be saved from himself in this place. My
experience is of understanding the relationship between north-east
England and Scotland, first hand. Those bonds demonstrate, I feel, the
underlying strength of the Union, a sentiment that I know is shared by
most Members present, with one obvious exception. Such links highlight
that the debate surrounding independence does not affect Scotland in
isolation but has significant implications for the rest of the UK.
Nowhere is that felt more keenly than in north-east England.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Sedgefield spoke with conviction about the common
identity shared by Scotland and the north-east, and I am in full
agreement with those sentiments. There can be no doubt about the bond

perspective.</hs_Para>

remember the 1980s, when Scotland and the north-east stood together
against the poll tax and pit closures. People recognised then, as we do
now, that any political change that we hope for can be reached only
through the unity of shared identity and interests. That common bond
would simply not be achievable if Scotland and the north-east were in
separate countries.</hs_Para>

the 1980s can be felt just as strongly today, as can be seen by the
fact that close to 150,000 people who were born in Scotland
live in north-east or north-west England, and we have heard today about
the many who travel across the border to work every day. Most of those
people have made it abundantly clear that they do not want the break-up
of the UK, as can be seen in a recent independent poll, which showed
that 62% of Britons want Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom.
People want that not only because of the bonds that we share, but
because of an underlying recognition that independence for Scotland
could leave them worse
off.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030453000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0001.htm#14030453000071">That
brings me to an important point, echoed throughout today’s
debate: independence has the potential to create uncertainty for our
nearest neighbours, as well as for Scotland. John Tomaney, formerly of
Newcastle university, has indicated that independence could have
significant economic consequences for the north-east; in particular, he
has highlighted the undesirable situation of Scotland competing
directly with the north-east for investment. North-east England would
be in the unfortunate position of being caught between a prosperous
south and an independent Scotland fixated on implementing Irish levels
of corporation tax. The end result would be a dangerous race to the
bottom when it comes to wages and conditions, a scenario that would
have serious implications for not only job security but the growth and
development of the economies of both Scotland and the
north-east.</hs_Para>

also runs the risk of damaging the north of England, part of the
country that would be an independent Scotland’s biggest supplier

today. I would encourage people to pay attention to the Institute for

which argues that the key to success for north-east England lies in
more joint working with Scotland—a point we heard in

people living in Scotland, the debate must be open to all. Open debate
will be vital in the coming months if we are to provide any clarity in

welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to today’s

data collected by the NHS to improve patient care sounds like a
wonderful idea and it should be something that we can all support.
However, almost nobody in the country, apart from NHS England, the
Department of Health and companies with a commercial interest in the
area, support what has been proposed. The scheme, which had the chance
to bring about huge benefits for patients, has suffered from a complete
failure to listen to either patients or doctors. The bottom line is
that people simply do not want their medical data to be sold to the
private sector or used for profit-making activities, and no amount of
awareness raising or leafleting will change that.</hs_Para>

want to ensure that we have a consent-based model for using patient
data that patients are happy with and have confidence in.
Patients’ opinions should be used to inform the way in which
care.data works and not trampled over in the hurry to extract data.
Patients matter, but we have heard no apology to all those who were not
properly informed about care.data and whose confidential data would
have been extracted without their knowledge if there had not been this
hastily arranged delay.

I will come to that point later. As I said, we have an opportunity in
the next six months to try to get the scheme right. If the Government
now address the many concerns raised about privacy, consent and the
creeping commercialisation of our health service, they have the
opportunity to create a scheme that offers enormous benefit to health
care and research. However, if they fail to do that and continue to
steamroll ahead, ignoring public concern, in six months’ time
they will find themselves in precisely the same place as they are now,
faced by massive public opposition to a scheme that has the potential
to do so much good and to save lives.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend has noticed an issue that has emerged. NHS England
uploaded a vast amount of hospital patient data—188 million

heard mention of the firm, Atos—by PA Consulting Group, which
lost a Home Office contract a few years ago because of data loss. Does
he agree that it appears that NHS England has now lost control of the
IT side of the project, and that before we go forward, we need full

that the Under-Secretary for Health, the hon. Member for Central
Suffolk and North Ipswich (Dr Poulter) has taken note of what she said

much confidential NHS data have been released to private profit-making
companies. He might also point out how much income the Government have

are a huge number of problems with the existing scheme. I could mention
the information leaflets that look more like junk mail and have no
opt-out return slip on them, or the fact that data extraction was
planned to start before the code of practice on who will be allowed to
access the data was completed, or the lack of a clear figure on cost.
However, perhaps the most damaging flaw in the whole plan has been the
refusal to listen to or to address those concerns when they were raised
by doctors and patients. We simply cannot and should not bring in a
scheme that lacks the consent and approval of the vast majority of
people whose confidential health data will be
used.</hs_Para>

Data collection is important, because of the benefits that could come
from it, but confidentiality and people’s confidence in the
system have been undermined. Does he agree that the fact that the NHS
data collection is specific to England, and that the Northern Ireland
Assembly Minister responsible has indicated that he

say again that simply spending the next six months dropping more
leaflets through letterboxes or building a website will not be anywhere

the Government have two choices, but first they should stop fighting

with GPs and patient groups about their concerns?

the Government have two options. They can either ensure that all the
patient data extracted are only shared with non profit-making bodies

we got found out. We will therefore delay it by six months while we try
to explain it better to you, the public. We know best—we

that we did not collect the data effectively to measure what good

diabetes, dementia and asthma to be better supported in their own homes

of those data will come from primary care, and it is important that we
put together those data and analyse them to understand what good care

Poulter:</Member></B> It is absolutely right that the discussions that
we have had in this debate and the issues raised about care.data have
been helpful in building on the safeguards in the 2012 Act to improve
the processes of the Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre, as a
new body, to ensure that it has particular regard to putting strong
confidentiality criteria in place. It is also right to keep those
criteria under regular review. Obviously, there is regular
communication between that body and the Information Commissioner about
issues such as protecting confidentiality.</hs_Para>

that we have a robust set of criteria in place under the 2012 Act. It
may be helpful to hon. Members if I outline what they are. I reassure
the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green that the data are not
released for
profit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T11:26:38"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
about cost recovery when they are. It is also important to say that
data are not released in identifiable form without a strong public
policy reason: for example, in a civil emergency or some such
situation. Data must be used for the benefit of the health and care
system. That is a strong set of criteria for use of the data, and
strong safeguards are in place. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State has already put in place an opt-out for patients who do not want
to be involved in the process, which has not been the case in the
past.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030453000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0001.htm#14030453000158">It
is important in this context to highlight that we are not taking a
sudden, big-bang approach or change to data; this is an evolutionary
process. In 1989, in-patient data were collected for the first time; in
2003, out-patient data; in 2007 and 2008, accident and emergency data.
That was about improving and driving transparency, 
<?notus-xml column=248?>developing better care pathways for patients with, for example, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and ensuring that we better used data to
benefit the health service and patients. Now, when it is so important
to drive better integration, primary care data will also be collected.
That is not a revolutionary change; it is an evolutionary change. What
is important is that now, under the 2012 Act, we have much stronger
safeguards in place better to protect patient confidentiality and much
more rigorous processes under which the Health &amp; Social Care
Information Centre, as a new body, will operate, in order to ensure
that it regularly reviews its processes and uses data in the right
way.</hs_Para>

important to say that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State fully
supports and is committed to the principles of the programme, which
will alert the NHS where standards drop, enable prompt action to be
taken, help staff understand what happens to people, especially those
with long-term conditions, and help us develop and improve care.
However, in order to reassure hon. Members further and bring greater
clarity to some of the issues and discussions, we have tabled some
amendments to the Care Bill. We will have an opportunity to discuss
them fully next week when we debate the Bill. I am sure that when hon.

up care standards in our NHS and supporting the integration of the

hope that hon. Members will take the opportunity next week to debate
fully any further issues or concerns that they may have. I will bring

Glen</B> (Salisbury) (Con):</Member> It is a great pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Dr McCrea, and I am delighted finally to have
secured this afternoon’s debate. The A303 is a 92-mile road of
historic importance that runs from Basingstoke to Devon and is one of
only two major routes across the south-west. It is often affectionately
referred to as the highway to the sun, because of its popularity with
holidaymakers. I am sure that many hon. Members in the Chamber have
fond memories of their long trips down it.</hs_Para>

such trips have become far from stress-free, and they now take far too
long, because of the formidable traffic jams that are regarded as an
everyday occurrence even outside the high season. A document published
by the Department for Transport in July last year revealed that an
estimated 20,000 vehicles drive within 200 metres of Stonehenge on an
average day. The problems have become particularly acute since the
closure of the A344 at Stonehenge. Sadly, to my constituents, the old
Roman name for the road, which was the devil’s highway, seems
appropriate. <hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T14:31:42"></hs_TimeCode>For
many people, travelling on the A303 has become a deep source of
frustration. Parents battling to the west country in half-term dread
it, but it is a hassle that they face only once or twice a year. It is
far worse for my constituents, who have to wrestle every day with what
feels like one of the most notorious traffic blackspots in the
country.</hs_Para>

have called the debate because I want to ensure that the 15 miles of
the A303 that run through my constituency are not overlooked in the
Government’s evaluation of the road as one of their national
strategic priorities. More than 20 years have passed since the first
dualling proposal was put on the table, and a staggering
£43 million has been spent on numerous feasibility
studies that have ultimately, and very sadly, come to nothing. That is
all despite the fact that when the M4/M5 route to Devon and Cornwall
was constructed in 1961, it was always envisaged that the A303 would be
entirely dualled, given the road traffic and economic forecasts at the
time. That was 53 years ago. My predecessor, the excellent Robert Key,
campaigned on the matter throughout his 27-year career in the House. He
tells me that he had meetings with 70 different Ministers from
different Departments during that time, which even involved the late
Baroness Thatcher examining maps on the floor of her office.</hs_Para>

risk of Stonehenge losing world heritage status is not an empty threat.
That happened to Dresden in 2009 when a new four-lane bridge was

the greater Stonehenge and the vast interlacing of pathways, waterways,
tombs, stones and enclosures fit together is not the idle pursuit of a
few; it is a national heritage responsibility for us

those two perspectives collide, doing nothing is not the only option.
Although people tell me, “Just get on and dual the road,”
a poorly designed and badly executed overground dual carriageway that
undermines a 5,000-year-old world heritage site is not an improvement
worth fighting for. In the past, however, all parties have repeatedly
united around one solution: a deep-bore tunnel that is at least 2.8 km
long, which would pass unseen beneath the hidden barrows and earthworks
of the wider Stonehenge site. It seems to me that no other realistic
solution has been offered—other proposed solutions have been a
cut-and-cover tunnel or open dualling—that provides the same
protection for the historic asset of Stonehenge and delivers the
improvements to traffic that so many of my constituents desperately
seek, and which I so enthusiastically support. Successive programmes
have been cancelled on the grounds of costs that made them politically
impossible to deliver or justify. As a result, we are left with a
highly congested road, dissatisfied local people, wasted investment in
feasibility studies, long delays for businesses and an imperfect

turn to the wider economic benefits of improvements to the route. A
study carried out in 2013 for Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire councils
estimates that dualling the A303 would ultimately generate more than
£41 billion for the economy, create 21,400 jobs and

Wiltshire businesses alone said that dualling would increase their
turnover, saving time, fuel and lives. The issue therefore is not
simply one of a bit of traffic on the edge of Salisbury plain. The A303
is one of just two transport arteries to the south-west. The British
Chambers of Commerce has shown that upgrading it offers the highest
benefit-to-cost ratio of any UK transport project,

Heathrow.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030456000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0001.htm#14030456000027">Why
would businesses invest in sites if accessing them involves travelling
regularly on the A303? Staff would be plagued by delays and rarely be
on time, while clients would never know whether staff would turn up.
The benefits, therefore, are clear, as is the choice. We can continue
with the clogged-up artery that is the existing A303, or we can provide
the region with a much needed lifeline to catalyse economic growth in
the south-west. It is somewhat sad that seven years ago my predecessor

come to those issues a little later, but she is absolutely right that
there are major problems when either the M5 or the A303 closes for one
reason or another. We have had relatively little investment in the
south-west, as recent weeks have shown. Across the south-west, we have
less investment in transport per person than any other region in the
country, with the possible exception of the north-east in some modes.
We are now reaping the consequences.</hs_Para>

goods. Companies such as Wrigley, Princess Yachts and Babcock all need
to ship products and supplies via road links rather than rail, due to
the nature of the products that they are moving. The Heart of South
West local enterprise partnership’s top priority is a faster,
more resilient transport system, and it is pressing for improvements to
the A303 as part of its key area of activity. It understands the need
to move people around by road. Certainly, now that Hinkley Point C will
be going forward, there will be a greater need for good road links, and
improvements will be

How can we better connect it with roads further west? The dualling

<?notus-xml column=255?>such as the RAC as well as local authorities. Dualling the road under
the Blackdown hills, for example, would be a huge cost commitment, but

Ilchester is a stretch of road that should have been dualled a long

appearing at a public planning inquiry in 1996 on the dualling of that
stretch of the A303. Those of us who 
<?notus-xml column=256?>were in favour of dualling won the inquiry—the inspector found in
our favour—and construction was about to start, when suddenly,

dualled relatively simply. I would like the schemes for Winterbourne
Stoke, Chicklade and Sparkford to Ilchester to be taken off the shelf;
it is utterly absurd that we have not made progress on those. I am
hugely relieved that this Government have finally decided that they
want to do something about the A303 and have commissioned the

is every argument for doing something about the A303, but they are in
three main areas. First, there are the economic arguments. We have
already heard from various hon. Members that the economy of the
south-west needs this connection, and ample evidence has been produced
by the CBI, the Federation of Small Businesses, the local enterprise
partnership and the local authorities in the area to say that this work
needs to be done to unlock the economy of the south-west
peninsula.</hs_Para>

there are perfectly sound safety arguments, certainly in relation to
the area that I represent. One of the problems is that there is a
relatively fast—I say “relatively”, because too
often it is clogged up—dual carriageway that suddenly becomes a
single carriageway, then a dual carriageway again and then a single
carriageway again, just at the point when people travelling from London
are at their lowest ebb and most tired. They have probably not taken a
break before that point, and therefore the accident record is of some
concern to me. That problem could be avoided by simple online
improvements.</hs_Para>

there is the point about resilience, which was eloquently made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:05:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton). It is simply
ridiculous that we often have only one viable route to the whole of the
south-west peninsula; it is ridiculous that one of the longest
peninsulas in any country has such limited access to it. People in
London and elsewhere sometimes do not understand just how big the
south-west is. I remember that when we were talking about regional
police forces, I said that the northernmost point of the so-called
south-west regional police force, which was at Tewkesbury, was nearer
to Scotland than to the tip of Cornwall. That is a fact. People have no
conception of the distances in the south-west, yet we are served by one
motorway. When that motorway is closed for any reason, as it was,
sadly, by the accident near Taunton in the constituency of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:06:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Taunton Deane (Mr Browne) a little while ago, the result
is chaos for the inadequate A303. Similarly, the A303 was flooded at
Christmas. Perhaps that was because of freak conditions, but
nevertheless we had, yet again, an example of the area’s lack of
resilience.</hs_Para>

have to couple that with our inability to travel by rail in such
circumstances, which all of us will remember from just a few weeks ago,
when Paddington station was like a ghost station, because there were no
trains running from it, or no trains running to anywhere that people

forgotten by every Government. A few months ago, I accused the

is. He has proved me wrong; he knows where it is and has been there, as
has my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:07:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Minister who is here today. However, in terms of Government
investment in infrastructure, the south-west is still very much the
poor relation of every other part of the country, and that is not good
enough for me. I just do not see why we have to be the last in the
queue for every single thing when it comes to Government investment. My
plea to the Minister is this: for once, listen to the west country,
listen to all the points that we are making, and do something about our
wholly inadequate A303.</hs_Para>

tunnel option. That would add to the considerable achievement of the

Members have said that we have few arterial routes into the west
country. Bristol is not the west country; it may be part of the west
country, but there is much after Bristol. To get to Devon and Cornwall,
people need to cross Wiltshire and Somerset. We need to get that road
done<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:16:43"></hs_TimeCode>. A previous
solution talked about in the spatial strategy—building on the
A358 and dualling it out to the A303—is not a solution, because
all that does is drive motorway and A303 traffic on to and off an
already congested
road<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:17:08"></hs_TimeCode>. The west
country—Somerset, Devon and Cornwall, and
Wiltshire—relies a lot on tourism. We also rely on our
businesses being able to be able to move their goods and services
around. Come the summer, there are times when those roads are
completely blocked. That has a huge economic effect on our businesses.

on holiday to the west country. Until we had all this rain, the sun did
nothing but shine in the west country. I am surprised that we have
managed to have such an amount of rain. In all seriousness, people come
to the English riviera in south Devon, and they come to Somerset and
Cornwall. They visit Stonehenge in Wiltshire, but they would like to be
able to move on at a reasonable speed without being jammed for ever; if
they cannot, it probably does not show Stonehenge to advantage. It
probably sticks in people’s memory as that horrendous place

A303 is a road that has tested the ability of successive Governments to
deliver those objectives. We have to be honest about that. There is a
clear need to improve the route, which is vital for the entire
south-west’s connectivity to the rest of the UK. Incomplete
dualling over the years has resulted in a number of bottlenecks, about
which we have heard today. Those bottlenecks cause road safety problems
and cost trade and tourism. There has been a range of continuing
reviews, public inquiries and policy changes from the 1990s to the
current day. They have demonstrated just how contentious delivering
some crucial road upgrades can be in practice. Any solution to this
matter will be difficult, but I am concerned—some of the issues
put to the Minister are real ones—whether the
Government’s approach fully learns the lessons of the past. I
have a number of questions for him to tease that out. The recent floods
have underlined just how important it is to improve strategic transport
connections to the south-west more generally. It is no good just
looking at roads, although they are important; we need to take into
account all the transport networks of the south-west—that point
has been made by a number of Members today—and improve transport
resilience across the piece in the
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030456000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030456000095">I
will not attempt to hide the fact that, like this Government, we faced
challenges in delivering a second arterial road to this part of the
country when we were in government. As Secretary of State for
Transport, my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr
Darling) committed to improving the A303 in 2003. Our process was
subject to lengthy public inquiries and the cost of the proposed
schemes rose significantly during that period. When we left office,
however, the Highways Agency had a costed and timetabled plan to
improve the A303. That included—it has been contentious for some
in the Chamber—dualling the A358 from Ilminster to Taunton,
which avoided some of the problems with the area of outstanding natural

Audit Office. The Highways Agency budget for capital investment in

take into account things that have happened so far. A number of Members

remained broadly similar, is there not a case for updating what has
already been done, rather than simply commissioning a new study? There
seems to be some confusion on that point. If I have misunderstood what

Ministers taking to ensure that the feasibility study will not just
result in an A303 proposal again being subject to further public

affected. Labour party candidates from that area have been on to us,
saying that investment needs to be prioritised. Those points are made
to us by our people in the south-west, as well as by those in this

that is, but ensuring that the transport network as a whole to the
south-west can cope with future pressures and be resilient. I therefore

Minister confirm whether they will be parallel processes that do not
link up? Secondly, will the Minister think again about the new national
networks policy statement proposed for the future of our road and rail?
This planning document, which is open to consultation at the moment,
does nothing to ensure that our existing transport networks are
flood-resilient. I understand that, privately, his Department is aware
of this and aware that the policy statement requires major work to
ensure that it reflects future planning policy properly and that it is
climate-resilient. If that is the case, it needs to be revised. So I

the Member for Salisbury. As is well known, the single carriageway
section of the A303 can cause congestion during traffic peaks on bank

new Stonehenge visitor centre opened in mid-December 2013 and is
situated at Airman’s Corner on the A360. In terms of traffic to
the centre, the car park fails to meet demand at busy times, and this
leads to traffic that is queuing to enter the visitor centre backing up
along the A360 and blocking it to other users. In extreme cases, the
traffic has reached as far as the A303 at Longbarrow roundabout,
causing congestion on the A303. In support of the new visitor centre
and closure of the local road, the Highways Agency has carried out
extensive improvements to the Longbarrow roundabout at the junction of
the A303, with significant investment of more than £3 million to
support the Stonehenge

addition, drivers have been using the nearby byway and lay-bys to get a
good view of the stones, which has further exacerbated congestion on
the A303. The Highways Agency has worked with Wiltshire county council
and the police to prohibit certain movements and to prevent drivers
parking illegally, guiding them by the designated route to the visitor
centre. I assure hon. Members that while we await the outcome of the
feasibility study, the Highways Agency will continue to monitor and
respond to congestion at this location. Wiltshire police have invited
some local representatives to a meeting with key agencies, including
the Highways Agency, the county council, English Heritage and the

south-west open for business during this difficult period and allowing
the replacement buses to run. The importance of the A303 has been

occurred at two locations on the A303, at llchester and at Deptford,
which was due to adjacent water courses and groundwater run-off from

directions for 20 hours. The diversion route was utilised to keep the
route into the south-west open. The flooding at Deptford saw the
eastbound carriageway affected for 12 days, although within two days a

conclusion, I again congratulate
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:49:23"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Salisbury on securing the debate. I have been clear that
the Government are committed to and have set out plans for large-scale
investment to improve 
<?notus-xml column=271?>our strategic road network in the relatively short term. We are also
committed to developing a longer-term programme of investment through
the route-based strategy process. Through the A303-A30-A358 corridor
feasibility study, we will work closely with local stakeholders to
ensure we consider current and future transport problems and the range
of possible solutions that could deal with them. As I said, it is
important that proposals for future investment are clearly supported by
the local stakeholders and that there is a clear consensus on what is
required. Ultimately, any proposals for future investment need to be
able to demonstrate a strong business case and the delivery of both
transport and wider economic
benefits<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T15:59:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

is said to have a silver lining, and the weather in the south-west this
year has emphasised the importance of a resilient road network when we
have problems on our rail network. The fact that big investment is
going into north-south rail connections makes an even stronger case for
investment in roads in the south-west. I look forward to my road trip
to Tiverton and Honiton—a road that I have travelled before.

Johnson</B> (Dartford) (Con):</Member> My hon. Friend makes an
important point about male victims of domestic violence. Female victims
are more numerous and sometimes more vulnerable, but we should not

heterosexual and homosexual relationships. Often they are unable to

crime survey statistics suggest that 31% of women and 18% of men have
experienced domestic abuse. Today I want to focus specifically on west
Essex and Harlow, where there is an above average amount of domestic
abuse incidents. I am incredibly proud of my town. I love living there
and am very proud to be its MP, but we cannot sweep the problems we
have under the carpet and so it is important to set out some of the
problems that we face. In Harlow alone domestic abuse makes up 10% of
all crime, a statistic that has increased by 2% in the past year; 32%
of all offences are assault with injury. Across Essex, police deal with
80 domestic incidents per day. As I mentioned, we have sadly lost two
Harlow residents to domestic violence recently, Eystna Blunnie in June
2012 and Claire Parrish in July
2012.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030469000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000009">I
therefore want to raise three issues this afternoon. First, what the
situation is in west Essex in relation to domestic abuse; secondly,
what steps are already being taken to improve how domestic abuse is
dealt with; and thirdly, what needs to be improved and how that could
be achieved.</hs_Para>

already mentioned, there are two tragic cases I would like to discuss
that really typify some of the problems that we face. The first is the
distressing case of Eystna Blunnie. Before she met her
ex-fiancé, Eystna was a happy young woman who had a close
relationship with her family. During her relationship with her
ex-fiancé she became withdrawn, and had little contact with her
mother and father. In April 2012, she was taken to hospital after being
strangled and falling unconscious. She was pregnant at the time, with a
daughter called Rose. She made the decision to leave her
ex-fiancé, and returned to live with her family. But two months
later, and just days before her baby was due, she received a text from
him saying he had a surprise for her. She was found by the roadside
with over 50 injuries, and died shortly afterwards from severe head
injuries. Her ex-fiancé was found guilty of her murder and of
causing the death of their unborn baby, Rose. He was jailed for a
minimum of 27 years. I was due to see her in my surgery just a few days
after she died. During the court case, it transpired that her
ex-fiancé had previously been arrested for assaulting
ex-girlfriends.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030469000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000011">The second
tragic death is that of Claire Parrish, a mum of four living in Harlow.
Her partner murdered her just hours after she told him that she wanted
to end their relationship because of his domestic abuse. Like three in
four victims, Claire was sadly one of the many who felt unable to
contact the police.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030469000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000012">Of course,
those cases are horrific examples of the terrible tragedies that can
occur. But they unfortunately also reflect the wider problem of
domestic abuse in west Essex, which has one of the highest rates of
domestic violence in the country. Between 2003-04 and 2011-12, recorded
incidents of domestic abuse increased by nearly 88% across Essex; they
increased by 25% between 2010-11 and 2011-12. The cost of domestic
abuse in Essex alone is £86 million per year. It represents a
substantial amount of police work.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030469000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000013">Those
statistics can be interpreted in two ways. On the one hand, we know
from studies that the incidence of domestic abuse is higher in areas of
deprivation, and that is sadly reflected in Harlow wards. Toddbrook,
Little Parndon, Hare Street and Netteswell are in the top 30% of the
most deprived areas in England; unfortunately, they also have the
highest rates of domestic abuse in my constituency. On the other hand,
it is good that Essex police are recording incidents of domestic abuse
thoroughly, and it has been acknowledged that changes in how records
are kept and county priorities are one of the reasons why domestic
abuse figures in Essex are so high.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030469000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000014">Yet that must
not stop us acknowledging that there is a clear problem with domestic
abuse. In the aftermath of tragedies such as the deaths of Eystna
Blunnie and Claire Parrish, it is worth remembering that Essex police
and Essex county council have taken important steps forwards in how
they treat domestic abuse. They have created a new domestic abuse
strategic board, and I praise them for that. I am glad for the enormous
amount of work done by the Minister, who is taking a zero tolerance
approach and is extending Clare’s law across the United Kingdom.
I am hopeful that that will prevent victims from being sucked into a
cycle of abuse that is difficult to break. I also recognise that the
east of England has the best conviction rate in the country for 
<?notus-xml column=274?>cases of domestic violence, with Essex having the second highest
conviction rate of all the criminal justice areas in 2011-12.</hs_Para>

minimise in any way, however, the significant failings that led to a
lack of help for Eystna and Claire. There are three main problems that
I wish to discuss. First, current training regarding domestic abuse for
people working in key public services is inadequate. There were a
number of occasions where better training for front-line staff might
have provided Eystna with the help she so badly needed. For example,
she was under the care of midwives and housing officers. She was also
seen at A and E, and had reported to the police that she was being
abused. Despite coming into contact with all those services, she
received little support.</hs_Para>

case is echoed in the review by Her Majesty’s inspectorate of

training has also been identified as a priority, and a recent report
said that there is a need for improved training and awareness about
domestic violence and abuse for GPs and healthcare professionals. The
training also needs to extend to the Crown Prosecution Service, which
acknowledged that it made a mistake by not initially charging Eystna
Blunnie’s ex-fiancé when he tried to kill her in April
2012. Healthy relationship education should be extended in classrooms.
Victims of domestic abuse tend to be women in their early 20s, and
education will hopefully give them the skills to deal with a bad
relationship and encourage them to speak up if they are in an abusive
one.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030469000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000018"><Member ContinuationText="Priti Patel" PimsId="5618" UID="14030469000115" xid="1153" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000115"><B>Priti

criminal justice system in Essex, in which I saw both good and bad
practices. Does my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon)
agree that it is incumbent on HM Court Service to play a role, so
defendants and victims are not left alone together, for example? In my
experience, the witness service does a fantastic job in preventing that
kind of thing. Nevertheless, it is important that courts ensure that
the interests of both parties are protected while they are going

tend to come from families in which there is a history of abuse.
Studies show that nearly a quarter of young people in the UK think that
abuse or violence is sometimes okay. It must be stressed to young
people that abuse in any form and for whatever reason is never
acceptable. I am pleased that Essex county council is working with
schools to develop a programme to help students recognise abusive
relationships. However, abuse should be tackled nationally, and the
curriculum should focus on altering the creation of violence through
targeted education. That could include training on self-esteem and
values; learning about the help that is out there, such as
Clare’s law, and how to access it; and special training for
tutors in
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030469000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000023">Victims
have identified that how they are supported needs to be reformed.
Following the terrible death of Eystna, Mr and Mrs Blunnie told me that
despite good help being available from individual police officers, they
felt let down by Victim Support. They received little follow-up, always
had to be the first to make contact and had to speak to different
people each time. Ultimately, they came to rely upon a charity called
Advocacy After Fatal Domestic Abuse for support, to which I give huge
thanks for all it has done. The situation is disappointing, and I
encourage Victim Support to review what it can do for victims and their
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030469000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000024">Finally,
one of the major problems that was identified in the handling of
domestic abuse in Essex is the lack of cohesive information sharing
across services, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Witham
referred. It is shocking that despite the fact that Eystna was pregnant
and was known to many key services to have a fiancé with serious
mental health problems and a history of abusing women, a sufficient
safeguarding plan was not put in place. The HMIC review strongly
criticised Essex police for failings across the force in that area. It
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14030469000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000105">“We

avoid tragedies such as those that happened in Harlow and prevent such
things from happening again anywhere, we must not only learn lessons
but act on them. As I have said, that means providing
education in schools, investing in and focusing
on areas of high deprivation and significant domestic abuse,
fully implementing Clare’s law, ensuring proper information
sharing among services and safeguarding vulnerable people. The
Government are making significant efforts on a national level, but we
must ensure that they also work on a micro-level. Local areas—in
particular, those with high levels of domestic abuse—should have
everything at their disposal to deal with this ever-increasing tragedy.
I look forward to the Minister’s

violence is unquestionably a terrible crime, and I give my absolute
assurance that the Government is committed to tackling it robustly.
Getting a clear picture of the prevalence of domestic abuse is always a
challenge because it is so under-reported; we must deal with that
problem. The crime survey for England and Wales, which measures what
people tell us, rather than crime recorded by the police, estimates
that 1.2 million women were victims of domestic abuse last year. That
is a huge number. The police and crime plan for Essex estimates that
there were 44,000 victims of domestic abuse in the county, which has a
population of 1.7
million.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030469000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000029">I

there have been some tragic cases, and domestic abuse is often fatal.
As I am sure my hon. Friend is aware, six people were killed by their
partners or ex-partners in Essex in the three years between 2009 and
2012. That was against a national backdrop of 76 women being
killed by their partners or ex-partners last year. Although we can take
some comfort in the fact that that is the lowest figure since 1998, I

take the opportunity to offer my sincere condolences to Eystna’s
family for the loss of their daughter and granddaughter, and to the
family of Claire Parrish for their sad loss. The Blunnie case was all
the more tragic because there was a chance to prosecute Mr

death. Regrettably, the Crown Prosecution Service missed the

That guidance has been published and is directed at commissioners and

Lavery</B> (Wansbeck) (Lab):</Member> As ever, it is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Dr McCrea. This debate focuses on the
Government’s proposals to close all HMRC inquiry centres in the
UK. Inquiry centres provide a vital public service, allowing taxpayers
to access free expert advice from highly skilled HMRC staff. In 2012,
some 2.5 million people visited those offices, where they could take
advantage of free phone and internet access, and 340,885 of those
customers made a face-to-face appointment to get help complying with
their tax duties and receive advice on their benefit
entitlement.</hs_Para>

Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs announced that a “needs
enhanced support” service model would be rolled out, resulting
in the closure of all 281 HMRC offices by the end of June 2014. The
taxpayers most likely to be prevented from accessing the proposed new
service as a result of the cost are the unemployed, those on low
incomes such as migrant workers and pensioners, and child benefit and
child tax credit claimants. Such taxpayers rely heavily on the free
service currently provided by HMRC staff at inquiry centres.</hs_Para>

were closed as part of a pilot of the new needs-enhanced support

have heard examples of people travelling miles, only to find their
local office no longer open to the public. In one prime example, an
85-year-old man used two buses to get to Scarborough, only to find the
inquiry centre closed. Staff were actively prevented from assisting
him: I repeat that they were actively prevented form assisting an
85-year-old gentleman. Another member of the public was trapped inside
Gilbridge house in Sunderland, while trying to look for the inquiry
centre, which had been
closed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:36:18"></hs_TimeCode>. Many

widowed elderly woman turned up at Gilbridge house office for
assistance with a tax form she needed to complete on behalf of her late
husband. She told a member of HMRC staff that she simply did not feel

of completing it herself, just in case she did anything wrong, and that
she could not grieve properly while she had this worry on her
mind<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:37:06"></hs_TimeCode>. I use this
specific example, because staff are particularly concerned about the
prospect of mainly older customers getting the support they need to

time. They not only need time; they need empathy, understanding and a
common touch<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:37:24"></hs_TimeCode>. It

are also problems involving equality issues. It is clear that the pilot
scheme could not possibly identify the equality impacts on customers
and staff, due to the demographics of our north-east
region<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:38:12"></hs_TimeCode>. For
example, migrant workers make up 25% of all inquiry centre customers.
However, the percentage of these customers is much lower in the
north-east of England than it would be in other regions, such as
London, which is a prime example.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:38:27"></hs_TimeCode> consultation
carried out by HMRC last year did not present equality data about
customers. The document was not produced in different languages, which
is of particular concern considering the high number of migrant workers
who use the service. Only 11% of staff work part time in the
north-east, compared with a national average of 36%. For example, 45%
of workers in Wales and Scotland work part time. Only 7% of
staff declared a disability in the north-east, compared with 27% based
in Wales. Some 30% of inquiry centre staff in London and south-east are
black, Asian and minority ethnic, compared with just 2% in the pilot
area. How<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:39:15"></hs_TimeCode> can

is also worth mentioning, while considering the equality implications

the low incomes tax reform group won their appeal against the
HMRC’s requirement that they must file their VAT returns online.
A tax tribunal found that HMRC’s regulations that required
online filing of VAT returns without providing exemptions for older

that are too remote for broadband access, breached the

vulnerable members of society. They are not able to afford a 
<?notus-xml column=283?>landline or a mobile telephone, and even if they own a mobile telephone
it is often on a pay-as-you-go facility with a minimum amount of credit
reserved for emergency calls only. Those taxpayers include the
unemployed, people on low incomes, migrant workers, pensioners, people
on child benefit and child tax credit claimants. Those taxpayers rely
heavily on the free service that is currently provided by our inquiry
centre network because their tax queries are often

earners, for example, often work in multiple jobs to provide for their
family, which means that the tax code is often incorrect. They visit
the HMRC inquiry centres to use the free phones and free internet
facilities or to receive face-to-face support and advice. HMRC agreed
that an alternative access solution needed to be found if the new model
was to be rolled out nationally. It is therefore concerning that the
decision to move to the new service model and to close the inquiry

has a decision been made without the Department having been able to
resolve those important issues? Even in areas that have decent mobile
phone coverage, taxpayers need to be reassured that contact centres
will be sufficiently staffed to handle their calls. If the closures go
ahead, people will no longer be able to walk into their local inquiry
centre and receive face-to-face assistance on tax issues that are often
complex. Instead, they will have to call a contact centre. A member of
staff will then vet them and determine whether to refer them to another
adviser. Only if that two-tier adviser deems it appropriate will a
taxpayer classed as needing enhanced support be given access to
face-to-face advice. Call handling levels have consistently been
criticised by the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit
Office. There are figures that prove conclusively that people will find
it extremely difficult to

fact that we are removing HMRC offices from local communities is one of
the most important issues. HMRC is effectively moving its presence away
from people who are supposed to pay, which will make closing the tax
gap even harder. It will make tax compliance more difficult, both for
those who want to comply but cannot get access to the information they
need and for those who intentionally want to slip under the radar
because they are disengaged with the tax authority at a local level.
Those concerns have been raised by a large number of stakeholders in
the public consultation exercise, including by the Association of
Taxation Technicians, Citizens Advice, Gingerbread, the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Lancaster city council,
Milton Keynes council, TaxAid and a number of individual taxpayers.

conclude simply by asking the Minister to reconsider the decision to
close the offices. There is a real danger that if the plans go ahead,
some of the most vulnerable people in society will lose their access to
HMRC’s services. Hundreds of quality jobs will be lost, and the
Government’s attempts to tackle the tax gap will be

Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Mr David Gauke):</Member></B> It
is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Dr
McCrea. I congratulate the hon. Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery) on
securing this debate and putting across his points with characteristic
clarity and force. Although I can understand his and other
Members’ concerns about the new HMRC service, particularly the
plans to close its network of inquiry centres, I hope to provide
reassurance that the changes will in fact provide better support to
customers who require extra help to get their taxes and payments right.
I want to focus on three areas: the impact on HMRC staff, whether there
will be continued provision of face-to-face service and what the
changes will really mean for those who currently use the inquiry
centres.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030469000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000078">First,
let me begin, as the hon. Member for Wansbeck did, with the impact of
the proposals on existing HMRC staff. Members will be aware that HMRC
has recently written to all MPs about the introduction of the new
service. That letter includes confirmation, which I would like to
stress again today, that the plans are no reflection on the dedication
and commitment of the 1,300 staff working in the inquiry centres. It is
simply the case that HMRC can better support customers if it uses its
money and staff in other
ways.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030469000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000079">Since
the original consultation on the proposed new service began last year,
HMRC has been discussing the impact of the changes with staff in
inquiry centres and trade unions. As the hon. Member for Wansbeck
pointed out, I met PCS representatives this morning to discuss the
changes. Staff have been advised of the options and support available
to them, dependent on their personal circumstances. The options include
opportunities to apply for one of 450 roles in the new
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030469000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000080">A
voluntary exit scheme has been opened for inquiry centre staff who wish
to leave the Department on favourable terms, and HMRC has good reason
to expect that a significant number will take the option to leave and
pursue their futures elsewhere. HMRC will also, of course, do
everything possible to redeploy as many staff as possible within HMRC
or to help them to find other roles within the civil service. For those
who go into the redeployment pool, the offer of a one-to-one meeting is
still in place—it has certainly not been
withdrawn.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030469000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000081">It
is worth bearing in mind HMRC’s history as an employer. It has
reduced in size significantly over the past nine years, but there have
been only 35 compulsory redundancies. Although I cannot provide any
guarantees that there will be no such redundancies, HMRC’s
record in avoiding such eventualities is
strong.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030469000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/halltext/140304h0002.htm#14030469000082">Secondly,
I would like to address the concerns of those who have suggested that
the closure of the inquiry centres marks the end of HMRC’s
dedicated face-to-face advisory service. Let me reassure them that that
is definitely not the case. A face-to-face service is about people; it
is not about bricks and mortar. What is important is that HMRC provides
an accessible and flexible face-to-face service that meets the needs of
customers. Such a service is at the heart of the new system, which will
provide face-to-face meetings where 
<?notus-xml column=285?>that is most convenient to customers. Today’s customers
increasingly want to access services online, by phone and face to face

Matters can often be resolved over the telephone rather than in a
face-to-face meeting. The hon. Gentleman rightly highlighted a case in
which an 85-year-old gentleman caught two buses to attend an 
<?notus-xml column=286?>inquiry centre. If it is possible to drive that service more easily over
the telephone, so be it, but there are circumstances in which a
face-to-face meeting will be appropriate, so that will be

research has highlighted that up to 1.5 million customers
need extra help with their tax and benefits affairs. Many of them need
help only for a specific event in their lives, such as when they
approach retirement. Others may have low literacy skills, or a mental
health condition may make it difficult for them to cope with their
affairs. The new, more accessible service will be tailored to the needs
of customers who require extra help. Specialist help will be provided
over the telephone by extra support advisers who have the time, skills,
knowledge and empathy to handle customers’ inquiries at a pace
that suits them, and who can identify when a customer needs extra help.
If a customer’s query cannot be dealt with over the phone, they
can arrange a face-to-face meeting with a team of mobile advisers based
across the United Kingdom. Such meetings can be arranged at a time and
place convenient to the customer, and extra help will be delivered
through HMRC’s voluntary and community sector partners who have

centres are being closed, but there will be something like 350 venues

McDonnell:</Member></B> The problem with call centres is that in order
to secure a face-to-face meeting, someone has to get through on the
phone. At the moment, the Public Accounts Committee has set HMRC a
performance target of 90% of calls for 2013-14, but performance, as at
December 2013, was 76.2%. So HMRC is significantly failing its existing

gone through one of the biggest peaks for telephone calls during the

it met the 90% target even on the last day of January, so
there is some progress in terms of HMRC’s contact centre

the time that I have available, I will turn to the consultation and
pilots. As many hon. Members will be aware, in developing and refining
the new service, HMRC undertook a wide-ranging consultation on its
proposals last year. It also piloted the new service in the north-east
of England from June to December 2013, closing 13 inquiry 
<?notus-xml column=287?>centres including, as we have heard, the Morpeth inquiry centre in the
constituency of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:56:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Wansbeck, so as to run the live trial. Feedback from customers and
staff has helped to shape the service that will now be rolled out
nationally, which includes introducing alternative routes for deaf,
hard-of-hearing and speech-impaired customers to contact HMRC online,
and making it easier for a friend or family member to contact HMRC on
behalf of a customer to arrange a face-to-face appointment.</hs_Para>

who have used the new service have liked it. Independent research has
shown that the new service has delivered an improved service for
customers who need extra help, compared with their previous experiences
with HMRC. Some calls, particularly those about tax credits, can also
be handled effectively by HMRC’s contact centre advisers. I know
that concerns have been raised about the ability of contact centres to
cope with the increased demand, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-04T16:57:45"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) said. However, as I

conclude by reassuring hon. Members that HMRC is making these changes
for two main reasons: first, to better meet the needs of those 1.5
million customers who need more help with their tax and benefits; and,
secondly, to ensure that the services it provides represent the best
value for money for taxpayers. Many inquiry centre staff will have the
opportunity to apply for roles in the new service; many others will
choose to leave HMRC through a voluntary exit scheme, or will seek
redeployment to other roles within HMRC or in other Government
Departments. In short, HMRC is doing the right thing for its customers
and for the country, and as a responsible employer it is treating its
staff with consideration and respect as it implements this important
new service.</hs_Para>

My noble Friend the Minister of State for Trade and Investment has made

EU Competitiveness Council took place in Brussels on  20 and 21
February 2014. The UK was represented by Lord Livingston on day one
(industry and internal market) and David Willetts on day two (research
and space). A summary of those discussions
follows.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="14030448000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/wmstext/140304m0001.htm#14030448000010">The
main internal market and industry issues discussed were industrial
competitiveness and the annual growth

Council began with a discussion about industrial competitiveness.
Member states were asked to outline their priorities for improving
industrial competitiveness, achieving a balance between climate, energy
and competitiveness policies and how to mainstream industrial
competitiveness into all policy areas. In its presentation, the
Commission outlined its overall approach, noting that: all policy
proposals should be competitiveness proofed; support should be given to
innovative SMEs; and Competitiveness Council should play a greater role
on industrial policy. The Commission also reiterated its proposed
target to boost industry’s share of EU GDP to 20%. The UK called
for: the EU to focus on creating the right single market conditions;
reduced burdens; a strong state aid regime; free trade agreements; a
cost-effective and flexible energy and climate framework; a reformed
emissions trading system; robust action to prevent carbon leakage; and
a single energy market. The UK also emphasised that the EU should not
be distracted by artificial targets on
industrialisation.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="14030448000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/wmstext/140304m0001.htm#14030448000012">This
was followed by a discussion regarding the annual growth survey. The
Commission noted the progress many member states had made on their
country specific recommendations, but argued that too many service
sector barriers remained. Key sectors where action should be taken
included business and professional services, construction and retail.
The UK emphasised the need to fully implement the services directive,
called on the Commission to urgently provide guidance on
proportionality, and suggested following a sectoral approach for
further services liberalisation—for example, professional
business
services.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="14030448000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/wmstext/140304m0001.htm#14030448000013">Eight
AOB points were discussed: the ninth ministerial meeting of the Union
for the Mediterranean on Euro-Mediterranean industrial co-operation;
the European tourism quality principles; the European strategy for
costal and maritime tourism; state aid modernisation; hybrid nutrition
labelling; non-financial and diversity information and the statute for
a European
foundation.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="14030448000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/wmstext/140304m0001.htm#14030448000014">Research
and space issues were covered on 21 February. During research
discussions, the Commission noted that many member states were cutting
their research budgets due to the overriding driver of fiscal
consolidation—a careful balance had to be found or this would
risk damaging their research and development capacity and the knowledge
economy.</hs_brev>

were made to the importance of linking research agendas—both
national and Horizon 2020—to structural fund spending. Germany
and the UK warned of the risks of unhelpful regulation at European
level, with the UK highlighting that the precautionary principle needed
to be revisited and that “gold” open access to
publications should be the norm in
Europe.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="14030448000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/wmstext/140304m0001.htm#14030448000016">On
the European research area Council conclusions, the Commission
clarified that the European research area was complete at a European
level, but this now needed to be complemented by member states’
action to implement the policies
identified.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="14030448000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/wmstext/140304m0001.htm#14030448000017">On
the AOB items on public-public research partnerships and public-private
research partnerships the presidency updated on the recent negotiations
with the European Parliament. On the AOB item on international

agreement.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="14030448000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/wmstext/140304m0001.htm#14030448000018">On
the space policy debate on relations between the European Union and the
European Space Agency, the presidency highlighted that both
organisations were analysing similar policy options: to do nothing,
have closer collaboration on policies and space missions, to have a
dedicated directorate in the European Space Agency operating in
accordance with EU rules on procurement, or to disband the European
Space Agency and establish a new agency within the EU with similar
functions. The majority of member states including the UK expressed a
preference to undertake further consideration of the middle two options
although the UK noted that the concepts still needed further definition
and that the case for new EU legislation to implement them had not been
made.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="14030448000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/wmstext/140304m0001.htm#14030448000019">There
was widespread consensus that both organisations needed to respect each
other’s expertise more and become more pragmatic in their
relationship. The UK proposed that there should be a joint ESA/EU
“Space Council” at the end of the year to discuss which
approach to
take.</hs_brev><hs_6bDepartment UID="14030448000003" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/wmstext/140304m0001.htm#14030448000003"><DepartmentName xid="54">Justice</DepartmentName></hs_6bDepartment><hs_8Statement UID="14030448000006" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/wmstext/140304m0001.htm#14030448000006">Prison

Bradley:</Member></B> The Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM)
was put in place to support and monitor Bulgaria and Romania's progress
on specific post-accession benchmarks in the area of judicial
reform, the fight against corruption and, for Bulgaria only,
the fight against organised crime. The European Commission monitors and
reports on developments in both countries. The latest CVM progress
reports were published on 26 January and deposited for
scrutiny in the usual way. The Government has endorsed their
conclusions, which offer a comprehensive, balanced assessment of the
progress achieved so far while drawing attention to those areas where
further efforts are necessary. We believe the CVM should remain in
place until the benchmarks are met.</hs_Para>

overseas territories with financial centres have taken
significant steps forward on tax transparency putting them at the
forefront of this agenda globally. This has been publicly recognised by
the Government. In addition to signing agreements with the UK for
the automatic exchange of tax information, they have also
agreed to be early adopters of the new global standard for automatic
exchange, recently endorsed by the G20 at its meeting of 22 February in
Sydney.

the process of obtaining extension of the UK's signature of the
multilateral convention on mutual assistance in tax matters. They have
also published action plans on beneficial ownership, setting out the
concrete steps they will take to ensure greater clarity about who
really owns, controls, and benefits from companies and legal
arrangements in their jurisdictions. We will continue to work closely
with the Crown dependencies and overseas territories and will continue

faults or excessive demand, the electricity system operator requires
either additional generation to run as back up, or a reduction in
electricity demand to ensure the system remains balanced. Such
generation is commonly referred to as “reserve”.
Electricity generated from wind at a given time is one variable
currently managed as part of the demand supply balance among others.
The system operator procures reserve services commercially, as part of
balancing services. DECC does not hold data on energy produced from
reserve services which is part of commercial arrangements the system
operator has with providers.</hs_Para>

and support assessments are carried out by assessors with suitable
knowledge and training. The Care Bill will require local authorities to
ensure assessments are carried out in an appropriate manner, which will
require local authorities to ensure staff are appropriately trained.
Regulations will place a duty on local authorities to ensure that any
person carrying out an assessment has the skills, knowledge and
competence to carry out the assessment in question and that this is
maintained. In addition, local authorities will be required to consult
an expert in the individual's condition in cases where the assessor
lacks experience. These requirements will apply to assessors who carry
out assessments for people with autism, and this will be set out in the
statutory guidance that will support the implementation of the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1403054000461" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/text/140304w0002.htm#1403054000461">These

Vaizey:</Member></B> I congratulate Screen Yorkshire for its track
record in raising alternative sources of funding. In 2012 it
established the Yorkshire content fund, a £15 million
co-investment fund with £7.5 million of European
regional development fund (ERDF) investment, which has
already been widely recognised by industry for its impact locally and
nationally. The fund has invested in over 20 highly successful
productions to date, with reports from production to date indicating
that the first £4 million of ERDF money invested has so far
produced direct spend in the region of over £15 million. In
February this year Screen Yorkshire announced it is to receive an
additional £7.5 million from the ERDF, raising the
total value of the fund to £30 million, which will greatly
benefit the film, television and digital content sector across the
Yorkshire region in terms of projects and job
creation.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1403054000067" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/text/140304w0002.htm#1403054000067">Video

on the use of informal exclusions. The Department's statutory exclusion
guidance makes clear that all exclusions from school must be lawful,

school has acted unlawfully in excluding a
pupil.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1403059000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/text/140304w0003.htm#1403059000120">The
exclusion guidance emphasises to schools the importance of early
intervention to address underlying causes of disruptive behaviour,
including, where appropriate, an assessment of whether suitable
provision is in place to support any special educational needs (SEN) a

possible, avoid excluding permanently any pupil with a statement of
SEN.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1403059000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/text/140304w0003.htm#1403059000121">In

Hancock:</Member></B> Our approach in Corby and East Northamptonshire
is the same as across the country—apprenticeships are an all age
programme. Outside of apprenticeships, we want to maintain access to
learning for older people and to support this we have introduced
advanced learning loans for those aged 24 and above studying at level 3
and 4, to help meet up-front course fees and remove one of the main
barriers to learning for older people. Community Learning is also an
important part of the wider learning and skills offer, engaging people
who are most disadvantaged and furthest from learning such as older
people. It is funded through an annual budget of £210 million
managed by the Skills Funding Agency and most provision is delivered or
commissioned by local authority providers, further education colleges,
large voluntary organisations and other providers. As part of our plans
for local growth, local enterprise partnerships consider how to drive
growth in their local areas and Northamptonshire Enterprise Partnership
has been working on a number of initiatives designed to support skills
development, including working with business, education providers and
public services to develop a comprehensive skills plan for the county
to meet the needs of employers and
learners.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1403059000024" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/text/140304w0003.htm#1403059000024">Business:

role in operational matters, such as providing advice or support to
individual subpostmasters. However, the Government has committed nearly
£2 billion since 2010 to maintain, modernise, and protect the
Post Office network. This includes funding the Network Transformation
programme that is seeing investment into thousands of branches, helping
subpostmasters to modernise, introduce new operational practices (such
as offering longer opening hours and making better use of their
premises), and to become more sustainable. For branches where Network
Transformation is not a viable option, the Government is providing a
£20 million improvement fund to enable those subpostmasters to
develop and secure their
businesses.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="1403059000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/text/140304w0003.htm#1403059000226"><B><Member PimsId="4793" UID="1403059000766" xid="888" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/text/140304w0003.htm#1403059000766">Daniel

raise an additional £30 million for victims services through
increased motoring fixed penalty notices in 2014. The increases were
implemented in August 2013 and there is no data yet available on how
much has been raised in the financial year 2013-14. It is not possible

is right that offenders, not taxpayers, foot the bill for the damage
offenders cause so in October 2012 the Government increased and
extended the Victim Surcharge to ensure criminals pay for victims'
services, and that they pay more than they used to. These changes,
along with increases to financial penalties including motoring fixed
penalty notices, will help generate up to £50 million
extra a year from offenders for victims’ services. This is in
addition of the £66 million already spent by
Government.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1403059000043" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/text/140304w0003.htm#1403059000043">Electronic

one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world. We have made
changes and proposed further reforms to reduce the cost of legal aid
and to ensure that the legal aid system commands the confidence of the
public. The Government is committed to providing value for money for
the taxpayer and making legal aid sustainable for the

recently announced changes to legal aid funding for judicial review
cases aim to ensure that meritless cases no longer receive taxpayer

Wright:</Member></B> Sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the
courts, within the maximum penalty set by Parliament for the offence.
Since 2010, those who break the law are now more likely to go to
prison, and they go to prison for longer. In 2012, 26% of offenders
convicted of an indictable offence were sentenced to immediate custody
with an average sentence length of 17.0 months compared with 24% of
offenders convicted of an indictable offence in 2010 with an average
custodial sentence length of 16.2 months. This Government is creating a
tough justice system with severe penalties 
<?notus-xml column=805?>available for serious offenders. We have already introduced automatic
life sentences for a second serious sexual or violent offence, and we
have announced plans to end automatic early release for child rapists,
terrorists and all dangerous offenders. Our radical reforms to
rehabilitation will mean for the first time every offender leaving
prison spends at least 12 months under supervision, where currently
around 50,000 are released each year with no statutory support. This
will start to address the scandalous gap that allows our most chaotic
offenders to leave prison with no support or supervision to turn their
lives
around.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1403059000331" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/text/140304w0003.htm#1403059000331">The

accept the verdicts of the courts and it follows that convicted
prisoners have to be treated as being guilty of their offence(s).
However, some allowance is made in the Incentives and Earned Privileges

higher court (appellants). Contrary to the position for other convicted
prisoners, a recognised appellant who does not take part in offending
behaviour programmes will not have that held against them when

of passengers, mail and cargo between land and sea and within maritime
platform groups; movements in support of the Joint Combat Aircraft will
form an element of the total MITL requirement. The Response Force Task

personnel could be called upon to support the delivery of activities
for the common benefit of all participating member states; the
remaining 30% are in managerial or support roles. It would not be
feasible for the UK to estimate the cost of the agency's facilitation
time, which will be depend upon a variety of factors such as the type
of activity and the level of participation from member

service staff, change posts regularly in their career. The need to hand
over to their successors, or other staff in their unit, is built into
the ways of working for each unit, according to the nature of the job,
and is handled at unit level. Retirement is a particular instance of
that, differing only because it is not readily possible to ask further
information after people have left their
service.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2014-03-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_03_04_PT_1/Index/89A105A86AD22F5E7488EDBB528C41D4B02FA254" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="11" cday="Tuesday" cmonth="March" cyear="2014" date="4" day="Tuesday" issue="130" maxparts="1" month="March" part="1" price="5@010c00" printing="daily" session="201314" type="back" volume="576" year="2014"><title col="733">Oral
