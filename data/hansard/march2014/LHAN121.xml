as private secretary to the Viscount Whitelaw; as Establishment

Leader of the House said, we have all become very familiar with Rhodri
Walters reading out the Letters Patent. After a bit of research, I
discovered that I was possibly the first Life Peer whose Letters Patent
he read out when I was introduced in November 2007. I once asked him
whether he could do that blindfolded after all the times he had done
it. He replied that he probably could but would never dare

should also recognise the many different roles that the Reading Clerk
plays. One of Rhodri’s roles was as Clerk of the Overseas
Office, where he helped the first two Lord Speakers build their roles
as the House’s ambassadors overseas. He also helped the House to
deepen its ties with Commonwealth Parliaments and to forge new links
elsewhere, most notably with Russia, having organised a very successful

Laming (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, on behalf of my colleagues in the
Cross-Bench group I associate myself with the warm and very well
deserved tributes already paid to Rhodri Walters. Throughout his career
Rhodri displayed a quite remarkable understanding and knowledge of
Parliament. Among his many responsibilities he was the clerk to a
number of Select Committees. They were far too many to record but I
mention just two of what might be called rather controversial Bills.
The first became the Constitutional Reform Act, which, among other
things, created the role of the Lord Speaker. The second, and more
recent, was the Joint Committee on the draft House of Lords Reform
Bill. Neither task could possibly be described as being
straightforward. The House liked to give Rhodri a real
challenge<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T14:46:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403034000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403034000012">Rhodri

Lord Bishop of Chester:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to associate
these Benches with all the remarks made so far. I think that Rhodri
Walters introduced more than 200 Members into the House, including the
rare distinction of introducing the Archbishop of Canterbury
twice—first as Bishop of Durham and then as Archbishop of
Canterbury. He may have been able to deal with the Letters Patent in
his sleep, except that when a Bishop comes along he is liable to trip
up the Reading Clerk as it is a different form of
words<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T14:49:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403034000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403034000014">Perfectionist
that Rhodri was, three or four weeks ago, when the first of the current
flood of new Bishops arrived, he said to me, with a fallen face,
“I don’t think I have got it quite right”. I do
not think that anyone else had noticed anything other than perfection
because he was a perfectionist—a perfectionist in the
parliamentary choir and in every aspect of his
life<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T14:47:56"></hs_TimeCode>. There was
always a particular resonance between the Bishops and Rhodri because he
is used to looking after bishops as he is a church warden of one of the
parishes here in London. As a good church warden, he forgave us our
sins when we did not do exactly as we were
told.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="1403034000347" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403034000347">Motion

Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, it is for schools to determine how to
respond to the needs of pupils with EAL, including how they support
pupils’ families. We do not hold centrally a figure for the
number of interpreters employed in schools. Local authorities have the
freedom to allocate EAL funding to schools as they see fit. 
<?notus-xml column=1101?>Schools may well choose to spend this on interpreters or on employing
bilingual staff. For example, we know that in 75 local
authorities, primary school pupils with EAL attract between £250
and £750 each. The Government are investing £210 million
per annum in community learning language programmes to support families
with EAL. We are also funding English courses for 24,000 adults with
the lowest levels of English through the £6 million English
language competition. There is no specific duty for schools to teach
English to parents; however, schools have a key role to play in this.
Parents of new pupils at, for instance, Millbank Academy—one of
the primaries up the road, which is in my wife’s
group—where 85% of pupils have EAL, are introduced both to other
parents and a member of staff who speaks their home language, and are

education is of high quality and closely involves all local employers,
which in Germany is sometimes on a compulsory basis. Of course there
are differences between our countries, but there is much we can learn
from them. This has informed our reforms of vocational education and
Professor Alison Wolf’s review. By introducing the tech bacc and
tech levels, reforming apprenticeships and through our UTCs and studio
schools, we are expanding high-quality technical education while at the

Neville-Rolfe (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
that welcome news. We all valued the visit of Chancellor Merkel to
Parliament last Thursday, during which she spoke of competitiveness.
The German education system does a better job for the nation’s
economy and for the less academic partly by ability streaming in
schools with the possibility of switching between streams. This
provides better educational outcomes and a larger, better pool of
talent that can be apprenticed to German business, which is very
actively involved. Can we improve our PISA scores and our business
performance by doing the same in our
schools<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T15:13:35"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Nash:</Member></B> My noble friend is quite right that the PISA results
were a stark wake-up call for all of us about the need to improve our
education system across the board in order to compete internationally.
In comparison with Germany, we do particularly badly on maths and
science. To achieve improvements, we are continuing to introduce a
whole suite of reforms, as noble Lords know. As for streaming, we
believe that all pupils need a core body of knowledge and indeed I
understand that Germany is now extending the period during which their
pupils have this. However, there is much that we can learn from
Germany. Our UTCs and studio schools, of which we have now approved
almost 100, are modelled closely on the success of German technical
schools, as are our higher apprenticeships.</hs_para>

Could we not emulate Germany in another way by recognising vocational
qualifications such as apprenticeships? Apprenticeships are celebrated
in Germany very much like graduate degrees are celebrated in this
country. For instance, engineers who have come up through an
apprenticeship route are held in much esteem, much more than they are
in this country. What can we do to make sure that we emulate

1 provides for a new section to go into the 1999 Immigration and Asylum
Act for the removal of persons unlawfully in the United Kingdom. It
replaces the current Section 10 of that Act, which is headed,
“Removal of certain persons”. That change is significant,
and the new section would certainly give rather broader powers.
Amendment 1, my first amendment, would require the Secretary of State
to give notice of the removal, which should be in writing and give the
date and time of the removal. At this stage, at any rate, I have
referred to this as the “approximate” time in order to
anticipate, and therefore not waste time on, an argument that a plane
might be delayed. Talking about time without qualifying it was
therefore inappropriate—that is not of course the point of

4 is about notice to a family member, which new Section 10(6)(c) in

unlawfully here, which is a different argument, but about who is to be

intention in Clause 1 is very simple: to simplify processes for
removing people who are in the United Kingdom unlawfully and provide
for removal of members of the person’s family, which provides a
new Section 10 to the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The
question of which member of an individual’s family can be
removed following the removal or planned removal of an individual is to
be decided in accordance with a number of policies. For example, a
family member who has been a victim of domestic violence in accordance
with the definition in the Immigration Rules will not be removed.
Similarly, a member who is no longer in a family relationship will not
be removed. There will undoubtedly be debate in your Lordships’
House about who can and cannot be removed under these provisions. Of
course, the Government have stated that removals will be in accordance
with existing immigration law and our international
obligations.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1403034000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403034000216">3.30

Government have stated that family members will always be notified if

ask why the Bill contains a provision enabling the Secretary of State

provide for circumstances in which notice would not be given. Going by

about when a person is considered to be a member of a family. That
power is delegated under new subsection (6) to the Secretary of State.
The committee’s report notes that the Government “have
helpfully produced” the draft regulations to which the noble
Baroness, Lady Hamwee, referred, and that they contain a definition of
family members for the purpose of Section 10 of the Immigration and
Asylum Act. It is the view of the committee that is
“inappropriate” to delegate the power to define a family
member in these circumstances. No case has been made to exclude from
the Bill this very important provision. I therefore ask your Lordships
to consider very seriously the report by the DPRRC and to contemplate

undue haste is rarely in the interests of fairness, especially when

not helpful. What if someone is unwell or on holiday? I can hear those
responsible having no answer to make other than, “'Tough

given adequate notice. The amendment in the name of the 
<?notus-xml column=1112?>noble Lord, Lord Avebury, would have it that the date of removal was
given at that point. This is perhaps better than receiving a letter
simply saying that you are liable to removal, although either makes it
clear that preparations must be made, which is better all round. Of
course, some will say that giving notice gives the opportunity to
abscond, but, on balance, it is more humane to give notice. The

document called <I>Outsourcing Abuse</I>, which referred to 78 cases
where injuries or death had been inflicted on people who were being
removed forcibly from this country. I was then a commissioner on the
Independent Asylum Commission, which made some far-reaching
recommendations about the whole process. In December 2012, I handed the

I should like to inform the House about the content of that document,
which is really three codes of practice. The first is all about the
actual conduct and the preparation of the case. It refers to duties of
the Home Office, which we suggested should establish a complex returns
panel to deal with single returnees who refuse either a voluntary or an
assisted return in the same way that the Independent Family Returns
Panel deals with families. I am very glad that Amendments 4, 5, 6 and 7
deal particularly with the families, and the Independent Family Returns
Panel has been a qualified success ever since it was appointed.
However, I do not think that that is good enough for

single people, some of whom have very complex cases indeed.</hs_para>

document also refers to a group of people who have suffered from
totally inadequate supervision and direction for years: the case owners
in the Home Office. Frankly, I reckon they are both inefficient and
incompetent. I do not reckon that they have ever truthfully told
Ministers exactly what has gone on. That has meant that Ministers have
not been in possession of the facts. Therefore, we put in the code of
practice a lot of things that must be done to oversee the case owners
and make certain that they are competent to carry out their task,
including having a detailed understanding of immigration
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403034000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403034000110">Then
we come to staff in the immigration detention centre, because that is
where the returnee is based. Frequently, the detention centre staff
know quite a lot about the person being returned which is not passed on
to the case owner and is therefore never taken into account. That
causes some of the problems in returns. We believe that immigration
detention centre staff must be brought into the
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403034000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403034000111">Finally
come the contractors—the people who provide the detention
custody officers taking the person back. Again, this is a sadly
neglected part of oversight at present. The contractors have behaved
appallingly badly, in public and in front of the Chief Inspector of
Prisons when he was accompanying a flight. That they are prepared to do
that in front of him suggests that for years they have got away
with—literally—murder. It is time that that was stopped.
We suggest what must happen to
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403034000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403034000112">The
next part of the thing is oversight. We believe that the Home Office
must establish a clearer description and direction of oversight. It has
the ideal person to do that in the Independent Chief Inspector of
Borders and Immigration. I have met the chief inspector on a number of
occasions and know that he is very keen to improve on what he has done
already. The difference he has made since he was appointed in 2007 is
enormously marked, as I note from when I was Chief Inspector of Prisons
and responsible for doing detention centres. If he is given oversight
over the process, particularly the practicalities of it, Ministers will
find that a lot of the problems that currently appear and are listed
under their names will disappear because somebody is responsible and
accountable for making certain that those problems do not
arise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403034000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403034000113">I
will not speak to the final part of the code of practice at this moment
because it refers to the use of restraint, which comes under Clause 2
and Schedule 1. However, my purpose in all this is that underlying
everything that has gone on for far too long in the whole conduct of
immigration has been what we described in the Independent Asylum
Commission as a “culture of disbelief”. It is time that
that was eliminated. I find very worrying at the moment that, although
the UK Border Agency has been eliminated, I do not detect in the Home
Office the leadership of the three silos that have been appointed to
take over those jobs. The intentions of this Bill will be achieved only
with 
<?notus-xml column=1114?>leadership and drive of the whole process, starting with a determined

Lister of Burtersett (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I hesitate to follow
such a powerful speech and will speak only briefly because important
points have already been raised about the amendments. Briefly, I
support Amendments 5, 6 and 7, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady
O’Loan, on behalf of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. As she
pointed out, in their response to our eighth report—our first
legislative scrutiny report on this Bill—the Government said
that they would give consideration to the amendments suggested by the
JCHR. That is about as good as it gets: the Government will give
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T15:45:26"></hs_TimeCode>.
They gave away very little indeed in response to our report. We were
optimistic that at least something would have happened on this, but
nothing has happened. The case has been made as to why it is so
important that this provision is placed in the Bill itself. It is not
sufficient for it simply to be in regulations or for there to be the
very welcome ministerial assurance. It should be in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T15:45:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403034000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403034000115">I

removal from her home for detention she was injured. Ten months on she
was still suffering from the injury that she received. Her 16 year-old
daughter—a child with a younger sister of eight years of
age<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T15:46:16"></hs_TimeCode>—spoke

Avebury (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I agree with what my noble friend
has just been saying, particularly about the failure of the Home Office
to deal with the serious criticisms of the case owners that were
referred to earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. The whole point
about disbanding the UKBA and returning these functions to the control
of the Home Office itself was that by common acknowledgement, including
that of the Home Secretary herself, the UKBA had become dysfunctional
and something had to be done. However, what has in fact been done since
it was disbanded is that the case owners are not the same persons who
were making decisions before and were manifestly incapable of doing the
right thing, by reason of the fact that a very large number of the
appeals against their decisions were upheld by the tribunal. It would
be useful if we had an answer to both that question and the noble
Lord’s further question about the consideration of
<I>Outsourcing Abuse</I>, the report to which he referred, which never
had the consideration that I believe it deserved in the Home Office but
is crucial to the future health and efficiency of the people who are
making these fundamental decisions, which affect the lives of so many
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403034000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403034000125">On
these amendments, I agree with the Delegated Powers Committee that the
definition of “family members” must be in the Bill and
limited to those whose leave to enter or remain in the UK is expressly
dependent on the principal’s leave to enter or remain. For
example, a family member who came to the UK for work or study, not as
the dependant of the principal, should not be included in the
definition. That seems to be the effect of Regulation 3 of the draft
Immigration (Removal of Family Members) Regulations 2014 but, as has
been said, it should be in the Bill. As the Delegated Powers Committee
found, the justification for placing both this and the time limits for
removal in 
<?notus-xml column=1116?>secondary legislation—that they may have to be amended from time
to time—is not borne out by experience over many years and
through a good many immigration
Acts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403034000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403034000126">Draft
Regulation 4 has the same effect as Section 10(1)(c) of the
1999 Act, providing that notice has to be given to any family member
who is liable to removal, but the Bill provides only that notice
“may” be given, as my noble friend Lady Hamwee pointed
out in moving the amendment. This is partly covered by our
Amendment 4, but the Minister may wish to consider placing
the obligation to give notice firmly in the Bill. As ILPA makes clear
in its briefing, quoting the noble and learned Lord, Lord Steyn, giving
notice is vital for the legality of the decision to remove a person so
as to give him the opportunity of challenging the decision before the
courts. The Secretary of State’s attempt to remove certain
persons without notice has been ruled unlawful by the High Court and
the Court of Appeal. In short, the powers and safeguards dealing with
the identification of family members who may be removed, the question
of when the powers may be exercised and the notice to be given should
all be in the Bill, as should the provisions of Section 10(5) of the
1999 Act, providing that removal directions should cease to have effect
against a person who ceases to be a family
member.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-03-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_03_03_PT_1/83AE53456A29A601EF1434106CF288B4AA9B9BAD" __version__="1.10"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 March 2014">Monday,

have Amendments 2 and 8 in this group. Amendment 2 is not
dissimilar to that moved by the noble Baroness,
Lady Hamwee, and provides that a person should be
given written notice of their liability for removal. According to the
Government, there are approximately 14,000 enforced removals a year,
with people being arrested, detained and then removed, and about
29,000 people depart voluntarily to a greater or lesser
degree. Apparently, an enforced removal costs about
£15,000.</hs_para>

Immigration Act 1971 requires written notice of decisions to give,
refuse or vary leave to be in the United Kingdom. Currently, migrants
are told if they are not allowed to be here, and they are then told
separately about their removal. Under the Bill, the Government want to
be in a position to serve only one decision that gives, refuses or
varies leaves and, following that decision, where notice has been
given, those who do not have leave to remain will be subject to removal
without a separate removal decision or notice being required. It seems
that the notice giving the decision on leave to remain will tell the
immigrant of their destination for removal, advise them to seek early
legal advice and place them under a duty to raise any asylum, human
rights or European free movement issues with the Home Office. It is not
clear why this is not stated in the Bill. No doubt the Minister will
explain why and indicate what else will be required to be included in
this decision notice. Apparently, the decision notice will be issued at
least 72 hours before 
<?notus-xml column=1117?>any removal is attempted, which is in line with the amount of notice
given currently when a removal decision notice is issued. Will the
decision notice make clear the individual’s liability to
removal, and will it state when, where and how that removal will take
place? I look to the Minister to give a response to that question when
he replies. Will the minimum 72 hours apply to family members? The

hope the Minister will respond to that question. Included in the
decision notice will be options for voluntary departure and the
consequences of not so departing. Will the Minister say what the
consequences of not departing voluntarily will be that will be set out

financial reasons appear in part to be behind the provisions in Clause
1, will the Minister say what the Government anticipate those savings
will be and what impact the change to not having a separate removal
notice will have on the number of enforced removals and on the number
of people departing voluntarily? Perhaps he will also say what impact
the Government expect the change to having no separate removal notice
will have on the net migration figure each year, since one assumes that
one key purpose of the Bill, as far as the Government are concerned, is
to have an impact on that overall figure. It seems unlikely that the
current system will be strengthened if the time gap between an
individual receiving notice that they do not have leave to be in the
United Kingdom and the time they are removed if they do not leave
voluntarily is longer than under the current arrangements, under which
a separate notice of removal decision is issued. Will the Minister say
how long it currently takes, on average, for an
attempt to be made to remove a person following a refusal to grant or
vary leave being made, how long it takes following the removal decision
being sent, and how long the Government intend it should take under the
proposed arrangements with only one decision notice being issued in the
light of the intention that a decision notice will be issued at least
72 hours before a removal is attempted?</hs_para>

8 provides that the regulations that the Secretary of Sate can make

case in respect of regulation under Clause 1(6), which would not be

of State to enable regulations that, in effect, define who should be
considered a “family member” and the period during which
they may be removed. Surely legislation should be clear about the
people who are subject to the powers it contains. The Secretary of

committee said that it found it difficult to understand why operational
experience should have any effect on who is to be treated as a family

considered the delegation of the power to define a family member to be
inappropriate, but accepted that it was appropriate for
other matters relating to the removal of family members to be set out
in regulations, particularly procedural matters relating to the
exercise of the power of removal. However, since the powers in this

wide and general terms, the committee recommended that the

parliamentary procedures in respect of various order and
decision-making powers provided for in the Bill. It already specifies
that any power to make an order or regulations is exercisable by
statutory instrument and that, for this particular power, it is under
the normal process of negative rather than affirmative procedure. The
draft affirmative procedure is normally reserved for those orders or
regulations that amend or repeal primary legislation, or develop policy
in a way to require significant parliamentary debate, or where the
intention behind the power to make them is not clearly set out in the

Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee referred to the
Government’s argument that these matters are best placed in
regulations because the definition of “family member” or
the time limits for removal may change within a limited extent. It
commented that this purported justification is undermined by no such
change having been needed over a period of very many years during which
there have been 
<?notus-xml column=1121?>numerous immigration Acts and a litany of immigration rules changes.
Since the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, subject to
what the Minister may say, appears to have shot the Government’s
arguments to bits, why is the Minister still resisting ensuring that

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> I think that I have made it clear that
the affirmative process is used where there is an opportunity for the
Government, in effect, to change policy through a statutory instrument,
which then gives rise to a reasonable demand by Parliament for the
opportunity to debate the measure. As I have said, we are going to
bring forward more explicit changes to the Bill to reflect the concerns
shown by the comments of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. It would probably be
best if we waited until then to see what they say before we rush to
change the procedure by which these matters have been considered in the
past. It would be helpful to the House to wait until these changes are
produced.</hs_para>

critique of what happens in practice from someone experienced as an
inspector has clearly resonated around the House. We have already
talked during the passage of the Bill—and I am sure we will talk
again—about the importance of practice. Whatever is on paper,
whether in the Bill or in regulations, is a precaution against bad
practice, but it is the good practice that is important. Given the
Minister’s assurances about coming back at the next stage, more
formally we hope, with responses in the form of amendments to the
comments of two committees, it would obviously be inappropriate for me
to spend very long at this stage responding to the points that have
been made. However, I will say that, like others, I read between the
lines: three days does not seem very long in which to decide what to do
about a decision that has been handed down and to make arrangements.

process was established in March 2011 after extensive consultation
across government and with a wide range of children’s experts.
It ensures that families with no right to be here are given every
opportunity to leave without the need for enforcement action. Where
families do not co-operate, it enables officials to take steps to
ensure that they leave. This may include a short stay in pre-departure
accommodation, but this would be as a last resort and always for the
shortest possible time.</hs_para>

powers derived from immigration legislation are needed to place

Exceptionally, we may also need to hold unaccompanied children: for

restriction will ensure that these families will always have an
opportunity to consider their options and avoid enforced return. We

scooping up a child and putting them straight on a plane out of the
country. The care that is given and the thought that goes into the

in the right direction, but the one anxiety I have is that it still
leaves matters very much in terms of systems and the responsibilities
for ensuring systems are running properly. If we put ourselves in the
position of the unaccompanied child, who may be going through all sorts
of mental turmoil and agony—bewildered, uncertain and
desperately in need of friendship and help—it would be good to
hear a little about the Government’s thinking on how these real
psychological, and consequently very often physical, needs of the young
person are being dealt with. We have debated the policy in this Bill in
previous years and, ideally, the child in this situation needs a
personal champion, who is there throughout the process, advising,
talking to and consulting them—if you like, a counsellor, who is
there to enable the child to make sense of what is happening and being
proposed and to enable the child to start developing his or her own
views about what they really want to take

Avebury:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments, which are all
concerned with the detention and removal of children, either on their
own or as part of families, are a reflection of existing government
policy, which, in the absence of these amendments, could be reversed
without parliamentary oversight, as the Home Secretary 
<?notus-xml column=1128?>observes in her <I>Factsheet</I><I>:</I><I> </I><I>Ending the Detention
of Children for Immigration Purposes</I>, issued last month. In fact,
children are still to be detained, but in places described as
“pre-departure accommodation”. The only place identified
as such so far is, as has been mentioned, Cedars near Heathrow, which
has hitherto been included in the list of short-term holding facilities
to be discussed in the next amendment. It appears to me that holding
children in Cedars is still detention, as I think my noble friend Lady
Hamwee remarked, because the families are still deprived of their
liberty, albeit in far more congenial surroundings than in immigration
removal centres and even though they are no doubt looked after far
better by child-friendly Barnardo’s than the impersonal
money-making subsidiary of Capita that runs the
IRCs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403038000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403038000059">Amendment

but it would be useful if my noble friend could say what statistics
there are on voluntary, as compared with forced, departures up until

when as a committee we visited Yarl’s Wood immigration removal
centre to take evidence. I am interested in the answers to what the
noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked when referring to encouraging voluntary
return and in having some detail about what incentives are being
offered on that. I share his concern about gaining some reassurance
about the independence of the Independent Family Returns Panel, and I
am also interested in what he said about the need for figures on the
detention of unaccompanied children in the

wish at this point—using this as the right place this

change in the safeguarding of children. It was harrowing to visit the
Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre both as a member of the
House of Lords European Union Sub-Committee and on two previous
occasions early in the centre’s existence. Yarl’s Wood
immigration removal centre, which took these families, was based very
much on a category C prison, so it was very familiar to me, having
visited Feltham young offender institution. One would see a mother,
with her young child, coming through the admission room—just
like Feltham, with the barred gate—and what would a child be
thinking, having that experience, walking through this
prison?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403038000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403038000067">I pay
tribute to the first Children’s Commissioner, who produced a
number of important reports, which highlighted, for instance, how in
going from admissions to the family wing there might be seven or eight
separate doors that had to be opened with keys by the warder. There
were important improvements to the 
<?notus-xml column=1130?>regime under the Labour Government. However, towards the very end, as I
said, I met a 16 year-old girl. Can your Lordships imagine what any
girl or young woman would feel who was detained for 10 months, through
no fault of her own or any action that she did wrong, separated from
the pleasure of being with her peers? What can that be like? Of course,
one understands why she was so angry with me and with us for allowing

have had excellent briefings from Barnardo’s, which we know does
so much work for these children. We know that unaccompanied children
have been temporarily admitted to the United Kingdom, but they are not
routinely detained prior to their return. There is concern, and
government assurances have been sought, as to whether this situation
could change in the future. It is worth making sure that unaccompanied
children who are admitted temporarily will not start being routinely
detained<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T16:55:14"></hs_TimeCode>. I
speak as somebody who in their previous role was a councillor in a
local authority which had to deal with a fair number of unaccompanied
children. All councils have responsibility as corporate parents to
those children because they come into their care. My experience of
those children who came into our care was always positive. I remember
attending award ceremonies for children some of whom had come from
worn-torn countries in a vulnerable and traumatised state but had gone
on to become academically so proficient that they gained places in
universities. They had turned their lives around with the right
support. As the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, when these children go
before any panel that is to decide their future, it is important that
councils in their role as corporate parents ensure that they are
properly supported and represented, as any parents would do for their
own children. They should get the right support and advice when it is
being determined whether they remain or are returned, or whatever is
best for their future. I would like an assurance on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T16:56:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403038000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403038000076"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Benjamin" PimsId="5763" UID="1403038000207" xid="2043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403038000207">Baroness
Benjamin (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I always say that childhood lasts
a lifetime, and all children need the best start in life. These
amendments will give these children the best possible start and I
congratulate the Government on putting them forward. I want to raise
just one point on behalf of Barnardo’s—I speak as a
vice-president of that organisation. I congratulate Barnardo’s
on having made an important effort to make sure that all children are
taken care of if they happen to come to this country in unfortunate
circumstances. Although Barnardo’s welcomes the 28-day
reflection period being enshrined in the law, it is concerned about the
drafting of the clause, as it would allow one parent to be returned
within the 28-day period as long as there is another parent to care for
the child. This in effect allows any family to be split and for the
child to be separated from one of their parents, with no restrictions
on the circumstances in which it should happen. Barnardo’s
believes that a child should be separated from their parent against
their will only if it is in the best interest of the child; for
example, if there are safeguarding concerns such as domestic violence.
It wants appropriate safeguards to be put in place to prevent children
being separated from their parents and traumatised in any way. I look
forward to hearing the Minister’s response on this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T16:58:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403038000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403038000077"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Northbourne" PimsId="2138" UID="1403038000208" xid="1110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403038000208">Lord
Northbourne (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am not entirely sure that
this is an appropriate intervention; if not, I apologise and I shall be

can’t cope. We’ve got all these unaccompanied minors
arriving”. Those children came and it got to know them and so
on. The majority of them were absolutely intentionally unaccompanied
immigrants. Having been put on a boat in Calais and told to throw their
passport into the water as they went across, they came into this
country and there was nothing that we could do to change it. Is that

Lords commented on Cedars. I confess that I have not been there; that
is something I maybe ought to do given what has been said about it in
the course of this short debate. My understanding is that it could not
be further in look or feel from an immigration removal centre such as
Yarl’s Wood. It is important to emphasise, again, that families
are held there only as a last report, for only a short period prior to
their return and only after safeguarding advice has been sought from
the independent family returns panel. Since Cedars was established,
Barnardo’s has provided dedicated social work, welfare services
and family support to children and their families there. I echo the
compliments and praise paid to the work of Barnardo’s by a

try and respond to a number of points. First, my noble friend Lord
Avebury asked some questions about numbers. There are published data on
voluntary returns, enforced returns and other outcomes in the family
returns process. I will certainly send those data to my noble friend. I
do not have details as to what the voluntary packages look like but if
I can I will try to set out some of those, too. I think everyone would
agree that if a voluntary arrangement can be made it is 
<?notus-xml column=1133?>a far better outcome, not least for the dignity of the family. However,
published statistics show that, under the old system, 1,119 children
entered detention centres such as Yarl’s Wood in 2009, and 436
in 2010. By contrast, the latest statistics show that in the first
three-quarters of 2013, seven children—at that time believed to
be adults—were held in immigration removal centres and
subsequently released following an age assessment. Some 64 children
have been held briefly at the Tinsley House family unit after being
stopped at the border and 68 children have been held at the new
pre-departure accommodation for very short periods prior to leaving the
United
Kingdom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403038000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403038000082">On
Amendment 9, my noble friend Lady Hamwee asked who a carer is in
proposed new Section 78A(1)(b) and whether that included the local
authority. No, the carer must be someone who has been living with the
child and subject to removal as well. That rules out local authority
carers but captures a situation where, for example, a child is part of
a family unit with an aunt. In those circumstances, the family unit
would benefit from the protection
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403038000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0001.htm#1403038000083">My noble
friends Lady Hamwee and Lady Benjamin raised the possibility of
families being separated during the 28-day reflection period. As I
sought to emphasise when moving the amendment, we will always seek to
ensure that families remain together during the return. However,
temporary separation may sometimes be necessary to safely ensure the
family’s return. We would not separate a family solely for a
compliance reason. It would always be where it was considered
in the best interests of the child to be temporarily
separated from their parent or where the presence of one of the parents
or carers was not conducive to the public good. We would never separate
a child from both adults for immigration purposes, or from one in the
case of a single-parent family, if the consequence of that decision is
that the child would be taken into

the situation regarding the detention of unaccompanied children. I
sought to make clear when moving the amendment that it is possible that
a removal attempt will be unsuccessful for reasons that may be beyond

technical fault. When this happens, we accept that children should not
continue to be held in a short-term holding facility for more than 24
hours. They should be released and given time to rest and recuperate.
But the fact that a removal attempt is unsuccessful should not mean
that such people are automatically entitled to stay in the UK. It
should still be possible to enforce immigration decisions. It may
therefore be necessary, after a suitable period, to attempt removal
again and this may require a further, short, period of

of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, relates to
holding unaccompanied children who arrive at the border. Where a child
is travelling alone or is identified as a potential victim of

arrange for them to be taken into the care of local children’s
services. I do not have figures as to how often this has happened, but
all border force officers are given training on trafficking and child
protection, so they know what to look out for. To support this we use a
system of risk profiles, alerts, and intelligence tools to give
officers the information they need to intervene in cases of suspected

Local authorities have a statutory duty to ensure that they safeguard
and promote the welfare of children under Section 11 of the Children

Lord’s point and I think I understand what lies behind it. I was
trying to make a point about what our view has been. We should probably
also recognise that unaccompanied children may arise in a number of
different circumstances. For example, as I was indicating, some might
potentially be the victims of child trafficking, which might raise a
different set of considerations from others. If a professional team has
already been involved in a case, we would not want to cut across that
by bringing in someone new at that stage. I recognise the importance of
what the noble Lord is saying; I will reflect on it and if there is
more that I can add to the answer that I have given, I will write to

centres and for short-term holding facilities by the Chief Inspector of
Prisons, whose remit extends well beyond that of the convention to
detainee welfare, the need for a decent and respectful approach to
detainees by staff and the physical conditions of detention. In the
case of the IRCs, there are detailed rules governing such matters as
welfare and privileges, religion, communications, healthcare, requests

since 1999, to publish an equivalent set of rules for short-term

there was a consultation on them, but a final version was not presented

given by the Minister in the previous debate when he was talking solely
about children being detained in the IRCs. Unfortunately, none of the
accommodation at the Heathrow terminals, Cayley House or the Cedars is
residential, so detainees who are held overnight either have to sit up
in hard chairs or be taken to Tinsley House near Gatwick and back
again, a journey that can take the best part of two hours, depending on
the time of day. The Cedars pre-departure family STHF near Heathrow is
high-standard but little used, and I wonder whether it might be
upgraded for overnight stays. I estimate that last year some 2,600
people were held at Heathrow for more than 12 hours, and it is

this wonderful amendment with its mover. What is going on here? This
makes sense to me. There are detention centre rules which govern
immigration removal centres, but the short-term holding facilities in
airports, as has already been mentioned, are very different. In some of
them—for example, Pennine House in Manchester where, sadly, a
Pakistani man died last July—people can be held for up to seven
days. There need to be published rules to provide a sound governance
structure. Without that, we will not be

People can be held at times of great personal and familial stress. The

activities, discipline and control of detained persons. Who would argue

moved by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. When I took over as Chief
Inspector of Prisons and was given the responsibility for immigration
detention centres, I was horrified to find that all of them were geared
only for the short term and had no long-term arrangements for people
who were there for a long time. When I went into it, I discovered that
the reason for this was the lack of direction from the Home Office.
There was at that stage the Immigration and Nationality Directorate,
which was meant to be running the centres, and they were all let out on
contract, but there was no overall drive, no direction.</hs_para>

years, let alone months—are not geared to look after their needs
in any more than the short term, about which I asked last October and

years to a number of interested parties, including Her Majesty’s

UK’s detention facilities. The delay in introducing these rules
is regretted, but it has been a case of unavoidable delay being caused
by a number of different reasons, including, most recently, the
discussions surrounding the legislative framework that should apply to
Cedars, which we have just discussed, which initially had been

oversight by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, the
Independent Police Complaints Commission and Her Majesty’s
Inspector of Prisons. The powers introduced by Schedule 1 include
escorting and searching detained persons and entering and searching
premises. There is also provision for a wider interpretation of the
general power to use reasonable force compared with that in previous
immigration Acts, and the schedule increases the powers of immigration
officers, including with regard to the power to use reasonable
force.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030326000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030326000002">This is
an important issue, not least in the light of the inquest into death of
Jimmy Mubenga in late 2010, following the restraint used as part of his
deportation undertaken by a private sector company. In that case, the
coroner determined that the cause of Mr Mubenga’s death was an
unlawful killing under existing provisions of immigration law. The
coroner highlighted several areas of concern, including lack of
training in scenario planning in relation to the use of force by
private sector companies, dangerous restraint techniques being used at
that time and a lack of accreditation of particular officers.</hs_para>

extends the powers regarding the use of reasonable force to previous
immigration Acts and gives additional powers to immigration officers on
escort, search and entry, we need at the very least some assurances

given to police officers. We also need assurances that these increased
enforcement powers will be subject to proper

interpret as they see fit how and when to use the considerably enhanced

affected to produce its own definition of reasonable force and the

Borders and Immigration of enforcement powers, such as searching

Lord Ramsbotham, when he was Inspector of Prisons, and calls on an old
tradition that rules will be enforced and kept in respect of the Prison
Service, with a long and remarkable record among prison officers in
terms of these expectations. I was a Minister of State in charge of
prisons for a while and I was impressed by the level of responsibility
shown, particularly by prison officers who had worked in prisons for a
period of time. They often had a strong sense of responsibility for
those with whom they worked, who were held in prisons in the ordinary
criminal justice system. There has been nothing like the same level of

have already been discussed and I will not return to them, but I will
say very loudly that they show how remarkably a concerned and
responsible Minister can alter the culture and attitudes of those for

The problem, quite 
<?notus-xml column=1143?>simply, is that the Home Office has not had that oversight, particularly
in respect of the outsourcing of responsibility for people
who are detained or who are held under the immigration provisions of
many earlier Acts. That is only too clear in the complaints and
concerns that arise over the handling and management of that
estate. We are grateful for Amendments 9 and 10. They are very detailed
and have been carefully worked out. However, I repeat the question of
the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, about whether there is any training for
immigration officers who now have the responsibility for enforcement. I
will go further and ask whether the Home Office writes into its
contracts with the private companies to which it extends the right to
run these establishments a specific requirement that the practices that
we hope to be embodied in the code will be upheld. Does it hold them
responsible for reporting on any breaches of those rules and codes of
practice? Does it hold them responsible for any accidents, injuries or
deaths that occur in the establishments for which they are responsible?
If the number of those is seen to be unusually high or if they are
inexplicable, will real consideration be given to withdrawing the
contracts as soon as possible? The contracts should clearly indicate
that they are conditional on the proper running of those

the person has done what he honestly or instinctively thought was
necessary in all the circumstances, and no more, that would be good
evidence that he has acted reasonably and lawfully. Force must never be
used as a punishment to intentionally cause pain, injury or
humiliation. Fourthly, use of force must also be
“accountable”; one must always be prepared to account for
any force used. Force should be used only as a last resort, and one
must be able to demonstrate that this was the case.</hs_para>

Avebury:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to say a word or two in support
of the amendment. Currently, the use of force by an immigration officer
is licensed under the Immigration Act 1971 and the Immigration and
Asylum Act 1999. Paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 amends this to license the
use of force under eight other Acts passed since 1971, and any future
legislation that may be included in the definition of “the
Immigration Acts”. The Explanatory Notes wrongly claim that this
“clarifies” that the power is not limited to the exercise
of powers under the 1971 and 1999 Acts, which would 
<?notus-xml column=1145?>mean that the power already exists. In fact, the use of force under any

via Cedars. The former Immigration Minister gave an assurance that the
power to use force was confined to immigration officers as distinct
from workers employed by private contractors on detention and removal

than just the specific powers of arrest, search and entry given in the

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My noble friend Lady Williams of
Crosby and the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York joined the
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, in raising the question of the
effectiveness of quality control in terms of outcomes, how we enforce
contracts, and whether we hold contractors responsible. We do exactly
that. We have contract monitoring teams at each detention facility and
individual detention and escort contractors are certified by the
Secretary of State, and this certification can be withdrawn. As the
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, will know, a new training programme is
being undertaken by the Home Office in this area. I have invited him to
come along and look at the programme and perhaps contribute to its
development because we feel it is very important that at the heart of
good practice in this area lies oversight on the one hand, good
management on the other and, at the bottom of all of that, good
training for the operatives. I think it would be the wish of the House
and, indeed, the Home Office that that is provided for. My noble friend
Lady Benjamin asked if there was particular training given to officers
on medical conditions. I am not in a position to give that answer on
the spot but I am happy to write to her.</hs_para>

We should make it clear that the provision to extend the use of force
affects only immigration officers and does not make any change to the
powers of contractors, those detainee custody officers and escorts, who
have separate statutory powers to use reasonable force in their
functions. We believe that immigration officers should be able to use
their powers to the fullest extent, where it is necessary. If paragraph
5 were to be removed, it would not affect the majority of immigration
powers of examination, arrest, entry, search, detention and
fingerprinting, where officers are able to use reasonable force if
necessary, as most of these are contained within the Immigration Act
1971 and the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, as my noble friend Lord
Avebury pointed out.</hs_para>

small number of coercive powers, which sit in later legislation, where
there is no specific reference to the use of reasonable force. Although
the use of force is currently implied, we intend that this should be
set out explicitly in statute to ensure greater transparency. The use
of force in these situations may be necessary for immigration officers
to carry out their role effectively and safely, and I have given
illustrations of that earlier in my response. I am sure noble Lords
will agree that it would be hard to see, for example, how immigration
officers could safely arrest a person for the offence of assaulting an
immigration officer if they were unable to use reasonable force to
restrain that person. It should be noted that the new enforcement
powers proposed in the Bill make amendments to either the Immigration
Act 1971 or 
<?notus-xml column=1150?>the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, so will already be covered by the
existing provision for immigration officers to use reasonable force
where
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030326000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030326000043">I
can assure noble Lords that only immigration officers who are fully
trained and accredited may use force. Arrest training is currently
provided by the College of Policing, and training on the use of force,
including control and restraint techniques, is in line with ACPO
standards. Published guidance explains that the use of force must be
proportionate, lawful, necessary, and age appropriate. It also sets out
that force should be used for the shortest possible period, be the
minimum needed, used only when all other avenues of securing
co-operation have been exhausted, and de-escalated as soon as
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030326000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030326000044">Every
instance where force is used is recorded in a comprehensive incident
report. Out of 14,598 enforcement visits in the financial year 2012-13,
force against the person was used in a little over 2% of cases. The
issue of whether that use of force was reasonable must be justified on
a case-by-case basis, as I have been explaining to my noble friend Lord
Mawhinney. The extension of the power to use reasonable force will
ensure that existing powers are able to be operated effectively, are in
step with other law enforcement bodies’ powers, and that current
enforcement practices are not at any risk of legal challenge on the
grounds that the ability to use force is not explicitly set out in
statute. Now I hope that I have been able to explain the context in
which these provisions of the Bill are being proposed. In the light of
these points, I hope that noble Lords will be reassured and feel able
not to press their
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T18:06:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of practice will see the light of day in any schedule to the Bill or
whether it simply—I do not use the word “simply”
in a derogatory way—means that the Minister intends that the
Home Office may take account of what is in that code of practice in the
practices that the Home Office seeks to ensure are adopted. I think the
answer I have had is the latter rather than the former. That is what
the Minister’s 
<?notus-xml column=1151?>response indicates. As I understand it, the Minister said in his reply
that the oversight powers throughout the United Kingdom are already
there through the relevant postholder or commission. I think he has
said that the extension of powers under Schedule 1 apply only to
immigration officers and not to private contractors, and that
appropriate training is or will be given in relation to the extension
of the powers on reasonable force. That is what I have understood from
the replies the Minister has given.</hs_para>

Hamwee:</Member></B> In moving Amendment 16 I shall speak also to
Amendments 20 and 21, and included in this group are Amendments 17, 18
and 19. The first of the amendments sets out a new clause headed,
“Presumption of liberty”, which covers exactly what it
says. I find the term “bail” quite difficult in this
context, with its connotations of the criminal justice system.
Detention—or imprisonment, to be blunt about it—should
require a positive decision: the rebuttal of a presumption, if you
like<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T18:12:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Minister will not argue that this is invariably followed because, like
other noble Lords, I am sure, I have been given a number of examples of
detention where it would be hard to argue that that is so. We are told
that the UK detains people for longer than any other European country.
As of July last year, 27 people had been detained for between 18 and
24 months, 11 for between 24 and 36 months and one person
for up to 48 months. In December last year, some 220 people had been

I say “inappropriate detention” as being what might be

and breaches their Article 3 rights. I do not doubt that there will

continued solely because of mental illness. No doubt when the provision
was designed it was about protection, but it now seems to assume a
rather rosy view of the benefits of detention that is very far from the
reality. While hindsight is a great thing, of course, I see no
justification for keeping someone in detention on the grounds of their
mental health where, were it not for mental illness, the applicant
would be released. This is a matter which has been considered from time
to time by the courts, and there is a framework for the detention of
mentally ill people in the Mental Health Act 1983, where it is
necessary in their interests or for the protection of others. This
surely must apply to those who are under immigration control just as
much as it does to other
people<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T18:16:54"></hs_TimeCode>.

about new subjects when one starts on a Bill. There is in addition a
lacuna in the legislation. Currently there is no power to make a
transfer direction using Section 48 of the 1983 Act for immigration
detainees held under the UK Borders Act 2007. The power
compulsorily to admit such detainees to hospital exists only under
Sections 2 or 3 of the 1983 Act. There is a power under Section 48 of
that Act to transfer people detained under immigration powers other
than Section 36 of the UK Borders Act 2007. The power arises
where there is an urgent need for treatment. The lacuna which I have
mentioned in Section 48 of the 1983 Act has been raised with the border
agency by various NGOs, and the agency’s position is that in its
view the lacuna, which it admits to and acknowledges, cannot be fixed
quickly as it would require primary legislation. Here we have primary

the clause and reading the debates that took place in the other place,

examples. That is one that came to mind, as well as primary care givers
for young children or where somebody is dying. I appreciate that the
pregnancy one is a narrow example. I am trying to understand how the

or make any difference at all. For example, I should have thought that

are exceptional circumstances in which bail should be granted.
Therefore, I am still somewhat confused about whether the Home
Secretary will take into account matters other than those considered by
the tribunal and the immigration judge. Norman Baker says that she will
not, but that raises the question about the evidence base for this
change. From the response of Norman Baker in Committee in the other

decision in overruling the immigration judge. There must be a concern

some circumstances that may have been a decision where the Home
Secretary has overruled the immigration judge who has said that there
are exceptional circumstances? Will the applicant know what the process
is in that case? If, as Norman Baker has said, no new factors will be
taken into account, the question will be whether the decision has been
taken on the facts, or whether it has been taken on political grounds.

these amendments, we propose automatic bail hearings after eight and 36
days. How long have we debated the need to provide for an effective
automatic review of detention? Detention under Immigration Act powers
is a matter, I am told, mainly of administrative convenience and, in
the UK, is not subject to a maximum period. A detained person is not
brought before a tribunal judge or a court unless he or she instigates
this. The lack of any maximum period of detention, combined with the
lack of regular and independent review of detention, may render this
detention arbitrary. Amnesty International is one of those
organisations that has powerfully advocated that every immigration
detention decision should be automatically checked to see whether it is
lawful, necessary and appropriate. Why should we do this? Because, at
present, there are greater safeguards for criminal subjects than there
are for immigration detainees and because people sometimes need
reminding that those detained for immigration purposes are not
criminals and have not committed any

alongside the general length of immigration detention in the UK, and
the possible indefinite nature of that detention, adequate bail
provision is an absolute necessity. Automatic hearings would benefit
all detainees but especially vulnerable and isolated detainees. Very

Harries of Pentregarth (CB):</Member></B> I, too, will speak to
Amendment 17. When I was the Bishop of Oxford, I had something to do
with Campsfield House. What really concerned us at that time was the
length of time for which people were held in detention. It is not at
all encouraging that, some years later, this is still a major 
<?notus-xml column=1159?>concern. As we know, around 220 people last year were held in detention
for more than six months, without even taking into account the 936 who
are held in prison. Why is this country so different from the rest of
Europe in having no limit on the length of time that people can spend
in detention? It is obvious, from so many of the facts and figures that
are put before us, that a time limit helps you to achieve your purpose
of removing people who have no legal right to be in the country.
France, for example, has a time limit of 45 days for people
in detention and it enforces 31% more removals of irregular immigrants
and asylum seekers than the United Kingdom. We all know that if you do
not have a deadline, things can slip and slip. Those of us who write
are grateful that there is always a deadline, otherwise we would never
get it done. If that applies with simple things such as writing, how
much more are things liable to slip when trying to deal with a
person’s

reiterate the point, it has also been shown that the longer people are
held in detention, the less chance they will be removed. Only 37% of
those who were detained for more than a year were eventually removed,
compared with 57% of those who were there for less than 28 days. Again,
so many facts show that having a limit, such as 28 days, allows you to
achieve what you want far more efficiently. That is, of course, without
even taking into account the expense. It has been estimated that this
amendment would save something like £87 million if it were
accepted, because it is very expensive to keep people in
detention<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T18:36:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030331000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030331000027">There
are alternatives. In Australia, for example, where there is an
alternative based on case management, there is a compliance rate of

without taking into account the human factor and the distress and extra
suffering caused by allowing people to be detained. From the point of

Hope of Craighead:</Member></B> My Lords, I support these amendments. I
should explain that at an earlier stage in my judicial career it was
necessary for me to visit prisons so that I could see the conditions
under which people were being held and understand the regimes that were
being operated in these establishments. I recall very clearly visiting
one of these places, where I came across people of the kind we are
discussing this evening—detainees awaiting decisions about their
immigration status. It struck me at the time that it was quite
extraordinary to meet these individuals—who, after all, had
either committed no offence or, if they had, had served their
sentences—being held in prison conditions along with other
prisoners. It is fair to say that a separate wing was set aside for
them; nevertheless, the conditions in which they were being held were
prison conditions. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said that it was a
dreadful situation. I must say that I found it quite offensive to meet
these people there when I spoke to them and discovered why they were
there and what their problems
were.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030331000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030331000029">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T18:39:27"></hs_TimeCode>
seems that there is a great deal of force in Amendment 16, tabled by
the noble Baroness, about 
<?notus-xml column=1160?>the presumption of liberty, which takes us right back to the beginning
of the exercise we are discussing. The points that are built into that
amendment are those that would occur to any judge considering an
application for bail in this situation. Most judges would, I think, see
that the question to ask oneself is whether the individual would fail
to comply with conditions or was likely to commit an offence. The value
of having that set out in the Bill is that it will achieve some uniform
standard throughout the system. The difficulty is that you have
immigration officers and First-tier Tribunals up and down the country,
and there will not be the same attention, uniformity of practice,
application of presumptions and so on that one gets if the matter is
set out in terms in the Bill. I would have thought that the matter was
sufficiently important to do that, so that it would carry itself
through the various steps that have been discussed by other noble
Lords, with everybody knowing where they
stand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030331000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030331000030">We

not to process that deportation while those people are serving their

they go from prison into a detention centre and then the deportation
process starts. That is causing an intense clogging in the detention
centres. Having disaffected prisoners awaiting deportation in a
detention centre also causes unrest in the centre, which was the case
at
Campsfield.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14030331000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030331000069">6.45

Judd:</Member></B> My Lords, last Thursday in the Moses Room we were
debating terrorism. In the context of that debate some of us were
raising the issues of immigration. This is a specific and good example
of the danger that some of us foresee. Forgive me if I repeat a bit of
what I said on Thursday. Extremists 
<?notus-xml column=1162?>operate best in a climate of ambivalence, one in which a significant
number of people—particularly young people but not only young
people—are pursued by doubt. They may not like what the
extremists do. They may actually abhor the actions themselves, but they
sometimes wonder whether those extremists are perhaps acting on their
side.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030331000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030331000044">This
does not create a climate in which everyone is busting a gut to
co-operate with the security services. There are anxieties and doubts.
Ruthless recruiters for extremism play on that kind of ambivalence. I
can think of no area such as the one that we are debating that
illustrates better the point that I am making. If it can be said that
we have double standards of justice and that we do not live up to the
ideals that we like to proclaim to the world as essential, and if it
seems that freedom is not a complete but a relative
principle—something that you like to apply when you can and when
it is inconvenient you do not apply it—sometimes very
intelligent people begin to raise queries. It does not take many people
to be in such a state of anxiety and doubt for the extremists to make
more recruits. It takes only a very few people in the age in which we
live to do terrible things in the context of terrorist action. If we
are going to win the cause of wooing people away from terrorism and
extremism, it is a battle for hearts and minds. That kernel of
toughness should be in all that we do. The battle for hearts and minds
means that we should live up to the principles we proclaim and make
them transparently clear in all the practice of policy throughout the
penal system and, particularly because of the complications of
international terrorism, in the sphere of

deprivation of liberty is a very serious matter so I will first set out
the safeguards that are currently in place to ensure that detention
powers are used appropriately. Although there is a power to detain, the
Home Office has a policy presumption in favour of temporary admission
or release. Wherever possible, alternatives to detention are used.
Detention must be used sparingly and for the shortest period necessary.

Supreme Court in a case called Lumba. The system affords appropriate
protections to individuals and flexibility to the Government. It is not
indefinite detention: every case is carefully and regularly considered
to see whether detention continues to remain appropriate. Regular
reviews of detention are required to be undertaken to ensure that
detention remains lawful and proportionate, and individuals can apply
for bail and challenge the legality of detention by judicial review, as
has been
stated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030336000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030336000003">I

the Committee that where a woman reaches the later stages of pregnancy

An individual can still apply for immigration bail at any time or
challenge the legality of their detention by way of judicial review. A
significant number of individuals are released on bail by the Home
Office without the need for a bail hearing—we have just heard

discretion to maintain detention of those who are suffering from mental

Secondly, the amendments would remove the requirement for repeat

guidance provides that certain categories of people are considered
unsuitable for detention in the first place unless there are very
exceptional circumstances in play. Unaccompanied young people under the
age of 18 and those suffering from serious mental illness which cannot
be satisfactorily managed within detention are specifically listed as
case types that should be detained only in very exceptional
circumstances. However, there will always be cases with very
exceptional circumstances which mean that detention is appropriate. An
example may be when it is necessary for detention to continue while an
individual is being or waiting to be assessed or awaiting transfer
under the Mental Health Act. We may also need to hold unaccompanied
children where, for example, it is in the public interest because of a
risk of reoffending or a risk to national security. They may also be
held for a very short period either on arrival pending collection by
social services or when we are trying to remove them. In any decision

effectively about the impact of detention. I will just mention again
the first of the amendments in this group, which is on the presumption

instinct. Of course, the drafting of the amendment could be tweaked but
we are only at Committee stage. However, subject to reading <I>Hansard

The law provides for that to enable us to address the issue of, for

immigrant—that officer would have either to let the person go if
they did not consent or to arrest them. The Minister went on to say
that the objective was to ensure that the immigration officer would be

that not also apply in the scenario referred to by the Minister in the
Commons debate to which I just referred? Who are the people who
immigration officers would not want to arrest if they declined to allow
their fingerprints to be taken? Presumably the immigration officers
would not just let them go, or is that what the Government say would

of people who would have had their fingerprints taken if the
“liable to be detained” provision in the Bill had been in

wording in the Immigration Act 1971? In other words, how significant a
problem is this, even though I am not entirely sure what the problem
is, and what is the evidence to support the change in legislation that
the Government seek to introduce? “Liable to be detained”

Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 5 amends paragraph 18 of Schedule
2 to the Immigration Act 1971 to include persons who are liable to be
detained. This will allow immigration officers to check the
fingerprints of persons they suspect to be illegal immigrants where
there is a question about their identity. The existing power allows for
fingerprints to be taken only from persons who have been detained under
immigration
powers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030336000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030336000040"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T19:24:57"></hs_TimeCode>The
ability to establish an identity is an essential requirement for
immigration officers when undertaking immigration enforcement
operations. Unless identity is established it is not possible to remove
or deport illegal immigrants. At present, where immigration officers 
<?notus-xml column=1171?>encounter people whom they suspect to be illegal immigrants and have
doubts about their identity, they can check the person’s
fingerprints only with their consent or following the person’s
arrest. In some instances this can lead to unnecessary arrests or
result in illegal immigrants not being
detected<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T19:25:37"></hs_TimeCode>. In
answer to the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, surely the Committee does not
want innocent people going about their lawful business to be
arrested<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T19:25:47"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondly, if the suspect does not appear to understand English, how can
they give informed consent to have their fingerprints taken?</hs_para>

power is intended to reflect the conditions under which the police
operate. Prior to the changes made to the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984 in 2005, the police also needed consent to check fingerprints
where a person had not been arrested. The amendment has enabled the
police to make fingerprint checks without the need to arrest
individuals who are suspected of committing a criminal offence and
whose identity might otherwise not be readily ascertained or
verified.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030336000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030336000042">This<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T19:26:34"></hs_TimeCode>

enforcement powers more into line with police powers. The power to
check fingerprints will be limited to the purpose of verifying identity
as part of an immigration enforcement investigation. The fingerprints
will not be retained but rather immediately electronically checked
against the immigration biometric database. If there is an existing
record, this will confirm the person’s identity and potentially
assist the immigration officer to ascertain the person’s
immigration status. This will help avoid unnecessary arrests, allowing
those legitimately in the UK to go about their business, while quickly
identifying illegal
immigrants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030336000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030336000043">I
want to assure noble Lords that this power does not mean that
immigration officers will be able to stop anyone they encounter. The
person required to provide fingerprints for checking must be liable to

they might be liable for removal from the UK. There will not be any

legislation. The order-making power will allow new types of biometric

was introduced using Section 8(2)(f) of the UK Borders Act 2007, which
allows the Secretary of State to put into regulations additional
purposes for which biometric information might be used. This provision
was introduced by the previous Government. We have placed that measure
in the Bill because it covers an important purpose for which biometric
information is currently used. The measure is intended not to deny
people medical treatment but to identify them so that families may be

already contained in Section 8 of the UK Borders Act, which has proved
useful. As I mentioned, the Secretary of State has already made

to avoid unnecessarily arresting people and to make it easier to carry
out immigration checks. I described a situation where someone cannot

asked what the definition of “liable to be detained” is
and how many cases it will affect. If I have any information about how

there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that removal directions may
be given—that is, that the person requires leave to enter or

Hannay of Chiswick (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 26 covers
ground similar to that covered by an amendment much later in the
proceedings, Amendment 49, which we will not be dealing with tonight.
Amendment 26 is about appeals and seeks to remove from the scope of the
Bill appeals by undergraduate or postgraduate students in full-time
study at a recognised higher education institution.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14030340000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000002">Why am I moving this
amendment? There is much common ground with the Government about the
important role that the higher education sector plays in our economy
and, above all, that our universities play in our economy. It is a
massive benefit to this country. It accounted for £10.1 billion
of invisible exports at the last time of asking, and that figure is
rising and should continue to rise. It is also common ground with the
Government and with those in the university sector—I declare an
interest as I sit on the council of the University of Kent—that
we want to see those student numbers increasing. Last July, the
Government published a strategy for international students, and in it
they foresaw a steady increase in the years ahead. They hoped for some
15% in the next few years.</hs_para>

tangible aspect of the benefits to this country from postgraduate and
undergraduate students, which is called “soft power”.
When they have qualified, these students very frequently go back to
their countries and retain very strong links with this country, often
doing much business with our exporters, and are thus generally very
positive. That is the good
news.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030340000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000004">The bad
news is that the Government’s immigration policy is cumulatively
hamstringing this vital invisible export industry. That is before the
measures in the Bill, several of which are likely to be quite damaging,
have taken effect. This cumulative effect is now under way, and if you
ask me whether these concerns are well founded, the most recent figures
produced by the Higher Education Statistics Agency in January 2014,
which cover the last academic year for which there are
figures—2012-13—are disturbing indeed. Those figures are
before the cumulative effect that would come from this Bill because, of
course, it is not yet in force.</hs_para>

much detail on the figures, because there was a good deal of coverage
of them at Second Reading, but some really stand out. The main one is
that in the year 2012-13 overall numbers dropped for the first time
since figures were produced in the early 1990s. They dropped by 1%.
More seriously, 
<?notus-xml column=1177?>perhaps, the figures for postgraduates—and postgraduates from
countries outside the EU are extremely important for the future of our
universities—dropped by 4%. Some of the figures for
the countries of origin of large numbers of students coming to this
country are really terrifying. The figure for India dropped by 49% in
two years, and there are very substantial drops in the figures for
those from Pakistan and other countries of the Indian subcontinent,
Nigeria and so on. That is in a period when the figures for our main
competitors—the United States and Australia—were going
up, by 7% for the United States and 6.9% for Australia. The
market is growing, we are losing market share, and that is not good
news for this country.</hs_para>

that Ministers look at a recent study conducted by the National Union
of Students, which it made available to those of us who are interested
in this matter, and which was based on 3,000 students from outside the
EU currently studying in this country. They were asked in January of
this year about their reaction to certain matters. That, too, was not
very comforting. The chilling effect that the Government’s
immigration policies are having and are likely to have was very clear:
51% of those non-EU students found the UK Government’s attitude
towards them “unwelcoming”. Has the Minister studied this
survey by the National Union of Students? These people have no
particular interest in the matter, because they are here already.
However, they said in much larger numbers than that 51% that if they
had been asked to undertake some of the burdens in the Bill, they
probably would not have come; they would have gone somewhere
else<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T19:50:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

not carve students out of the Bill? There is no requirement for the
Government to include students in the Bill for public policy purposes.
I accept that the Government have to make a return on economic
migration to the UN, which has to include students as well as those who
are more properly regarded as economic migrants. However, there is no
need whatever for the Government to apply their immigration policy,
these new measures, to students because they are economic migrants; of
course, they are really not. These people bring to this country very
large resources, to which I have already referred:
£10.1 billion net in the course of the most recent
year. They bring jobs to this country because they are creating
employment in our universities. The study by the University of
Sheffield, of which I am sure Ministers are well aware, shows just how
much of a contribution they make to the economies of many of our

not therefore prepared to listen to the views of four or five—I
cannot remember the exact number now; it goes up all the

not treat students, for public policy purposes, as economic migrants,
because you are damaging a resource vital to this country”? I
hope that the Government will reflect further on this and will see the
advantages to them and to the whole country of simply removing them
from the Bill. I hope we will then all be able to work together, which
is what universities want to do. Those of us who work for universities

is a perfectly legitimate objective for the Government to seek to
reduce the risk of unmeritorious claims being brought, we do have
serious concerns about the effect of some of the Government’s
proposed judicial review reforms on the practical ability to bring
meritorious challenges to decisions, including in the immigration and
asylum context … We also draw to Parliament’s attention
the paradoxical fact that after years of seeking to reduce the number
of immigration and asylum judicial review cases that have been causing
backlogs in the High Court, including by transferring such cases from
the High Court’s jurisdiction to the Upper Tribunal, the
Government is now seeking to justify a significant reduction in appeal
rights by reference to the continued availability of judicial review
… In light of our concerns, we recommend that the removal of
appeal rights for which the Bill provides should not be brought into

decision-making has improved sufficiently to remove the risk that
meritorious appeals will be prevented from being

Often, clause stand part debates are used as a kind of probing
amendment, a technical way of ensuring discussion on the principle of
the clause or an attempt to tease out the detail and address questions.
We will be doing that with this clause. However, I also say to your
Lordships’ Committee that removing the clause entirely would be
our preference given the current position. Failing that, our Amendment
27 would ensure that appeal rights could not be abolished until the
quality of Home Office decision-making for managed migration is deemed
by the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration and the
Secretary of State to be efficient, effective and fair. That would
require that the provision be introduced by order subject to

figures show that of the 4,102 ex-foreign national offenders living in

revealed a previously undisclosed new backlog in permanent and
temporary migration decisions of 190,000, and the total immigration

work and student appeals—and 49% of entry clearance applications
were successfully appealed last year. Shockingly, the Government
acknowledged in a recent letter to me from the Minister
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14030340000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000157">“neither

find that surprising given that this is such a significant clause in
the Bill. However, what the department did have was a sample exercise
of, I understand, around 2% of cases, which showed that 60% of the
volume of appeals allowed are due to casework errors. That would mean
that almost 30% of all appeals—that is, 60% of the
49%—are allowed due to casework
errors<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:01:52"></hs_TimeCode>. When so
many decisions are found to be flawed, should we really be trying to
remove the current routes of appeal and replacing them with
administrative reviews? It would be helpful if the Minister could tell
me today—or write to me—when that sample exercise was
undertaken and what period it relates to. That would be very useful
information to have. However, should we not be focusing on improving
the efficiency of these initial decisions and making sure that there is
little need for appeals in the first place? It really cannot be right

simply to stop people being able to challenge that

am sure that the Minister will point to administrative reviews as the
recourse. The Government have already made clear that, as evidence of
the appropriateness of this new system, they rely on the fact that it
is already used overseas when people are refused entry clearance. I am
sure the Minister will also tell me that, under this process, 21% of
original decisions are overturned. I appreciate that we are not
comparing exact like for like, but it has to be recognised that these
are two very different figures—50% of appeals granted under the
current system compared with 21% of administrative reviews overturning
original decisions. Even accounting for appeals overturned on the basis
of new evidence or Article 8 claims, this still leaves roughly 10%

Government have said time and again that the person reviewing the
decision will not be the person making the original decision, but it
will still be a cohort of immigration staff drawn from those who
already make the decisions, so there is a conflict. Given the very high
proportion of appeals that are allowed, and given the reasons for those
appeals, it is clear that there is a serious problem in the quality of
decision-making. Therefore, should not any administrative review be
completely independent so that there is confidence in the

noble friend Lady Lister, the Government have again relied on the
availability of judicial review as a recourse. We have pointed out on
previous amendments that reliance on judicial review is likely to be
more costly for the taxpayer. In their impact assessment on appeals,
the Government said that the displacement on to judicial review could
not be quantified, and therefore could not be costed. However, the
“sensitivity analysis” in the assessment models the
effects of an extra 5,600 reviews being started, and of up to 1,000

the number of judicial

Maclennan of Rogart (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to support the
arguments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, by recalling two
anecdotes. He very forcefully and persuasively deployed the arguments
about students from abroad, external to the European Union, coming to
this country. One anecdote is about when I visited Tanzania with the
late George Thomson and met Julius Nyerere. He had studied in a
university in Britain and had translated Shakespeare’s plays
into Swahili. The ties with Tanzania were greatly fostered by that
personal encounter at a particularly difficult time when we faced
apartheid in South
Africa<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:06:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030340000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000025">The
second anecdote relates to a visit I paid to Hong Kong some years later
when I met the director of development and housing, who had also been
to a British university. When I inquired about who were the
construction engineers developing various important developments in
Hong Kong, virtually every single one of them was British. I think that
reflects the truth of the general principle that we should encourage
people from overseas to come to this country as students not only
because of the money they pump into our education system, but also
because of the long-standing ties that they foster when they go back to
their own
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:07:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030340000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000026"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lea of Crondall" PimsId="1443" UID="14030340000176" xid="1309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000176">Lord
Lea of Crondall (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I support the first
amendment in this group, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay,
for the following reasons. Each Bill introduced into Parliament has an
impact 
<?notus-xml column=1182?>assessment. I have considered the methodology of the impact assessment
for this Bill. It refers to costs and benefits, but I think there is a
fallacy built into the methodology. The section on employment and
monetised benefits
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14030340000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000151">“There

must be based on an extraordinarily narrow focus, even if it is not
economic sense, to say that employment opportunities will be opened up
for UK residents. It sounds like a bit of UKIP propaganda to me; I
cannot see how the rationale for it
works.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14030340000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000027">Why
is this important? It is important because it is a long way from the
sort of impact assessment to which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay and
others, including the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, have alluded. If, for
example, we were to see a catastrophic fall in the subcontinent, are we
seriously suggesting that the impact assessment on UK plc national
income over the next generation would be zero? Of course it would not
be zero; it would be negative. It is unacceptable that the impact
assessment can be framed as narrowly as this.</hs_para>

the Minister to do two things. One is to revisit the impact assessment
and to at least have a go at the wider context. The analogy that
crosses my mind is that 10 or 15 years ago we could have said that we
did not need to spend any money on Heathrow Airport because aeroplanes
could land there and if there were a few more in the next year that
would be fine, failing to see that our market share in Europe, compared
with Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt and Schiphol, would now be in a state
of crisis, unable to serve all the places in China, for example, that
can be served by these other airports.</hs_para>

Minister to do a survey, and to put it in the Library, of the situation
in other EU countries. We are talking about a distinct group, non-EU
students coming into the EU, and although we control our own borders,
at least to some extent—obviously not with the EU—we are
not covered by a common external immigration policy. I am not
suggesting that we should be. I am suggesting that we do a benchmark
study. Australia, the United States and possibly Canada are the only
countries that have been mentioned so far: the “white
Commonwealth”, as it was once called. However, it is important
to know what the practice is on this question of students in the other
EU countries. Do they have to deal with the fearful rigmarole that we
are confronted with here? Is the damage to Britain’s reputation
part of the cost-benefit analysis? Of course it is not. I have great
sympathy for the civil servants trying to do these cost-benefit
analyses in so many fields nowadays. With HS2, can you actually look at
the cluster effect on Manchester and Leeds and so on in the north of
England? Possibly not, because it is very hard to do. It is very hard
to quantify the cost benefits for that, and civil servants would get no
extra brownie points for introducing, alongside key monetised benefits,
things where it is difficult to monetise their value.</hs_para>

Minister agree with me, and with the spirit of what has been said by
many noble Lords, that one cannot look at an impact assessment 
<?notus-xml column=1183?>in the narrow terms on this rather thin piece of paper that I have here,
which it is probably obligatory on Whitehall to use? Will he agree to
look into the two matters that I have specifically asked about? This
involves our world market share in so many areas, and that concerns the
future of our country. Some might say that this is missing point and
that the point is to reduce the number of overseas students. I ask the
Minister if it is outrageous to suggest that the policy is to reduce
the number of overseas students, the rationale being that statistically
they pose more potential danger to the country. We must spell this out.

with the thrust of what has been said so far, I have concerns about
Amendment 26. It would have the effect of
excluding—or including—a particular group that would
retain a right of appeal. The new Section 82(1) would allow appeals by
individuals in certain circumstances, but the noble Lord’s
amendment would allow all those to whom he has
referred—essentially all students—to retain the right of
appeal. Students and universities are an obvious, vocal and important
cohort. They have a voice that others affected by Clause 11 do not
have. There will be individuals who are substantially affected as
individuals, over a range of circumstances and issues. I would be
concerned about picking out a single group for whom to retain a right,
without considering carefully what that would say to all those other
people who will be affected by this

Hannay, said that many of our committees have said: “Please

have slightly different meanings. However, I am absolutely convinced of
the importance of the international links to which my noble friend Lord
Maclennan referred. I am concerned about all the reputational issues
for the UK that would flow from perceptions—we may be told that
they are only perceptions but they are important—if we were

immigration figures, it would be right to pursue the issue regarding
the number of students. We should seek not just to disaggregate the
numbers, because I understand that that is done at the moment. However,
that issue gets no coverage. We should be taking positive steps to make
sure that it is understood how the numbers break down and that we

why British universities are in the top group of world universities but
one is that there is a free market in talent that enables them to

here<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:23:29"></hs_TimeCode>. They are
great universities partly because they can attract talent from all over

is a similarity between the university world and financial markets.
Neither of them is purely national. Both are totally international with
seamless connections across the world. Therefore, if you try to turn us
into an island and cut us off from this stream of talent that is
crossing the world, you will do great damage to British universities.
It will not show up in the short term, as the noble Lord, Lord Lea of

through. But it will very seriously damage over the long term the

nothing to do with me because the outstanding vice-chancellors that it

Bath has moved from obscurity not only into the top group in the United
Kingdom but now into a number of world league tables as well. That is
because it has both a student body and a faculty that are drawn from
all over the world. In fact the previous vice-chancellor was

Hope of Craighead:</Member></B> My Lords, I endorse what the noble
Lord, Lord Tugendhat, just said and what the noble Lord, Lord Hannay,
said earlier. My background is that I was for 17 years chancellor of
the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. Our experience has been that
we are operating in a global market not only for teachers but for
students—those coming to the university and those going out from
the university to other countries to take on part-time study or study
together with employment experience.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14030340000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000044">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:26:32"></hs_TimeCode>
are a number of aspects that I might very quickly mention one after the
other. The first is the point that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, made
about the cumulative effect of policies that have been building up over
the years. One of the most injurious in our experience has been the
inability of foreign students to stay on after they have completed
their degree courses. I know that there is strong feeling in government
that we have a policy about people who stay on who should not do so.
These are people who in the previous system were able to remain here
for a given period. They used that time to gain work experience in some
of our leading companies. Together with their academic work, they took
that back to their own countries, developed their own expertise and
thereby maintained a continuing link not only with the universities but
with the companies with which they worked. That has gone. We are not
talking about that in this Bill, but it is against that background that
this has become a much more serious
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:27:45"></hs_TimeCode>. The noble
Baroness made the same 
<?notus-xml column=1186?>point. We have reached a point where we are losing contact and the
competitive edge that we must maintain if our universities are to
remain as competitive as they are in the
world<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:28:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030340000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000045">The
second point is about revenue, which the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan,
made. Certainly, our experience when we were getting students from
India and China was that they were paying substantial sums to come to
the university, and we are losing that. I am told that there has been a
25% fall in students from these countries coming to Strathclyde for
postgraduate degrees. That is a drop in numbers that is difficult to
make up for in the market in which we work.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14030340000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000046">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:28:37"></hs_TimeCode>
other aspect is the exchange process whereby our students go away in
the course of their studies for a year out. Because we are driving away
international students from elsewhere, it is more difficult for us to
get places for our students to go
to<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:28:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030340000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000047">The
final point is that one of the essences of university is the ability of
students to mix with each other, gain experience from what other people
have done and make friends across the faculties and across the nations
throughout the world. The opportunities for doing that will be
diminished if we do not sustain our effort of attracting students from
other countries from outside the EU who have so much to contribute.
Therefore, I warmly endorse the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord
Hannay.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14030340000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000048">I
should add, in response to a point made by the noble Baroness, that I
believe it is a very carefully crafted amendment because it is seeking
to direct attention to a very particular category. Those are the
categories described very precisely in the amendment, which is the
point that I and, I suspect, the noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat, have
addressed. It is a very particular category. It does not include
language schools and all the other fringe elements, which might give
rise to abuse. These are people who would be here for very good
reasons, carefully monitored, and would take enormous benefits back to
their own country if they were allowed to continue to come
here<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:30:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lord Bishop of St Albans:</Member></B> My Lords, if I may, I will just
add a brief comment on precisely that amendment. Some years ago I spent
time in Malaysia and found myself meeting a number of barristers, all
of whom had trained in this country. They spoke of how, when they had
particular legal problems or needed advice, they would immediately turn
to the people they had studied with back in this country. However, they
were lamenting the fact that in recent years the next generation were
all being trained in Australia and America and, of course, the place
that they immediately contacted when they wanted help was their friends
in those countries. They thought it was the most extraordinarily
short-sighted approach compared with the way things had formerly been
done.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14030340000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000050">I will
add one other thing. Just three or four weeks ago, I paid a visit to
one of the universities in my diocese, the University of Bedfordshire,
and I met Bill Rammell, who had recently come there as the
vice-chancellor. Immediately when we got talking, he lamented the very
serious problem they have now of finding 
<?notus-xml column=1187?>perfectly good students who want to come but are simply already unable
to come. He was saying that this is something that is materially
affecting Bedfordshire as one of our dynamic, thriving universities,
which wants to be right of the forefront of forming, developing and,
indeed, celebrating an international academic community, but it is
finding that already it is difficult. Therefore, I want to add my
support for the
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:31:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Benjamin:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to speak to Amendment 80, to
which I have put my name, as I believe we need to find a sensible way
forward to deal with the international student figures. International
students make up less than 1% of the UK population, yet their spending
power supports £80 billion-worth of UK economic output.
International students support over 830,000 UK jobs across the country,
including in Wales and Scotland. Interestingly, they are the most
heavily regulated and monitored and are subject to strict visa
controls. Yet there are proposed processes being considered here in
this House that will deter many potential international students from
choosing the UK as the place to study. This worries me greatly, as I
speak as chancellor of the University of Exeter—I declare an
interest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030340000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0002.htm#14030340000052">This
is why I support Amendment 80, which my noble friend Baroness Hamwee
has spoken so eloquently on. I believe this is a common-sense way
forward that deals with this important issue, and highlights
international student numbers in a coherent and sensible way to show
them that they are not perceived as the enemy and that they are wanted
and welcome. It will ensure that the Government will know that, if
there are any concerns detrimental to our country, they will know
exactly where the problems are if there are any. Therefore, I hope that
my noble friend the Minister will give careful consideration to
Amendment 80. I look forward to his reply and will accept nothing less
than a
compromise<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:33:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Williams of Crosby:</Member></B> My Lords, the hour is late and there
is much to say, but I will be brief in my remarks. Let me begin by
declaring an interest as a member of the court of the University of
Hertfordshire, which is very like what the right reverend Prelate had
to say about the University of Bedfordshire—a very young,
growing but exciting and expanding university in a part of the world,
which, rather surprisingly, has not got as many universities as exist
around Oxford and Cambridge and London.</hs_para>

the following. I would like first to add one other distinguished name
to the list given by my noble friend Lord Maclennan. It is a name worth
thinking about for a moment, and it is of course that of the new
president of Iran. He holds a postgraduate degree from Glasgow
Caledonian University, and one has to ask oneself whether his much more
enlightened view of global relationships has nothing whatever to do
with the fact that he is one of the very few senior figures in Iranian
society who has spent substantial time outside his own country, speaks
good English and is interested in what is happening elsewhere. That is
the kind of benefit, one which cannot be listed economically, that a
country like ours gets from the very wide spread of its students from
all over the world who, over the last generation, have attended 
<?notus-xml column=1188?>universities in this country. Out of that has grown an abiding affection
both for their university and for the country in which it happens to be
located<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:35:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is a profound division of opinion within the Government on this issue.
We all know that the department for business enthusiastically supports
the idea of a substantially greater expansion of British universities.
That department includes some able Ministers with considerable
knowledge of higher education, and it knows one important thing. The
important thing that it knows is that you can grow out of a university
relationship a whole range of relationships with other businesses,
public services and so forth across the front. The noble Lord, Lord
Tugendhat, pointed to the effect of this kind of relationship on global
attitudes. It allows us to extend our acquaintances and friendships all
over the
world<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:36:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

particularly because the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said something less
dramatic than I am about to say. He pointed out quite rightly that the
National Union of Students study, based on a careful poll conducted at
the end of last year of more than 3,000 students in this country, is
the best figure that he could get; it is a figure showing what
undergraduates think. Some 51% of undergraduates have said that they
think that this country is not welcoming to overseas students. The more
drastic figure—more drastic for the reasons given by my noble
friends Lady Hamwee and Lady Benjamin—shows that 66% of
postgraduate students, people who have spent some time studying here,
take the view that this country is unwelcoming to overseas students.
These are the very men and women to whom the noble Lord, Lord
Tugendhat, was referring when he talked about relationships with
scientific, medical and cultural groups in this country. They have a
valuable contribution to make, but increasingly they are being somewhat
frozen out.</hs_para>

of the worst examples of this is the playing around with visas, which
means that students suddenly find themselves without a visa a matter of
months before they are due to start their course, and no one repays
them for the work they have done to get that visa in the first place.
British visas are among the most expensive to be found in any country
offering higher education in the whole of Europe. Our visa expenses are
something like three or four times higher than those of our major
competitors. Now we are going to add to that cost health surcharges,
decisions about tenancies and a whole range of things, all of which are
off-putting and not welcoming. I agree with my noble friend Lady Hamwee
that this country has to make a great effort to retain this huge asset
value in one of the few areas in which we still lead the world. It is
to my mind almost totally irrational to make it harder and harder for
our most effective industry, that of higher education, to expand, grow,
root itself and be there for the distant
future<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:39:01"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:39:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is that we have become so obsessed with immigration numbers that we can
no longer see the larger picture. The great bulk of students, over 95%,
who come here to study go back to their own countries, having fostered
friendships and relationships with us. I shall give only one example 
<?notus-xml column=1189?>before I stop. In this country we suffer considerably from a long
increase in waiting times for people getting into, for example, A&amp;E
to look after accidents and injuries that they have. We used to have a
substantial number of junior doctors serving in A&amp;E, particularly
those who came from countries like India, but elsewhere as well, who
gained great knowledge of medicine and of our hospitals and made a huge
contribution to a National Health Service that ran smoothly.
Increasingly, those numbers are no longer there. In two years’
time we shall see A&amp;E waits rise, and we shall ask, “How did
this come to happen?”. The answer is right here and now. It
comes to happen if we turn off the young medics who would like to come
here, who would like to learn about how we work and about how our
health service works and then go back to their own countries and spread
that knowledge more
widely<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:40:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030340000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0003.htm#14030340000059">So
I end simply by saying that we have a profound schizophrenia in this
country on this issue. I do not understand why it is not clearly seen
to be of such advantage to us, to our own people and to those who come.
We do not recognise that we should have the strength to face up to
looking again at this extraordinary conflict that we look at all the
time between different departments, different people and different
individual political attitudes. We should look at it and say to
ourselves that this is something that we do very well, something for
which we have been admired, something which benefits the world and
benefits us, and decide to get on with it and make our universities the

debate is very timely. Last week, the net migration figures were
published and none of the media coverage disaggregated the figures. I
do not know what the Government’s original press release stated,
but it seems that by publishing in that form they are simply creating a
rod for their own back. Amendment 80 at least is an attempt to make

terms and in terms of the soft power to which the noble Lord, Lord

number of voices that we have heard over the past two years, not just

<?notus-xml column=1190?>The Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee did likewise. The

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been an
important and interesting debate. It is really about appeals, but I
understand why many noble Lords have also used the opportunity to talk
about student issues. It is an issue which was well canvassed during
your Lordships’ debate at Second Reading. I think the noble
Lord, Lord Hannay, has amendments—or at least an
amendment—down later in the Bill, where I am sure there will be
an opportunity again to debate these
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:45:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030340000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0003.htm#14030340000066">I
will of course try to respond to a number of the points that were made
but it might be useful to put this into context—the noble
Baroness, Lady Smith, spoke to the clause stand part debate and to
other amendments with proposed new clauses—and to look at some
of the issues regarding students in that context. The key point is that
we believe that the present appeals system is complex and costly. The
purpose of Clause 11 is to reform and streamline the appeals system so
that appeals can be brought only where decisions engaging the
fundamental rights of asylum, human rights or EU free movement are
made. The clause will also set up an administrative review system to
provide a proportionate and less costly mechanism for resolving
casework
errors<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T20:46:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030340000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0003.htm#14030340000067">Clause
11 changes the decisions that give rise to an appeal, the grounds on
which that appeal can be brought and the jurisdiction of the tribunal
to consider them. As I said, it is intended to simplify an overly
complex appeals system. That complexity provides the opportunity for
multiple appeals and allows removal to be delayed by the lodging of an
appeal as of right where there is no arguable error or where there is a
simple casework error that can be corrected more quickly and
effectively by administrative review. I will come on to the wider
points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, which I am sure we will
debate fully. The Joint Committee on Human Rights accepted that there
was a legitimate objective to reduce unmeritorious claims, although I
accept that other issues arise with
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030340000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0003.htm#14030340000068">Clause
11(2) reduces to four the number of decisions that can be appealed. We
recognise the importance of an appeal to an independent tribunal where
a case involves fundamental rights such as asylum and human 
<?notus-xml column=1191?>rights, and the provision preserves an appeal right in these cases. A
right of appeal is also preserved where the decision was to refuse a
claim based on European Union rights. That appeal right is established
by secondary legislation under Section 109 of the Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and therefore does not form part of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030340000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0003.htm#14030340000069">A
right of appeal is not the most appropriate remedy for cases that do
not involve fundamental rights. The noble Baroness, Lady Smith,
mentioned that our internal sampling showed that 60% of allowed appeals
against decisions under the points-based system are allowed because of
casework error, and asked when that sampling was done. It was a 2%
sample between April and June 2013. An appeal is a costly and
time-consuming way to correct a casework error but it is not the case,
as I think the noble Baroness said, that we are trying to stop a
challenge where there is a casework error. There will be an
administrative review system, which is what we have been debating and
what we believe is the most appropriate remedy in these
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030340000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0003.htm#14030340000070">Subsection
(3) repeals Sections 83 and 83A of the 2002 Act, which provide for a

restores the Secretary of State’s position as primary
decision-maker on asylum and human rights claims and prevents
appellants from raising new issues for the first time on appeal. Under
the current appeals system, the tribunal has jurisdiction to decide
such issues even though the Secretary of State has not had the chance
to consider them. For example, a student appealing against the refusal
of an application to study in the UK can currently raise asylum or
their Article 8 rights, disclosing for example that they now have a
family in the UK, which they can do under the present system for the
very first time on appeal.</hs_para>

restores the role of primary decision-maker to the Secretary of State
by providing that the tribunal cannot consider any reason that a person
has for wanting to stay in the UK that has not already been considered
by the Secretary of State, unless the Secretary of State consents to
the tribunal considering the new matter. This provision does not
prevent a person introducing new evidence about matters that the
Secretary of State has already had a chance to consider. The tribunal
will continue to be able to make its decision on the basis of all facts
relevant to the matters that are before it, as required by case law.
Reforming appeal rights will create a better process. Immigration
judges at the tribunal will no longer need to consider caseworking
errors. Applicants will have those errors considered faster and more
cheaply, and those types of case will be removed from the tribunal
system, which will reduce overall expense.</hs_para>

was 425,260, a drop of less than 3,000. Australia had a drop of 10,000

the drop in the UK was relatively small and much smaller than that in
Australia. There was specific mention of Chinese students. Between 2010
and 2013, the number of Chinese students increased in the United
Kingdom by 24.5%. Admittedly in the United States the figure was 49.5%,

trying to address the issue, the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has moved an
amendment which seeks to add decisions relating to higher education
students to the types of decision that can be the subject of an appeal

that anyone, including students, can appeal against one of the
decisions listed in Clause 11(2); the refusal of a
protection claim, the refusal of a human rights claim or the revocation
of protection status. The amendment does not change that because it
neither adds a new decision type to the list of decisions that attract
a right of appeal nor adds to the grounds of appeal that could be
raised at appeal. When I was in the other place, I used to cringe a bit
when Ministers used to say, “Your amendment is technically
deficient” when an important point was being made.
Technical<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T21:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> flaws
aside, we believe the amendment is unnecessary. It is true that a
student may no longer appeal against the refusal of an application for
further leave to remain in the UK as a student under the Immigration
Rules. We are doing that because the appeals system is slow and
expensive for those with a genuine concern and presents too many
opportunities to frustrate removal for those who seek to break the

Bill replaces the right of appeal with the administrative review

these concerns must be seen from the perspective of the end-to-end

allowed by the tribunal. The total number of managed migration
decisions taken in 2012 was 291,827. Only 5% of those decisions were
overturned. Although our internal sampling indicated that 60% of the
points-based system appeals that succeed do so because a case-working
error has been made, this does not mean that the majority of decisions
are affected by error—far from it. The great majority of
applications are successful. Of decisions taken in the UK, only 10%
were refused in 2012. Fifty-one per cent of those succeeded on appeal,
of which 60%, as I referred to earlier, succeeded because an error was

is why the old UK Border Agency was abolished and its functions brought
back into the Home Office. That has made a real difference and work is
continuing to improve decision quality. The chief inspector himself
acknowledged that positive steps have been taken to improve the process
by which decision-makers learn from appeals in his November 2012 report
on tier 4 student visas, which in turn led to improvements in process
and decision quality.</hs_para>

29 would require the Secretary of State to produce a review within 12

but rather under Section 5 of the Immigration Act 1971. However, I
assume from what was said that the aim is to question what difference
the changes in the Bill will make to our ability to deport those whose

national

changes made in the Bill are not about large increases in the number of
foreign criminals we deport but about the principle that Parliament is
rightfully the body to set out the public interest in the importance of
seeing foreign criminals deported and that the tribunal is the right
body to weigh the strong public interest in deporting foreign criminals
against the specific Article 8 rights of the criminal and their family.
Success will be seen as these deportation cases progress through the
Immigration Tribunal with outcomes that clearly show that the tribunal
decision has had particular regard to Parliament’s legitimate
view on the public interest. Case law will take some time to develop
and settle once these provisions are commenced. It is not sensible to
have a set period on the face of legislation for when a report must be
presented when we may well at that point have only a very partial

Singh of Wimbledon (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the first week of June
will mark the 30th anniversary of the Indian Government’s attack
on the Golden Temple—the Vatican of the Sikhs. The attack was
deliberately timed to coincide with the martyrdom anniversary of the
temple’s founder Guru Arjan, when the huge complex would be full
to overflowing with pilgrims. Tanks and armoured vehicles were used. On
conservative estimates, well over 2,000 pilgrims were killed.
Eye-witnesses told of how some who surrendered were tied up in their
own turbans and shot. Other eye-witnesses outside the temple complex,
including my own in-laws, described with horror how they saw groups of
pilgrims being herded together and then dispatched with hand
grenades<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T21:11:05"></hs_TimeCode>. Many

June Sikhs remember the huge loss of life and the mindless damage to
the Golden Temple, the historic centre of the Sikh faith. The question
arises: why did Indira Gandhi resort to such brute force against the
Sikhs? The Indian government version, unquestioningly accepted by our
Government—and I speak as a British Sikh—was that there
were 17 wanted 
<?notus-xml column=1198?>separatists “holed-up”—to use the Indian

this version does not explain why 40 other historic gurdwaras in Punjab

were the so-called separatists not simply arrested by the hundreds of

Sikhs were demanding at the time was a fair share of Punjab’s

true reason for Mrs Gandhi’s vindictive attitude to Sikhs
stemmed from her prison conviction for electoral fraud in the election
of 1975 and her seizing power and imposing dictatorial rule. Her son
Sanjay had married a Sikh and she turned to Sikhs for support. Sikhs,
although less than 2% of the population, were at the forefront of the
opposition to dictatorial rule, in which the poor—particularly
Muslims—were forcibly sterilised and others dumped in the
wilderness to make Delhi a tidier place for the Asian Games. Maneka

of thousands of Sikhs following Mrs Gandhi’s assassination was

khoon”, meaning “Take blood for blood”. The army
was confined to barracks for three full days to allow free rein to
organised gangs carrying Sikh voter lists, armed with identical steel
rods and an unusually plentiful supply of kerosene, to go around the
capital in municipal buses beating and burning male Sikhs and
gang-raping women and young girls. Prominent Hindus and Sikhs begged
the new Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, to order troops to restore order.
His chilling response was: “When a big tree falls, the ground is
bound to shake”. The same scenes were enacted throughout the
country. We know all about the disappearances and killings in General
Pinochet’s Chile, but a WikiLeaks document carrying a signed
report from the American embassy in India shows that more Sikhs were
brutally murdered in just three days in 1984 than those killed in
Pinochet’s 17-year rule.</hs_para>

Sheikh (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Singh
of Wimbledon, for initiating this debate. I am close to the Sikh
community, and I enjoy good relations with it. In fact, I am patron of
two Sikh organisations. Sikhs have played a vital part in the life and
history of the United Kingdom. The first Sikhs settled here 160 years
ago, in 1854. Since that time, waves of Sikh migrants have come here
and successfully integrated into British society. We owe them an
immense debt of gratitude for fighting shoulder to shoulder with us in
both World Wars. They also played a key role during the post-war
expansion of the British economy. They filled many jobs when Britain
was experiencing a labour shortage. There are now more than 500,000
Sikhs living in the United Kingdom. The <I>British Sikh Report 2013</I>
found that 95% of British Sikhs are proud to be born or living in the
United Kingdom. They have been successful in every walk of life,
including business, the professions, sport, academia and politics.

an utter tragedy. Estimates of the number of deaths range from the
hundreds to the thousands, including innocent pilgrims caught in the
crossfire. It will for ever be remembered as a horrific point in

Sikhism’s holiest place of worship. It was therefore only right

investigation was both rigorous and thorough, and I have no reason to
doubt this. The report was clear that the UK’s assistance was
purely advisory in context and very limited in volume. When the actual
military operation took place several months later, it diverged vastly
from the original plans. We can therefore be confident that there was
little, if any, connection between the British advice and the
disastrous events that eventually unfolded. However, the resonance of

outcry of the Sikh community all over the world on the invasion of the
Golden Temple by the Indian armed forces in 1984. This was a tragic
event that resulted in the loss of thousands of innocent lives that

recent release of the report by the UK Government regarding the attack

raised more questions on the British involvement in this operation. I
have had long discussions with Sikh leaders, including my friend and

one of only five Sikhs ever elected to it. He has worked robustly on
the issue, both before 
<?notus-xml column=1202?>the release of the report and after. I believe that, along with other
Sikh leaders, he has met some of the most senior people in the

behalf of the British Sikh community, I wish to raise the following
points. First, the Cabinet Secretary had reported that a key file on
the provision of military advice to the Indian authorities on their
plans for the attack in June 1984 was destroyed by the Ministry of
Defence in November 2009. It remains unclear why such an important file
was destroyed, and this lessens the credibility of the internal
inquiry. Given the incredible importance of the 1984 attack to the Sikh
faith, who took the decision to destroy the files and how was that
decision taken? Was it taken at the ministerial
level<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T21:31:18"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030340000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0003.htm#14030340000127">Secondly,
Parliament appeared to have been misled at the time, following a
Question on 30 July 1984 by the then MP for Slough, John Watts, who
asked the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what

of India about the incident—the attack on the Sri Harmandir

the media had reported in January 2014 that the then Prime Minister had
ordered an inquiry to be carried out by the Cabinet Secretary which
would cover the events of 1984. However, the inquiry covered only the
period up to the start of the attack and no other events, which
included the genocide of Sikhs that followed later that year. Clearly,
the parameters of the review were too narrow, and it has been alleged
that the terms of reference, which have not been published, changed
during the inquiry. Would it not have made sense, if the inquiry was to
carry the confidence of the Sikh community, to review and release all
documentation covering the 1984 events, and over a much broader period
of time, including the genocide of Sikhs in 1984? Despite the review
and report, why have the details of the specific advice that was given
not been revealed, nor the reason that the UK Government agreed to
advise the Indian Government on how to attack the Sikhs’ holiest

when the Foreign Secretary delivered his Statement in the other place

some of the highest levels of motivation and ambition compared with

cricket team is of course in need of another Monty Panesar to rescue

how reasonable accommodation of religious beliefs can be achieved in UK
law. Section 11 of the Employment Act 1989 exempts turban-wearing Sikhs
from any requirements to wear safety helmets on construction sites or

the news coverage of this matter reveals that the relationship between
the UK Government and the Sikh community is strained and reconciliation
is needed. Despite the attempts by the first inquiry, it seems that we
are not where we would like to be. Any relationship needs the parties
to trust each other and 
<?notus-xml column=1205?>that in this scenario depends on openness. After reading various
reports, it is clear that the disclosure of the documents in January of
this year was inadvertent. This was disclosure of information that the
UK Government had decided would always remain secret. It is important
that Her Majesty’s Government have been clear about this as it
is a starting point for considering matters and restoring the
relationship. In this scenario, it seems that the Ministry of Defence
made a mistake in that it did not destroy all the files that it should
have done and that at the 25-year point copies were left. Although the
Cabinet Secretary’s report has pieced together the material from
copies left in other government files, it has inevitably left a
lingering and damaging suspicion that not all the documents needed were
in fact available to the inquiry. It is partly to ensure that this does
not happen again that Her Majesty’s Government have instituted
an inquiry into the disclosure under the 30-year, or soon to be
20-year, rule. As a matter of practicality, at 25 years,
should the files be destroyed? Would it not be sensible to wait until
30 years have passed to make sure that we are not in future
inadvertently placed in this position again and that the files remain
to be considered if
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T21:44:07"></hs_TimeCode>. These
documents were never intended to be disclosed as the decision was made
that they would reveal information relating to intelligence or special
forces. This situation would have meant that the destruction of all the
files in 2009 was appropriate and all the copies in the other files
should have been destroyed.</hs_para>

that there is a commission looking into the annual release of papers

inadvertent disclosure, we have a rare window into the decisions that
are made on the basis of the military and special forces destruction of
information. Will the commission have any remit to receive views from
the public and interested bodies, particularly the Sikh community, on
whether this kind of information should have been available for
disclosure after 30 years? Is there not an advantage from such an
inadvertent disclosure to have public debate on whether the line of
non-disclosure is being drawn in the right place?</hs_para>

concerns for the community of what else the Government know and
questions about why the community should not have known this

Government realise, it is one thing to express your apologies for the
death of community members at the hands of a foreign government. Quite
another type of apology and restoration is needed if you have

I note that the Indian Government are looking into this matter again.
Can my noble friend the Minister indicate whether the UN is looking at
holding some form of inquiry into the matter? I strongly support an
international inquiry. If Her Majesty’s Government could support
that, it would do something to improve relationships. I sympathise with
Her Majesty’s Government over this inadvertent disclosure as
restoring the relationship with the Sikh community will not be
straightforward. I hope that they are able to do this, whether in the
manner that I have outlined with the ISC or through another vehicle.

Triesman (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I join everyone in thanking the
noble Lord, Lord Singh, not just for securing the debate, but for the
moving, careful and thoughtful way in which he introduced it. I
appreciated that greatly, as I did the valuable history of the noble
Lord, Lord Sheikh, and its full recognition of the contribution of the
Sikh community, which was again very moving. Like him, I have visited
the Golden Temple. It is an inspiring and deeply religious place, where

sometimes say that dreadful events occurred at a different time in our
history when different understandings of what normality was held sway.
This is not such a case. No such argument, in my view, is available. A
massacre is a massacre. It came in the midst of many other outrages
against the Sikh people. People are entitled to know with as much
certainty as possible what happened and why, who was involved and with
what level of
culpability<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T21:49:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403041000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0003.htm#1403041000010">The

but because it is needed and right, and the community has a plain
entitlement to know what happened and why. The nature of the terrible
events at Amritsar in 1984 affects not only the Sikh community but all
of us. It affects our country and our sense of decency—the

inadvertent disclosure; it was always intended to be a permanent
secret, whatever the pain that would cause—pain that could have
been alleviated but which it was intended should not be because of
secrecy. It has been said that the Indian Government at the time turned
to the United Kingdom because, through the experience of Balcombe

Balcombe Street and Amritsar look to me to be very different, and their
consequences hugely different.</hs_para>

some documents were destroyed. I share that view with him. The Cabinet
Secretary concluded that we did nothing more in respect of Operation
Blue Star than provide limited military advice. I am surprised that
such a conclusion can be reached given the documents that are missing
because they would have added great clarity. If he is so confident of
these facts, it seems to me that he should not be. There is an
information gap, which requires further investigation.</hs_parafo>

the high level of the request for assistance that was received. Mrs
Ghandi, it is said, would not have understood a failure to help.
However, he concludes that the assistance—the advice—was
not subsequently taken. Indeed, he concludes that everyone thought our
advice and assistance was insufficient and insignificant. In paragraph
19 of his report, he notes that Mrs Ghandi’s letter to Mrs
Thatcher of 14 June 1984 made no reference to UK assistance
at all. In paragraph 20, he notes that the military commander at
Amritsar, Lieutenant-General Brar, said that no one had helped in
planning or execution. This is seen by Sir Jeremy as compelling
evidence of the United Kingdom’s minimal role. I find this
nothing like as compelling as he appears to. At the least, it is
untested by the kind of full inquiry that is plainly needed on this
occasion and in the remarkable absence of Mrs
Thatcher’s letter to Mrs Ghandi. Where is that letter and what
does it say?</hs_para>

However, it is just as probable that the documents—the
historical trail—were intended on this occasion to show how
small the United Kingdom’s involvement was because it was
thought that that was the best way of describing our approach. It is
just as probable that a proud nation such as India, with a proud
military commander, wanted to confirm the strength of its sovereign
role and capability without making reference to anybody else. Such
possibilities are commonplace in the relations between nations at this
level. It is not fanciful, on the evidence that Sir Jeremy himself
looked at, that other conclusions might be drawn. Sir Jeremy’s
final assertion is, I fear, rather too shallow to remain
unchallenged.</hs_para>

an exceptional civil servant, and I will always say so, but the
conclusions are far from beyond challenge. An inquiry is the right
place for a challenging examination, and nothing less will commend 
<?notus-xml column=1208?>itself to the Sikh community, or indeed to the rest of us. Missing
documents, insecure conclusions and a failure to grasp the context do
not inspire confidence. However, the documents that are available
provide some context. In those documents many express concern about the
denigration of anyone who had anything to say about the matter as
extremists. Her Majesty’s Government did that at the time. The
view of Sikhs and other supporters of Mrs Thatcher’s Government
would, I believe, regard what was said then as intolerable if it was
said today. It should have been intolerable when it was said at the
time.</hs_para>

was and still is a remarkable community. Its offence was to object to a
sequence of events and finally to the massacre of a large number of its
members. It was perfectly entitled to object in those terms. What is
more, researchers at Kew have found documents that were believed to be
missing—some are still missing—which bear on the gaps I
have tried to describe, as have other noble Lords in the debate. It is
regrettable that our call for all the relevant documents to be placed
in the public domain and for a list of those who were interviewed by
Sir Jeremy is as yet not forthcoming. I regret the narrowness and
limited timeframe of Sir Jeremy’s terms of reference.
Again the noble Lord, Lord Hussain, made that point very forcefully. So
tonight is, in my view, something of a watershed. This is not a small
debate at the end of a busy day. Her Majesty’s Government cannot
sidestep the issues tonight. An independent public inquiry is needed:
they should agree to it tonight and do so with good grace. It will be
forced on the Government either legally or by the outrage of the
community so, rather than that, they should do it because it is right
and it is inevitable, and take credit for doing the right
thing.</hs_para>

whether Parliament was misled on 30 July 1984 have been misleading,
having been based on what I can describe only as a somewhat deceitful
piece of sophistry? Will she simply acknowledge that error? Will the
United Kingdom’s military adviser’s report, provided to
the Indian Government on 13 February 1984, be shared with Parliament so
that it can assess whether the United Kingdom’s advice was taken
or not? If it is thought that it is too sensitive, will it be provided

tragedy of what happened in Amritsar 30 years ago, which led to a great
loss of life. That must never be forgotten. I understand the pain and
suffering that these events inflicted on the Sikh community. It is
still deeply felt in the United Kingdom and around the world. It was in
deference to that strength of feeling that when, on 13 January, two

the wider context of the issues of concern to the Sikh community, the
community meeting that I had, at which the noble Lord, Lord Singh, was
present, discussed broader issues, including the way in which the
British Sikh community is perceived now and was perceived at the time
of the events in 1984. I stressed to him at the time that I believed
that the working relationship between the Government and the Sikh 
<?notus-xml column=1212?>community on domestic issues has been a good one. The Department for
Communities and Local Government has engaged on a number of issues and,
indeed, after being advised by the community, there have been some
great successes. One is the wearing of turbans through airports, for
example, and the use of swabs as opposed to the way in which it is done
in some other European Union countries. I know that the Ministry of
Justice is engaged on a whole series of issues with the British Sikh
community, as is the Government Equalities Office around legislation on
equalities and human
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T22:08:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403041000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0003.htm#1403041000034">However,
I understand that whatever the relationship is with the British Sikh
community, the issue remains one that raises huge concern. That is why
I said to the noble Lord and to the community representatives at the
time that if specific questions remain—some have been raised
today—it is for officials to see what we can do to respond to
them. I laid out a series of action points at the end of that meeting
and I will certainly be writing to the Sikh Council, which appointed
itself as the convenor of that meeting, as a way of communicating back
to the community. I will make sure that copies of that correspondence
are sent back to the noble Lord, Lord Singh, and that the conversation
between the Government and the British Sikh community
continues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403041000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-0003.htm#1403041000035">In
conclusion, the families of those who were killed at Sri Harmandir

the pain of their loss is clearly still keenly felt. The suggestion
that the British Government may have had a hand in the tragedy will
have understandably shaken the Sikh community, a group that makes such
a valuable and positive contribution to our society. However, this
Government, perhaps more than any other, have recognised the need for
honesty and transparency when it comes to the darker moments of our
past. That is why, when concerns were raised, we took instant action.

investigate co-operatives, community benefit societies and credit

unlawful. The FCA initially requested these changes 
<?notus-xml column=448?>to legislation to enhance its powers to investigate societies. The
proposal was included in the Government’s July 2013 public
consultation, <I>Indus</I><I>trial and Provident Societies:

regulations aim to increase confidence in co-operatives, community
benefit societies and credit unions by creating a level playing field
with the requirements that companies face. Therefore, the additional
powers for the FCA are in line with the current powers in the Companies
Act 1985, appropriately modified for societies. The investigations
regulations include a number of new powers, including the requirement
for the FCA to appoint an inspector if a court instructs it to do so.
They also give the FCA power to appoint an inspector to investigate the
affairs of a society. The power is available in the same circumstances
as for companies, for example where it appears to the FCA that the
society’s business may have been conducted with an intention to
defraud creditors or for unlawful
purposes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030324000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030324000010">Other<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T15:33:17"></hs_TimeCode>
powers concern the expenses of an investigation and state that these
would be payable in the first instance by the FCA, who would then have
the power to recover them from the society investigated. The total cost
of an investigation is expected to be no more than £100,000,
since co-operatives, community benefit societies and credit unions are
relatively simple business models compared with large companies, where
much higher costs may be involved.</hs_para>

FCA’s first intention would be to recover the costs of an
investigation from the periodic fees paid by all societies; as a last
resort the FCA may consider using its central budget before passing on
any costs to a society. It is also worth noting that the FCA estimates,
based on past experience, that it would only need to use the powers to
investigate up to one society a
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030324000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030324000012">The
measure also gives the FCA, or an authorised investigator, power to
give directions to a society to produce documents and provide
information. This is similar to the FCA’s existing powers but,
in addition, the investigations regulations give the FCA or an
authorised person the power to apply to a magistrate for a warrant of
entry to premises of a society on the same grounds as those relating to
companies.</hs_para>

help to improve the legislation for co-operatives, community benefit
societies and credit unions by bringing it more into line with that for
companies and giving members of these societies confidence that the
regulator has adequate powers to act to investigate those societies

a whole by giving more confidence in the legal form, and it has been

my eyes alighted upon was the powers mentioned 
<?notus-xml column=449?>in paragraph 7.4 of the Explanatory Memorandum. The other powers concern
the expenses of the investigation. These will be payable in the first

investigated, which rather implies that they go through the FCA as a
transaction<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T15:36:15"></hs_TimeCode>. I
note the response that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury made in
another place, using more or less the same words that the Minister has
used—that it would be unusual for such a charge to be passed
through to the society being investigated. However, I would welcome an
assurance that where the investigation reveals no malpractice, there
will certainly be no passing through of the charge to the society
concerned. With that, I am entirely content with the regulations and

question, the FCA has the option of either recouping its costs directly
from the society in question or funding the costs from within its own

no wrongdoing, the FCA may well decide that it is more appropriate to
adopt the latter option. However, the decision will be for the

the Budget 2011, we announced that from the 2012-13 tax year the basis
for indexation of most NICs rates limits and thresholds would be the
consumer prices index, the CPI, instead of the retail prices index,
RPI, rate of inflation. This is because the Government believe that the
CPI is the most appropriate measure of the general level of prices. The
exceptions to this are the secondary threshold and the upper earnings

set the class 1 national insurance contributions lower earnings limit,
primary and secondary thresholds and the upper earnings limit for the

from £109 to £111 per week from 6 April 2014. The lower
earnings limit is the level of earnings at which contributory benefit
entitlement is secured. However, NICs do not need to be paid by the
employee until earnings reach the primary

class 1 primary threshold will be increased from £149 per week
to £153 per week from 6 April 2014. The secondary threshold is
the point at which employers start to pay class 1 NICs. In line with

£9,440 to £10,000. The point at which higher rate tax is
payable will be increased to £41,865 in the 2014-15 tax year. As
I mentioned, the upper earnings limit is not subject to CPI indexation.
This is to maintain the existing alignment of the upper earnings limit
with the point at which higher rate tax is paid. The upper earnings
limit will be increased from £797 to £805 per week from 6
April 2014. The regulations also set the prescribed equivalents of the

raises the small earnings exception below which the self employed may

rise in April, from £5,725 to £5,885 a year. Many
self-employed people choose to pay these contributions in order to
protect their benefit entitlement even though they may claim exemption
from paying class 2 contributions. The rate of class 2 contributions

from £7,755 to £7,956 in line with the increase to the
class 1 primary threshold. At the other end of the scale, the 
<?notus-xml column=451?>annual upper profits limit will increase from £41,450 to
£41,865 for the 2014-15 tax year. This is to maintain the
alignment of the upper profits limit with the upper earnings limit for
employees. The changes to the class 4 limits will ensure that the
self-employed pay contributions at the main rate of 9% on a similar
range of earnings as employees paying class 1 contributions at the main
rate of 12%. Profits above the upper profits limit are subject to the
additional rate of 2% in line with the 2% paid by employees on earnings
above the upper earnings

I need to ensure that the National Insurance Fund can maintain a
prudent working balance throughout the coming year which the Government
Actuary recommends should be one-sixth or two months of benefit
expenditure. The rerating order provides for a Treasury grant of 5% of

Explanatory Memorandum and these regulations with great care, and I
have to confess that I am finding it very difficult to find any
questions whatever to ask on them. The report of the general committee
in the other place was equally bereft of any serious exchange. There
were some technical questions asked but I will not repeat them, on the
basis that I am sure that the Treasury machine would give precisely the
same answers. There was an exchange on some thinking that we are
developing about a different rate of benefit for people who have paid
contributions over a number of years but that has to be developed
further, to make sure that it is cost-neutral. The 5% that the Minister
mentioned is, as I understand it, essentially a piece of book-keeping
and does not represent any increase in overall public expenditure. I am
not sure whether the Minister said that explicitly and I would value it

investment in improving our housing stock, some housing remains
inefficient. Combined with rising energy prices, that means that there
are still too many households left in fuel poverty. The warm home

the contributing factors of fuel poverty, either through increasing

spending target for each year of the warm homes discount which sets out
the value of assistance that participating suppliers should
collectively provide. For 2013-14, the spending target set out in
regulations is £300 million. That total spending is divided into
the demand-led core group and the non-core spending. Having estimated
the size of the core group, the Government set the total non-core
spending obligation for suppliers for the forthcoming scheme year. The
larger the core group, the smaller the amount of non-core spending
suppliers have for other groups of households who may qualify for a
rebate. The size of the core group has to be estimated in

them sufficient time to prepare for their spending

it is estimated that the core group would result in spending of

£300 million, the department set the total non-core
spending obligation at £100 million. However, six months on from
setting the non-core spending obligation, the size of the core group
was lower than forecast. Therefore, we now estimate that suppliers will
spend £166 million on their core group customers in

means that £34 million of the overall spending target that
suppliers could use to help other vulnerable households would not be
required to be spent in 2013-14. Under the current regulations, if
suppliers spend more than required, their individual obligations for

incentive for suppliers to spend above their obligations by up to that
amount. For example, if an individual supplier spends 25% above

intended to close the gap in spending between years so that we maintain
the growth in the number of households who receive electricity bill
rebates year on year. As required in the regulations, the Secretary of
State has already notified Ofgem of the non-core spending obligation
for 2014-15. The Secretary of State has set the obligation based on
spending of £266 million in 2013-14, and has added the
£34 million underspend against the total spending target this
scheme year to the spending target for 2014-15. This takes us to a
total of £344

if suppliers incur more non-core spending than they are required to
prior to the end of March, Ofgem will be able to adjust down individual
non-core spending obligations by 30 September once suppliers report
their actual spending for this scheme year. This change has been
consulted on and all respondents were supportive of the change.
Although suppliers have not given us exact forecasts of how many more
rebates they intend to provide, some suppliers have already decided to
spend above their regulatory obligations in anticipation of this
change. This amendment means that more low-income and vulnerable
households may receive £135 off their bills this winter than
would have been the case otherwise. It will give suppliers the
incentive to provide more rebates to a greater number of households
this year and therefore provide more help to tackle fuel poverty. For

understanding is that the access to that group is determined by pension
credit—either the guaranteed credit or the savings credit. I
think that there is an age threshold of 75 and above for either savings
credit or the guaranteed credit; for those below that age, it is just
the guaranteed credit. Part of my question is, if it is because fewer
people have been able to access pension credit—we know that

moment with the single-tier pension. One consequence of that Bill is
that, from April 2016, pension credit or savings credit is being
abolished<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T16:09:45"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T16:05:34"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, people who retire on or after that date will not be entitled
to the savings
credit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T16:09:48"></hs_TimeCode>. Fewer
will be entitled to the guarantee credit because the idea of the single
state pension effectively is to have a pension which is at the current
guaranteed pension credit level or slightly above it. The income of
people will not be substantially different but they may be swapping
state pension for what was a guarantee credit
top-up<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T16:10:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403039000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#1403039000048">Therefore,
there are two categories of people; namely, those currently entitled to
savings credit, which will disappear in April 2016, and those currently
entitled to guarantee credit who will end up with broadly equivalent
income but will get it via the single-tier pension and not via the
guarantee credit. If those two avenues, which I understand are the
access to the core group, are no longer available, what discussions
have taken place? What focus has there been on any alternative route
and access to the warm home discount scheme? I am sure that the

Lord, Lord McKenzie, quite rightly asked about the size of the core
group. If it is any consolation, I asked a similar point in the
briefing because it also occurred to me that the size is smaller than
was forecast. The explanation is that the DWP forecast the size of the
core group at the start of each year, and during the course of 2013 the
accuracy of its forecast was affected by greater than normal volatility
in economic conditions and various policy changes, including the
details of pension credit eligibility. In addition, the DWP’s
principal focus in forecasting is for the pension credit population as
a whole rather than the specific eligibility element used in the warm
home discount eligibility. That, therefore, is the precise reason why
that group was smaller than was

My Lords, these regulations will help to maintain the
smooth operation of the business rates retention scheme in England. The
scheme allows local authorities to retain up to 50% of business rates
income in their area, which provides a direct incentive and a boost to
those authorities that go for growth. This incentive could deliver a
£10 billion boost to the economy by 2020.</hs_para>

introduced last April and since then we have continued to hold
discussions with local government on how it operates in practice. These
regulations make some technical changes to the rules for calculating
the levy and safety net under the business rates retention scheme,
which we have identified as a result of those discussions. All of the
changes we are making today have been agreed with representatives of
local government.</hs_para>

scheme includes a safety net system to protect those authorities which,
for whatever reason, see a large drop in their business rates income.
The safety net ensures that no authority’s income from the rates
retention scheme can drop by more than 7.5% below their baseline
funding level. Authorities in that situation receive a safety net
payment which increases their income to the 7.5% threshold.</hs_para>

authorities which, because they have such a large amount of business
rates income in comparison to their spending, are potentially able to
generate significant sums in business rates growth. These sums may be
very large when compared to the authorities’ spending
requirements. Therefore, the system includes a levy on those
authorities which can generate growth which is disproportionate to
their spending. The income from the levy is used to fund the
safety
net.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403039000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#1403039000065">These
regulations make some technical changes to that levy and safety net
system. First, the regulations, together with the original regulations
which they amend, ensure that changes to business rate reliefs
introduced by central government are not captured within the
calculation of the levy or safety net. So, for example, in the Autumn
Statement of last year the Government announced that small business
rate relief will continue to be doubled until 31 March 2015, a change
that was welcomed. This rate relief for business reduces the rates
income for local government. These regulations ensure that the
reduction in income from this change,  and other changes
introduced by the Government, are not included in the
calculation of the levy and safety
net.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1403039000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#1403039000066">We have
done this because we will separately compensate local government for
the lost rates income from central government changes to business rate
reliefs. We will do this outside the rate retention scheme using a
grant under Section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003. Indeed, the
Section 31 payments for 2013-14 have already been made, and the
payments for 2014-15 will commence in April.</hs_para>

amendments in these regulations, local authorities might also receive
compensation for the Autumn Statement measures through a reduced levy
or a safety net payment. For example, if an authority is
already on the safety net then the Autumn Statement measures would
merely increase their safety net payment, and this would duplicate the
compensation they are already receiving through the Section 31
grant.</hs_para>

regulations also make a number of technical improvements to the
original scheme. They will ensure that when an authority which is
paying a levy or receiving a safety net also chooses to reduce rate
bills using a local discount scheme, it will have to meet only the
local share of the cost of those discounts. The original regulations
required it to meet the full cost of the local discounts, which was
rightly criticised by local government, so I am pleased to be able to
correct it now. We are also taking the opportunity to correct an error
concerning the treatment of relief in an enterprise zone and we have

conclude on the noble Baroness’s assertion that these
regulations are helping to maintain the smooth operation of the new
system. It is clear from looking at what is happening to local
authority support, using the Government's own preferred measure of the
spending power of the household, that the 10 most deprived authorities
in England will lose 10 times the amount in spending power per
household compared to the 10 least deprived local
authorities between 2010-11 and 2015-16. If you look at the cumulative
cut in spending power per household over that period of 2010-11 through
to 2015-16, some of which I accept precedes the business rate retention
scheme, for the 10 most deprived authorities there is a reduction of
25.3%, while for the 25 most deprived it is 22.5% and for the 50 most
deprived it is 20.96%. However, for the 10 least deprived it
is 2.54%. Can the Minister explain how these outcomes are justified? Is
it an intent of policy that this be the outcome or some quirk that was
not intended to happen? We have seen enough of the system now to be
able to ask legitimately whether the Government really intend this
redistribution. Perhaps we could understand where it is articulated
because if we extrapolate forward what has happened over the past
couple of years the situation for local authorities, particularly those
most deprived and challenging authorities, is very dire

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> I am certainly grateful to the noble
Lord for confirming that the Opposition do not oppose these
regulations. As noble Lords will be aware, when this Government came
into power we made some changes to business rates. One of our various
changes was having measures to reduce the burden of business rates on
business; the others were to ensure that local authorities were able to
enjoy the benefits of the business rates that they collected and to do
so in a way that encouraged and supported growth, so that they would
see the benefits and enjoy some of the proceeds of that growth. We
believe that this system is working well.</hs_para>

Lord, Lord McKenzie, asked me some specific questions to which I am
happy to respond. First, he asked about the Section 31 grants, which
are 
<?notus-xml column=461?>paid to compensate local authorities for the reliefs that were announced
in the Autumn Statement. I can confirm that each local authority will
be compensated for the relief that they actually give. He also asked
about the small business relief and the share for local government. I
have been given an answer but I am struggling as I read it to recall
which point the noble Lord raised. However, I think that the plus
symbol in the regulations is 50% of the full cost of the small business
rate relief that is the local share. Does that answer the point that
the noble Lord raised? I think that he was asking about the small
business relief and the half for local government share. I may need to
come back to that one and perhaps clarify it.</hs_para>

for an update on the safety net and how that is working. In the last
financial year, we have paid £69 million in safety net payments.
Those numbers may change when outturn figures are available at the end
of the year but, at the moment, I cannot give him any further
information. I should make it clear that while I said “the last
financial year”, it is the current financial year in which we
are paying £69 million in safety net payments.
Clearly, as we are still in that financial year I am not able to give
him the final data on that number.</hs_para>

question that I was struggling to answer, I think that the symbol that
the noble Lord was asking about is T. In Regulation 4, there is a
calculation and, in that rather scientific-looking formula in the
regulations, T is 50% of the amount of small business rate relief given
to local ratepayers. In other words, it is the amount of relief given
as a result of the Government’s decision to double small
business rate relief in 2013-14 and 2014-15. I hope that that clarifies
the noble Lord’s question.</hs_para>

£120 million from revenue support grant to pay for the safety
net in 2014-15. If it is not needed, we will return it to authorities.
I think that the noble Lord asked me how much of the safety net was
being paid for out of the revenue support grant beyond that collected
via the levy from those authorities that operate a surplus, if I can
describe it in that way.</hs_para>

pointed to paragraph 7.7 of the Explanatory Memorandum and asked for
examples of other discretionary relief that will be ignored, as
described in that paragraph. I spoke about other Localism Act relief
schemes. These are local authority-run schemes, such as that in Croydon
town centre. These regulations ensure that local authorities pay only
their local share of the cost of those schemes. To expand briefly on
that, we are saying—as the noble Lord understands and as I
mentioned—that we have given local authorities the power to
introduce their own discounts and reliefs. However, we need to ensure
that, in introducing those discounts and offering those reliefs, they
have to meet only 50% of the costs and not the full costs. The deal is
that central government will meet half those costs, so we are amending
the regulations to ensure that what we intend is borne out in
practice.</hs_para>

some statistics on how the scheme is operating, our latest estimates
show that business rates income in the next financial year,
2014-15,  
<?notus-xml column=462?>will be £22.4 billion, of which half, £11.2 billion, will
flow directly to local government under the rates retention scheme.
Local government will also retain a further £112 million for
enterprise zones, renewable projects and collection costs. Some 92% of
authorities will have more money in 2014-15 than their baseline funding
level. Therefore, in only its second year, the rates retention scheme
is delivering benefits for authorities that go for growth.</hs_para>

Lord’s point about spending power more generally and the way in
which local authorities are funded, he will know, because we have
debated this in the past, that this Government are very clear that the
changes we have made to how local authorities are funded represent the
difference between us and the previous Government in principle. We are
ensuring that areas of the country that are not currently in a position
to benefit as much from this new system of going for growth are
properly supported and that the grants that they receive and the
spending power that is set for those areas reflect the pressures on
them in terms of demands on their local services and the time that it
may take them to be in a strong position to go for growth. We think
that the way in which we have changed how local authorities are funded
is right. We also think that the principle of encouraging growth is
right.</hs_para>

regard to towns and high streets, we are also making sure that local
businesses have the right environment to be able to expand and
flourish. The changes that we make, whether they are to business rates
or other measures, such as tackling parking charges or development
regulations in towns, mean that where there is potential for growth,
that growth takes place and local authorities are able to benefit from
it. They, in turn, can pass on the benefits to their local
taxpayers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030318000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030318000010">I

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> Before the Minister sits down, I am
grateful for some very detailed responses there. On the safety net for
2014-15, I think that she gave us a figure for the top-sliced amount.
Can we have a figure for what is expected to be raised from the levy?
Reverting to the more general point, one can see an argument in favour
of encouraging people to go for growth, but if we look at what has
actually happened in people’s loss of spending power, do the
Government believe that it is right that the most deprived authorities
should lose much more in percentage terms than the least deprived
authorities? Is that an outcome of government policy which the Minister
is happy with and believes is
right?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030318000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030318000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Stowell of Beeston" PimsId="5900" UID="14030318000016" xid="2111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030318000016">Baroness
Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> On the specific question of money
expected to be raised by the levy, I shall have to follow up in
writing. As to the more general point about spending power, the point
that I was trying to make to the noble Lord is that this Government are
ensuring that those areas of the country in greatest need are properly
supported. Spend per household in those areas is higher than in those
areas that are  
<?notus-xml column=463?>wealthier. We certainly want to ensure that our approach supports all

Lordships may be aware, these statutory instruments are a significant
part of a package of secondary legislation required to bring into being
the new family court. Section 17 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013

of appeals order. The Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984
provides that if any party to proceedings in the family court is
dissatisfied with the decision of the court, that party may appeal to
the Court of Appeal. The Administration of Justice Act 1960 provides
that if any party to proceedings in the family court is dissatisfied
with a decision relating to contempt of court, that party may appeal to
the Court of Appeal. The destination of appeals order aims to route

will speak first about appeals against decisions in the family court,
except those relating to contempt. The objective of this order is
largely to enable replication of the current position whereby appeals
from magistrates and of district judges do not go to the Court of
Appeal. Rerouting appeals away from the Court of Appeal is not new. It
is a well established principle that appeals should normally be heard
at a lower level than the Court of Appeal. In the family court the
intention is that they will be heard by a higher level of judge than
the one who made the decision being
appealed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030334000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000008">So<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T16:46:11"></hs_TimeCode>
the intention is that generally, for the single family court, the same
judges will be hearing appeals as now, but they will be sitting as a
family court judge, rather than as a county court judge or in the High
Court. Subject to your Lordships’ approval, the effect of this
instrument will be that appeals from a decision or order of the judges
or officeholders listed in the order are routed away from the Court of
Appeal to the family
court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030334000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000009">For<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T16:46:35"></hs_TimeCode>
example, where there is an appeal against a decision of a bench of lay
justices, or a district judge sitting in the family court, about which
parent a child should live with, or whether a care order should be made
in relation to a child, that appeal will be heard in the family court
not the Court of Appeal. As I said earlier, this is not new. At present
an appeal from the decision in family proceedings of lay justices or a
district judge sitting in the magistrates’ court, or of a
district judge sitting in a county court, is heard in a county
court.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14030334000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000010">The
level of judge that can deal with appeals routed to the family court by
the destination order will be set out in a different statutory
instrument under Section 31D of the Matrimonial and Family
Proceedings Act 1984. It will be made by the Lord Chief Justice, or his
nominated officer, after consultation with the Family Procedure Rule
Committee and with the agreement of the Lord Chancellor. That
instrument is not yet before Parliament, but I can reassure noble Lords
that the plan is for appeals in the family court to be heard by a
circuit judge, as now. However, there will be greater flexibility to
ensure that judicial resources are used more efficiently and that the
appeal is heard at an appropriate level. For example, there will be
provision for a judge of High Court level sitting in the family court
to be able to hear an appeal which would otherwise be heard by a
circuit judge, where a designated family judge or a judge of High Court
level considers that the appeal would raise an important point of
principle or practice.</hs_para>

also noted that this order makes provision for decisions of certain
tribunal judges and court martial judges to be routed away from the
Court of Appeal. I should explain that this provision seeks to
future-proof the legislation. These judges cannot currently hear family
proceedings, but the Crime and Courts Act 2013 provides for more
flexible deployment of the judiciary to make efficient use of
resources. It provides for tribunal and court martial judges to be
judges in the criminal, civil and family courts and for the judges of
those courts to be tribunal judges. Although there is no immediate
intention to deploy these judges in the family court, they are in fact
judges of the family court. It would not be appropriate for appeals
against the decisions of those tribunal and court martial judges listed
in the draft destination order to go to the Court of Appeal, so this
order routes appeals against any decision which they may make in the
family court away from the Court of Appeal to the family
court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030334000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000012">In
addition, appeals against decisions by deputy district judges and
justices’ clerks will be routed away from the Court of Appeal to

turn briefly to appeals against decisions relating to contempt.
Currently the route of appeal for decisions concerning contempt of
court is complex. The draft order we are considering today simplifies
the routes of appeal so that appeals against such decisions will follow
the same route as appeals against other decisions of the family court.
The Crime and Courts Act 2013 enabled us to do this so that the process
is streamlined and more transparent.</hs_para>

Justices’ Clerks and Assistants Rules, known together as the
Justices’ Clerks Rules. The Crime and Courts Act 2013 provides

already exists that allows for justices’ clerks and their

perform functions of the court. Existing rules made under that

family court, new rules are needed to specify the 
<?notus-xml column=466?>functions of the family court or of judges of the court which
justices’ clerks and their assistants will be authorised to
carry out.</hs_para>

the passage of the Bill this House expressed some concern about which
functions justices’ clerks would be able to perform in the new
family court. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, put down an
amendment at some stage which concerned this issue. I reassure the
Committee that the draft rules being considered today have been agreed
by the President of the Family Division as the Lord Chief
Justice’s nominee, and were developed in close consultation with
the Family Procedure Rule Committee. My noble friend Lord McNally gave
an indication of our plans to the House on Report, and these draft
rules reflect those plans. Therefore the draft rules allow
justices’ clerks to continue to perform broadly the same
functions as they currently do in family proceedings
courts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030334000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000018">However<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T16:52:11"></hs_TimeCode>,
as previously explained to the House, they will be able to perform
those functions in cases allocated to any level of judge of the family
court rather than just when a case is allocated to lay magistrates,
which provides greater flexibility. Therefore justices’ clerks
will be able to assist in progressing cases, freeing up judges to deal
with the more complex parts of the case. This should increase the
efficiency of the family court and help reduce delay—something
that we know can adversely affect cases with children
involved.</hs_para>

rules will also allow justices’ clerks to perform some functions
for the first time. For example, these rules will allow a
justices’ clerk to perform certain functions in undefended
divorce or separation cases. These cases are relatively
straightforward, but because of the volume of applications they take up
a significant amount of district judges’ time. Allowing
justices’ clerks to perform these functions will allow judges
more time to deal with more complex matters. However, I stress that
justices’ clerks will not be able to deal with any case where
the application for divorce or other order is defended. These will
continue to be dealt with by judges of the family
court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030334000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000020">The
draft rules also provide for assistant justices’ clerks, as now,
to be able to perform functions when authorised by a justices’
clerk. In all cases, justices’ clerks and their assistants are
subject to a duty to refer matters back to the court if, when
considering carrying out an authorised function, they consider that it
would be inappropriate for them to carry out that function. This is a
duty to which justices’ clerks and their assistants are
currently subject in the existing rules, so it is replicated in these
draft rules.</hs_para>

emphasise that although justices’ clerks and assistant
justices’ clerks are employed by Her Majesty’s Courts and
Tribunals Service, they are not subject to the direction of the Lord
Chancellor or any other person when carrying out the functions set out
in these rules or when giving legal advice or assistance to lay judges
of the family court. They act independently, just as a judge
would.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14030334000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000022">These
rules largely replicate the functions that justices’ clerks can
currently carry out for the court. They have been carefully considered
by the members of the Family  
<?notus-xml column=467?>Procedure Rule Committee, and the president of the Family Division, who
has agreed them. The rules will allow the extensive knowledge, skills
and experience of justices’ clerks to be used, over time, to
free up judges to deal with more complex cases and to improve the
efficiency of the courts. I would further expect this to reduce delay
and provide an improved service for families who need to use the new
family court.</hs_para>

consider the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (Family Court:
Consequential Provision) Order which makes amendments to primary
legislation required because of the creation of the new family court.
Already a number of changes to primary legislation in the Crime and
Courts Act 2013 are required because of the creation of the new family
court. However, as is often the case with a change as complex as the
creation of the family court, further changes to primary legislation
are required to ensure the family court can operate effectively.
Section 59 of the 2013 Act gives a power to make provision in
consequence of the 2013 Act. This order will be made under that power
and provides for various amendments to primary legislation which are
needed as a consequence of the setting up of the single family court.
It mainly replaces references in primary legislation to
magistrates’ courts and county courts with references to the
family court, as the magistrates' courts and county courts will no
longer be able to hear family proceedings when the new family court is
commenced.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14030334000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000024">The amendments to
primary legislation set out in the order are required to ensure that
the family court can deal with matters such as the enforcement of
maintenance orders, which currently are often dealt with in
magistrates’ courts but in future will be dealt with in the
family court. The order also removes references to matters which will
no longer be dealt with in magistrates’ courts. It will enable
legal aid payments to be paid for advocacy in the family court, in
circumstances to be specified in legal aid legislation. It also makes
other amendments to primary legislation to ensure that the family court
can deal with all the matters that it needs to, such as an application
from a creditor in relation to a judgment debt, for information about
what enforcement action to take to recover that debt.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14030334000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000025">The instruments
presented today will enable the creation of a new family court that
will be able to operate more effectively and efficiently, and provide
an improved service to the families who need to use the court. The
creation of a simpler court structure should make it easier for those
who need to use the courts to do so. They will no longer have to work
out to which tier of court to submit their application. Instead they
will just submit it to the family court in their area and it will be
allocated to the appropriate level of judge. Cases will no longer need
to be transferred between the old tiers of court. Court users should
experience a more streamlined and efficient service with a significant
reduction in delays. These measures, together with others, will give
the judiciary, working together with Her Majesty’s Courts and
Tribunals Service, greater flexibility and allow it to respond to
differences in demand to ensure the most efficient use of judicial and
court resources.</hs_para>

Jones (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his pithy
and customarily helpful remarks. My questions stem from the most
honourable tradition of asking questions in a Parliament to a Minister.
Will he give specific reasons why the Government have resolved to end
the interests of magistrates’ courts and county courts in these
courts? That question is linked to another: shall we truly have more
flexible and more efficient family courts? What were the
magistrates’ courts doing wrong and what were their
shortcomings? Why has it been resolved to end the historic relevance of
the magistrates’ court with its three citizens? What insights
have informed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T16:05:34"></hs_TimeCode>
these decisions? Can we be absolutely assured that in the new
arrangements the primacy of the interests of the child will be always
borne in mind? Is that a reason for this large change? Surely we can
raise this matter in this Committee and surely it has always informed
Ministers and those who advise
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:00:24"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:00:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14030334000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000097">5

existing family courts not have great experience in handling these very
difficult, delicate and important child-centred matters? We need to
have some specific reasons as to why this long-standing experience of
those courts is being put aside so decisively. Were these changes by
the Government presaged in their electoral manifestos? Were they to be
seen there, or has this come forward since the formation of the
coalition

can we have an itemisation of the kinds of bodies and persons that were
consulted in the Family Justice Review? I note that
paragraph 8 of the helpful Explanatory Memorandum to the Crime and
Courts Act 2013 (Family Court: Consequential Provision) Order makes
reference to consultation, but it is very hard to understand the nature
of that consultation. On a matter as important as this, on an historic
shift, we should be able to have some detail before your Lordships come

the Government promulgating the view that the long-standing lay
magistrate is incapable of thoughtful and sympathetic decisions when
compared to a senior judge? We have heard judges of senior rank being
referred to in the Minister’s helpful remarks. Is it perceived
that wisdom now dwells only in the thoughts and mind of the senior
judge<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:02:50"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030334000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000031">On
the Justices’ Clerks and Assistants Rules, are there enough
justices’ clerks? I have established that for all of north and
mid-Wales there is but one justices’ clerk, who is based in
Llanelli, which is some 150 miles south and west. On that basis, it is
a relevant question to ask. Are there enough? I have given that
instance, helpfully and positively, and that is surely the case in
other parts of England and Wales. That has great relevance to the
issues that the Minister has so helpfully
described<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:03:57"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:04:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030334000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000032">Furthermore,
is it appropriate to raise a problem that exists throughout the rural
parts of our country—namely, the problem of travel? In many
parts of England 
<?notus-xml column=469?>and Wales, rural travel sometimes does not exist in terms of bus
services, which are not cheap or frequent and are never organised for a
citizen to go from a village or a town to a given court. We should have
some persuasive insights from the Minister on that
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:04:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030334000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000033">I
am thinking, too, of the cost of hiring a taxi. To travel even eight,
nine or 10 miles is expensive. It is likely that the new proposals, as
adumbrated by the Minister, will come down heaviest on the least
favoured citizens of our communities—those who are not wealthy
or prosperous. We should try, when we look at the details of this
legislation, to consider the predicament of ordinary people: for
example, the younger mother with a young teenager who needs to steer
that youngster to the court. Members of this Committee may have greater
insights into this than me. Without a doubt, ordinary people will find
that the consequence of this legislation is to make things more
difficult for them at a very important time in their family
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:05:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030334000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000034">The
closure of magistrates’ courts throughout England and Wales has
gone on apace under successive Governments, and insufficient
consideration has been given to the impact of the closure of these
courts. It is reasonable, therefore, to ask where these family courts
will be centred. In Wales, will it just be in Cardiff, Caernarfon, Mold
or Swansea? How will the ordinary citizen get to those courts? It might
be helpful if there were some consequential assurances on
these
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:06:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030334000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000035">On
the same issue—consultation—the Family Procedure Rule
Committee has been consulted in the course of drafting this instrument.
The Explanatory Memorandum to the Justices’ Clerks and
Assistants Rules says so. In all of this, has the executive committee
of the Magistrates’ Association been consulted? Has it given a
view? Is it the same view as that of the justices’
clerks’ organisation? Was there tension? Are there difficulties?
Have there been differences? It would be helpful to know from the
Minister whether that is the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:07:31"></hs_TimeCode>. I do not

noble friend has expressed, which are not, strictly speaking, germane
to the matters that we are debating this afternoon, raise concerns
which I share and which, indeed, I have raised from time to time. They
are also concerns which the Magistrates’ Association
shares—that is, the current size of Benches that have been
amalgamated and the position now occupied by the justices’

magistrates but are responsible upwards, as it were, to the Ministry of

noble friend rightly refers to the accessibility of courts and the
closure of court buildings. However, one matter to which he has not

is the apparent growth in the role of full-time or part-time
professional district judges as opposed to lay magistrates. There is
concern about the imbalance that that is creating. Nowadays, some cases
are dealt with virtually exclusively by district judges and the lay
judges have a diminished role in consequence. These are genuine
concerns which I think we need to explore further, but not for the

my 40-odd years—some of them rather odd indeed—practised
as a solicitor and have spent much time briefing counsel. I am
experiencing something of a role reversal today, because I have
benefited from briefing from a distinguished family law practitioner,
Michael Horton. I do not know whether he is somebody with whom the
Minister is acquainted but he is an experienced counsel dealing with
family matters. He raises a number of issues which do not undermine the

to the appeal to the family court. Where, within the family court, does
the appeal lie? In other words, who in the family court will deal with
the appeal? The Civil Procedure Rules lay out a definition of who will
hear appeals. At the moment, it appears that a new practice direction
to the Family Procedure Rules will identify the destination of
appeals—that is, not just the broad destination of the family
court, which, as I have just emphasised, reaches from the magistracy
right through, ultimately, to the Court of Appeal—but what tier
of the judiciary will deal with it? I understood the Minister to say
that that either has happened or is about to happen—that the
rules will be promulgated. They are to come into force in six or seven
weeks’ time. I take it that they have been 
<?notus-xml column=471?>the subject of consultation and I should be grateful if the Minister
could confirm that. If, by any chance, they have not yet been the
subject of consultation, I strongly urge that they be made

not a criticism at all but it arises from a welcome change to which I
do not think the Minister specifically referred. It is the possibility
of funding emerging from the change in rules which will allow payments
to be made to charities, to be ordered by the family court. I am not
quite clear of the intention here. but one hopes that such payments
could cover the advice services provided by voluntary organisations to
those engaged in family disputes. It would be helpful to have
clarification of whether that is in fact the intention. It could make a
significant difference in facilitating support for litigants who are
not able to pay for or obtain legal aid for advice, as would be the
case in a number of instances, if voluntary organisations could be the
recipients of money as the result of such an order.</hs_para>

Horton refers to one matter which has apparently been overlooked
completely. It should be said, of course, that arguably everything we
are discussing today could and perhaps should have been dealt with at
an earlier stage, but we are where we are. The matter of interest is
one that I was certainly not aware of. At the moment, if an order is
made in the higher courts—for example, the High Court or the
county court—and a lump sum order is made which is not paid on
time, it automatically carries interest at the judgment rate. However,
there is apparently no provision at all for interest on orders made by
the family court. I invite the Minister to look at that and, if
necessary, to bring forward appropriate further regulations if they are
required to ensure that interest would be payable on such an order. It
would be anomalous if it were not; if other judgments carry interest,
so, clearly, should payments
here<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:16:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030334000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000047">The
final point is, again, not to offer any opposition to what is being
done but to note the irony that the Government are allowing a greater
role here for justices’ clerks, and indeed assistant clerks, in
making decisions in what would basically be the simpler issues in
family proceedings, such as uncontested divorces and the like. However,
at the same time they are increasing the cost of initiating divorce
proceedings. The fees will go up from apparently £410 to
£750, while the level of decision-making will often be at a
lower and therefore clearly a less costly level than now. The current
cost is estimated at about £250 a case, so the Government are
doing rather well out of this devolution of decision-making to rather
lower-paid members of the family court, as they would be, particularly
if justices’ clerks or assistant clerks were taking that kind of
decision. That raises the question of the reasonableness of the
Government increasing the fees in the first place. Again, I invite the
Minister and the department to look again at the increase in cost that
they are proposing, particularly in relation to cases which are of the
simpler kind. I suspect that it should be possible to distinguish
between those undefended matters, simple matters, and those which are
contested, where a higher fee may be more
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:18:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

said all that, we do not in any way dissent from the proposals in so
far as we have them. Perhaps there are areas which require attention,
and we look forward to the department and the Minister perhaps coming
back with one or two modest further improvements to the position which
we will reach

Beecham, for his

central question behind the speech given by the noble Lord, Lord Jones,
was, “Why do we need this reorganisation of a family court, and
why ignore the experience there was in the magistrates’
court?”, and that we should take into account in particular the
convenience for local people to use their magistrates’ court. I
quite understand that concern. However, as the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham, quite rightly said, we will not lose that expertise.
Magistrates will still deal with family proceedings, but within the
overall context of a family court. Previously we had these various
tiers, but now we have a unified court. However, they will all be the
family court, albeit some will sit in magistrates’ courts, some
in county courts and others will physically sit in the High Court,
depending on the allocation and the level of the dispute. So that
much-valued expertise will not be
lost<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:19:40"></hs_TimeCode>. What is
intended, as I indicated in my opening remarks, is that there should be
increased flexibility and a better use of appropriate judicial
resources. I am not sure that those qualified lawyers who act as
justices’ clerks would welcome being described as a lower level
of judge, as the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, described them. They are
very often qualified and, if not qualified, have a considerable amount
of relevant experience, and they will not be given any tasks that they
are performing now and will perform in future unless it is clear that
they have relevant experience and
expertise<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:20:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030334000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000051">The
creation of the family court was recommended by the family justice
review. It was considered that the new structure would limit delays and
simplify the whole question of people who go to their local area with a
particular issue, which will then be allocated to the appropriate level
of court. It will not be the enemy of localism, which I think was the
concern expressed by the noble Lord, Lord

hope that I can at least reassure the noble Lord that the magistracy
will still be involved in the matter, as it was before, and will not
lose its expertise—it will simply be called something different.

closure of courts generally is a different issue from that which we are
considering. There are always difficult arguments on the cost of having
a court that is infrequently used as against the convenience for 
<?notus-xml column=473?>local people. We are of course anxious that the quality of
decision-making should be high and that there should be convenience,
and we do not anticipate that there will be a radical change in
individual cases. The noble Lord mentioned the position in Llanelli,
where he feared that there would not be enough local expertise. I am
assured that there would not be a radical transfer unless the court
service was satisfied that there was the appropriate level of expertise
in a local

turn to issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Beecham. He said that he
was concerned that there had not yet been a specific route for the
appeals identified. I indicated in the course of my remarks that they
would be set out in a statutory instrument under Section 31D of the
Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984, which would be made by the
Lord Chief Justice or his nominated officer after consultation with the
Family Procedure Rule Committee and with the agreement of the Lord
Chancellor. The rules are made with the consultation of the committee,
which includes expert practitioners, justices’ clerks and
judges. It also includes a representative of the court users, so it
should be possible before the appropriate tier of appeal is finalised
for all interested parties to have an opportunity to have their views
reflected in the designation. Although I understand the noble
Lord’s anxiety, it is unlikely that he will find the
organisation of appeals in any sense out of sync with the construction
of appeals that exist generally in civil procedure—that is,
there will be an appeal from a court to a higher level of court and,
depending on where the initial allocation begins, a superior court will
then come to consider the relevant
appeal<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:24:34"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:24:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:22:57"></hs_TimeCode>.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:24:40"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="14030334000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000056">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:12:55"></hs_TimeCode>

the Magistrates’ Association, which was very helpfully answered
by the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, who was able to confirm that it had
been consulted. The statutory obligation was to consult the family
practitioners’ rules committee, which comprises representatives
of the lay magistracy, justices’ clerks and a number of judges,
so it would have been included in any event in that
consultation.</hs_para>

Beecham, asked about payments to charity. I am told that the amendment
to Section 194 of the Legal Services Act 2007 will mean that the family
court will be able to order a party to make a payment to a charity.
This mirrors the current position in the civil courts and applies where
a party has been represented free of charge. It will be for the court
in the individual case to determine to which charity the payment should
be made. I hope that that answers that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:25:49"></hs_TimeCode>. The noble
Lord also made a point about the increase in costs and the fees for
divorce going up. Yes, if it is dealt with at a lower level then I

are managers, so there is one in each

regulations are being introduced in order to fully comply with European
directive 2010/41, which was adopted on 24 June 2010 following
negotiation between member states. The directive assures equal

8 of the directive legislates for a maternity allowance to be paid to
self-employed women and spouses or civil partners who habitually

their spouse or civil partner’s business by regularly helping
out in an unpaid capacity could bring themselves within coverage of the
maternity allowance and other social protection by becoming partners

incentives for doing this, which include tax benefits for the business
and greater social protection for the woman. However, for women who do
not wish to take these steps we must bring forward these regulations to

The higher rate and longer payment period of maternity allowance is
intended to provide a measure of earnings replacement to enable women
to take a break in their occupation at the end of their pregnancy or
soon after childbirth. It would not be right to make a corresponding
award of maternity allowance to women who have no earnings to replace.

Scott of Needham Market (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I support the
social security regulation which we are debating today—not just
because it avoids an €11 million fine. I think it is
a good thing in its own right. For once, we have a welcome change to
the benefits system in that it is beginning genuinely to reflect the
diversity of people’s lives and the lives of women in the
workforce. That is a very good thing indeed. It is bringing a new group
of women, predominantly from the very small, micro-business sector,
within the ambit of maternity benefit. I just wish that the
gold-plating had been left in place just on this one occasion so that
they could have had a benefit more in line with everyone

want to ask two questions. The first is about disseminating
information, because this is a very difficult group to reach. They do
not tend to be members of chambers of commerce, and that sort of thing.
I do not have a particular answer, but I wanted to put in the plea that
all efforts are made to ensure that women who are likely to benefit
actually know about it and are able to. We hope that the
Government’s new enterprise allowance scheme will be successful,
so we could have even more very small businesses starting up in the
coming year or so, so we need to get on top of how we can ensure that
women know that these benefits are

I welcome the discussions on shared parental leave—I know that
the Deputy Prime Minister has been very keen on this and it has some

Sherlock (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
explanation and I look forward to hearing the answers to those two
excellent
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:39:25"></hs_TimeCode>. I do
not propose to ask any questions about the second order, as I accept
the Minister’s assurance that it is consequential upon the
first. However, I should like to ask a few questions so as to
understand better the implications of the first order, relating to
maternity allowance.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14030334000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030334000079">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:39:41"></hs_TimeCode>
first question relates to the point that has just been made about the
rate being so low. The standard rate of maternity allowance is
£136 a week, or 90% of average weekly earnings, for up to 39
weeks. In this case, the Government decided to settle on £27 a
week for 14 weeks. I think I heard the Minister say that the aim of the
allowance was to enable women who regularly help in the business of a
spouse or civil partner to take a break from their activities towards
the end of a pregnancy or the start of motherhood. Have the Government
made any assessment of whether the amount of money involved is such
that it is likely to make taking that break possible when otherwise it
would not have
been<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:40:16"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Explanatory Note says that 1,300 women will be affected by the
provisions at an estimated cost of £0.5 million. No impact
assessment was carried out, so we do not know whether the Government
considered other approaches. Clearly, there is quite a wide range
between what the Government are doing and an allowance that is fully
gold-plated. Did the Government consider bringing this in at an
intermediate level and, if so, what kind of cost would have been
implied<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:40:41"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

should be interested in understanding what conditions a claimant would
have to meet to qualify for maternity allowance under these
circumstances. We have had a question about shared parental leave. I
should also be interested in knowing what happens to someone who is
adopting a child rather than giving birth, as the regulations are
specifically about giving birth or having just given birth. Looking at
the regulations, I do not think that someone in these circumstances
would be entitled to statutory adoption pay, so would they be entitled
to maternity allowance? Similarly, what happens if the child is
stillborn or dies immediately after birth? Certainly, I think that SMP
is payable if a child is stillborn after 24 weeks, but is there a
read-across to this
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:41:25"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

question about communication because I was going to ask something
similar. The Minister made the very good point that there may be strong
reasons why women in these circumstances may be better off being paid
by the business and being able to pay national insurance. I am very
conscious that the Pensions Bill is going through the House at the
moment. Of course, if a woman in these circumstances does not end up
with 35 years of national insurance payments in her own
right, she may find that when she comes to retire she is not entitled
to the new single-tier pension, and in future she will not be able to
claim on her husband’s contributions either. Therefore, when the
Minister looks at the communications campaign, I wonder whether
anything can be done to make sure that the opportunity is taken to
communicate to those women so that they understand the consequences of
not paying national insurance and of not coming within the national
insurance and tax
system<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:42:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I have a practical question. Can the Minister explain the tax and tax

who are entitled  
<?notus-xml column=479?>to maternity leave, statutory maternity pay or maternity allowance

self-employment, what tasks she performed and how often. Each claim
will be decided on its merits. From the information I have just
described the decision-maker will decide whether the woman has
regularly undertaken the same, or ancillary, tasks of her self-employed

of why the rate of payment is so low, I covered that to some extent in
my opening remarks, in saying that we were seeking to comply with the
minimum of the EU directive. We have made no specific assessment of
whether it is enough money to encourage parents to take a break.
However, the Government have an overall objective to avoid gold-plating
EU legislation. This means that we should not go beyond the minimum
requirements of European directives. The benefit will, therefore, be
paid for the minimum duration allowed by the directive—that
being 14 weeks—and at a weekly rate equivalent to the lowest

start by touching briefly on the Guaranteed Minimum Pensions Increase
Order, which provides for contracted-out defined benefits schemes to
increase their members’ guaranteed minimum pensions that accrued
between 1988 and 1997 by 2.7%, which is in line with inflation as at
September 2013<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:51:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
As noble Lords will be aware, we are not here to discuss the Welfare
Benefits Up-rating Order 2014, which was made on 24 January. The rates
increased by 1% in that order were debated in Parliament during the
passage of the Welfare Benefits Up-rating Act 2013.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14030346000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030346000003">Turning to the Social
Security Benefits Up-rating Order, I would like to start with the
increase in the basic state pension. One of this Government’s
first acts was to restore the earnings link to the basic state pension.
Indeed, we went a step further and secured a triple lock for
pensioners—a commitment from the Government to increase the
basic state pension each year by earnings, prices or 2.5%, whichever is
the highest. This year, as prices were greater than average earnings
and the 2.5%, the basic state pension will increase by CPI at
2.7%<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:51:59"></hs_TimeCode>. The new
rate of basic state pension will be £113.10 a week for a single
person, an increase of £2.95 from last year. This means that
from April 2014 the basic state pension is forecast to be around 18% of
average earnings, a higher share of average earnings than at any time
since 1992. Our triple lock commitment means that someone on a full
basic state pension can expect to receive £440 a year more than
if it had been up-rated by earnings since the start of this
Parliament.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14030346000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030346000004"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:52:36"></hs_TimeCode>On
pension credit, we have taken an important decision to ensure that the
poorest pensioners are able to benefit from the effects of our triple
lock. That means that, rather than rising in line with earnings at
1.6%—the minimum required by legislation—the standard
minimum guarantee credit in pension credit will be increased by 2% so
that the poorest pensioners benefit from the full cash value of the
increase in basic state pension. Single people will receive an increase
of £2.95 a week while couples will receive an increase of
£4.45 a week.
Consistent<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:53:15"></hs_TimeCode> with
our approach last year, the resources needed to pay for that
above-earnings increase to the standard minimum guarantee have been
found by increasing the savings credit threshold, which means that
those with higher levels of income will see less of an
increase.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030346000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030346000005">I
can confirm that additional state pensions will rise in line with
inflation at 2.7% in 2014-15. That means that the total state pension
increase for someone with a full basic pension and average additional
pension will be around £196 a year. The decisions we have taken
on pensioners reflect the Government’s belief that even in
difficult economic times it is important to protect those who are less
able to increase their spending
power.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:53:55"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

belief is reflected in our decision to ensure that those benefits that
reflect additional costs because of disability will be protected and

<?notus-xml column=482?>the full value of CPI at 2.7%. These include the personal independence
payment, disability living allowance, attendance allowance, incapacity
benefit, disability premiums in working-age benefits, the support
component of the employment and support allowance, and the limited

credit. That is also true of the carer’s allowance and the carer

conclusion, I ask your Lordships to note that at a time when the

German (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I have a number of questions.
First, I welcome the triple lock. This is the first time that we have
seen prices as the lock that has come into play, which means that
pensioners will always benefit from the best of the three options. This
is the first time we have seen one of the three
locks<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:55:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030346000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030346000010">I
will spend a few moments on the rationale behind the 1%, 2% and 0.7%
for the pensions and other matters. This is really about what is
contained in the Government Actuary’s report. For the first
time, we see from the Government Actuary what the state of the fund
is—the fund from which these benefits will be paid—not
just for this year but through to 2018-19. I believe that this is the
first time we have been able to have those projections. The report
clearly shows that there are a number of difficult years to come, in
particular 2015-16. Next year the actuary projects that the Government
will have to put in £8 billion extra in order to keep the fund
at its one-sixth level of what goes in and what comes out, and what is
left in the fund. However, the last table of the Government
Actuary’s report shows that the following year will be even more
difficult. Can we have some comparison for benefits’
sake?</hs_para>

will be quite happy if my noble friend wishes to send me information
about this or to write to me about it. As we are projecting forward six
years to 2018-19, can we have the figures showing how much has had to
be contributed in the past 10 years, say, so that each year we can see
what the graph or the direction of travel is? Quite clearly, it is not
the usual case that the Government have to top up the fund to achieve
that one-sixth balance. It might be useful to know how often that
happens and what the projections are for the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:58:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030346000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030346000012">I
have just two short questions, one of which relates to the
implementation dates in the order. I should probably know the answer to
this question, but I would be very grateful if the Minister could
answer it, although it is a question similar to, “Why do we 
<?notus-xml column=483?>always have elections on a Thursday?”. For the dates of
implementation, which are contained within this order, we have 1, 7, 9
and 10 April. I know that it does not mean very much if someone has to
wait a week longer for their benefit to come through, but why is it not
possible to have a single implementation date at the beginning of the
financial year, or is there some administrative reason for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:58:49"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030346000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030346000013">My
second and final question relates to the investments in the national
insurance fund. I noticed that the projection from the Government
Actuary is that they will fall from £127 million to £90
million. If the investments made £127 million last year, which
obviously supported the amount of money that could be put into benefits
without having to top them up from the Treasury, why do we see a lower
projection in the coming year when all the signs are that investment
opportunities are greater in the coming year than they were in the past
year? I should be grateful for some explanation, but I will be
perfectly happy if my noble friend wants to do that for me in
writing.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T18:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_time UID="14030346000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030346000065">6

Kirkwood of Kirkhope (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to
follow my noble friend Lord German, who asked some pertinent questions.
I want to take a slightly different approach and put these uprating
orders into the context of a longer timescale. As I think we all know,
changes to upratings will generate more savings for the department over
the middle to longer term than any other single change, so it is
important for Parliament to stay abreast of what is going on.</hs_para>

process. In the old days—he says, reverting immediately to
nostalgic mode—this used to be a huge debate. My noble friend
the Minister will know, because he was there and was briefly a
Minister, that the uprating order was a big event then, when we were
spending millions, not billions as now. There was a full Chamber in the
House of Commons and those numbers were keenly contested. It has now
come to this, at the fag end of a late Monday, with the Minister and
two or three lonely survivors discussing these very important matters.
We must make sure that the parliamentary process is maintained because
the scrutiny of these matters is important.</hs_para>

now have is a bit confusing to me. The Minister is absolutely right
that the Welfare Benefits Up-rating Act 2013 basically takes out the
working-age benefits from consideration this afternoon. I do not think
that is for all time coming but I am not sure. I assume that the 2013
Act will render it nugatory to discuss working-age benefits until that
Act falls away, after its third year. Presumably we will then go back
to the uprating system as before. I am also a bit nervous about losing
sight of tax credits and child credit Treasury-type benefits, which in
the old days were also all subsumed into the one comprehensive
debate.</hs_para>

am even more confused about the annually managed expenditure proposals
which the Chancellor has been talking about. I am always suspicious
about Chancellors talking about social security department business as,
in my experience, they invariably make a hash of it. 
<?notus-xml column=484?>I would stiffen the Minister’s resolve to resist these
territorial ambitions from the Treasury, which are very hard to
contain. I can see some heads nodding, so I am obviously on a strong
point there.</hs_para>

making is a simple one. In Parliament, we should insist on being able
to have proper opportunities in good time to look at the comprehensive
changes being made, even though they are getting more complicated, so
that we can satisfy ourselves that at least we know what is going on
and can make the best points to the Minister and his future heirs and
successors. I am fearful that this is becoming so piecemeal that it is
getting difficult to do. That is my first point and I suspect that the
Minister will not disagree with it.</hs_para>

what the additional costs of these orders are. They are basically
pension-orientated. I have nothing whatever to say about the Guaranteed
Minimum Pensions Increase Order. I have never had anything to say about
that order; it goes on and it goes up, and that is fine. However, my
impression is that there is £3 billion or so involved in
increased spend and I would like to know to what extent, over the
period of this order, that is derived from an increased caseload. In
the middle to longer term, the demographics will obviously change
regarding the proportion of the population. There will be more and more
pensioners, so we will have more and more trouble paying for them,
which is perhaps part of the answer to the important question that my
noble friend Lord German asked. I would not mind being copied into any
answer that he gets because it is a very important question. However,
the caseload is bound to increase, so if that number increases, the
costs will get bigger as the numbers get higher. I understand this,
perhaps, more than
most<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T17:24:31"></hs_TimeCode>. As of the
fiscal year 2014-15, we spend £211,000 million each year, every
year, which is a serious sum of money. We really need to make sure that
we understand how we are spending it and that we get control and make
it as effective as we can. I should like to know the cost of these
orders, just to keep track of the

Section 150 duty on the Secretary of State in the Social Security

kind of Delphic way, the answer comes out as CPI. I hope that the

evidence coming out from the archbishop, now cardinal, and the powerful
intervention that he made about destitution. I do not think that he is
right to say that the entire safety net has been withdrawn, but he is a
serious man, and the Church of England and other churches are beginning
to pick up the fact that some serious things are emerging in their
localities. I think that they are correct about that, although I would
not go as far as to say that the safety net was being removed. But that

I think that this is more hidden—the impact on local
authorities’ service provision is beginning to be bigger than I
have ever seen before in my past experience. That is characterised
perhaps by the local welfare assistance fund, which I think the Local
Government Association was right to complain that the Government seemed
to be withdrawing funding from. These are the kinds of things which I
hope the Minister will be able to tell me were thought through
carefully in the department before the Secretary of State discharged
his duty under the 1992 Act, because they are bits of evidence that are
more cogent than I have seen in the recent past—and I have a

to go from mean average figures of inflation and prices because they

glancing reference in these regulations to universal credit and
personal independence payments—it is the first time we have seen

for these benefits. I am sure that that will become clear during the
period of the duration of these orders. Can the Minister say anything,
even if it is in writing, about the timetable for it? The press

If you do not have the professionals—and it is a very skilled

struggle to carry the weight of these hugely important and very onerous

I noticed in the Explanatory Memorandum—they are always very
instructive and helpful for these things, and I pay tribute to the poor

September 2013. I understand what service charges are and what rental
agreement deductions are in housing benefit, and that they are not new.
However, 7.7% is a big percentage. It might not be much—a couple
of pounds—but that is a big change. I was grateful that the
Explanatory Memorandum took the trouble to point it out to us. I hope
that the Minister will take that back and satisfy himself that that is
not an outlier figure as regards 2.7% increases here and there.
Particularly when energy costs have gone up so dramatically over the
recent past—there have been some quite significant
increases—7.7% is striking. If the Minister can go away and
satisfy himself that that is not a relative punitive increase in a
deduction, I would be very

has been made of the fact that the Government are uprating pensions by
the triple lock. That is welcome as far as it goes. The comments about
RPI notwithstanding, will the Minister acknowledge that the triple lock
has so far been less generous than the RPI uprating it replaced? It was
not used in the first year. I notice that my right honourable friend
Stephen Timms pointed out, when this order was debated in another
place, that the RPI last September was 3.2%, whereas the pension
uprating delivered by the order, as the Minister said, is 2.7%. My
right honourable friend said that the triple lock has delivered a lower
uprating than the previous formula in each of the three years it has
been used. The effect of that is that in RPI terms it is a real-terms
cut for the third year in a

concerning is that the standard minimum guarantee element of pension
credit is to be increased by only 2%. This reduces both its real-terms
value and its value relative to the basic state pension. One of the
consequences must be that the poorest pensioners find their pension
income falling in real terms. The Minister, I am sure, can confirm
that. I would be very interested in the Minister’s answer to the
question of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, about cost. If the value of
some of these benefits is falling, but the spend is rising, is caseload
the reason? I would be interested to

receives Royal Assent. The Government have signalled, during our
deliberations on that Bill, that they propose to introduce the new
single-tier pension at a rate above the prevailing rate of pension

Government not giving themselves the option of introducing the

also have some questions about process. I am with the noble Lord, Lord
Kirkwood: I fear that I may have lost track of some uprating that
should have happened. If I tell the Minister what I think is happening,
perhaps he will correct me where I go wrong. As I understand it, the
Welfare Benefits Up-rating Order 2014 uprates by 1% those on benefits
covered by the Welfare Benefits Up-rating Act. The protected benefits
are covered by this order. So what happens to tax credits? Where did
they get uprated? Where was the benefit cap uprated? I know that it has
been, but I am not quite sure where that happened. Also, are all the
elements of universal credit uprated in this order and, if so, where
are the work allowances uprated? I could not see
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030346000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030346000039">I have
two final questions. First, on childcare, it seems to me that the
childcare element of universal credit is not being uprated at all. Can
the Minister explain why not? If it is not being uprated at all, that
is a significant real-terms cut. The last annual childcare cost survey
in 2013 from the Family and Childcare Trust—what used to be the
Daycare Trust—found that costs had risen by an average of 6% the
previous year, more than double the rate of inflation. If the decision
is made to cut that childcare element in real terms, coming on top of
the Government’s decision to cut the proportion of childcare
costs in universal credit to 70%, will that not have a significant
impact on the ability of working parents to afford childcare? There was
no impact assessment, and I was not able to work out what the effect of
that was. Have the Government made any assessment of the impact on
working parents of that decision on childcare and, if so, what is
it?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14030346000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030346000040">Finally,
I should be very interested to hear the answers to the questions from
the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, on PIP, for example, where I have grave
concerns about the implementation. The recent report is not encouraging
in that respect. Also, I should like to understand to what extent, if
at all, the Secretary of State is using discretion in making judgments
about the appropriate levels of uprating, given the concern that
abounds now about the use of food banks and the extent of poverty among
people who are in receipt of

the National Insurance Fund running out of money. Making provision for
such grant has no overall impact on the Government’s finances.
It is done primarily for accounting purposes to ensure that the
National Insurance Fund complies with the Government Actuary’s
recommendation of maintaining a working balance of one-sixth of the
expected benefit expenditure in 2014-15. My noble friend was absolutely
correct to point out that at least now the information in the forecast
is being made available in the Government Actuary’s report. He
asked me a specific point about whether we will look at that
historically over the 10-year period. I should say that we think that
the grant has not been required over that period but, as one of the

Working-age benefits will be debated again from 2016-17. I will turn to

Tax Credits Up-rating Regulations 2014 will uprate certain elements of
tax credits by CPI from 6 April. These were laid in draft form on
12 February and are due to be debated later in March. The
Child Benefit and Tax Credits Up-rating Order 2014 will increase

noble friend Lord Kirkwood also asked about how much of the increase in
expenditure is in relation to caseload increases. Clearly, caseload is
an important 
<?notus-xml column=490?>factor in the overall expenditure, which is why it is important to make
pension spending more affordable over the longer term, including, for
example, the changes we are making through increasing the state
retirement age. As regards the delay in implementation of the personal
independence payment, PIP has been successfully introduced using a
controlled approach to learning lessons as we go along in a live
environment. We have been very clear that PIP will be introduced in a
gradual way. Disabled people have wanted us to take time to get it

generous<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T18:31:05"></hs_TimeCode> than
the comparable disregards in the existing system, which are not
uprated. This means that claimants will be able to keep more of their
earnings before their benefits are withdrawn, unlike in the current
system, whereby a claimant can effectively be penalised for moving into
work. Of course, because universal credit is much simpler, it removes
the behavioural barriers that we know many people face in getting back
into work and increasing their earnings. Overall, universal credit
still offers a better incentive to work than does the current system,
and I think that that view is shared across all parties and all sides

limited capability for work and work-related activity element of the
care element will be increased by CPI at 2.7% as part of the
Government’s decision to protect the benefits, which reflect the
additional costs of disability. Non-dependants’ housing cost
contribution will be increased by 1%, in line with the increasing use
in standard rates. The child elements, the higher disabled child

noble Baroness asked about the uprating of pension credit. Reflecting
what we have done in previous years, we have passed through the cash
increase in the basic state pension to the pension credit standard
minimum guarantee, increasing the standard minimum guarantee by 2%
rather than a statutory minimum of earnings at 1.2%. That ensures that
the poorest pensioners benefit from the triple lock increase in the
basic state pension. This is funded by an increase in the savings
credit threshold and an associated reduction in the maximum savings
credit, which means that those pensioners with slightly higher levels
of income will see less of an increase than the increase in the basic
state
pension.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030346000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030346000058"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Sherlock" PimsId="5776" UID="14030346000083" xid="2050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303-gc0001.htm#14030346000083">Baroness
Sherlock:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to the Minister for
explaining the process and what happens to the different benefits, but
I am still chewing over the information that neither the childcare
allowances nor the work allowances in universal credit will be
increased at all and are therefore facing a real-terms cut. I might
have let that go, but I am afraid that I will have to push back on his
comment that all sides of the House agree that people will be much
better off under universal credit than under the present system.
Universal credit 
<?notus-xml column=492?>is simply a delivery vehicle. Whether or not people will be better off
will depend on how generous the benefits are, the taper rates applied,
the levels of work allowance or disregard applied and the interaction
with other sources of support. In other words, unless the calculations
done previously about the gains to work and participation rates in work
are redone using these figures, we do not know whether people getting
universal credit
are<hs_TimeCode time="2014-03-03T18:34:12"></hs_TimeCode> going to be

Bates:</Member></B> I appreciate the point which the noble Baroness has
made and I was not suggesting that everybody would be better off under
this provision. The question is one of removing perceived barriers to
go back into work—to encourage people to move seamlessly off
benefits and into work—without creating disincentives. That
principle, I think I am correct in saying, is one that is widely shared
on all sides of the House. How it actually applies and is worked out
for individuals and individual families is clearly a crucial matter. On
that point, I will add that to the list of issues about which I will
write to noble Lords immediately following this debate.</hs_para>

explained that we are spending an extra £3.3 billion on uprating
pensions and benefits in 2014-15, enabling us to protect key benefits
and vulnerable groups. This order protects pensioners, many of whom
have worked hard all their lives and are no longer in a position to
increase their income through work, and benefits, which reflect the
additional costs faced by disabled people, again reflecting our
commitment to protect those least able to increase their spending
power. Those are principles which I hope all noble Lords can support
and on that basis I commend these orders to the Committee.</hs_para>

Transforming Rehabilitation reforms. The National Probation Service
(NPS) will carry out a risk assessment of all offenders and will be
responsible for the direct management of those offenders who pose the
highest risk of serious harm to the public and who have committed the
most serious offences. Every offender will be risk assessed prior to
allocation to any probation provider and their risk will be reviewed
when there are indicators that their risk of serious harm has increased
to high. Offenders who are deemed to pose a medium and low risk will be
managed by a Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC).</hs_para>

the risk assessment of offenders, we have developed a Risk of Serious
Recidivism (RSR) predictor which uses the same analytical approach as
our existing predictors OGRS and the OASys Violence Predictor (OVP).
This is an established methodology subject to quality assurance and
peer review. The predictor and user guidance has been thoroughly tested
with a number of Trusts and has been shown to be a strong predictor of
serious reoffending. Training has begun and will be cascaded through
Trusts to all staff who need to use the tool. Comprehensive user
guidance has recently been issued to Trusts to facilitate transition to
the new
processes.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question">

Kramer:</Member> Boatmasters’ Licences are normally issued with
a validity period of five years. To revalidate their licence,
Boatmasters must submit evidence of having completed a certain number
of service days in the preceding five years. The number of days is
dependent on the tier and level of the Boatmaster Licence held. Where
Boatmasters cannot provide evidence of the appropriate number of
service days, licences may be revalidated through passing a practical
boat handling examination conducted by the Maritime and Coastguard
Agency
(MCA).</hs_para><hs_para UID="14030332000392" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140303w0001.htm#14030332000392">Boatmasters
whose licences are endorsed with a Port of London local knowledge
