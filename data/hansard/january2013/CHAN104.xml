The Bill’s main purpose is to bring things onshore to the United

is placed online the point of consumption is in this country. The whole
thrust of the Bill is to bring money back into racing, and I shall
explain how. The Treasury’s proposals, which I understand can be
introduced in any Budget—perhaps not this year; possibly next
year—will restore the tax situation to those offshore betting
companies. That is not the purpose of this Bill. The main difference

disappointment at the recent closure of race courses such as Folkestone
and Hereford, and I hope that that process will be halted and kept

attend during the Royal Ascot at York week. In the past decade York
race course has invested over £30 million in capital projects,

part of its income is from the levy board, which helps to fund prize
money, and from the wider investment that York race course enjoys
through non-interest-bearing loans for capital expenditure for things
such as the new stands. Funding from the levy went towards the major
developments of the Knavesmire stand in 1996, the excellent Ebor stand

McIntosh:</Member></B> I disagree on the basis of the conversations
that I have had with the industry. Over the past five to 10 years, the
percentage change in prize money has been almost minus 8%. Racing takes
place on almost every day of the year. On 364 days of the year there is
at least one race meeting. It is only on Christmas day that there are
no meetings. That means that by any definition the prize money has
reduced. Against the backdrop of the cost of owning a
horse—perhaps my hon. Friend is so comfortably off that it does
not dent his finances, but I am a little alarmed that my brother has
taken a share in a syndicate for a race horse, which might affect the
family economy—the trainer who keeps the horse has found that
the cost of bedding has gone up, the cost of feed stuffs has gone up,
and fuel costs for transporting a horse to the races have gone up. It

McIntosh:</Member></B> I shall come to that point in a moment. The levy
yield has gone down in the past 10 years by almost 35%, and the
five-year trend shows that it has gone down by almost 21%. The current
financial problems with racing revolve around betting companies having
moved their businesses offshore, meaning that they are exempt from
paying both tax and the levy. As soon as one company moved offshore,
there was a need for others to follow, enabling more competition
between those companies. My understanding is that, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T10:07:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) said, only one betting
company, bet365, remains based in the UK for these betting operations,
and it is a significant employer in

a result of this mass exodus offshore, the Government are losing
approximately £300 million in tax each year, and the amount
being paid into the levy has been reduced by between £5 million
and £10 million. I repeat that the tax situation is properly a
matter for the Treasury to address in the Budget. The point that I want
to make for the purposes of the Bill is that the drop in levy and the
drop in tax has meant that less prize money is available, making other
countries such as Ireland and France more attractive for owners to buy
horses there and enter them in races
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T10:08:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0001.htm#13012550000097">To

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T10:08:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bury North (Mr Nuttall), the figures that I have show
that the average prize money per race over the past 10 years on flat
race courses has seen a reduction of more than 16%, and for jump racing
a reduction of almost 10%. Overall the reduction has been almost 14%.
The five-year trend for flat racing shows a reduction of more than 3%
in average prize money per race and in jump racing a reduction of
almost 20%. Overall, average prize money per race has dropped by more
than 9%. By comparison, the prize money available in France is
approximately seven times higher than that on offer in the

idea of the difference between the UK and France, in 2011-12,
£67.7 million on betting activity on British racing was returned
to racing through the levy, but in France the PMU, the state-owned tote

approximately £735 million to racing. In Australia approximately
£280 million was returned to racing. British owners
receive the lowest return from their investment in training fees for
racehorses of any major racing nation. I think that the international
statistics are powerful and show how weak British racing is in
comparison because of the falling

hon. Friend the Member for Shipley serves with great distinction on the
Culture, Media and Sport Committee. The Committee addressed this
question in 2012 in its report, “The Gambling Act 2005: A

failure of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to work with the
Treasury to set remote gambling taxation at a level at which online
operators could remain within the UK and regulated by the Gambling
Commission has led to almost every online gambling operator moving
offshore whilst most are still able to advertise and operate into the
UK. We therefore welcome the announcement, made in the 2012 Budget
Statement, that the online industry will be taxed on a
point-of-consumption rather than a point-of-supply basis. We also
welcome the detailed consultation with the industry since the Budget
over the design of the policy framework and look forward to the
Government's response. To give certainty to online operators, and their
investment plans, we urge the Government to adhere to its timetable for
implementation by December, 2014 and to make plans to deal with any
challenges to the proposed new system. However, the Treasury still
needs to work with industry stakeholders to establish the correct level
for online gambling taxation, taking into account the need to encourage
companies to accept UK regulation and taxation and to discourage the
formation of a grey
market.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13012550000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0001.htm#13012550000100">There

difference between the Bill before us and the remote gambling Bill that
we hope Ministers
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T10:30:56"></hs_TimeCode>will introduce
in the next parliamentary Session. When betting shops were legalised in
1961, that was the first time that a bet could be placed other than on
course. Now, even more gambling is taking place with internet gambling,
and there is a wider choice of how to place a bet. That raises the
question of how to bring the money placed on an offshore bet into the
levy so that it can return to racing.</hs_Para>

has been pointed out to me in the course of preparing for this debate
that an unintendend consequence of the Bill is that the UK could become
a centre from which illegal markets could operate. Foreign companies
that are not subject to tax and the levy could find it more competitive
to attract British consumers in this way. There is a fear that
operations could move from the EU to third world countries, as the
ordinary consumer—the person placing the bet—would not be
able to tell where the website was licensed. In addition, the EU
Commission needs to be persuaded that clause 4 is acceptable, and for
that purpose there has to be proof that consumers are not benefiting
from the current system. However, Bills similar to this have already
been passed in other EU countries.</hs_Para>

Government have voiced concerns over a potential state aid issue
whereby a tax is applied to companies based in other EU countries to
fund racing in those countries. I hope that the Minister will respond
to this point. Some companies based offshore thereby avoid paying tax
and the levy despite the fact that they operate almost solely in the
UK. It has been suggested that there could be problems in compelling
the whole market to pay at the point of consumption, as betting
operators are not keen to pay the tax and levy unless they can see that
everyone else is doing so. This would increase the currently
uncompetitive nature of being based in the UK and mean that less money
is put back into racing.</hs_Para>

operators who are based offshore are reaping all the benefit of
accessing the British market but are not contributing financially to

imaginable, with open competition, betting shops, the internet and the
legalisation of gaming machines in shops. If betting operators are
brought into the taxable area, their biggest concern will be the rate
at which the tax is set. I accept that that is a matter for Her
Majesty’s Treasury. However, it has been put to me that if the
tax were set at 15% of gross profits, a number of betting operators
would become unprofitable. The purpose of the Bill is not to increase
tax, which is properly a matter for the Treasury, but to level the
playing field for those contributing or  
<?notus-xml column=585?>not contributing to the levy. I hope that that addresses any potential

that the wish of the House is to include clause 4 to address the levy

point. However, when the Secretary of State comes to a determination on
the levy, or an agreement is reached on it, the mechanism used is
designed to reach a particular figure of, say, £75 million. If
the Bill succeeded and money were added on, the target figure of
£75 million would still apply. All that would happen is that the
mechanism used to calculate it would change in order still to hit
£75 million. We would not get any more money through the levy;

operators in the field of horse racing but directly to the Horserace

horse racing as an industry, including veterinary science and

bolted. I would say, as we canter around the course, that the voluntary
idea simply does not work. A lot can be said for the one company, which
I shall try not to name, that has proceeded on a voluntary 
<?notus-xml column=586?>basis. It has entered into a commercial deal that has safeguards in
place to ensure that the contribution is made at the point of
consumption. The time has passed for a voluntary option, and we have to
move on to some sort of compulsion. It would be helpful if there were a
further level playing field in that those who had entered into a
voluntary deal were allowed to sponsor prizes and races. It is unfair

satisfy my hon. Friend’s request. Importantly, the levy was
created and enforced prior to our entry in 1973 into the Common Market,
as the European Union was then called. Let me state clearly and
graphically that the levy enjoys grandfather rights—that is the
big difference between the Bill under consideration and the remote
gambling Bill—and cannot therefore be said in any shape or form
to constitute a state aid.</hs_Para>

authority do I have to make this case? I hesitate to say this, but as a
mere youth in 1978 I spent six months on a stagiaire placement as a
trainee with the Commission in the Directorate General for Competition,
then known as DG 4. The House will be familiar with the competition
rules—originally articles 85 and 86 of the treaty of Rome, and
now known as articles 105 and 106 of the snappily titled treaty on the
functioning of the European Union—that set out the common rules
on competition, taxation and approximation of laws. As the levy existed
prior to 1973, and because it has grandfather rights, it cannot be
deemed to constitute a state aid, and the fact that we have not been
pursued by the European Commission emphasises that.

the levy is provided from state resources, its extension to overseas
operators would only equalise, not distort competition. The overall
impact of betting operators having moved offshore has been the decline
in prize money I referred to earlier. Race courses have therefore had
to fund part of the prize money themselves, as well as fund the levy,
which is its biggest overhead. Therefore, if the levy decreases, race
courses have to contribute more to maintain the same level of prize
money. That is difficult to do, because if more money goes into prize
money, less is available to spend on the integrity of the sport and
things such as the photo finish and dope

overall has gone down by 8% over the past 10 years. That is obviously

hon. Friend the Member for Shipley will testify. Feeding costs have
gone up hugely for all livestock, including horses. Bedding costs have
gone up hugely. Alternatives to straw are being considered. Corn is
being produced so that more corn goes to cereal and there is less
straw, which has a huge impact on the stabling costs. Many of the
stables I have visited had considered alternatives such as cut-up
newspaper. However, I understand that stabling horses with
newspaper—this also applies to using newspaper for
chickens—leads to a cough and is a health hazard that can
prevent horses from
running.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0001.htm#13012550000160">There
are therefore reasons other than economic ones—though costs are
increasing—for smaller field sizes and fewer runners. In turn,
that reduces the footfall at the race course, and so yields less income
from admission prices. Figures for the past five and 10 years show that
average attendances are down by a considerable 7%. Trainers are
training fewer horses, and therefore require fewer stable staff and
fewer farriers, which will have huge knock-on effects in rural areas
such as my own of Thirsk, Malton and Filey. The trainers require fewer
saddlers and horse boxes. The knock-on effect on the whole rural
economy is potentially
huge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0001.htm#13012550000161">The
results are the same if there is less prize money, because owners enter
their horses in races from which they will see a greater return, and at
this point in time, that means overseas.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T10:51:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Shipley seems to be bucking the trend, because it
appears that the number of owners is down. The number of sole owners

further flung courses in Scotland and the UK, which are feeling the
effects of the reduction in the levy because they have less to offer to
owners and trainers. A further consideration is the price of fuel and
the location of the race course in relation to the trainer’s
yard. The trainers to whom I have spoken have made that point most

they must enter into a commercial deal with the British Horseracing
Authority that ensures that a percentage of their gross profit goes
back into racing. That approach has already been taken up by one
betting operator, to which I have referred. Pressure must be placed on
others to follow. There could be a further incentive: betting operators

Commission of a proposal for a parafiscal levy on online horse race
betting in order to fund a public service mission entrusted to horse
racing companies. The notified measure comes in the context of the
opening up of certain online games of betting and chance under the
French law of 12 May 2010. That law ends the monopoly on online horse
race betting held by Pari Mutuel Urbain, commonly known as PMU, an
economic interest grouping of 51 horse race companies that, however,
retains the monopoly of online horse race betting through its physical
network of sales outlets. The French authorities argued their case that
the purpose of the levy was to fund the public service mission
improvement. They subsequently submitted this to the Commission and it
considers that the aid measure contains all the features constituting
the concept of state aid, and published its decision inviting comments

strengthen the Minister’s and the Government’s arm. We
have nothing to fear on this point from the European Union. We have a
very strong case to put, and it appears to me that there are
distinctions between it and the French case. I hope the Minister has
joy and that the Government did respond to that consultation and can
use it as an opportunity to clarify the difference between the French
proposed parafiscal levy and our levy which has existed since the early
1960s and enjoys grandfather rights, which by no stretch of the
imagination can be said of the French proposed parafiscal levy. If the
Minister did not respond to that consultation, he owes 
<?notus-xml column=591?>the House an explanation as to why the Government chose not to respond,

are distinctions between the French case and the Horserace Betting Levy
Board. Most importantly, the levy in this country is not paid to
economic operators in the field of horse race betting, but paid direct
to the Horserace Betting Levy Board, which then distributes the
proceeds of the levy for the improvement of horse racing and breeds of
horses, and for the advancement of veterinary science and education.
There is no direct participation by bookmakers in the proceeds of the
levy, and if any advantage is conferred on them it is only on the
maintenance of the stock of good quality horses, the provision of
grants to cover the costs of regulating races and to provide loans for
the improvements to race horses. It is very hard to reconstruct what
contribution bookmakers might have made without the levy, but it cannot
be sensibly said that the levy relieves bookmakers of the burden that
they would otherwise have had to assume. Indeed, the paradox before us
today is that the existing levy confers an advantage on overseas
operators, since they derive, albeit indirectly, the benefit from a
healthy horse stock and well-provisioned race courses without having to
make the contribution that their domestic competitors have to make.
That must surely distort competition.</hs_Para>

McIntosh:</Member></B> I see where the hon. Gentleman is coming from,
but I think that would be unacceptable to the racing industry. The
message that I want to go out from the House today is that the House
cares about the racing industry, recognises the contribution the
industry makes to the micro-economy in rural north
Yorkshire—Thirsk, Malton and Filey—and to the greater
economy of the United Kingdom. Racing has been cheated for months and
years ever since these offshore operators have been operating out of
Gibraltar, the Isle of Man and other such unacceptable points of
establishment.</hs_Para>

is a unique opportunity to take the challenges facing racing in the
round. I fully accept that we cannot deal with questions of taxation
today—that has to be the remit of the Treasury. I am sure that
my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will address that
point, giving those affected sufficient time to prepare for this tax.
Some of the betting companies are alarmed about this, but I think
unnecessarily so. That is a separate argument, however. Clause 4 and
the matter of the horse racing levy is an integral part of the whole
problem of racing being cheated out of the money. The consequences of
licensing and advertising offshore and not paying towards the levy
onshore need to be addressed together. We seek to improve competition
and equalise the market. I notice that my right hon. Friend the
Minister is shaking his head. He must be bold. He has nothing to fear.
He has the whole of the House and the industry behind his not
inconsiderable stature.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T11:09:27"></hs_TimeCode>I therefore hope
that the Minister will march forth today and take on those companies,
which want to do the right thing—one of them is already doing

betting companies pay the correct amount of tax and contribute to the
future of racing by paying the levy. I accept that the levy in its
current form is no longer fit for purpose and must change. The industry
has some time to do so—it has been invited to do so by the
Government, which I welcome. The purpose of today’s Bill is to
equalise the competitive situation, as in France, to ensure that
everybody pays the tax and the levy and that everybody knows and can
see that they are doing so. The Bill is not anti-competitive; quite the
reverse. It seeks to encourage competition by removing the current
distortion in the market. Without this Bill, racing will continue to
lose out on much needed funding.</hs_Para>

North Yorkshire it is also recognised as bringing tremendous enjoyment
to local participants and tremendous returns—on a good day or a

Bill will not go forward in its current form, because the Government
have just published their draft Gambling (Licensing &amp; Advertising)
Bill and, with the exception of the racing parts, today’s Bill
covers the same ground. In fact, we will be scrutinising that draft
Bill in the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport on Tuesday, so
perhaps the promoters and sponsors of today’s Bill will want to
make a detailed written submission to the Committee—or, indeed,
send the <I>Hansard</I> report of this debate—as we perform that
scrutiny. That draft Bill is the DCMS/regulatory end of what the
Government propose as a major reform of the taxation regime—the
move to point of consumption as the basis for taxation of remote online
gambling. The business end of that change—the Treasury
part—is at the detailed policy design stage, which has been the
subject of extensive consultation by the Government.</hs_Para>

as we heard from the hon. Lady, we unanimously welcomed the change of
emphasis towards taxing remote gambling on a point-of-consumption
basis, for three very good reasons. It may well encourage online
operators to rebase themselves here, following a flight
overseas—in particular, to Gibraltar. Changing the emphasis

regime, bearing in mind the possibility of a challenge in Europe if the
tax level in particular is not right or acceptable to the operators,
which might wish to challenge it, as they have challenged other moves
in the EU. Such a challenge might be a vexatious challenge at the last
moment, simply to delay things as far as possible. That would have

is important to recognise that, for those operators, this is about
getting the tax right. The other arguments are incidental, and those

made pre-tax profits of £116 million, which was up 22%. That is
a record that most UK businesses can only envy in the current economic

as she might have done for Ministers to back the case for the racing

levy to help struggling clubs. An example of such a club is Port Vale,
which is at the opposite end of the city from Stoke City

conclude by returning to a point that I made in an intervention on the

There is great merit in keeping this Bill simple and in dealing with
racing separately. The Bill is the regulatory end of the changes to the
taxation regime that will benefit everyone in the country through
increased contributions to the Treasury coffers, and that will benefit
operators who have remained here and face competition from
organisations overseas that do not pay tax. The real danger is that a
vexatious complaint could be made, causing delays because of the
European Union angle. The Government’s approach has much to
commend it, if they proceed with careful thought and simplicity, and if
the racing element is dealt with
separately.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_25_PT_1/940152D3F7F1318848DDD42FFEB89865B5919ED8" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 January 2013">Friday

That was exactly the point I was about to make. The differences in
prize money are significant and make a very significant difference. We
are not talking here about marginal competitiveness, but fundamental
differences in the rate of prize money that no sensible or rational
operator in the industry could ignore. Indeed, they are not ignoring
them. In the last few years there has been an 8.4% drop in the number
of horses in training, and that continues year on year. There has been
a 32% drop in foal production, which is an even more significant figure
in the context of forthcoming years. Britain now ranks bottom of the
global league in terms of the percentage of trainers’ costs that
they are able to recoup through prize money—the figure is
21%—which means that trainers are increasingly dependent on
their fees. That raises the costs of having a horse in training, with
the result that fewer and fewer people—such as my hon. Friend
the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)—can afford to do it. We
want to make racing an activity that more and more people can access,
enjoy, participate in and contribute to, but by allowing the present
structure we are doing exactly the opposite. We are feeding an
increasing diaspora of British racing talent
overseas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0001.htm#13012550000220">The
last Government’s attempt to deal with this problem, as with so
many others, failed. The Gambling Act 2005 did not sort the problem
out. It allows betting operators to base their remote operations
offshore, often simply by placing the servers offshore while many of
the offices are in the United Kingdom. It creates loopholes by allowing
offshore bookmakers to avoid Gambling Commission regulation, and by
exempting them from payment of their fair share of the
levy.</hs_Para>

simply create a level playing field by making offshore bookmakers

that the Bill will unlock three important benefits. It will provide
better protection for consumers. If all operators are subject to
Gambling Commission requirements, everyone who places a bet will know
that wherever they are placing it, it will be subject to the same
regulation. Operators will be mandated under the Gambling
Commission’s licence condition 15.1 rather than being able to
operate on a voluntary basis. The Bill will, as I have said, return a
level playing field to the market, and in so doing will make it easier

of the debate is an issue similar to the one that we face across the

smaller placers are locked out at the bottom. The pyramid of racing,
which at the top relies on the glamour and prestige of the Derby, the
grand national and other big, celebrated events, has deep roots at the
bottom. Unless we look after those roots and introduce a system that
maintains their viability and sustainability, we will see them wither.
I believe that the Bill does what the 2005 Act failed to do. It
resolves a very simple and fundamental funding crisis at the heart of
racing, and gives hope to the 60 race courses in the
country—including Fakenham, which is on the edge of my

the aims of the Bill, racing is continually told that the levy is
incapable of the reform that would enable it to capture modern forms of
betting. It is therefore vital for the work to establish a mechanism

A register is maintained. I believe this goes across the board. If that
person, for whatever reason—stress, perhaps—is worrying

“I’ve changed my mind. I want to gamble again,”
they are not allowed to do so. They are opted out, but that same person

speech was equally important because it sent a message to companies
about how they should conduct their tax arrangements, whether they are
banks, Starbucks or online casinos. They need to do the right thing and

some of the people who were listed. They gave me odds of 250:1. I was
not trying to earn money, because I thought that chances of my ever
becoming Prime Minister, let alone the next one, were zero. Instead, I
was looking at how the odds could be changed and at suspicious betting
patterns, particularly given my comments about Liberal Democrat

was so popular, based only on one or two bets that I had other people
across the country make for only another few pence. That demonstrated
how easy it is to manipulate the betting statistics and, in relation to

return to the idea of working across jurisdictions, one can often go on

mentioned my dabbling in the national lottery. A friend who used to

as sunny as it is, it comes as a surprise that anyone would want to do
that—bought a lottery ticket there. Although they had a modest
win—£10, I think—they were outside the

better protection in other jurisdictions, or simply better odds, and
people may be very aware of the risks they are taking in response to
those odds. During the problems with the Icelandic banks, people felt
that they knew the risks they were taking for an extra couple of per

one on the next leader of the Labour party—I might be tempted to
use a site I had never heard of if I got better odds. It is worrying,
however, because people must know the details and be confident that
when that eventuality—the change of leader—takes 
<?notus-xml column=612?>place around 2015, the site will pay up. Will the site pay up against a
person standing in as temporary leader or must it be a long-term

fundamental change to the basis on which the system of remote gambling
is regulated in the UK. By moving from the current place of supply
basis to a place of consumption basis, the British consumer becomes the
focal point around which the system is based, rather than the location
of the gambling operator. In terms of consumer protection, that is the

referred to. That will bring the original intent of the Act up to date.

the original intent of the Act up to date will give consumers greater
confidence that the operators they choose will be subject to the same
standards. For example, an offshore operator that makes remote gambling
facilities available to consumers around the world on the internet will
need to obtain an operating licence from the Gambling Commission if
people in part of Great Britain are capable of using them, regardless
of whether they are used in Great Britain. If operators want to avoid
having such a licence, they would need to block internet access from
consumers in Great Britain at their own cost, so that people are
incapable of  using remote gambling facilities illegally in the
UK. The 
<?notus-xml column=613?>measure will also mean that there is a requirement for operators to
contribute towards British problem gambling issues and regulatory
costs. Effectively, they would have to make a contribution where they
are part of the problem, which is an extremely welcome development, and
will go some way to levelling the playing field for UK-based
companies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000312" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0001.htm#13012550000312">I
have concerns about the whole arena of gambling. Recently, the
<I>Southend Standard</I>, a weekly publication in my patch of Rochford
and Southend East, set out the number of betting offices on the local
high street. I was surprised to find that there were five, including
two run by the same company. I cannot help but think that we need to
look again at the broader issue of gambling, and particularly at how
online gambling based offshore encourages people to bet money they may
not be able to
afford.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000313" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0001.htm#13012550000313">Switching
to a point-of-consumption basis will mean that the location of the
gambler and not the operator will be the deciding factor on what tax to
pay. For example, money collected by an online casino that is
attributed to a UK player will be subject to British taxation, which
seems entirely fair. Although there is no mention of the rate, the
current rate of 15% on gross profits clearly puts domestic operators at
a disadvantage.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T12:32:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Newcastle-under-Lyme rightly said that the level of taxation is the
crux of the matter. I believe William Hill accepts the principle of
changing to the point of consumption from the place of supply if the
rate of taxation is right. I understand it has pitched for 5%, but it
would suggest a low figure, wouldn’t it? I have never been a fan
of high taxation—I prefer lower and flatter rates—so I
encourage the Government to consider whether 15% is right and
competitive, and whether it will encourage growth in the UK and people
in other jurisdictions to bet in the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000314" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0001.htm#13012550000314">The
new licensing arrangements will also mean that, for the first time,
overseas-based operators will be required to inform the British
Gambling Association of suspicious activities, which will help the
fight against illegal activity and corruption in sports betting, which
discredits not only the betting community but the sporting
community—people cannot enjoy sport if they believe the result

and gaming have for many years been a popular pastime for many people.
For most, it is a pastime carried out and enjoyed safely and
responsibly. The British gambling prevalence survey was carried out by
the National Centre for Social Research and in 2010, the Gambling
Commission sponsored the third in a series of prevalence surveys. The
National Centre for Social Research is an independent social research
institute, and the 2010 survey followed on from two previous surveys in
1999 and 2007. The 2010 survey found that 73% of people aged 16 and
over—around 35.5 million adults—had participated in some
form of gambling in the previous year, while 56% of adults had
participated in a form of gambling in the year before that. The
difference there, of course, is that some forms of gambling can take
place at 16, but others only at 18. It was reported that 4% of adults
said that their involvement in gambling had increased in the previous
year; for 13% it had decreased; and for the rest it remained the
same<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T12:52:16"></hs_TimeCode>. In 2011,

many other previous attempts to try to regulate and control the

effect and people try to get round those controls. The Gambling Act
2005 was in part a consolidation measure, but it was also a reforming

online gambling. The Act also created a new single regulator for the

liberalised the gambling laws and legalised betting shops. However,
despite that Act and the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963,
commercial gambling became a source of criminal activity, and a new
Act, the Gaming Act 1968, was therefore necessary. It was largely
successful in removing the criminal element from gambling, and it

should be clear about what the Bill seeks to regulate. As I understand
it, the remote gambling market covers all betting and gaming
transactions that are effected without the customer’s coming
into contact—physical contact, that is, as when a customer goes
into a traditional bookmaker’s office—with the operator.
It covers, for example, the placing of a bet on the telephone or the
use of a computer to bet on the internet. It would also cover new
mobile technologies—for instance, bets placed via a tablet
computer or a mobile telephone.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012550000346" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000346">Most United
Kingdom operators started to offer customers the opportunity to place
bets online in the mid to late 1990s, as improvements to internet
technology opened up the market to a whole new segment of the
population who had previously been denied a chance to participate.
These were people who, for whatever reason, had been prevented from
visiting a bookmaker’s premises—and presumably, for
whatever reason, had not been attracted to telephone
betting—perhaps because of infirmity, because of the nature of
their work, or simply because they lived in a location where there were
no bookmakers. The new development enabled customers to play casino
games and poker online whenever they chose to do so. Previously such
opportunities had been available only to those with access to a casino,
of which there were fewer than 150 in the United Kingdom.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012550000347" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000347">The Gambling
Commission itself reports that fewer than one person in 100 has a
problem with gambling. In other words, 99% of the population who chose
to engage in betting do so safely and responsibly, and enjoyably. Our
level of problem gambling compares favourably with that in other
countries. For instance, the United Kingdom’s rate is lower than
the rates in France, where it is 1.3%, South Africa, where it is 1.4%,
and the United States of America, where it is 3.5%.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012550000348" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000348">Those who are
involved in the industry take their responsibilities very seriously,
providing training for their staff so that they can recognise customers
who are at risk. It is, of course, legitimate to argue—indeed,
it was argued earlier in the debate—that the risk posed to
people who are engaged in remote gambling may be greater than the risk
posed to those who visit traditional bookmakers’ premises. All
licensed gambling operators in the UK have to abide by strict licensing
conditions designed to protect and help problem gamblers, and the 
<?notus-xml column=619?>gambling industry is unique in financing relevant research, education
and treatment activities on a voluntary basis. Licensed operators offer
clear guidance and advice to customers on
responsible gambling and, for example, are clear that gambling should
not be used as a source of income or as a means of paying off debt.
This year, the industry will be contributing some £6 million to
the Responsible Gambling Trust, an independent national charity that
works to ensure that the gambling industry in Britain, including the
remote gambling industry, retains its world-leading reputation for
promoting responsibility in gambling and to demonstrate that legitimate
business growth and job creation is balanced with social protection of
the weak and vulnerable in our society.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:00:25"></hs_TimeCode>Licensed
operators also signpost customers to helpful websites such as those run
by GamCare, Gamble Aware and Gamblers Anonymous. Nobody wants to see
lives ruined by gambling, and this debate gives us an important
opportunity to highlight the enormous amount of help available to those
struggling with a gambling habit that is perhaps getting out of
hand.</hs_Para>

I hope to demonstrate, one problem with the Bill is that it would have
many unintended consequences. For example, it runs the risk of forcing
customers into the hands of unlicensed operators; they could be forced
into the black market and into the hands of operators who may not
operate in the same responsible way as the household names on our UK
high streets do. We are being told that one of the reasons for trying
to regulate offshore gambling is to protect customers, but I have to
tell the House that, unfortunately, all the evidence from other
countries suggests that that laudable aim will not be
achieved.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_25_PT_1/522789F5BD8F7230C84F8477A119A7582C173217" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 January 2013">Friday

essence, the Bill seeks to regulate the internet, and we know from
other countries’ attempts to regulate the remote gambling market
that it is easier said than done. Different means of enforcement are
available—for example, payment process blocking or website
blocking. They have all been tried in various guises and all have their
shortcomings. We may ask why customers will seek to circumvent attempts
at enforcement, but the answer is simple: human nature. It is human
nature for customers always to seek out the best value, and operators
who are unlicensed in the UK and operating from a jurisdiction where
there are fewer controls will be able to spend more on advertising and
on marketing. They will be able to keep coming up with new offers to
make their offering attractive to customers. It is also possible that
they will be able to offer better odds, giving better value to
customer, although in reality the UK-based operators will try to match
the odds offered by foreign operators and absorb the extra overheads
themselves by reducing spending in other areas.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012550000351" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000351"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:03:30"></hs_TimeCode>In
an attempt to stop customers using companies operating from outside
their jurisdiction, other European countries have pioneered the use of
restrictive tools to stop customers accessing authorised websites. The
three main methods in use are: payment process blocking; website
blocking; and the imposition of advertising restrictions. Norway has
led the way on payment process blocking as a means of preventing
customers from taking advantage of offers from black market operators.
It must be said that that has not been entirely successful, because
more than half of gamblers said that they play as frequently on foreign
websites as they did before the 
<?notus-xml column=620?>ban came into effect. Norwegian customers soon
cottoned on to the fact that if they wished to access blacklisted
market products, they could get around the payments ban by using third
party payment solutions such as e-wallets.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012550000352" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000352"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:04:40"></hs_TimeCode>Another
unwelcome side effect was that, as a result of over-zealous compliance
by operators, legitimate payments could sometimes be blocked. Website
blocking has been tried in Italy and has proved to be just as easily
circumvented by the use of technology by end-users or service
providers.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:05:10"></hs_TimeCode>Consumers can
easily get around website blocking by using the internet protocol
address of a website rather than the website’s domain name.
Alternatively, a blacklisted provider can simply change the name of a
blocked site in order to evade a blacklist. A common feature of many
markets is the imposition of advertising restrictions.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:05:42"></hs_TimeCode>Whatever method
of enforcement is used, the mere existence of such a method sends out a
signal to customers that there is something out there to which they are
being denied access. Human nature being what it is, there will be a
natural desire to find out what they are missing out on. Consequently,
it is clear that no single measure has been proven to be 100%
effective. We have heard much debate this morning, but I have not heard
anything about how the Bill will be enforced. What magic bullet do we
have in this country that other European countries have been unable to
find?</hs_Para>

whole issue of enforcement raises the thorny question that increasingly
arises in modern life when we try to put together legislation:
to what extent is it possible or indeed desirable to try to regulate
the internet? To put it another way, how can we stop people accessing
the world wide web? How can their access to the web be restricted? Some
might think that such questions were of interest only in closed
societies such as North Korea, and although I am not suggesting that
that is what is being proposed, it is a dangerous path to venture down.
Why should the Government attempt to deny citizens who want to access
gaming sites run by overseas operators the right to do so?</hs_Para>

the Member for Rochford and Southend East said, there might well be
jurisdictions with a more favourable level of control and regulation.
We must not always assume that we have got it absolutely right in this
country. Equally, UK customers might well want to seek out the better
value that is available from a foreign jurisdiction that has less
regulation and is therefore in a position to offer slightly better odds

online operators to locate within the UK under the jurisdiction of the

operators, to advertise to UK customers, provided that they were
licensed in a jurisdiction within the EEA or were on what the Gambling
Commission called the white list which, as we have heard, includes
Antigua, Barbuda and Tasmania. Helpfully for those offshore operators,
the list includes low-tax jurisdictions such as the Isle of Man and
Alderney, so it is not surprising that operators listed on the UK stock

4 deals with the levy. As we have heard, the levy is a statutory way of
transferring money from bookmakers to the racing industry. It was, in
essence, a compromise that was reached in the 1960s between bookmakers
and the racing industry, once bookmakers were legalised. The Betting
Levy Act 1961 created the statutory body, the Horserace Betting Levy
Board, which still exists. We have heard concerns expressed about state
aid and whether reforming the levy could fall foul of those state aid
rules. I do not want to go down that path again, but there are problems
and I look forward to hearing the Minister’s views later. I
would  
<?notus-xml column=622?>like to know what advice he has received on the issue of state aid and
the legitimacy of potentially bringing the levy within the scope of
these

of the debate surrounding the current levy system has focused on the
levy in isolation. That is misleading and unhelpful to a sensible
debate on the issue. Although the levy may well be in decline for a
range of reasons, let us not forget that there are several avenues of
funding for horse racing, apart from the
levy<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000362" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000362">I
shall touch on one point that was raised earlier about the amount of
racing, as opposed to the other forms of betting that go on. I have
from the largest bookmaker in the country, William Hill, figures which
show that for its shops, the horse race business accounts for only 25%
of revenue. The remaining revenue comes from greyhound racing,
football, other sports and gaming. For online gambling, the percentage
is even lower. The whole of the sports book accounts for 35% of online
revenue, and 65% is made up from other products such as casino games,
bingo and poker. So the idea that racing forms a major part of the
revenue of bookmakers is not backed up by the
facts<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000363" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000363">As
we heard, there is revenue for the racing industry from on-course
bookmakers, overseas picture rights, picture rights for UK betting
shops paid through the media rights, and sponsorship. A significant
proportion of the sponsorship comes directly from the bookmakers in
order to help promote the sport. The amount raised by the levy may be
in decline, but the cost of racing to bookmakers is increasing. Racing
is now by far and away the most expensive product for bookmakers.
Figures collated recently by the Horserace Betting Levy Board show that
the combined profits before tax and loan capital repayments of
Britain’s race courses—as we heard, there were 60 race
courses in 2011—amounted  to some £20.9 million,
compared with £20.6 million in 2010 and £20.2 million in
2009.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000364" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000364">Furthermore,
horse racing is not in as bad a state of health as some might think.

appreciate racing’s need to guarantee prize money and that it
needs certainty of funding in order to plan ahead. In the most recent
levy agreement, William Hill, Ladbrokes and Coral agreed to guarantee
that their combined contribution to the horse racing levy will be not
less than £45 million, and Betfair has undertaken to make a
contribution to British racing through the levy board, which is assumed
to be in the region of £7 million. In response to the
latest levy agreement, the chairman of the Horserace Betting Levy
Board, Paul Lee,

are problems facing the horse racing industry—we have heard a
lot about them today—it is worth considering that there are
problems facing the bookmaking industry, too. Betting shops have been
part of our communities for decades. Despite what some would have us
believe, there has not been an explosion in the number of betting
shops. The number in the UK has, in fact, remained relatively stable
over the past decade, at around 8,900 shops. In fact, since the 1960s
the betting industry has seen a vast decline in the number of betting
shops, because in those days there were close to 16,000 in the UK, and
fewer betting shops of course means less money for horse racing. The UK
betting industry is already highly regulated and subject to significant
levels of taxation. I believe that additional regulation and higher
taxation would only make it less likely that the industry will be in a
position to consider spending more on supporting horse
racing.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_25_PT_1/C5EA9EB5BB3AC7790A9DE67AE75737061A1B9657" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 January 2013">Friday

themselves to see what they can find. Just to give a complete
disclosure, the only thing that I think is of any relevance is a
subscription from which I receive no financial benefit whatsoever, from
a company called Peninsula Business Services Ltd. It does what it says
on the tin: it deals with employment services, and that is how I dealt
with it when it approached me about an employment matter. It happens to
be owned by Peter Done, the brother of Fred Done, who owns Betfred and
now the Tote. You might think it a rather tenuous link, Mr Deputy
Speaker, but others might not, so it is all there on the record for
anyone to pore over. I reiterate that I receive no personal financial

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:25:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh) made an excellent
speech. I did not necessarily agree with all the points she made, but
she made them very well. In my first intervention on her, however, I
asked her what she thought the main thrust of the Bill
was—whether it was to improve regulation of the gambling
industry and player protection, whether it was to raise money for the
Treasury, or whether it was to provide more money for the racing
industry. I stand to be corrected, but my hon. Friend seemed to say
that the thrust of what she is trying to achieve was to bring in more
money to the racing industry. As she made perfectly clear, she
represents a community in which racing has a large presence, and she
is, quite properly, trying to do the best for her constituency,
constituents and local community. That is why she feels so passionate 
<?notus-xml column=624?>about it, and more power to her elbow in that
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:26:14"></hs_TimeCode>. I take
it that that is why clause 4, which relates to the levy, is so
important to her and why its omission from the Government’s own
Bill, which covers many of the same matters, is unacceptable to her.
That is her opinion and we all appreciate the clarity with which she
expressed
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:26:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000370" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000370">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:26:37"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) also made an
excellent speech. I, like him, commend bet365, and not just because it
has stayed in the UK to pursue its business interests and has not gone
abroad like everybody else. It has been helped by the fact that it is
family-owned and does not have any shareholders to account to. I think
I am right in saying—I will apologise to the company profusely
if I am wrong—that, when its representatives gave evidence to
the Culture, Media and Sport Committee as part of our inquiry into the
Gambling Act 2005, they themselves acknowledged that had bet365 been a
public company on the stock market, they would have found the pressure
to move abroad irresistible. Nevertheless, it could still do that as a
family-owned business. The fact that it has not shows—this is
what I took from the evidence its representatives gave us—a
deep-seated commitment to its local community. That should be
commended. They are very proud of the fact that they employ so many
people in Stoke and of the impact that they have on the local
community—the hon. Gentleman mentioned the football
club—and that is to their credit.</hs_Para>

by<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:28:10"></hs_TimeCode> talking so

be focusing on the tax implications of the Bill and the idea that it
offered an opportunity not only to level the playing field with regard
to the competition that bet365 faces from people who have moved abroad,
but for the revenues that such a move would generate for the Treasury.

She was absolutely right; it was a

the EU where such measures have been introduced. In those cases,
however, people may have been starting from scratch and deciding to
start their regulation of the gambling industry on that basis. That

area where I am today making substantial changes is gambling
duties…The current duty regime for remote gambling introduced by
the last Government was levied on a ‘place of supply’
basis. This allowed overseas operators largely to avoid it, and much of
the industry has, as a result, moved offshore. Ninety per cent of
online gambling consumed by our citizens is now supplied from outside
the UK, and the remaining UK operations are under pressure to leave.
This is clearly not fair—and not a sensible way to support jobs
in Britain. So we intend to introduce a tax regime based on the place
of consumption—where the customer is based, not the
company—and, from this April, we will also introduce double
taxation relief for remote gambling. These changes will create a more
level playing field, and protect jobs here.”—[<I>Official

is that the Chancellor made no reference in his Budget to the need to
introduce the measure to improve player protection or better regulate
the gambling industry. He made no reference to that being a problem

what he said was perfectly reasonable and fair, and many hon. Members
on both sides of he House agree with his analysis, but I suspect that
it has been unhelpful. He may not have been aware of the legal
minefield he was in at the time, but people have become aware of it,
and the Government have backtracked to change the nature of the debate.
The debate must now be based, therefore, on player protection and the
regulation of gambling rather than on—we can probably guess this
is the real motive for the measure—getting money into the
Treasury, which is no bad thing, and levelling the playing field for
companies such as bet365 so that they do not go abroad, which no hon.

believe the Chancellor was also hinting that, if we get the measure
right, we may even be able to reverse the trend. It would be fantastic
if we were not just trying to stop bet365 leaving the country, but
putting a regime in place that encouraged companies that have left the
UK to come back. Not only would we retrieve lost revenue; we would also
get jobs back. Lots of people in the UK would love the jobs that have
been exported to places such as Gibraltar because of the current
situation come back to this country. With the best will in the world,
neither the Offshore Gambling Bill nor the Government’s

the Member for Rochford and Southend East (James Duddridge) mentioned a
rate of 5%. If we had that rate and the Government asked the gambling
industry whether it would agree to come back in return for that rate,
there might well be scope for negotiation, but VAT will scupper such a
plan, because gambling industries in the UK cannot reclaim their VAT.

House would support a regime that levelled the playing field, and that
means companies paying more in taxation than they currently

great prize to aim for, and I urge the Minister to lobby the
Chancellor. All that is required is for the Chancellor to help with
taxation—not just point of consumption taxation for the online
industry, but VAT relief. Those two things combined could get those
jobs and companies back. That is what we should be aiming to do. It is
a strange state of affairs when we

many respects, the main thrust of what
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:44:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Thirsk and Malton said concerned the levy. I should
thank my hon. Friend, because from what she and my hon. Friend the
Member for Mid Norfolk (George Freeman) were saying, it seems that, in
essence, the Bill is designed to help me. As we discussed earlier, I am
a very modest owner of race horses. I am an owner of very modest race
horses, too, to be perfectly honest. Contributing to the odd shares and
legs and other parts of the anatomy—I am sure that it does not
make a great impact on the considerable wealth of Mr Michael Easterby,
in the constituency of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:45:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Thirsk and Malton—provides me with a great deal
of pleasure. I seem to be the kind of owner that my hon. Friend says
she wants to help. I regret to inform the House that I am also a very
small-scale breeder of race horses, too. The saying goes in racing
circles that the only thing worse than having one broodmare is having
two. There is no better way of leaking money as quickly as possible
than breeding horses. The only thing that can compete is owning horses.
Whichever one chooses, the only possible outcome is that one will be
considerably poorer at the end of it than at the start. I think that
somebody once said that the best way to gain a small fortune out of
owning and breeding race horses is to start with a large
fortune—there is a considerable amount of truth in that. I
should therefore be grateful to my hon. Friend for having me in mind to
try to boost the modest returns I get from my horses. It is a rare
pleasure when any of them trouble the scorers.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:48:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Thirsk and Malton. Clause 4 is well-meaning and I do not
want to decry that, but I do not think that it will 
<?notus-xml column=629?>have the impact she thinks it would. I spoke about this briefly in an
intervention. The levy is determined, hopefully, by agreement—it
has been recently, which is to be welcomed—between the betting
industry and racing industry through the auspices of the levy board,
and we should all thank it for its work. When they come to an agreement
about how much money should be handed over from the betting industry to
the horse racing industry, rather than concentrating on the mechanism
of how that money is raised, people are really thinking about how much
it will raise. People think, “Well, what we need is a certain
amount of money from the betting industry to make the racing industry
viable which is reasonable to ask the gambling industry to provide
based on the money it makes from the horse racing
product.”<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:49:36"></hs_TimeCode>
A figure is therefore arrived at that seems reasonable.</hs_Para>

cannot remember, but I have a feeling—the Minister will be able
to help out on this—that the last time the Secretary of State
determined what the Government thought was a reasonable price for the
betting industry to pay the racing industry, the figure arrived at was
somewhere around £75 million. The Government then introduced a
mechanism in the levy, making slight amendments to try to deliver
£75 million—or whatever figure they thought was a fair
amount for the gambling industry to pay—and that was that. The
mechanism was arrived at to deliver the figure.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012550000396" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000396"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:50:23"></hs_TimeCode>My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:50:24"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton seems to presume that
everyone will continue with the same mechanism, which will simply
deliver more money to the racing industry, but I suspect it would not
really work like that. I suspect that the levy board would still go
through the same deliberations and work out what was reasonable to
expect the gambling industry to provide, and that a
mechanism would be worked out to deliver around £75 million.
Therefore, the 10.75% of gross horse racing profits that go to the levy
would probably be reduced to hit that target. As a consequence, the
Bill —clause 4 in particular—would generate no
more money for the racing industry. Rather, it would simply mean that
the money came from a different
mechanism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:51:14"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:51:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Davies:</Member></B> I understand my hon. Friend’s point, but in
some respects she argues against herself. As she says, the Government
are looking at this issue—indeed, everybody has been looking. I
think even she said in her speech, in passing, that the levy system was
broken to a certain extent—everybody starts these debates like
this—or that it was not ideal and was not delivering the right
outcome. However, it seems rather strange to say, “The levy
system’s broken; let’s introduce a measure that

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:52:34"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Rochford and Southend East would describe himself as a
layman, but he made some 
<?notus-xml column=630?>pertinent points about other sports and industries being subsidised, and
all the rest of it. I certainly do not think there is any justification
for that. Really, the levy is something historical, because that is how
it started. If we were starting again now, would we have the levy
system? Possibly not—I do not know; probably we would come to a
commercial agreement—so I am not sure that entrenching the levy
system is the solution to the problem that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:53:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Thirsk and Malton identifies, nor would it deliver any
extra funding for racing. Therefore, I am not sure that this proposal
is worth persevering with, given that it would also add legal
complications—again, I accept her point about the legal position
as she sees it—that the Government could well do without. I see
lots of downsides for the Government in pursuing this proposal; I do
not really see any great upside, for the reasons I have given.
Therefore, it is probably not worth while persevering with. Again,
however, I am sure that the Minister will have a view on
that.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:53:50"></hs_TimeCode>return to the
point about the levy. There is a slight misnomer—I am certainly
not alleging that anybody is trying to mislead anybody when they trot
it out—that can give a false picture, which is the idea that the
levy is essential for the small trainers, the small owners and the
small breeders, whom we have got to support, and that without the prize
money the levy generates, they would go under. I do not think that that
is the case. If we look at the figures more closely, we can see that it
is not quite as simple as that. There is an element of that involved:
the levy board supports fixtures at the bottom end that might not
otherwise be viable, and I am not going to decry that, but that is not
the only destination for the levy board’s money. It might not
even be where most of it goes; I am not entirely sure. It would be
interesting to have a breakdown of where the board’s funding
goes, so that we can see whether it represents a sensible way of
diverting resources.</hs_Para>

I said, a very high percentage of prize money in this country goes to a
very small number of people, including the top owners and the top
trainers. In effect, we are asking for money to be transferred from
poor people in betting shops—they are the ones who pay the levy,
after all; it is the punters, not the companies, who are paying in one
form or another—to wealthy racehorse owners. That set-up
represents a strange redistribution of wealth, and it is not one that I
recognise. There are not many calls in the House for the very poorest
to pay more to the very wealthiest people in the world, but the levy,
in essence, brings about just such a transfer of wealth. I do not think
that that arrangement stands up to scrutiny.</hs_Para>

levy is certainly used to prop up the prize money of some of the top
races in the country. I am sorry if I am returning to a subject that
you would rather I did not mention, Mr Deputy Speaker, but with the
best will in the world, a small owner like me is not going to win the
top classic races on the flat. That is simply not going to happen, so I
will not benefit from an increase in the levy. The people who win that
kind of race are Sheikh Mohammed, the Coolmore stud in Ireland and the
new people from Qatar, who are a welcome addition to the racing
industry. It would be stretching the imagination to suggest that any of
them were struggling to get by, based on what they have at the moment.
We cannot pursue that particular avenue too far. We should be

the racing product is not being efficiently passed down the racing food
chain. A lot of it gets stuck with the broadcasters who are supplying
the pictures, for example. Perhaps we could explore the possibility of
finding a better mechanism for getting the money from the broadcasters
down into the racing industry, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T13:58:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

have any idea of the amounts that are being acquired, or could be

Davies:</Member></B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I will try to
assist him by looking at the data from 2009-10 and then from 2010-11.
In 2010, the levy was £75 million and the picture rights were
£140 million—the betting industry was paying for
them—and other costs came to £26 million. That total of
£241 million was, in effect, what racing cost the betting
industry. The total dropped to £228 million in 2010-11, which
was largely the result of a drop in the levy by £16 million, and
the overall amount that betting gave to racing dropped by £13
million. Since then, however, it has steadily risen. In 2011-12, the
picture rights went up by £11 million and the levy went up by
£60 million, so the total went up from £228 million to
£256 million. For this year, 2012-13, the betting industry is
forking out £267 million for racing products compared with
£256 million last year.  
<?notus-xml column=632?>In the current climate, that is a considerable rise.
Next year, with the agreements that have made, it is going to go up
from £267 million to £275
million<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000407" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000407">If
we take all that together, it is difficult to sustain the argument that
bookmakers are not paying a fair amount for their racing products. It
might not be through the levy—the levy is at a level similar to
what it was five or six years ago, now that it has stabilised and gone
back up—but it is not the levy that is costing the bookmakers
more: it is the other things. Given that we have heard from a number of
Members today how horse racing makes up a smaller and smaller part of
the income bookmakers receive, it is not, in my view, sustainable in
the long run for, on the one hand, horse racing to take less and less
of the bookmakers’ share of the bets they are taking, while on
the other expecting bookmakers to pay more and more every single year
for the horse racing product. At some point, it is going to snap; it
will reach a point where it is no longer sustainable.</hs_Para>

to say “Let’s get those awful bookmakers to pay more
money.” They have paid more money and they are paying more
money, but that will not be possible in the long run: we need to find
alternative ways to get the money into racing. We need a commercial
agreement based on picture rights, as we must find a mechanism for
getting money into

right costs. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:02:39"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Thirsk and Malton said, two race courses have closed,
which is a matter of great regret. I am very sad about that, as one of
the great virtues of British racing is the diversity of race courses
all around the country and the ability of people living nearby to get
to them. I am sure that this is also a great regret to the Minister,
given that one of the courses that closed down was in his area of
Kent.</hs_Para>

might get the idea that the race courses must be struggling, too, if
they have to close down, but I do not think that is the case. I think
there has never been a better time for race courses; they have never
had more money coming in from picture rights and other sources. The
reason for the closure of the two race courses, as I see it, is that
they were owned by this big company—it was Northern Racing, but
is now in a bigger group, ARC, Arena Racing Company, owned by the
Reuben brothers—which took advantage of the fact that fixtures
could be transferred from one race course in a group to another race
course in the group. It thus closed down the least profitable race
courses to move the fixtures to the most profitable race
courses—not because the two race courses were not viable, but
simply because profits could be enhanced by moving fixtures to other
race courses in the group. That is a very sad and serious state of
affairs, and I hope the racing industry will wake up to that, and
change the allocation of fixtures to stop that happening.

Davies:</Member></B> That is essentially the point that I am making. In
the past, there has been a “racing versus bookmaker”
attitude that has got neither side anywhere. There have been faults on
both sides of that polarisation. Bookmakers need to accept that horse
racing must thrive if they are to do well in their business, and,
equally, the racing industry needs to understand that without betting,
it has not much of a product to sell. Each side needs the other; a
“them and us” approach gets us absolutely
nowhere.</hs_Para>

rehearsing those decades-old arguments, let us look at the facts in the
cold light of day. Let us see where the money is, and how it can be
filtered down. I think that there is an awful lot more money in the
racecourses now than there was before, but what we want is for the
prize money to filter down. The amount of prize money could be
increased if funds were passed down efficiently, and the smaller
trainers, owners and breeders could benefit in the way that my hon.
Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton wants if that increased prize
money were passed on by the race courses.</hs_Para>

problem is the fact that the Horsemen’s Group, which represents
racehorse owners, trainers and so forth, placed a minimum tariff on
different race classifications. The prize money for a class 5 race, for
instance, will be at a certain minimum level, while for a class 4 race
the level will be slightly higher. Although that was done for a good
reason—to end what I am sure my hon. Friend would consider to be
the worst excesses of paltry prize money levels and establish some
minimums —it has encouraged race courses to put on lower-grade
racing so that they can get away with providing the minimum maximum, as
it were. A well-meant initiative has had an unintended consequence.
Race courses have been given a perverse incentive to “dumb
down” the quality of the racing that they offer so that the
prize money can be as little as they can get away with, although it
will still hit the minimum prescribed by the Horsemen’s Group.
That, too, is not of much benefit to anyone.</hs_Para>

have a white list, which is based on the view that the regulation in
the other regimes involved is just as rigorous and onerous as it is in
this country, and we are satisfied as a country that those regimes are
just as good. So the principle goes: given that we are happy with the
regulatory regime in those jurisdictions, we are happy to accept the
licences that they issue. If we are simply looking at this in terms of
regulation, the model of regulation seems to be sensible. So if we are
happy with the overall standard of regulation, why do we need to get
bogged down in issuing each individual operator a licence, given that
they have already been given a licence in a regime that we think is
good enough? That is the basis on which we have operated our regulation

contrary on that and I will certainly accept it if it exists. In other

white listing system means that the Gambling Commission can accept
regulation from other jurisdictions and can trust it in the knowledge
that those jurisdictions have as tough a regulatory system as we
do—one in which we can have faith. That means the commission can
accept such operators in the same way as it would one from the UK. The
problem with the Bill and the Government’s draft Bill is that
the Gambling Commission will have to issue individual licences to Lord
knows how many gambling companies. On what basis will it do that? On
what basis will it assess the abilities of betting companies in foreign
lands? How will it decide whether they are legitimate, whether they can
pay out to punters and whether they are ring-fencing the
punters’ stake rather than putting it all in a pot? How will it
do that when companies are in far-flung jurisdictions? Will all the
Gambling Commission staff be off on permanent jollies, going around and
looking at all those industries? Who will issue all the licences? How
many more people will the commission need?</hs_Para>

love empire building; we have seen it time and time again. The
commission must think all its Christmases have come at once. Instead of
having to accept the licences issued by jurisdictions whose regulatory
regimes we are perfectly happy with, it will have to consider every
company individually. That seems to me to be what
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:19:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Thirsk and Malton and the Minister are proposing. Great
stuff if you work for the Gambling Commission, but probably not so
great for anyone else. Will those companies, including UK companies,
that employ many people in the UK have to get an individual licence in
every jurisdiction in which they operate? That is unnecessary, as we
could just recognise regulatory regimes elsewhere. It is bureaucracy
gone mad, and I hope that the Government can make a good case for why
that should happen.</hs_Para>

am sure that we are all anxious to hear what the Front-Bench spokesmen
have to say about the matter, but I am sorry that we have been short of
time for this debate, because there is a lot more stuff that I wanted
to mention. The revenue raised by the measure is not all a net benefit
to the Exchequer, as there is a negative side too. There are gambling
companies such as tombola—Members might have seen it advertise
its product before “Emmerdale” on television—and
it is a fairly new company that has enjoyed massive growth. I apologise
if this is not true, but I believe that it is based offshore, so it
does not contribute the taxation that people would like, and that is
the problem the Bill is designed to tackle. Tombola employs an awful
lot of people in the UK to work on things such as its marketing and
advertising strategies. If we imposed extra taxation on such companies,
which is difficult to justify given their margins, they will reduce
their marketing spend—we do not have to be great geniuses to
work that out—because they will not be able to afford to spend
as much on it. Ultimately, therefore, they will employ fewer people in
the UK to work on marketing.</hs_Para>

should think through the consequences of what we are doing. The
Government seem to have pound signs in their eyes, thinking that this
is an easy way to 
<?notus-xml column=637?>make money: there is no downside, it is all upside. Life is never
quite as simple as that. There are no painless
panaceas, and there may well be some unintended consequences, including
the fact that fewer people will be employed in these industries in the
UK. I am sure that none of us, whatever our view of the
Bill—again, I have no problem with it in principle—want
to see unintended consequences that result in people losing their jobs
in this country and in the economy losing money. We want a regime that
increases revenue for  the Government and increases the number
of jobs. The Government can do that, but they need to be rather more
careful than they have been, and rather more careful than has been the
case with this Bill. However, I commend
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:22:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friends

will leave the Dispatch Box after asking the Minister if he can clarify
where we are. We have two identical Bills: the only thing that is
different about the Offshore Gambling Bill is clause 4—where
have we been before on clause IV?—which deals with the levy. The
levy is important, as it provides essential funds for an important
industry, particularly in rural areas, but will the Minister explain
how he intends to proceed with the Bills? Will we see legislation in
this Session? It is shame that his draft Bill was not submitted to the
Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport any earlier, given that
there has been a paucity of Government business to fill the time. We
could have completed scrutiny of this piece of legislation had it been
introduced earlier. In the time remaining today, the Minister will want
to contribute to the debate as much as possible, so I shall leave it to
him to answer those points.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton asked about the levy,
which is the subject of clause 4. The best thing I can do is read to
her the legal advice that I have been given by the Government Law
Officers, which says that although a levy is permitted in its current
form, since it originates from before 1972 and therefore pre-dates
state aid rules, the European Commission is likely to consider that the
collection of contributions from overseas operators would substantially
alter the levy, such that it was no longer compliant with state aid. I
am afraid that, regardless of how many high-priced opinions are
obtained elsewhere, once the Government Law Officers have opined that
the Bill is therefore defective in that respect, the Government cannot
accept
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:26:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000437" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000437">Let
me turn to the reform of the levy board, which was the second part of
my hon. Friend’s question. Given the success of the levy board
in concluding the most recent negotiations, and the fact that the
advice that I was given, both by the industry and by the lawyers, was
that the proposed solution around secondary legislation was unlikely to
withstand legal challenge, should it appear, and since the advice that
I received from the chairman of the levy board was that there was much
more good will in the industry—I pay tribute to the work that he
and his organisation have done—it seemed sensible to allow him
six months to see whether he could put together a voluntary
agreement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:27:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000438" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000438">I
think that is the right thing to do. No Government want to legislate
unless it is absolutely necessary, and they need to exhaust all avenues
before they do so. The chairman of the levy board is aware that the bar
in that is quite high, because such an agreement would have to be
sustainable, it would have to carry the confidence of both sides, and
it would, I hope, bring security and stability to the industry in the

not in any way restricted the chairman of the levy board over that, but
I have made medium-term stability a key criterion by which we will
judge any deal. If is he able—I wish him the very best of
luck—to conclude a three-year or five-year deal that brings
stability to the racing industry and commands the confidence of both
sides, which I realise is a high hurdle to jump over, I would look at
such a deal very

hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton talked a little about
integrity and sports. I seemed to spend a considerable amount of my
time last year locked in rooms in Switzerland talking about integrity
and sports betting before the Olympics, and it is worth 
<?notus-xml column=639?>saying here that the system that was set up for London 2012 worked so
well that it is now being imported into other games as the model of how
these things should happen. Rather to our surprise,
there was very little of that sort of activity around London 2012. We
might find, as we discover more about it, that it is quite
sport-specific, and more specific to football and cricket than to some
Olympic sports, but the system worked
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000442" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000442">The
key point, of course, is that many of the threats come not from
established betting markets here and in Europe, but from illegal
betting markets in the far east. When I was in Delhi for the
Commonwealth games, a journalist got access to one of the illegal dens,
and one could hear the buzz about it. I do not know how these things
are calculated, but it is rumoured that for a one-day cricket match

Liam Byrne</B> (Birmingham, Hodge Hill) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful
for the chance to bring this subject to the Floor of the House for
debate this afternoon. May I say to the Minister, who has now taken his
place, that I am very grateful to the Secretary of State, and indeed to
his predecessor and to his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
Business, Innovation and Skills, for meeting me to discuss this
important subject? I rise, therefore, to reinforce a
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000459" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000459"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:31:42"></hs_TimeCode>The
nub of the matter is extremely simple. Today High Speed 2 is consulting
on safeguarding orders that, if put into effect, would lock up,
sterilise and write off one of the most important development sites not
just in the city of Birmingham but in the entire country. High Speed 2
proposes to do that in an area that has some of the worst unemployment
in the country, and at a cost  of some 7,500 jobs, which could
not and would not be created in years to come if the proposal were
implemented.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000460" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000460">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:32:47"></hs_TimeCode>
argument this afternoon is very simple: to proceed with locking up the
land on the LDV-Alstom site in Birmingham is tantamount to a monstrous
economic crime against the city. It is a senseless act and an avoidable
one. The city of Birmingham is looking to the Minister and to the
Secretary of State to bring an end to this
lunacy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:32:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000461" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000461">I
want to preface my remarks by saying that I am a passionate and strong
advocate of High Speed 2. I think it would transform the economic
geography of our country and do an incredible amount for the economy of
the west midlands and for the city of Birmingham. Some estimates have
suggested that something in the order of 60,000 jobs could be created
in and around  the city. Heaven knows we need those jobs, not
least in the light of the growth figures we saw this morning. I and
other Members of Parliament in and around Birmingham want to join
forces with the Government to ensure that the High Speed 2 legislation
that is needed hits the statute book as quickly as possible. We want
the project to go ahead and we want it to succeed, because we know what
kind of prizes it can bring.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012550000462" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000462"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:33:41"></hs_TimeCode>However,
putting a marshalling yard in the middle of the inner city, in the
middle of the worst unemployment blackspot in the country, is simply a
recipe for hobbling the economic growth of the city, specifically east
Birmingham, for literally the next 50 years. We in this House should
not stand by and watch that happen. Around half the city’s
unemployment is concentrated in three constituencies, Hodge Hill,
Ladywood and Erdington, all of which are at the junction of the site in
question, where High Speed 2 proposes to build its marshalling yard.
There are 22,000 people on jobseeker’s allowance in those three
constituencies. That is 42% of the number of people on the dole in the
city of Birmingham. Simply, the problem confronting local MPs is that
there are just not enough jobs to go
around.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000463" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000463">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:34:51"></hs_TimeCode>
morning I was pleased to meet some of the managers from my local
jobcentre, who do an incredible job under the most difficult of
circumstances. It is clear  
<?notus-xml column=641?>from what they tell me that there are simply not enough jobs to go
around. Indeed, the unemployment statistics published earlier this week
confirmed that in my constituency 24 people are chasing every
job.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000464" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000464">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:35:22"></hs_TimeCode>
is holding up unemployment in my part of the city of Birmingham is that
we do not have the local jobs to go around. That is why a couple of
years ago I suggested to officials at Birmingham city council and,
indeed, to the owners of the site that a once-in-a-century moment was
about to come to pass. After the liquidation of LDV and of the regional
development agency in 2010, for the first time in 100 years three great
pieces of the jigsaw puzzle on the LDV-Alstom site were about to come
together. In so doing, it created the second biggest development site
in the city of Birmingham, after Longbridge in the south of the
city<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:35:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000465" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000465">When
I asked city planners to undertake some rough and ready master planning
of what could be done on a site so big and so neatly adjacent to the
city centre and to our brilliant transport links in east Birmingham,
they said, after a bit of work, that something in the order of 7,500
jobs could be created on the site. There, on the table, is a specific
proposal to create 7,500 jobs in the middle of the worst unemployment
blackspot in the country. That, at a stroke, would take one in six of
those in the city’s dole queue off the dole and into work,
paying tax and national insurance, not sitting on the dole and taking
benefits. That is why this is too good a prize simply to throw away. Of
course, what is worse is that if the proposal for a marshalling yard
goes ahead, we will lose 850 jobs within the next couple of
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:36:48"></hs_TimeCode>. There are
two big businesses on the site and they are both ambitious to expand,
but they will be forced to move quickly if the proposal is given the
green
light<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:37:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000466" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000466">This
is not a theoretical problem. In the past year or so, two major
businesses, both seeking something in the order of 1 million square
feet, wanted to invest in the site, but ultimately they turned away to
go elsewhere because of the uncertainty that HS2 has cast over the
site. At a time of rising unemployment in east Birmingham, that is a
tragedy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:37:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000467" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000467">My
second big point is that I am not making this case simply on behalf of
the citizens of Hodge Hill, Ladywood and Erdington. The problem
confronts not just the citizens of east Birmingham but all residents in
Birmingham. If a site this big, which constitutes half of the best
urban land available in the city, is taken out, the city will, of
course, be forced to take land out of the green belt—and, my
goodness, what a lot of land it would have to take. In fact, it would
have to take almost double the amount of green-belt land to compensate
for the loss of land in Washwood Heath and Hodge Hill. That is the
equivalent of 105 football pitches— 7 million square
feet of green-belt land that would have to be taken from other parts of
the green belt around the city. I suspect, although I am not an
economic geographer, that a great deal of that land would come out of
Sutton
Coldfield<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:38:40"></hs_TimeCode>. There
are therefore big concerns not just for the residents of Hodge Hill but
for citizens across the
city<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:38:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000468" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000468">My
third major concern is that, if this proposal goes ahead, it will not
last 10 minutes in court. I won and lost enough judicial reviews in my
time as a Minister to recognise a process that is not judicial
review-proof, and the selection of this site is in no way judicial
review-proof. The objective criteria used to select the site have not 
<?notus-xml column=642?>been published. High Speed 2 has ignored much of its own guidance.
Indeed, I have been told by one of the site owners that two of the
three sites HS2 identified in its assessment are in green-belt land
south of the city, but there has been no clear acknowledgement in its
reporting of the economic devastation that the selection of the site at
Washwood Heath would wreak. There has clearly not been a transparent
and open process, and I should think that that would fall foul of a
judicial review hearing in any
court<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000469" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000469"><Member ContinuationText="Frank Dobson" PimsId="2981" UID="13012550000725" xid="170" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000725"><B>Frank

say gently to the Minister that this is one of the most important
projects in the country. It will, I hope, be a railway for well over a
century to come. It will transform the economic geography and economic
prospects of my region. It is controversial, it is difficult, and it
will have its ups and downs. It needs a powerful coalition across all
parties to support it. That cross-party support is jeopardised when we
have slipshod, mediocre management of a consultation process which, in
the case of the landowners that have talked to me, has involved their
producing very detailed and expensive submissions and getting but a
letter of acknowledgement, without even the offer of a meeting or an
invitation to come to consultation forums. AXA Insurance, one of the
site owners, presented some very detailed proposals that were not even
acknowledged by High Speed 2, provoking the former Secretary of State
herself to have to apologise for the omission. When we have a project
that is so significant to the country’s future, we
need the world’s best team, not any old team, managing
the consultation. I hope that the Minister will take that  on
board<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:43:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

is that some landowners, such as the Homes and Communities Agency, have
a legal obligation, in transferring their assets, to seek the best
possible outcome for local communities. I cannot see how such an

hope that the Minister has listened hard to the debate, and I look
forward to a full response. I look forward even more to him and the
Secretary of State taking the decision to put the marshalling yard
somewhere else. Much better sites are available. There are sites much
closer to the Y junction at Birmingham international airport, where
there are significant land holdings in the hands of Birmingham city
council. It is true that they are on green-belt land, but they are also
land-locked by the M42 and therefore dead; they have no future economic
purpose. They are in the middle of a very busy motorway junction that
is perfectly suitable and appropriate for designs of this

hope that the Secretary of State and the Minister can take a degree of
inspiration from our history. One hundred years ago, the city of
Birmingham doubled in size following Acts passed in this House in 1911
and 1912. A century ago, in 1913, the city of Birmingham published in
full its ambitious plans to create a bigger, better city in east
Birmingham, building on the foundations set by some of our great civic
entrepreneurs—Joseph Wright and his sons who built the great
Metro Cammell engine works; Herbert Austin who built the great site
that was the forerunner of Austin cars and LDV; and, of course, Lord
Norton, the last lord of the manor at Saltley, who laid out the streets
in the design that can still be seen today. Those great civic and
industrial engineers helped to create the mighty city of Birmingham and
set a standard against which we should judge ourselves. I hope the
Minister and the Secretary of State will not fall

think I should say something about how Washwood Heath was chosen and
why we are where we are now. I know there has been a desire from some
for the selection of the Washwood Heath site to be looked at again, so
let me dwell on that for a second. HS2 Ltd undertook an assessment to
identify a credible location for a rolling stock maintenance depot that
could be progressed as part of an overall HS2 London to west midlands
phase 1 proposition. The fleet using the depot, and ultimately the
depot’s functional requirements, informed much of the site
selection process. Additionally, the key factors influencing the site
selection process included location, size, access to the HS2 network
and sustainability.</hs_Para>

initial assessment concluded that a west midlands location was more
appropriate than a site in the London area. From that assessment, a
longlist of six potential sites in the west midlands area was
identified and evaluated. That resulted in the identification of a
shortlist of the Washwood Heath, Middleton and Coleshill sites. Those
locations underwent further evaluation to enable a preferred
option—Washwood Heath—to be identified as the most
suitable rolling stock depot location. The key reasons 
<?notus-xml column=645?>for Washwood Heath’s selection as a preferred option include the
fact that it is close to the Curzon Street terminus station, that it is
situated off the main HS2 line of route, and that the site is centrally
placed within the future national high speed network. That process is
documented in HS2 Ltd’s “Rolling Stock Maintenance Depot
Selection”, which was prepared in September 2010. In developing
a longlist of options, HS2 Ltd worked closely with Birmingham city
council officers, who agreed with the site selection
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-25T14:50:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012550000485" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000485"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Byrne" PimsId="2410" UID="13012550000728" xid="666" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130125/debtext/130125-0002.htm#13012550000728">Mr

points. First, the site in question has remained largely as it is for
many years, including through the last economic boom, and it is not
immediately clear—or at least the Government are not
persuaded—how realistic the development proposals are. Secondly,
the proposals for the rolling stock maintenance depot would bring
employment directly associated with building and operating the railway,
create opportunities for supporting employment uses, and make valuable
use of the site, which, I might add, has an historic association with
the railway.</hs_Para>

HS2 Ltd needs to safeguard a larger area of land initially to ensure

relevant financial support mechanisms up to the end of the 2013 annual

In Scotland, the ‘African’ category is collected and
presented separately to ‘Caribbean’ or
‘Black’, however under the harmonised UK output, these
two categories are output as Black/African/Caribbean/Black British. The

‘White/Asian/Other African’ in addition to
‘Black’

Dialogue, the Strategic Dialogue discussing foreign policy, and the new
People-to-People dialogue discussing culture, sport, media and
education. In recognition of the importance of the UK-China
relationship, China has been prioritised as part of the Foreign and

than a small adjustment for emergency ambulance costs, ACRA have never

complicated matter and one which is not directly under the control of
this Department. It is however one where very significant resources
have already been targeted. As has been very widely reported, a number
of banks have already been investigated by the relevant regulatory
authorities and fines levied, and it is reported that further
investigations are on-going. The Financial Services Authority has
completed its own investigation into Libor and the Wheatley Review,
commissioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, my right hon. Friend
the Member for Tatton (Mr Osborne), has also already reported, with the

is by no means clear that private finance initiative (PR) projects
entered into by institutions in the national health service, have been
adversely affected by the manipulation of Libor. In fact, it is
reported that at certain times banks’ Libor submissions resulted
in a lower declaration of Libor. This may have had the effect of
lowering the private sector's borrowing costs, thus reducing the PFI
payments required by the NHS body. Whether or not there is a subsequent
investigation by the Serious Fraud Office or other body is not a matter
for this Department to comment

counter narcotics assistance to a range of international partners in
each of the last 10 years. We have done so to tackle the international
drugs trade and minimise the threat it poses to the UK. It is important
to protect activities which form part of the UK's contribution to the
international counter narcotics effort and to respect the principle
that international partners are able to operate in secrecy on matters
of national security against organised crime. As such, it is our policy
not to disclose details of our counter narcotics work, as to do so
risks reducing its effectiveness and damaging international
relations.</hs_Para>

Office, in consultation with other Government Departments, is currently
considering the possible effect of the High Court decision of 24 July
2012. The actual cost of policing at events such as football matches is
determined by individual police and crime commissioners in negotiation
with the event organiser—not by the Home Office. We are always
looking for ways to ensure best value for policing. As part of this we
are reviewing the police charging policy including the existing
legislative framework. The work will be completed in due

according to the rites of the Society of Friends (Quakers) or according
to the Jewish religion, can only be carried out in buildings which have
been registered as places of worship and also registered for the
solemnisation of marriages by the religious group concerned. Council
halls and village halls are not usually registered as places of worship
