Gove:</Member></B> I absolutely accept the hon. Lady’s point
that Conservative-controlled Trafford is a superb local authority, and
we can see the many schools that have flourished under its care over
the years. As a strong local authority, not only has it welcomed the
growth and expansion of outstanding schools—such as Urmston
grammar, led by Mike Spinks, in her constituency —but it
recognises that schools sometimes have a responsibility beyond their
borders to help others to improve. In Northamptonshire we would not
have schools improving had it not been for the actions of David Ross
and other outside sponsors. Similarly, I know that there are schools in
the north-west that wish to extend their wings, not least Altrincham
girls grammar in Trafford, helping schools in deprived east

social workers are describing their case loads as unmanageable and 88%

education limited to a narrow elite in the 1950s is now being extended
to more and more children. I am very sorry that the snobbish attitude
that prevails on the Labour Benches<I>—[Interruption.]</I> It is
interesting to see Labour Members uniting behind a view that academic
education should be available only to a minority, and it is a unique
historic trap into which they are falling by endorsing the idea that
English, maths, science and modern foreign languages should somehow be
denied to young people. What a pity that the party that once stood up

say, for example, that English literature is not a subject that
encourages creativity. The assault on the subjects in the English
baccalaureate betrays the most narrow of mindsets, whereby the only
things that are creative are those which fall within a particularly
narrow spectrum. I think that scientists are creative; I think that
those who study physics are capable of creativity; I think that
geographers are creative; I think that historians are creative. To have
Labour Members attacking those subjects as somehow not being creative
and not being appropriate for the 21st century is as revealing as the
dog that did not bark in Sherlock Holmes’s

with far too many children being educated outside the city and far too
many of their parents feeling that they had to be educated privately.
At last, educational standards in Bristol are being turned around, not
least thanks to the inspirational leadership of academy sponsors and
academy leaders such as David Carter of the Cabot Learning Federation.

Prime Minister (Mr David Cameron):</Member></B> With permission, Mr
Speaker, I would like to update the House on the despicable terrorist
attack in Algeria and the tragic events of the last few days. It is
with great sadness that I have to confirm that we now know three
British nationals have been killed, and that a further three are
believed to be dead, as is a Colombian national who was resident in
Britain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:33:53"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
sure the whole House will join me in sending our deepest condolences to
the families and friends of all those who have lost loved
ones.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012112000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000191"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:33:59"></hs_TimeCode>First,
let me update the House on developments over the weekend and the steps
we have taken to get survivors home, and then I will begin to set out
how I believe we will work with our allies to overcome the terrorist
scourge in this region. The Algerian Prime Minister told me on Saturday
afternoon that the Algerian military had completed its offensive and
that the terrorist incident was over. Since then, Algerian forces have
undertaken a further operation to clear the site of potential
explosives and booby traps. This is still being completed, and it will
allow our embassy-led team to access the
site.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000192">It
is important to put on record the scale of what happened. There is
still some uncertainty about the precise facts, but we believe that, in
total, there were some 800 employees working at the In Amenas site at
the time of the attack, about 135 of whom were foreign nationals. Over
40 were taken hostage, and at least 12 were killed, with at
least a further 20 unaccounted for and feared dead. The Algerian Prime
Minister has said today that he believes 37 foreign hostages were
killed. The number of terrorists was over 30. Most were killed during
the incident but a small number are in Algerian
custody.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000193">Our
immediate priorities have been the safety of the British nationals
involved, the evacuation of the wounded and freed hostages, and the
repatriation of those who have tragically been killed. Working closely
with BP, and side by side with our US, Japanese and Norwegian partners,
a swift international evacuation effort has been completed. The last
British flights out on Saturday night brought not only the remaining
freed Britons, but also Germans, Americans, New Zealanders, Croats,
Romanians and
Portuguese.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000194">As
of yesterday, all 22 British nationals caught up in the attack, who
either escaped or were freed, had been safely returned to Britain, to
be debriefed by the police and of course reunited with their families.
Now, our most vital work is bringing home those who died. An
international team of British, American and Norwegian experts is in
close co-operation with the Algerian Ministry of Justice undertaking
the task of formally identifying their bodies. We want this process to
happen as swiftly as possible, but it will involve some intensive
forensic and policing work, and so may take some
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000195">Throughout
the last five days, the British ambassador to Algeria and staff from
across the Government and beyond have been working around the clock to
support British citizens and their families, and I am sure the House
would like to join me in thanking them for their efforts.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=26?><hs_Para UID="13012112000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000196">We should also
recognise all that the Algerians have done to confront this dreadful
attack. I am sure the House will understand the challenges that Algeria
faced in dealing with over 30 terrorists bent on killing innocent
people in a large, extremely remote and dangerous industrial complex.
This would have been a most demanding task for security forces anywhere
in the world, and we should acknowledge the resolve shown by the
Algerians in undertaking it. Above all, the responsibility for these
deaths lies squarely with the
terrorists.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000197">Many
questions remain about this whole incident, but one thing is clear:
this attack underlines the threat that terrorist groups pose to the
countries and peoples of that region, and to our citizens, our
companies and our interests. Four years ago, the principal threat from
Islamist extremism came from the Afghanistan and Pakistan region. A
huge amount has been done to address and reduce the scale of that
threat. Whereas at one point three quarters of the most serious
terrorist plots against the UK had links to that region, today that has
reduced to less than half, but at the same time al-Qaeda franchises
have grown in Yemen, Somalia and parts of north
Africa.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000198">The
changing nature of the threat we face was highlighted in our national
security strategy in 2010 and shaped the decisions we made. Although
there were difficult decisions to make, we increased our investment in
our special forces, cyber-security and key intelligence capabilities,
while also increasing our investment in fragile and broken
states.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000199">In
north Africa—as in Somalia—terrorist activity has been
fuelled by hostage ransoms and wider criminality. To date, the threat
it poses has been to these north African states themselves and, of
course, as I have said, to western interests in those states, but as it
escalates, it is becoming a magnet for jihadists from other countries
who share this poisonous ideology. Indeed, there are already reports of
non-Algerian nationals involved in this
attack.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000200">More
than ever, the evolving threat demands an international response. It
must be one that is tough, intelligent, patient and based on strong
international partnerships. First, we should be clear that this
murderous violence requires a strong security response. We must be
realistic and hard-headed about the threats we face. Our role is to
support the Governments of the region in their resolve to combat this
menace, as many are doing at a high cost. We will therefore work
closely with the Algerian Government to learn the lessons of this
attack, and to deepen our security co-operation, and we will contribute
British intelligence and counter-terrorism assets to an international
effort to find and dismantle the network that planned and ordered the
brutal assault at In
Amenas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000201">We
must work right across the region. In Nigeria, we will continue our
close security partnership with the Government there as they confront
Islamist-inspired terrorism. In Libya, we will continue to support the
new Government on the urgent priority of building new and effective
security forces. In Mali, we will work with the Malians themselves,
with their neighbours and with our international allies, to prevent a
new terrorist haven developing on Europe’s
doorstep.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000202">We
support the French intervention that took place at the request of the
Malian Government, and we are working to ensure that an African-led
military force 
<?notus-xml column=27?>can—with the appropriate training and
support—help to ensure Mali’s long-term stability. That
support will include the EU training mission that was agreed by EU
Foreign Ministers in Brussels last
week.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000203">Secondly,
our tough security response must be matched by an intelligent political
response. Al-Qaeda franchises thrive where there are weak political
institutions, political instability and a failure to address
long-standing political grievances, so we need a political approach
that addresses these issues. We must support effective and accountable
government, back people in their search for a job and a voice, and work
with the UN and our international partners to solve long-standing
political conflicts and
grievances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000204">Thirdly,
we must be patient and resolute. Together with our partners in the
region, we are in the midst of a generational struggle against an
ideology which is an extreme distortion of the Islamic faith, and which
holds that mass murder and terror are not only acceptable but
necessary. We must tackle this poisonous thinking at home and abroad,
and resist the ideologues’ attempt to divide the world into a
clash of
civilisations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000205">The
underlying conflicts and grievances that are exploited by terrorists
are in many cases long standing and deep, and, of course, the building
blocks of democracy—the rule of law and the independence of the
judiciary, the rights of minorities, free media and association, and a
proper place in society for the army—which are a big part of the
solution, all take a long time to put in place. But this patient,
intelligent but tough approach is the best way to defeat terrorism and
to ensure our own security. We must pursue it with an iron
resolve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000206">I
will use our chairmanship of the G8 this year to make sure this issue
of terrorism, and how we respond to it, is right at the top of the
agenda, where it belongs. In sum, we must frustrate the terrorists with
our security, we must beat them militarily, we must address the
poisonous narrative they feed on, we must close down the ungoverned
space in which they thrive, and we must deal with the grievances that
they use to garner support. This is the work that our generation faces,
and we must demonstrate the same resolve and sense of purpose as
previous generations did with the challenges that they faced in this
House and in this country. I commend this statement to the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13012112000487" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000487">3.42

Miliband</B> (Doncaster North) (Lab):</Member> I join the Prime
Minister in expressing my deepest sympathy and condolences to the
families who lost loved ones in last week’s terrorist attack.
For them, and for all those involved, the past six days have been an
unimaginable nightmare. The whole country has been shocked as the
horrific details of this unprovoked and violent act of terror have
emerged. This was pre-meditated, cold-blooded murder of the most brutal
kind, and behind each lost life is a family of loved ones who are in
our thoughts
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000208">I
echo the Prime Minister’s unequivocal condemnation of those
involved in planning and carrying out this attack. It is they who bear
full responsibility for the dreadful loss of life, and every effort
must now be made to bring them to justice. We on this side of the House
will give the Government our full support as they seek 
<?notus-xml column=28?>to achieve that. We will also give them our support
as they consider how best to respond to the growing threat that
al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and other violent extremist groups
pose.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000209">In
particular, the task is to understand the nature of the new threat,
which is more decentralised and fragmented and takes advantage of the
ungoverned spaces and security vacuum in parts of north Africa. At the
same time, in its response the international community needs to apply
the lessons of the past about the combination of diplomacy, politics
and security required to help to bring about stability in the
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000210">On
the attack itself, people will agree with the Prime Minister that the
Algerian Government was faced with some extremely difficult judgements
about how and when to act. I join him in paying tribute to all our
embassy staff for the work that they did. In the light of the attack,
can the Prime Minister say more about the work that the British
Government are doing with British companies operating in the region?
Can he tell us whether, at this early stage, any lessons can be learned
about the security of those
installations?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000211"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:44:18"></hs_TimeCode>Turning
to the broader context of what is happening in the region, on Mali we
support the Government’s actions to date. Can the Prime Minister
confirm that he does not envisage a combat role for British troops? We
agree that the efforts of the French military must be supplemented by
the much more rapid deployment of west African forces, as the Prime
Minister said in his statement. Can he tell us by what means, and in
what time scale, he expects that to be
achieved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:45:04"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012112000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000212">After
last year’s coup, the Mali Government face a security and
legitimacy crisis. Can the Prime Minister tell us what further steps
can be taken by the international community and Governments to use
diplomacy and development to stabilise the situation in Mali and, in

work?</hs_Para>

broadly across the region, countering the emerging threat of terrorism
begins with understanding it and talking about it in the right way. The
work to deal with that threat will be painstaking: diplomatic and
political as much as military; and collaborative and multilateral, not
unilateral. Does the Prime Minister agree that we are talking
about a number of distinct regional organisations, some using the
banner of al-Qaeda and others not, rather than a single, centrally
co-ordinated or controlled group? Each of these threats needs to be
monitored and countered appropriately. Will he outline what further
steps might be taken—he talked about some in his
statement—to improve the flow of information and intelligence
from the region, and whether it needs to be better shared with key
allies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:46:12"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

the Prime Minister said, we know that these threats grow where
governance is weak. What longer term roles does he anticipate for the
African Union and the Economic Community of West African States in
securing greater stability in the region, and how does he believe that
the EU will support that effort? On the question of ready access to
arms, can the Prime Minister set out how the international community
can better prevent the spread of weaponry throughout the region,
including weapons left over from the Libyan conflict?</hs_Para>

does he agree with me that if we are to meet the challenges we face, we
need a much greater focus of our diplomatic development and political
resources on

the right hon. Gentleman that we are not seeking a combat role in Mali.
We believe that we should be supporting the French, who have taken
emergency action to stop Mali being overtaken by what is effectively an
al-Qaeda-backed group of rebels. Our help for the French will be
discussed again at the National Security Council tomorrow. We have lent
them two C-17s. We propose to continue with that, and will be looking

hon. Gentleman is right to say that the answer on the security front is
to train up African soldiers, and that they should play the lead role.
Some African soldiers are already in Mali from west African states, and
others will be arriving soon. On who should have the co-ordinating
role, ECOWAS has been encouraged to take the lead, and there is also
the backing of a UN resolution that was secured before

distinct organisations in different countries, some of them more
connected to al-Qaeda than others. I think that we need to
make sure that we deal with each one individually, while
recognising that there are some commonalities. We are trying to break
up these problems and deal with them individually, rather than pose one

to raise the point about Libyan weapons. The British Government have
stepped up our engagement with Libya at all levels to help with the
challenge of security and removing so many weapons from their society.

and other resources in the region, that is very much something we need

further—to focus on those threats to our security that we face

that the Foreign Office actually got a reasonably generous settlement

Britain, particularly in south-east Asia. The second point is that when
we look at west Africa, we should be very much thinking about how we
will work with our partners—I have already had this conversation
with President Hollande and President Obama. We have particularly
strong ties with countries such as Nigeria; France has particularly
strong ties with countries such as Mali. It does not make sense for us

of Muslim-majority countries—to condemn it in very strong terms.

question. I would say yes, there is the capacity, for two good reasons.
First, I believe we are more effectively co-ordinating what we have.
The National Security Council means that we have the Development

Secretary, with their budgets, sitting round the table, which makes it
more possible to use that money—including through the conflict
pool—to come to terms with the challenges we face. Secondly, we
have taken some difficult decisions on defence, but as a result
we have reduced the amount of unfunded commitments and our budget is
now, as it were, in balance for the future. We can afford the very
important capabilities that include heavy lift—vital for the
sorts of things we are doing with the French—air-to-air
refuelling and those sorts of capacities, which will be so important

on both counts. It is clear from the scale of the attack, and the
number of terrorists involved, that it was some time in the planning.
However, I would advance the wider argument that my right hon. Friend
has advanced. Do we really believe that we—British people,
British companies and British interests—would somehow be safer
if we, and others, stood back from Mali and allowed it to become a
country effectively governed by an al-Qaeda franchise? Of course we
would not be safer. The whole premise behind such thinking is wrong.
Britain is a country that is engaged in the world and open to the
world, and we have people living all over the world. We are safer if we
act with others to deal with problems as they occur, rather than
turning our back on the world and pretending that it is possible to

eight of them, and lending two to the French for this vital task is
right. In future, we have the A400M coming in and that is a highly

The French intervened because it was an emergency, but their aim, as I

African states to put their military into Mali as a way of
providing security. It is in our interest to build the capacity of
these countries and, frankly, it is in their interest to make sure that

key for the future is not necessarily to look at the overall number of
regular soldiers, sailors or airmen we have, but to look at the
capabilities we have. We should reflect on the decisions taken in the
SDSR that made sure that our forces are mobile, properly equipped and
accompanied by all the assets they need. If, for example, we decided to
maintain the number of soldiers but not to invest in C-17 aircraft, we
would not be able to move those soldiers around the world. If we
invested simply in the number of soldiers but did not have drones and
other intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and
reconnaissance—ISTAR—equipment, we would not be able to
fight modern warfare. Yes, those are difficult decisions, but I have to
say that I find it frustrating when people just want to keep what we
have and then add to it. To govern is to make difficult choices about
priorities, but I am convinced that we made the right choices in the

Timms:</Member></B> In this Bill the Government are punishing people
who are already hard up for the failure of their economic policy. We
were promised that the policy would lead to steady growth and falling
unemployment, but it has failed. We have had a double-dip recession,
and some predict that this week we will learn we are in a triple dip.
Unemployment is now officially forecast to go up next year, so spending
on unemployment benefits will go up, and borrowing will go up
too.</hs_Para>

Chancellor’s policy has failed and the Government have decided
to respond by forcing down the incomes of those whose incomes
are already the lowest of all. Roughly speaking, the saving over the
two years to which the Bill refers will be about the same as the
increase in welfare spending resulting from the rise in unemployment
forecast just between the Budget last year and the autumn
statement.</hs_Para>

quarter of a million people received help from a food bank because they
could not afford enough to eat, and this Bill will make matters
significantly worse. It means that for three years, low-income families
will get below-inflation increases. The number of people visiting a
food bank will be higher this year and, because of this Bill, it will
be higher still next year and higher again the year after

the Government have restricted uprating to 1% for the coming year
without a Bill and did not need a Bill to restrict uprating for future
years. The Chancellor thought he could boost his party’s

part of employment and support allowance, the support group is
protected, but it is not. The Secretary of State said that people who

true, but people in the support group will be hit as well. Citizens
Advice has worked out that a lone parent with three children who is in

could about the extent of the mess left by the previous Government,
which was such that recovery has been choppy. As the whole Committee
knows, a recovery from a debt crisis is always much tougher,
particularly when we also have the eurozone plunging into crisis
because of its years of mismanagement. Unless we have sound
money and ensure restraint in the public finances and growth in the
private sector, we will not be able to turn the corner and get the
economy growing and the nation’s finances in place. The economy
is now starting to heal, but part of that involves building
in an extra incentive to ensure that work pays—universal
credit is part of that—and ensuring an extra incentive for those
who are out of work and on benefits to go into work. We do that by not
continuing with the over-generous benefits or over-uprating of
benefits, as compared with what people in work have received, that we

me turn to the issue of child poverty. We heard a lot of rhetoric on
child poverty from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T17:18:51"></hs_TimeCode> shadow
Minister, in addition to the amazing spending commitment that
he delivered to the Committee in response to my intervention. Let us
look at the child poverty figures, which the Opposition say are a key
reason to oppose clause 1. The figures from the last Parliament show
that, after housing costs, there were 3.6 million children in poverty
in 2004-05. In 2009-10, there were 3.8 million. In other words, it went
up 200,000 under the previous Government. The figures for 2010-11, the
latest available, went down 200,000 under the present Government. The
achievement of the previous Labour Government was therefore to increase
child poverty by 200,000—not a great record, to put it
mildly—while the present Government have been in office at a
time when child poverty has been falling.</hs_Para>

us also consider the fact that there were 700,000 children in severe
poverty in 2004-05. By the end of the Labour Government, that figure
was the same. After one year of this Government, however, the figure
had gone down to 600,000. Before the Opposition start talking about
child poverty, they ought to take a closer look at their record in
office. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T17:20:26"></hs_TimeCode>We also
need to have a closer look at the policy of universal credit, which,

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T17:21:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Dover (Charlie Elphicke) forgot to mention that while those on
benefits have had their benefits uprated at twice the rate of those in
work in percentage terms over the past five years, the actual increase
in financial terms has been on average about £49 for those in
work and about £12 for those on benefits. Those figures were put
into the public domain by Paul Lewis on “Moneybox” on BBC
Radio 4, and I have no reason to disbelieve him. I wonder whether the
hon. Gentleman has. It is important to take those figures into
consideration. Percentages are meaningless; 50% or 100% of very little
is still very little. Making comparisons in the way that he did demeans
the debate.</hs_Para>

would like to thank you for calling me to speak, Mr Evans,
because this is an important debate on a Bill that, if voted through,
will have a detrimental impact on many thousands of my constituents and
others across Tyneside and the north-east. I have said this 
<?notus-xml column=60?>before, but it is important: the way in which this country’s
economy works is very different in different parts of the
country. It is therefore important to remember that the equation of
welfare to work is a two-part equation. Welfare is one part; work is
the other. In some parts of the country, there is no work; in others,
between a dozen and 20 people—or even more in some
places—wait for each vacancy. In such places, where people have
no real opportunity to get work anywhere near their own locality, there
must be decent welfare so that they can sustain themselves, their
families and, most important, their children.</hs_Para>

for us to start by working out what we agree about, because during
debates such as this the House sometimes becomes very tribal. It seems
to me that we agree that we hate poverty, and that that is true not
just of the Opposition but of the two governing parties. We see poverty
as a scourge. We come here to promote and support policies that will
make people better off and improve their living standards—of
course we do—and today’s debate is about how we can
achieve that in very straitened and difficult circumstances.</hs_Para>

thought it was common ground that we need to ensure that it is more
worth while to work. In order to ascertain whether that is common
ground, I intervened on the right hon. Member for East Ham (Stephen
Timms)—who was very eloquent—and he said that that was
indeed Labour policy as well as Conservative and Liberal Democrat
policy. So we agree that we want to get rid of poverty and that we need
to make work more worth while. That is where our Ministers are faced
with a difficult dilemma. Last year’s benefits uprating occurred
at about the peak of the spike in inflation and so benefit recipients
got the 5.2% increase whereas low-paid people working alongside them in
their local communities got perhaps 1.7%, if they were
lucky—that was about the average. Suddenly, in one fell swoop,
people were 3.5% worse off in work than out of work because of the

to accept that, at the lowest income levels, there was a problem

Friends have a couple of policies that try to do that. First, they are
rightly taking many low-paid people out of tax altogether. I believe in
tax cuts for everyone. I do not just want tax cuts for the rich; I want
tax cuts for those on middle incomes and low incomes, particularly
those at the lower end. The idea of the tax cut for the rich is to get
more money out of them; all we are trying to do is get back closer to
Labour’s very successful 40% rate, which it kept for almost all
the time it was in office. I noticed that its 40% rate collected
considerably more revenue than the 50% it bequeathed to the incoming
Government, and so it was rather foolish to put in a rate that did not
work in taking money off the rich. We are trying to get back to the
earlier rate.</hs_Para>

by my right hon. Friends of reading them too closely. If she
read on through those Budget papers, she would see that that top rate
led to an almost 10% reduction in the amount of top-level income tax
coming in, which is a very foolish position to get into when we need
all the money we can get. My right hon. and hon. Friends are very
sensible to try to correct that, in order to get more money off the
rich. We need more money off them and less money off people at the
other end of the income scale. The way to take less money off people at

a handling charge, as the rich will not pay all the money we

to tax the poor in order to give them benefits, and that can be

Government are attempting, through their tax and benefit changes, to
tackle the problem of people asking, “Why work?” I have
two bits of advice for my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front
Bench that might be more to the liking of the Labour party. If my right
hon. and hon. Friends are going to pursue and sustain the policy of
very low benefit increases for the next period, it is important that
two other conditions are met. The first is that every action should be
taken to get inflation down. If inflation suddenly took off, this would
become a much tougher and crueller policy than Ministers have in mind.
That would be extremely difficult. So it is in everybody’s
interest—not just of those in low-paid work and not just those
on benefit, but those people in particular—that more is done to
sustain and control price
rises<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13012124000155" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0002.htm#13012124000155">5.45

that their contacts with the Bank of England stress the need to do a
better job of controlling price inflation than the Bank has been able
to do in recent years, and I hope they will also be looking at reforms
in a number of areas, particularly in energy, for example, because it
is energy prices above all which have done so much damage to people at
all income levels, but especially to people on low incomes and benefit
incomes. <hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>There
are other things, which are not the main subject of this debate, that

worries me that instead of seeking to restore the link to prices, the

is worth remembering that benefits were linked to earnings until 1980,
when the Thatcher Government changed the link to prices in order to
save money. That was a deliberate and aggressive policy to run down
benefit levels. In 1980, unemployment benefits were one fifth of
average earnings; today, they are one tenth. Earnings are important in
the long term, but in the current context, I worry that focusing on
earnings when they are so low, without the link to RPI, risks being a
smokescreen for existing Government policy. I worry that without the
additional protection of a link to prices, the link to earnings will
not protect people from inflation risk over the next three years.
People must, at the very minimum, be able to keep up with the rising
cost of living. My personal view is that benefits should increase
either in line with RPI or in line with average earnings, depending on
which is higher, but I deliberately tabled a more modest amendment that
would just restore the link to RPI because I wanted to press the
Committee to provide that minimum protection in the face of this Bill,

also many places, including my own in west Cornwall and the Isles of

are such people moving in and out of work—not of their own

have to acknowledge that, among working people and those who are moving
in and out of wages, there is a class or group who are, in effect, on
the very margins of survival. They will be significantly affected by
the proposal to peg benefits at 1%. Some argue that the Bill is about
ensuring that we make work pay and that clause 1 is entirely about
out-of-work benefits, but the fact is that a significant number of

said earlier that one big weakness of the Government’s proposal,
and the reason why I opposed it, was the inflexibility of the 1%
uprating. It takes no account of what may happen to food prices, for
example, by 2015-16. It is all very well having a Bill that takes a
clairvoyant view that a 1% increase will not press large numbers of
working families, as well as out-of-work families, into severe and
extreme hardship. However, we have experienced this year in the UK the
impact of significant volatility in our climate. There has been
significant climate change, 
<?notus-xml column=78?>which is having an impact on the food baskets of the world, including
those in many developing countries and here. We therefore need to ask
ourselves whether we can confidently say that there will not be food
price spikes such as we saw only a few years ago. I suggest that we may
see such spikes again. There is also tremendous concern about the
potential volatility of energy prices. The 1% uprating figure is
inflexible and somewhat arbitrary, and we cannot say with confidence
that we will not need to introduce further primary legislation to
revise that figure in
2016<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T18:25:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012132000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0002.htm#13012132000023">We
must also consider the impact of the 1% uprating on housing. In their
emergency Budget, the Government proposed to cut housing benefit from
the 50th percentile of rents to the 30th percentile. Whether or not we
like the fact that only 30% of the private rental market might be
available to people in receipt of housing benefit, rather than half of
it, it is essential that the rate is linked to the variation in private
sector rents. The 1% uprating will break the link with what is
available in the market and instead peg housing benefit back. In my
area, and I know in many others, the Government’s attempt to peg
it back by cutting the rate to the 30th per- centile
of rents has failed to constrain private sector rents, so it has not
had not the desired impact. Maybe it has in some areas, but certainly
not in mine or many

thing that has come across in the speeches of Members on both sides of
the Chamber is the economic illiteracy of the Government’s
policy as part of a strategy for reducing the deficit. As other Members
have said, one of the great things about welfare payments is that when
people are living on the bread line, the money that they
receive is spent in the local economy, often within their own community
or on their own estate. They spend it at their local convenience store.
They tend to spend it the minute they get it, rather than put it in
trust funds, because they are attempting to sustain their life on the
bread line.</hs_Para>

that he has been happy to support, demand comes out of the economy.

bust purely as a result of the economic circumstances, no, that is not
the case I am making. However, when a raft of retail organisations go

centres—happily, not in Chesterfield because of the progressive
policies of the Labour council—a huge number of empty shop
units, it is perhaps time to start considering whether the economic

issue I have raised previously in the context of the Bill is housing
benefit changes. Last week, I met Chesterfield borough council
officials to discuss the impact of the bedroom tax, which will hit
people across Chesterfield in April. The council knows it faces a time
bomb as people who cannot afford to pay their rents are told that there
is a shortage of smaller properties for them to move to. Many of those
people are at the back end of their working careers, and are either not
working or in part-time employment. The council is budgeting for a
situation in which around a third of them will fall into
arrears—their housing-related benefits will be reduced and they
will no longer have enough to pay their rents—and the Government
are increasing the discretionary payment to allow councils to meet the
costs of some who fall into that situation, which is a totally
illogical policy. People who have been council house tenants for many
years will fall behind, and the Government will give money to councils
to bail them out. At the same time, the Government will hit them on
housing and council tax benefit, and on tax credits. They are saying,
“Those payments have already been cut, but they will now be
increased by less than the rate of
inflation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T18:44:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012124000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0002.htm#13012124000153"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Marcus Jones" PimsId="5603" UID="13012124000267" xid="1112" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0002.htm#13012124000267">Mr

one who—like so many of my right hon. and hon.
Friends—applauds so many of the initiatives that the coalition
has been able to take, specifically in the field of social policy, I
think that the input from the Liberal Democrats has been significant,
not least from my hon. Friend the Minister of State who will have the
arduous task of replying to the very wide diaspora of this debate later
this evening.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T18:49:59"></hs_TimeCode> input
includes taking low-paid people out of tax altogether to moving in the
direction of universal credit—I do not take the jaundiced view
of many as to its prospects. I am delighted that the Secretary of State
for Work and Pensions is in his place, because if we find, a little
further down the track, that a little more constructive pressure needs
to be placed on the Treasury to make things work that little bit
better, he can certainly count on support from these Benches, because
we think that the direction of travel on universal credit is very good.
However, my hon. Friend the Member for St Ives (Andrew George) pointed
out that the Bill sits at odds, both practically and philosophically,
with developments of that type. He used the phrase “a blunt
instrument” and I think that is a fair description. Our
amendment would maintain a responsible position in relation to the
wider issue of the deficit—and deficit reduction
policy—in that benefits would not rise at a higher rate than
earnings. That is responsible, consistent and a constructive
contribution to the debate this

to get into detail at this stage in the debate: my objection is more a
philosophical and political observation. It is right that a party that
can look back to a lineage including Beveridge and Lloyd George should
make this reflection—that there is a large measure of political
device about the Bill, which emanates in particular from the personage
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, aided and abetted by the Prime
Minister. I say that because a tactical judgment has been made by the
Conservative—not coalition—high command that this can be
a very useful dividing stretch of water to place between themselves

election.</hs_Para>

against the politics of choice, argumentation and the clash of
ideas—what is the point of a House of Commons and a
parliamentary democracy without that? But the insidious aspect of the
Bill is that, in seeking to open up a philosophical divide of that
type, it becomes not an issue of political leadership, but of political
pandering to some of the fears, insecurities and downright prejudices
that can be stoked up in society—the “us and them”
mentality and the sense of resentment and envy. When people start
playing fast and loose with those factors—and we have seen early
examples against the backdrop of this legislation in the last week to
10 days —they are following a very risky strategy
indeed.</hs_Para>

that the Deputy Prime Minister—the leader of my
party—spoke out robustly against the initial posters and some of
the leaflets that the Conservatives were producing. However, where the
temptation of Her Majesty’s Britannic and historic Conservative

state historically and playing that card to their advantage and to the
disadvantage of others, I would take reassurances from them on that
this week as assuredly as I would take reassurances on Wednesday night
from the Prime Minister about the direction of their European policy.
That is the fact of the matter. But if that is the game that we are
playing—and I fear it is—the Liberal Democrats should
ensure a clear distance between ourselves and the Conservatives, given
our political
lineage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012130000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0003.htm#13012130000025">My
second point is, as my hon. Friend the Member for St Ives said, that
the presence of my hon. Friend the Minister of State—and other
colleagues, both in the coalition as Ministers and outside
it—has added strength to the philosophical and practical
arguments that we seek to bring to social policy. Before the last
election, I shared a party platform at one of our conferences with the
leader of my party. We were speaking about aspects of social policy,
and the point I made to him and to the audience I repeat tonight. We
can be tough-minded—indeed much more tough-minded than many an
outside commentator ever expected the Liberal Democrats would or could
be when the coalition was entered into two and a half years
ago—and that has been proven. What we have to remind people
of—with a view to the next election—is that our party and
our cause is not just 
<?notus-xml column=87?>about the head, but must also be about the heart. Many people will view
this Bill as hard-hearted, and many will remember that when they come
to cast their votes. In part, what we are trying to do here is remind
that section of our electorate, our membership, our activists, our
sympathisers and our supporters whom we want to come back over the
second half of this Parliament, that while the head remains rigorous in
government, the heart has not been lost in the wider environ that is UK
Liberal Democracy.</hs_Para>

what account had been taken of the difficult art of gazing into the

ever committed itself to a course of action without some sense of a
contingency there would great criticism from across the political

important—the Bill will commit the Government, and beyond what
can be the lifetime of this Government and this Parliament, to a course
of action for which there is no contingency. That is not a social,
political or economic blank cheque that those of us who put our name to

on those low wages will also lose out through the cuts to working tax
credits and housing benefit. In fact, the whole point about the
Government’s strategic, political mistake is that more people in
work will lose out from the Bill than those who do not work.
Furthermore, if he will allow me to do a little more arithmetic for
him, a person currently on ESA will get a 70p increase in April, but a
person earning £25,000 and receiving a 1% increase will get a

want to address the Minister. When, in the previous Parliament, we
introduced the Bill that became the Child Poverty Act 2010, he gave a
great deal of evidence from the Family Budgeting Unit in York and the
people at Loughborough about the minimum income standard—the
minimum income guarantee. He said that what the Labour Government were
doing was absolutely shameful and that benefits were not high enough.
Now, however, we see that he is prepared to cut benefits in a way that
we never did. The testimony to the great success of this
Government’s benefit policy is the expansion in the number of
food banks: in Durham last year, the food bank fed 4,455 people, of
whom 1,390 were children. That is utterly shameful. To demonstrate that
it is not possible to live on £22.96 a week, I am going to try
to do 
<?notus-xml column=89?>so during the February recess. Neither I nor, I believe, any other hon.

it was 13.2%; and by 2015, it will be 11.1%. It is absolutely clear
that the Government are trying to take it back to the very lowest point
at the very bottom of the recession, irrespective of the impact on

and ESA claimants live, he will see that it looks like a map charting

difficult decisions have to be taken. It is important to remind the

know, as was made evident earlier—certainly from the cheers on

that committing the country to a 1% increase for three years now,
before we know what inflation will be when the increase comes into
effect, could end up being harmful to people on low incomes, because we
have absolutely no idea how much world fuel and food prices will rise
in those three years. I recognise the strength of the argument that
benefits for people out of work should not rise at a higher rate than
the earnings of those in work, which is why amendment 10 proposes to
increase such benefits by the same percentage as the rise in average
earnings over the previous year. Amendment 10 would be a fair
compromise between the need to cut the deficit and the need to provide
a safety net for those dependent on welfare
benefits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T19:22:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

to people on low incomes, but if energy prices rise by more than

I heard the Prime Minister’s answer, I am afraid that I was left
to form the conclusion that the Government have no contingency plans
for a scenario in which prices rise by more than expected. I hope that

future increases to the increase in average earnings would address the
legitimate argument that out-of-work benefits should not rise faster

average earnings were used, they would increase 
<?notus-xml column=94?>by 1.6%, saving half the amount that a 1% increase would save. It is
also important to point out that cutting public spending on its own
will not eliminate the deficit. We need to grow the economy as well.
All the economic research indicates that money put into the pockets of
people on low incomes is far more likely to be spent straight away than
it would be by those on higher incomes. Not increasing welfare benefits

look at the overall picture. The 1% increase is not very much.
I know that some Government Members proposed a cash freeze, and I am
glad to note that the Government have not adopted that severe option;
but in the context of the European and the global financial crisis, a
cash freeze is not completely off the table. We have seen other
countries take extremely tough measures. Why have they done that? They
have not done it because they want to limit demand, as the hon. Member

want to hurt people on low incomes. They have done it

is surely a temporary measure; I would not want to see this in
perpetuity. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham talked about
the need to combat inflation. Clearly if inflation is sustained at 3%
or 4% over years, that would be very punitive and would make the
proposed measures even more difficult for people to bear. So the
Government need to keep a firm handle and an eagle eye on the inflation
rate. I am absolutely in favour of that, but on the general approach I
would not want to see any amendments to this Bill. It is a difficult
proposal that we are trying to push through, but many people up and
down the country are supporting the Government on it because they feel
that the measures we are introducing are encouraging people to get
out to work. People also realise—I will close where I
started off my speech—the appalling fiscal legacy given to us,
the incredibly difficult financial circumstances in which the

focus on amendment 7, which was supported so eloquently by my hon.
Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas). It is
important that we try to restore a link to prices this evening. The
problem with a below-inflation flat-rate uprating of benefits is that
it represents a real-terms cut in the incomes and living standards of
those who already live in the most straitened circumstances and will
continue to do so for the next three years. Some 70% of those who are
adversely affected are families with children and an estimated two

may be receiving below-inflation rises, not to impose a real-terms
freeze in the 
<?notus-xml column=107?>uprating of benefits. That is a particularly facile argument, which we
rehearsed on Second Reading. It goes without saying that whereas
someone with a job with average pay would receive £200 or
£300 for a 1% increase, depending on whether they were a man or
a woman, a person on benefits of £70 a week would see an annual
increase of £36. That probably would not even take me beyond the
boundaries of my own constituency. It is wrong to pretend that 1% of
not very much is equivalent to 1% of an average salary—or,
indeed, of the very generous salary that so many people in this place
enjoy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012136000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0003.htm#13012136000031"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T20:18:11"></hs_TimeCode>As
others have highlighted, there is a great deal of uncertainty in the
Bill. If inflation stays in line with OBR predictions, the
Government’s approach will result in a 4% real-terms cut in tax
credits and benefits by 2015. That is a very big “if”,
though: the OBR’s crystal ball has not been very effective to
date and it has certainly not been good at predicting
inflation—or, pretty much anything else. If inflation is higher
than the guesstimates from the OBR, the impact on low and
average-income households will be greater than we predict today. That
is why we must preserve the link between social protection payments and
the cost of
living.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012136000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0003.htm#13012136000032">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T20:18:53"></hs_TimeCode>

deciles will be worse off as a consequence of the cumulative impact of
the Government’s changes to the tax and benefits system, and the
least affluent will be the most affected. In contrast, three out of
five people on average incomes and above will be better off. That
exposes the truth of the matter: the Government have set themselves
priorities and made choices that make those on low and average incomes
pay for the tax breaks for the very wealthy. The poorer half of our
society is being asked to carry the can for a financial crisis and a
failure of political leadership that is not of its making, rather than

other key point that I want to make this evening—again, one that
I made on Second Reading—echoes points made by the hon. Member
for Gateshead (Ian Mearns) earlier today. It is that the measures of
inflation that we use are not especially good at measuring the impact
of inflation on lower income households. We know that low income
households spend a far greater proportion of their resources on
essentials such as food and domestic fuel. In the past five years, food
prices have risen by around 30%, and the prices of some staple foods,
such as potatoes, have risen by 40%. Projections for next year are for
rising prices for a number of staple commodities because of poor
harvests in north America and many parts of Europe, not least in our
own country. Thrifty shoppers, as we know, are adept at switching to

neither the consumer prices index nor the retail prices index captures
the full impact of inflation on the lowest income households, the
retail prices index includes some housing costs and is more likely to
reflect the actual inflation that poor people experience. The Bill will
cause tangible hardship, quantifiable in real money terms and in
practical ways for people on low incomes. Hundreds of thousands of
people who are disabled, who are carers, who are lone parents, will be
particularly hard hit. It will hit families, whether they are in or out
of work, dealing with the added expense of bringing up children. It
will not cut the deficit—indeed, it will take money out of local
economies and inhibit recovery at a time when we should be trying to
get local economies going.

long-term cost of child poverty cannot be measured only in financial
terms. The long-term implications for children who grow up in
deprivation are well quantified. The results are devastating and store
up problems for the future, some of which we are still dealing with

will vote for every amendment that seeks to ameliorate the Bill. That

There was a consensus for a time in our country about how we dealt with
welfare benefit upratings: they would increase on the basis of either
earnings or inflation, whichever was 
<?notus-xml column=109?>the higher. That consensus was achieved because there was a moral
commitment to protect the poorest in our society—in a civilised
society. It went alongside a steady rise in wages at the time. What we
have seen recently—it has impacted on my constituents
particularly—is wage cuts and wage freezes across the public
sector and in some parts of the private sector. I opposed the wage
freeze in the public sector that was supported by my own

is a gulf between the views and experiences of some Members of the

they suffer. I thought that might be particular to my

looked at the survey undertaken by Contact a Family, the charity that
works with families who care for disabled children. It was an extensive

have more faith in the British people. I do not believe that they
accept the terms of that debate. I think the British people
have a sense of fairness and a sense of moral commitment to people less
fortunate than themselves. That is why I do not think there is majority
support for the measure. I think that, as a result of this debate,
understanding is overcoming prejudice. Prejudice will be defeated by

to find the biggest number possible, but to measure inflation properly

that even the Office for National Statistics, which constructs it, says
does not meet international standards, is a crazy direction to take,

first relates to the specifics of the amendment, which links benefit
increases in 2014-15 and 2015-16 to whatever amount average earnings

should be. At a time when we will have to make other difficult

do not imagine that he meant this—would be to lock in what we
expect to be an above inflation increase in benefits in 2015-16. I do

have faced large cash losses. This is a different approach. It is a
gradual approach that will create much smaller losses, but for much
larger numbers of people. At a time when we are trying to find savings
from this budget, I believe that spreading the pain relatively thinly

want to say something a bit more positive to my hon. Friend. The gist
of his amendment is that he believes that fairness demands that
benefits go up in line with earnings. The Bill will deliver that for
him over what I believe is not an arbitrary period but a sensible,
realistic one. He knows that over the five years since it became
difficult to find money for things—the credit crunch and
financial crisis of 2008—we have put benefits up by 20%,
including 5.2% last year, when inflation was very high. With three
years of uprating at 1%, we would be on something like 23%. Wages have
gone up by 10% or so over that period, and I would wager that on any
credible estimate of wage inflation, benefits will have gone up at
least as fast as earnings over the whole eight-year period, if not
faster. Over a tempestuous period for the economy and the welfare
state, we will have ensured that benefits rise at least as fast as
earnings, which is a record to be proud of. The Bill will deliver what

Friend the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes) asked
me to give some examples of cash figures. We are talking about an
uprating of perhaps 80p a week or so below inflation in one year, so
maybe £2.50 a week below inflation over a three-year period. For
a typical person who is out of work for three months, which is the
median spell on JSA, the difference will therefore be a tenner a month,
or £30 to £40 over that three-month period. That
£40 is a lot of money to someone who is unemployed, but the
typical experience is that someone has three months of unemployment and
then finds a job. We are about to cut people’s income tax bills
by £600 a year, so that person might have, say, £3 a week
less while unemployed, but the typical experience is for them to be
unemployed for a relatively short period and then get a job, so they

the IFS does its numbers, it does not count almost all the taxes on the
rich we have introduced—it cannot, because it uses household

because they are too busy salting their money away in Swiss

the whole are folk who have capital gains and properties. They pay
stamp duty. They try to avoid paying tax, but we have been cracking
down on that, and there is a further clampdown on pension tax relief.
The vast majority of those gains for the Government are not counted in
the IFS figures. The overall impact is that we are taking far more from
the rich than Labour ever would have done. I can therefore assure my
right hon. and hon. Friends that this is not a question of taking money
from the poor when we could take it from the rich. Even the Budget that

but unfortunately it would tie the Government in to an above-inflation
increase in 2015-16. The Liberal Democrats would not choose that as a

that is what we will deliver through the

Lucas:</Member></B> On a point of order, Mr
Deputy Speaker. I wonder whether consideration could be
given to how our business could be organised better, so that legitimate
amendments could be put to a vote rather than being talked out. My
amendment was supported by at least four parties, and the amendment of
the hon. Member for St Ives (Andrew George) would no doubt have
received significant support as well, but there was no time for that
happen. I think that it would be a worrying precedent if the only
amendments put to a vote were those tabled by members of the official
Opposition.</hs_Para>

George:</Member></B> Further to the point of order, Mr Deputy
Speaker. As the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) has
pointed out, there is some disappointment among those who wished to
test the temperature of the Committee. We were readily allowed to
engage in the two-dimensional tribalism represented by previous
Divisions, but we had no opportunity to ensure that the more nuanced
and considered debate on other issues was brought to a proper
conclusion, because those who wished to express a view had no
opportunity to do so in the
Lobbies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012143000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0004.htm#13012143000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Deputy Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="1050" UID="13012143000061" xid="293" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0004.htm#13012143000061">Mr
Deputy Speaker:</Member></B> That was, in fact, the same point of
order. Again, I understand the frustration that is felt,
but—quite rightly—it is not for the Chair to decide the
amount of time that is allocated for a debate. It is for the House to
make that decision, and it did so on 8 January. No doubt the
hon. Gentleman will wish to take the matter up with the Whips in
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012143000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0004.htm#13012143000007"><I>Bill

Bill moves into its Third Reading with—I believe—its
fundamental principles intact. I thought that my hon. Friend the
Minister of State’s closing speech before the votes answered, in
detail, many of the questions that remained after the debate on the
amendments, but now, on Third Reading, I think it important to make
further
progress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012143000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0004.htm#13012143000011">The
arguments that we advanced when we presented the Bill were first and
foremost about affordability. Our main argument concerned the need to
reduce the historic deficit left by Labour. As I have said to my
colleagues throughout the coalition, at no stage have we made our
decisions lightly. This is not something that, at the start, we would
have wanted to do, and I want to come back to that point in a moment.
We were left a legacy of disaster and spending that was out of control,
and our priority must be to get that back under control. If we do not
do that, the poorest in society will fare the worst—that is the
main point to make.</hs_Para>

me give an illustration of the point I was making. Under the previous
Government public spending ran to excess, while the cost of working age
welfare increased by some 60% in real terms, as has been said on a
number of occasions. Money was poured into what became an over-inflated
system; as my hon. Friend the Minister of State,
has<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T21:37:07"></hs_TimeCode> said, for
every £3 taken in tax £4 was actually borrowed, with the
result that we had a growing deficit. It was one of the worst deficits
in Europe, if not the worst in the western world. We spent £170
billion on tax credits alone between 2003 and 2010. For all the talk
about this being absolutely about people in work, 70% of that money
went on child tax 
<?notus-xml column=129?>credits, chasing a target that Labour never hit, and
that was payable regardless of whether parents were in work or
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T21:35:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

increase into tax credits just before an election—almost 70% of

recipe for nightmare problems and excess spending. We do not claim that
that is the right way to measure the problem. The hon. Lady will have

Second Reading, I noticed one of her Front Benchers nodding his
head—they would admit that when they worked out the arbitrary
target in 1997-98, they thought that they would not be in power that
long and that they could achieve the targets along the way. What they

should be limited to two years. We have said that there should be an
independent gateway for disability living allowance. We have said that
we should switch the way we uprate benefits from RPI to CPI. We have
said that there should be a benefit cap which, yes, is different in
London from the rest of the country, but a benefit cap none the less.
We have said that disregards in tax credits should be reduced.
Crucially, we have said that there should be a two-year limit on
jobseeker’s allowance. That is a far bigger list than the
current Chancellor of the Exchequer ever set out when he was in
opposition. We think welfare spending should come down. We think
getting people back into work is the way to do it. That is why we think

price of children’s clothing is rising by 4.5% and food prices
are rising by 3.6%. Working mothers going on to statutory maternity pay
are losing £180 a year at a time when someone on £1
million a year is getting a £2,000 tax cut. How are Government

tragedy is that there is another way to bring down welfare spending.
Long-term unemployment is now rising towards the 1 million mark, as is
youth unemployment. Nothing in this Bill fixes the Work programme,
which gets only 2.6 people out of every 100 back into work,
or fixes the disarray that is now unfolding in universal credit. What
the Government should have been doing tonight is bringing us measures
to bring down unemployment, long-term unemployment and youth
unemployment, and to save this country the cost of failure. Instead,
the debate on this Bill has shown a Government and Secretary of State
who are hellbent on making savings and clearing up the cost of the
failure of a rising unemployment bill by taking that money from working
people—6,000 working people for every Conservative-held marginal

Mann</B> (Bassetlaw) (Lab):</Member> I rise to highlight the problems
of the reorganisation and funding of the East Midlands ambulance
service. The problem has been covered up because, over the last 18
months, the service has lost the contract for non-emergency transfers
of patients to Arriva trains and buses. Regardless of the question of
service, the impact on the East Midlands ambulance service is £5
million a year. That was told to me, in advance of the loss of the
contract, by the senior officials who ran the service. That £5
million a year has not been put back in additionally by the Government.
Therefore, £5 million of cuts are required in the
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301222000597" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0004.htm#1301222000597">To
make those cuts, the service is attempting to reconfigure, which has a
detrimental impact on my constituency and elsewhere, as I shall
outline. Before doing so, I wish to highlight another problem for the
Minister to respond to: targets and how they are set. There is
currently an in-built pressure for ambulance services to meet specific
targets. The reconfiguration is happening in the context of meeting
those targets, but there are perverse incentives within many of
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301222000598" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0004.htm#1301222000598">I
shall highlight that with one example, but there could be many. A
mother sadly lost her child last year. The mother went into premature
labour at 29 weeks and the child, Jessica Day, died at birth. When the
mother went into premature labour, she had a midwife with her and an
ambulance was called, but none was available. A response vehicle with a
single paramedic came, but Jessica Day’s mother
needed—medically—an immediate transfer to an intensive
care unit within a hospital to give the baby, Jessica, a chance of
survival. Had that immediate transfer happened, on the balance of
probabilities, Jessica would be alive. It did not happen because no
ambulance was available. In fact, the nearest ambulance was on its way
back from Sheffield on the M1 in
Yorkshire.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301222000599" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0004.htm#1301222000599">That
in itself is a major issue, but perhaps equally major is the fact that
the target was met. Despite the fact that the mother with the baby
needed to be in hospital immediately but did not get there for an hour
and two minutes, the target was met, because a car arrived with a
paramedic within 19 minutes. The mother and baby needed to be in an
ambulance, and it was the right medical decision not to transfer them
in their own car, which was available, as that would have endangered
the mother as well. That is a graphic illustration of the
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301222000600" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0004.htm#1301222000600">As
we see repeatedly, not least in respect of elderly people, if the
target is not met, the ambulance does not come for many hours. For
example, one 80-year-old pensioner was laying in a garden for more than
an hour with a broken hip. Because the immediate response target could
not be met, the emergency was de-prioritised, and the ambulance was
sent somewhere else to meet another target—the second incident
may or may not be as urgent. The longest wait I know of for an
emergency response is 10 hours, but it is often three or four
hours—with “often” not meaning daily, but
certainly weekly. That needs to be looked at.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=142?><hs_Para UID="1301222000601" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0004.htm#1301222000601">I also see a
problem emerging with improvements. How could improvements be a
problem? Over the last 11 years as an MP, I have called for a vast
increase in the number of community defibrillators. I would like to see
them in every community building, every significant employer, most
small employers, every school and every parish council, with trained
responders to use them. That would be wonderful, and a wise
expenditure. All those defibrillators would be maintained by the East
Midlands ambulance service, and every time one was used, it would be
deemed to be an eight-minute response. Therefore there is a perverse
incentive not to have community defibrillators in areas such as mine,
because it would mean fewer ambulances. The community first-responder
with the defibrillator would meet the response time, but the ambulance
would not come in that minority of cases in which the patient needed to
get to hospital. That is no good for my
constituents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301222000602" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0004.htm#1301222000602">It
is similar for strokes. I would like to see localised thrombolysing
done immediately in the way it is done in Iceland, for example. The
brain image is scanned and sent to the consultant, wherever they are.
They analyse it instantly and the decision on thrombolysing is made.
That is done without having to take people to hospital, but we are
light-years away from that simple system. The reconfiguration of the
ambulance service now under way will worsen that
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301222000603" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0004.htm#1301222000603">There
are bigger problems for people who do not live in a city. I want to go
through some mathematics with the House to show the problems. The
problem of averaging to meet targets means that, by definition,
high-density cities will always be prioritised over low-density rural
areas. I have a theoretical example, but it could be real in the east
midlands. Suppose we have a city of 900,000 people and a rural
constituency of 100,000 people. The average time for an ambulance to
get to a job is much shorter in the city because of the density of
population. In other words, the propensity of any square kilometre to
have an incident is much higher simply because of the density of
population. Therefore there will be a much higher level of vehicle
cover in the city. But a 95% response time in the city and a 60%
response time in the rural area—with the population figures I
have given—results in a 91.5% response time overall. If those
figures are reversed, with a 60% response time in the city and a 95%
response time in the rural area—the exact opposite—the
overall response time falls from 91.5% to 63.5%. Therefore, by
definition, setting response times as they are means that ambulance
services will disproportionately put their resources in the
high-density cities rather than in rural areas. That is bound to
happen, and the problem when the service faces a shortage of money is
that when it reconfigures to meet response times, it has to downgrade
the rural areas. It is not possible to do otherwise if response times
alone are taken into account. The Minister needs to look at how the
response times are
set.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301222000604" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0004.htm#1301222000604">These
are major issues for the Government, and I do not make those points in
a hostile, partisan way. These are issues that successive Governments
have looked at, but no solution has been found. Those things have to be
changed. As well as Bassetlaw hospital, we use Doncaster Royal
Infirmary—we are part of the same trust. We use Sheffield
hospitals for heart attacks and cancer. However, the East Midlands
ambulance service plans have been reconfigured to take us to
King’s Mill in Ashfield, which is an entirely different

the largest public meetings. We found one person—I will not name
his political party, but he was the campaign organiser for a small
party—in favour. All the other 19,000 who signed up were against
it—every single person in the public meetings was against it.
All the staff were against it—every single one of them. They
were all against it because,

ambulances and the base are shifted out of the area and we just have a

the bit of the response time that is not met. My constituents will

I want from the East Midlands ambulance service, therefore, is a proper
rethink. It is clearly rethinking, but I want to ensure that Worksop
and Retford ambulance stations stay open. If they want to juggle the
minutiae of where the management is based, I am not worried about that
and neither are my constituents, but we want two proper bases. We want
the Gainsborough ambulance service maintained to keep accessibility in
the north-east part, the rural part, over the border in Lincolnshire.
That is what we need if we are to maintain the kind of service that my
constituents expect. They pay their taxes. We have our illnesses like
everybody else. What is unacceptable to all of my constituents and to
me is that former mining areas and rural areas have a worse ambulance
provision than the rest of the country. We are not prepared to accept
that. East Midlands ambulance service must come back with a proper
proposal. In that proposal, Worksop and Retford ambulance stations will
need to stay open so that there is a proper base to allow the staff to
continue to do their excellent job. I thank the people of Bassetlaw for
the way they have responded. They will continue to do so to ensure that
we get the service that they
deserve.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_21_PT_1/5A8B701B140261C57696E8927CBB2ABC63694DA7" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="21 January 2013">Monday

closure of an ambulance station will de facto reduce the service

respond to a local incident. They spend most of their time out of
ambulance stations on the road so that they can respond to emergency
calls. EMAS reported—these are important facts that should be

£169.5 million in its 2011-12 final accounts and a £1.4
million surplus. It has also reported surpluses in the previous three
years. I understand that for 2012-13 the trust received £3.5
million funding as its share of the EMAS contract from Bassetlaw
primary care trust. As I have said, my concern is not so much about the

summed it up—we are having an outbreak of cross-party unity. As
he says, the key point is the positioning of the hub. One of the
attractions of the hub approach is that the mechanics would be in place
to ensure that the vehicles were ready at the beginning of a 
<?notus-xml column=146?>shift. At the moment, paramedics are responsible for that, which does
not seem to be a very good use of their time. There is therefore much
merit in establishing 27 hubs in the right areas to ensure

hon. Member for Bassetlaw has quite properly commented on the
difficulty of having targets, and I could not agree with him more. This
debate is a good example of where top-down, Government-led targets have
blighted an ambulance service—no doubt there are many other
examples in the NHS. That is why, when this Government were elected,
for many of us it was on the basis that these targets, far from freeing
up services and making them better, were strangling them and making
them worse. This debate is an example of targets doing all the things
they were designed not to do, constricting a service and making it
worse. It is worth bearing it in mind that it was in 1997, I believe,
that the ambulance service suffered from such targets. I hope that
there will be more cross-party agreement and moving forward, so that
although there are laudable aims that all services should have, we
should not necessarily set rigid targets, which then create exactly the
sort of horribly sad cases that

should be redefined so that they are targeted only at those who are new
to a job or role that requires sustained and substantial training, that
there should be greater focus on the outcome of an apprenticeship, that
recognised industry standards, should form the basis of every
apprenticeships, and that Government funding should create the right

deal with representations from hon. Members in a number of ways
including responding to inquiries addressed to a court or tribunal,
preparation of answers to parliamentary questions, verbal briefing of
Ministers and drafting written responses to ministerial correspondence
and other official replies. HMCTS staff whose roles specifically
include dealing with such representations receive training in answering
telephone calls and responding to written correspondence from Members
and their offices. This training aims to ensure that staff can identify
what information a Member needs or what further action must be taken in
response to representations. It also trains staff to understand what
information a Minister or other official should provide to the Member.
This ensures that Members are provided with appropriate case specific
details to assist their constituents, resolve their inquiries and also
that appropriate action is taken by HMCTS.</hs_Para>

the jurisdictions; the review and continuous improvement of

work to increase judicial sitting capacity by improving the processes
used to allocate judges and members to sessions; further increasing the
use of Saturday sessions as well as rolling out a three-session day,

Simon Burns:</Member></B> The Government recognises the potential of
unmanned aircraft systems, now referred to as Remotely Piloted Aircraft
Systems (RPAS), in a variety of civil applications, particularly in
crisis management situations. The ability to stay on station for
prolonged periods of time with cameras and other sensors without the
need to refuel or consider pilot fatigue makes them ideal for
monitoring disaster and security events or for other environmental
applications, such as crop and vegetation monitoring. Police forces,
fire services and a growing number of farmers are all showing an
interest in operating RPAS. However, we recognise there are some
concerns from the general public about the use of RPAS in urban areas,
particularly in relation to privacy and data protection. Operators are
required to take into consideration European and national legislation,
such as the Data Protection Act and Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act, when conducting operations and ensure that data is managed
sensitively and securely in accordance with these rules. We do not
believe that any additional regulatory changes are needed to ensure
adequate privacy and data
protection.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_21_PT_1/C644656EC4CF25B6B59CDFD7226304128739B9E8" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="21 January 2013">Monday

leavers leave the military with a range of skills and abilities which
are transferable for civilian life and civilian employment.
Consequently, personnel who leave the military enter a wide range of
civilian employment sectors; from security to engineering, from health

how to spend the Bonus, since we believe they are in the best position

Notwithstanding, I would note that green belt policy in the National
Planning Policy Framework is clear that most forms of development are
inappropriate other than in very special circumstances. Similarly,
green belt boundaries should not be altered other than in very special
circumstances through the preparation or review of local plans. All
local plans are subject to the requirements of the Strategic
Environmental Assessment directive and therefore the environmental
effects of any proposed policies to be included in the local plan,
including reference to the green belt, must be assessed. In addition, a
local planning authority must demonstrate that its plan is founded on a
credible evidence base, takes into account views of the local community

national

referred to in the DEFRA consultation of April 2012 on ways to tackle
irresponsible dog ownership relates to the Sentencing Council's
guidance on dangerous dogs cases. This guidance was updated and
increased its recommended upper limits for such offences. The new
guidance came into effect on 20 August 2012. DEFRA's proposal, made in
the same consultation, to allow suspected prohibited-type dogs to
remain with their owners while their cases are being dealt with, is a
separate proposal and one we are considering along with the other
proposals. An announcement about a way forward on all of the proposals
set out in DEFRA's consultation of April 2012 will be made
shortly.</hs_Para>

establishment of rule of law is a priority in its reform process.
Burma's problems with its judiciary are pronounced: partiality and
inconsistency in sentencing is prevalent, as is corruption within the

serving civil servants often lack the capacity to design and implement
reform. The British Government remains committed to supporting the

action.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012142000326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/text/130121w0004.htm#13012142000326">The
