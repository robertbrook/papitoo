Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr George Osborne):</Member></B> More than
1 million private sector jobs have been created since the first quarter
of 2010 and employment is at a record high. We are supporting more job
creation by further reducing the rate of corporation tax to 21%, and
since 1 January we have been helping businesses large and small to
invest, with a temporary tenfold increase in the annual investment
allowance. We can afford these tax reductions in part because we are
taking tough action on tax evasion. I can confirm to the House that
last night Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs received
£340 million from the Swiss Government, a first instalment of
the deal we have struck, and the first time in our history that money
due in taxes has flowed from Switzerland to the UK, instead of the
other way

House outlining the UK’s deployment of two C-I7 transport

detachment of technical personnel deployed to Bamako airport to assist
with the reception of the C-I7 aircraft. Since that announcement, we
have decided to extend our support to the continued provision of one
C-I7 in support of the French for a further three months. There are
currently about 20 people deployed in Bamako supporting liaison with
French forces and, following a French request for additional
surveillance support, we have deployed a Sentinel R1 aircraft to Dakar,
Senegal, with supporting ground crew and technical support staff of

involvement in Mali and the wider region is deepening, and it is
clearly in everyone’s interests that we do not allow legitimate
Governments to fail, particularly when faced with extremists. It is no
secret that I opposed our recent interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and
Libya, because I fear that one can be drawn into ever-deepening
conflicts. Afghanistan illustrated the dangers of being sucked into
larger deployments. That mission morphed into something much larger: it
changed from a mission to defeat al-Qaeda or deny it the use of
Afghanistan to one of nation-building.</hs_Para>

We need greater clarity on the role of British troops. The Government
have said they will not be placed in a combat role, but there are a
host of grey areas between combat roles and support roles. What exactly
will these advisers do? Will they be involved in logistics or training,
or will they advise on strategy? Equally importantly, how will they be
protected? Are we deploying troops on the ground to protect these
advisers, or are we relying on our French colleagues to provide that
protection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T12:39:13"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012943000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0001.htm#13012943000220">May
I also ask the Secretary of State what exactly is the exit strategy? It
is very easy to get drawn into these situations, but it is not always
clear what the endgame and exit strategy are, and even what the endgame
looks like. What are the contingency plans if military progress does
not go to plan? Is there talk on the table that we should perhaps be
deploying or committing, or be prepared to commit, more troops if the
fighting goes badly? At the moment, that is all going well, but the
situation can change very

what lessons should we learn from United Nations Security Council
resolution 2085, which was passed last year and called on local African
nations to lead the combat role in defeating these extremists in
northern Mali? There was tremendous delay in the implementation of that
resolution. What lessons have we learned from that, because we seem to
be playing catch-up? On a related but slightly separate issue, what is
the international community’s broader strategy on encouraging
local forces to play a more proactive role, not only in Mali, but in
the wider region, in combating these extremists? These are legitimate
questions and the British public and we as a House need to ask them,
because there is a real danger of getting drawn into a much larger
deployment, particularly if things do not go to plan on the
ground<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T12:40:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Hammond:</Member></B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his
questions. First, the UK has a clear interest
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T12:44:15"></hs_TimeCode> the stability
of Mali and in ensuring that its territory does not become an
ungoverned space available to al-Qaeda and its associates to organise
for attacks on the west. Secondly, we have established military
co-operation with France, which is an important part of
Britain’s strategy for the future, and this situation, along
with the Libya campaign, is an opportunity for us to demonstrate the
validity of that working relationship with France. The role of British
troops, as I set out in my response to the urgent question, is clearly
not a combat role, and it will also not extend, as we envisage it at
the moment, to a force protection role. We are looking for force
protection arrangements to be put in place, probably by the French, but
certainly by the European Union in relation to the EU training
mission.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend asked me about the exit strategy. France has made it clear
that it envisages a short intervention to stabilise the situation on
the ground while the African forces from neighbouring countries and the
Malian army deploy to sustain the situation in the longer term. We
concur with that strategy. I should say, again, that it is not our
intention to deploy combat troops; we are very clear about the risks of
mission creep and we have defined very carefully the support that we
are willing and able to provide to the French and the Malian
authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T12:42:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012943000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0001.htm#13012943000224">My
hon. Friend referred to UN Security Council resolution 2085 and the
time delay in deploying African forces. I think it is well known that
the intention was to deploy African forces in support of the Malian
authorities later this year, but the situation on the ground has become
more urgent, hence the decision by the French to intervene. Some of
these forces require equipment and some require additional training,
and the response time to the mobilisation envisaged by resolution 2085
has perhaps been longer than we would have liked. The lesson we can
learn from that is that if we want local forces to be able to deploy
and respond to resolutions of this nature, we may have to take a more
proactive role in resourcing them to do so.</hs_Para>

the broader strategy for encouraging local forces to tackle extremism,

will be broader worries about mission creep. The UK commitment to Mali
has grown from lending the French two transport aircraft to the
deployment of perhaps hundreds of troops to the region. It appears
clear that Islamists have chosen to abandon population centres and
might now melt away across near-non-existent borders. It is possible
that they will be able to regroup and return to carry out the type of
terror attacks we have seen in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. What

so?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012943000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0001.htm#13012943000229"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T12:45:35"></hs_TimeCode>I
want the Secretary of State to say more about force protection. If UK
trainers are based in Bamako, which has not to date been the centre of
violence, that might make them and the capital a target. Our forces
will, I assume, be armed, so what will the rules of engagement be? UK
trainers might be non-combat, but that does 
<?notus-xml column=784?>not mean that they are without risk. They are deployed and will need to
be protected in a hostile environment, so what security guarantees has
he received from French forces about protecting UK trainers as a
condition of this deployment from day one?</hs_Para>

Afghanistan to Mali. We are acutely conscious of the primacy of the
operation in Afghanistan and the limits of what we have been able to
offer the French in this operation are defined largely by the need not
to degrade our capabilities in Afghanistan. We are looking all the time
at what we can do without impacting on the air bridge or the operation
in Afghanistan. As he noted, our initial response was to offer
logistical support as that was what was urgently required to get French
troops and equipment into Mali. The French ask has evolved to include
additional surveillance capability, which we have now provided with the
Sentinel R1. Over the next weeks and months the requirement will be for
training of the Anglophone African troops who will provide the force in

Maghreb is not as great as we would like it to be. It is not an area
where Britain has had traditional involvement, but we are making strong
efforts to obtain awareness of what is going on there. We should not
underestimate the potential for terrorist threats to emerge from the
Islamic Maghreb, but nor should we overestimate the strength of the
Islamists in this region.</hs_Para>

loudly and clearly, but of course precisely the problem that we are

with a majority Christian population, with a significant Islamic
minority. It is a country of two halves geographically, climatically,
religiously, culturally and ethnically. That is the challenge, but the
solution must be a democratically elected Government in Bamako who
effectively represent all parts of that country. That is the long-term

supporting and upskilling local forces in fragile areas, to prevent the
breakdown of order in such countries. We are proposing to deploy up to
200 troops in a training role to support four Anglophone countries in
west Africa to prepare forces to intervene in Mali. That seems to me to

establish freedom of movement in an area such as the Sahel in order to
attack us in the future. I say again that this appears to me to be a
very limited and well-leveraged intervention by Britain in support of
the French, who have deployed significant numbers of troops and
equipment, and who are doing the heavy lift alongside the Malians. What
we are now proposing to do is help to reinforce the English-speaking
African countries which have also indicated that they are prepared to
contribute forces to deal with this as a regional problem. That is the

concerns and are addressing them with  the Malian Government

have opposed over many years many of the things that the hon. Gentleman

differ with the hon. Gentleman on three principal areas. First, as many
hon. Members will recall, the Equality Act 2010 already takes great
care to provide protections for persons of religion and belief, despite
significant scaremongering at the time, such as claims that we were
going to lose Christmas and other such things. Those protections were
placed on a principled equal footing with other protected
characteristics, including those of sex and sexuality. As the
Government Equalities Office made clear in guidance when the Bill was
introduced:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13012946001292" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0002.htm#13012946001292">“In
the case of Ministers of Religion and other jobs which exist to promote
and represent religion, the Bill recognises that a church may need to
impose requirements regarding sexual orientation, sex, marriage and
civil partnership or gender reassignment if it is necessary to comply
with its teachings or the strongly held beliefs of
followers.”<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T13:45:29"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13012946000101" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0002.htm#13012946000101">I
believe the Act already provides safeguards against the scenarios
envisaged by the hon. Gentleman, and that it does not need further
clarification by
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T13:45:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=802?><hs_Para UID="13012946000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0002.htm#13012946000102">Secondly, by
opening up debate on such a carefully considered piece of legislation
in what is effectively a piecemeal way, we could essentially be undoing
the work of a great deal of parliamentary debate that took place when
we considered where to set the boundaries on “protected
characteristics”, and how to balance appropriately the rights of
one protected group alongside or against those of another. As I have
said, great care and respect were provided to people of religion and
belief, as well as to those without belief, to ensure that they could
not be discriminated against on that basis, and appropriate exceptions
were provided in relation to other protected characteristics to prevent
malicious prosecutions—for example, trying to force a church or
other religious institution to appoint a minister or priest not of its
faith. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T13:46:23"></hs_TimeCode>I have
worked for a Christian organisation protected by such provisions, to
ensure that where there is a genuine occupational requirement to employ
a practising Christian, that requirement is protected and

I fear that this motion is unfortunately a veiled attempt to prejudge
and resolve a problem that, in my view, the Bill on equal marriage does
not create. With the greatest respect to the hon. Gentleman, a motion
such as this is not the best vehicle through which to pursue the views
of this House on such important matters, given that next week we will
have a clear opportunity to debate and discuss all implications of the
proposed equal marriage legislation, not just one part in isolation
which I am worried could merely distract the
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T13:47:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Gentleman and those who support his position will be entirely at
liberty to pursue their concerns and lines of inquiry as part of their
contribution to the Second Reading debate, or to probe the point by
tabling amendments subsequently. I have no doubt that Ministers will be
able to assure him that the problem he appears to be outlining will not
be created by the Bill on equal marriage, and therefore does not need
to be resolved by an unnecessary
measure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T13:47:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012946000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0002.htm#13012946000105">The
hon. Gentleman and I will no doubt find ourselves on fundamentally
different sides of the debate next week. I for one do not believe that
my faith, or any other, has a monopoly on the definition of marriage,
and whatever it may have been historically, marriage is an institution
that I believe now transcends belief, faith and religious conviction.
As such, I hope marriage will be made open to all who wish to enter it,
whether in the sight of their God, gods, or simply their closest
friends and
family.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012946000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0002.htm#13012946000106">My
Church currently does not permit same-sex marriage and will not be
forced to do so under the proposed legislation. I will argue from
within for it to change its mind, but it is fundamentally a decision
for that Church and its decision-making procedures. Until such a
time—if, indeed, it arrives at all—the proposed Bill
will, I believe, protect those with different views to mine. The hon.
Gentleman and those with similar views should have no fear: nothing in
the proposed Bill constitutes an attack on them, their marriages, or
those who cannot support same-sex marriage and would not enter into one
owing to their own sincerely held
beliefs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T13:48:30"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T13:48:29"></hs_TimeCode>.
It is inaccurate to suggest that any religious denomination that does
not want to celebrate such marriages might be forced to do so if a
permissive, rather than mandatory, mechanism such as this Bill is
introduced. The hon. Gentleman and 
<?notus-xml column=803?>others should rightly test and secure assurances on that if they so
wish, but I believe there is no need for this motion.</hs_Para>

in proposing a Bill at this stage, the hon. Gentleman will be aware
that there is no chance of it progressing through the relevant stages
in this House and the other place before Prorogation, and no chance of
making it on to the statute book. I emphasise again to hon. Members and
colleagues that next week the House will have a chance to make its
views clear on the entire issue, not just on one small part
disassociated from the others. On that basis, although my views differ
from those of the hon. Gentleman, I will not push the House to divide
on this motion, and I hope other hon. Members will take the view that
we should not distract from the full and free debate and that should
vote on these issues next week. The House should now be allowed to move
on to deal with the other important business before it today.</hs_Para>

were inserted into the Bill in the Lords, despite being outside the

am that it is not the Deputy Prime Minister who is moving the motion? I
will have to ask my right hon. Friend the question instead. Is he aware
that in 2010 in this Chamber the Deputy Prime Minister made it very
clear that the boundary review would be established on the simple
principle of fairness, with all votes being of equal worth? Do the Lib

motion to disagree, the Lords amendments will be held to have been
agreed with, and no further votes will take place on this group. There

correct in that respect. The coalition agreement is clearly a relevant
issue, but it is not encapsulated in the ministerial code. The code is
very clear—he will no doubt be familiar with it—and makes
clear the requirements for Ministers to accept the obligations of
ministerial collective responsibility save when it is explicitly set
aside. I am simply making it clear that collective ministerial

ministerial collective responsibility is explicitly set aside, it is
the Prime Minister who makes that decision. He is clearly doing it, as
the House will understand, in the context of coalition government. As
we know, that can give rise to occasions where there is not a

agreed less than two years ago to a boundary review, and it did so for
good reasons. There are major disparities in the size of
constituencies. In England, East Ham has 92,000 voters; Wirral West has
just 55,000. The differences are even greater in respect of other
nations: Arfon in Wales has an electorate of just 41,000. This means
that some votes count much more than others, and the principle of
greater equality in the value of each vote is at the heart of this new
boundary review. Votes should carry much more equal weight across the
country in electing Members to this House and in deciding a future
Government. If the current review were not to happen, in England the
next general election would be based on the register of February 2000,
with all the consequent disparities and in equalities which have been
exacerbated since then. It would be 15 years out of

is simply that Parliament voted on that legislation, which has been
enacted. That was done on the principle of equality and fairness and
the Boundary Commission has proceeded on that basis. Not now proceeding

urge Members to recognise that democrats in all parts of this House
should reject the Lords amendment. Even those who object to the
boundaries reviews, whether for party, personal or other reasons,
should reject the way in which the Lords have amended the Bill. In
doing so, they would still have the option of voting for or against the
review, in the subsequent vote on the amendment in lieu or, if it is

be fair, equitable and democratic. It is wholly wrong that these

settle the boundaries today by voting for the amendment in lieu or to

matters. We know why he was here. It is his job to ensure that the

of unelected peers is increasing by about 50 a year. Since 2010, 117
new peers have been created at a cost of £18 million a year. The

are to reinforce the connections between MPs, candidates and their
constituents, we need to know the facts sooner rather than later. We
need an end to the impasse, and that is what voting for the amendment

significant amounts of money that might otherwise be wasted on a review

current boundaries, and would allow us to engage and register the
missing millions in the meantime. It would prevent the wasting of any

with the question of admissibility. The other place is self-regulating;
it is completely different from this House in that regard. Because it
is self-regulating, all matters of order reside with the House
collectively, not with any individual. The Clerks give advice, and it
is given on the understanding, and in the belief, that it will be
accepted. That is the convention, but it is a convention, not a rule.
The rule is that anything their lordships decide collectively is in
order. As they have so decided, that settles the matter as far as order
is concerned. If anyone wants to revisit the debate, however, may I
suggest they look in particular at the remarks of two Cross Benchers,
both of whom served this House well as Speaker? They made very plain

the debate in their lordships’ House, and the third I shall add.
The first point is in regard to the quality of the register. Since the
Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill was enacted, much
work has been done on that register. At the time, the best evidence was
that it contained the details of about 92% of those who should be on
it. As a result of work carried out by the Electoral Commission, we now
know the figure is much lower, however; it is, in fact, 82%. To my
mind, that is a material difference that should be addressed. We should
be asked to look at that

what has happened in regard to boundaries. We now have the benefit of
the proposals that have been made. At the time of our original

fascinating point arose from a discussion I had with a senior member of

said that in a given area the proposal their experts had come up with
was the one thing that had never been thought of. That is precisely
what has happened in respect of my own seat. The proposed size of it
gives me concern, as it would become the largest. However, in electoral
terms—notionally, on the basis of the historical
numbers—the change would 
<?notus-xml column=826?>increase my majority, although one would never boast about that in any
highland seat. My constituency would go from being made up of two and a
quarter counties to comprising two counties, 90% of another county and
a little chunk of a fourth, none of which are linked together in any
way, shape or form; none of this has any rationale of community. These
areas have different local election arrangements; the seat goes through
wards. The proposed seat goes all over the place, simply to squeeze
enough both in respect of the area and the numbers.</hs_Para>

Thurso:</Member></B> Let me deal with that precise point at the moment
I arrive at it. First, I wish to deal with my third point of substance,
which is the one that was not made in the debate. It is brief but it is
important. A reduction in the size of this House increases the
percentage of the payroll vote and thereby strengthens the grip of the
Executive on Parliament, without there being an acceptable
counterweight.</hs_Para>

leads me to my final point, which relates to the wider coalition
issues. Let me make it absolutely clear that I supported the formation
of this Government and I remain committed to them. As a Liberal
Democrat, I entered this coalition because I believed in 2010 that the
country needed a stable Government to deal with the
financial crisis that was before us. As a member of the Treasury
Committee in the previous Parliament, I had looked at many of the
matters on the sovereign debt markets and was concerned, and I believe
that the right decision was made.</hs_Para>

when two very different parties come together to get agreement on an
essential issue there has to be agreement on other areas. The red line
issues—the ones we will not have at any cost or the ones we must
have at any cost—are relatively straightforward to address,
because we either agree them or we do not, and we are either there or
we are not. All the other matters that are subject to negotiation, both
individually, as policies, and, most importantly, collectively, as a
slate, are much more difficult to deal with. The coalition agreement is
not a pick-and-mix menu; it is an agreement. I agreed to the boundary
changes—in many respects with a heavy heart—but I did so
in the knowledge that the rest of that agreement acted as a
counterweight. To my mind, that would occur mainly through Lords
reform, which I judged would increase the check on the Executive and 
<?notus-xml column=827?>strengthen Parliament. For me, that was a fundamental point and I
believe it is a fundamental point for all my

Central is inner city and multicultural; we have large council estates,

Sheffield, Hallam consists of our city’s leafy suburbs; it is

constituency size based on the number of registered voters, our two
constituencies would appear to be pretty similar in size. However, if
we compare the population according to the 2011 census with the number
of voters registered on 2 January 2013 according to the
council’s electoral registration officer, we can see that the
picture is completely different. Sheffield Central has 76,596
registered voters whereas Sheffield, Hallam has 71,559—the
difference is just 5,037, or 7%. According to the census, Sheffield
Central has a population of 115,284 whereas Sheffield, Hallam has a

Commission’s original concerns about the impact of the Bill came
into being and were compounded by a process of redrawing boundaries
based on the register as at December 2015, the gap would widen even
more. If boundaries were redrawn based on an average electorate of

it clear that like those on my Front Bench I support the principle of
equalisation. In so far as there is public interest in constitutional
reform, that argument has enormous resonance with the public, but the
people to whom I have spoken were shocked to learn that equalisation is
based not on population but on the number of registered electors. The

end of Torbay, which is in my constituency, there are just over 67,000
voters. One vote carries 11% more weight on the Brixham side of Torbay,
and when we take the populations into account, the discrepancy is even
higher. It does not always ring true that using population equalises
matters because, in some cases, it would make things worse. It

the case of individual electoral registration, the three or four

accuse the previous Labour Government of using our political

constitutional issues. One of the first things that Labour did was
introduce proportional representation in the European elections. In
Wales, we went from having four Labour MEPs to one Labour MEP. We had a
majority of 180 back in 1997—such a huge majority that we could
have delivered devolution to Northern Ireland, to Scotland and to Wales

us have a look at the pans of justice. With one or two cases a year of
electoral fraud, all the resources are made available, but with 6.5

questions, which was answered two weeks ago, asked for some numbers on
this subject. If electors do not fill in the extra registration form,
the electoral registration officer has to send a canvasser to their
house at least twice—that is the law. Labour managed to
implement that law, and in 2010 only eight local authorities disobeyed
it; I think that they were all Tory authorities. In 2011, when the
Tories had got their feet under the table, that figure massively
increased, to 30 or 40. Of the 60 constituencies in England that do not
send an electoral registration officer to knock on the doors of the
non-registered, 55 are Conservative, one is
Labour—Telford—and I think that the rest are Lib Dem.

to me and said, “Mr Ruane, you and Experian are absolutely
right, but the 6.5 million people who are off the register are a

conclusion, the reason given by the Conservative party for wanting to
introduce the boundary review changes is to decrease the number of MPs
from 650 to 600. It says that it is a case of cost and that that is its
primary reason, and yet when I tried to table a parliamentary question
in the Table Office to find out the cost of an MP and the cost of a
Lord, I was told that I was not allowed to do so.
Fortunately a Lord in the other place tabled the question and received
the response that it costs £130,000 per Lord and
£590,000 per MP. The Government have created an extra
125 Lords since they came to power in 2010 and they propose to create
another 50 over the next few weeks. Where is the logic in creating an

constituencies are almost double the size of others, meaning that their
inhabitants are under-represented in elections and, subsequently, at
Westminster. The overall balance is weighted heavily towards the Labour

With hindsight, perhaps it should have been asked to respect county

constituencies into consideration as far as possible, the Boundary
Commission for England recommended that the North Herefordshire
constituency be dismantled and merged with Worcestershire and
Shropshire to form a constituency with a minority part of each county.

on was whether it would allow a vote on AV in return for Liberal
Democrat support on boundary reviews. That was the deal. The
Conservative party kept to that deal but the Liberal Democrats have

Gummer</B> (Ipswich) (Con):</Member> I rise briefly to express my
regret on three points. First, I regret that the other place has seen
fit to ride through the conventions that have held it secure in its
position for many centuries. It has done so on the basis of Members who
have gone to that House, precisely—Opposition Members have
referred to this—through a packing of the House of Lords under
the previous Government. Those Members have then ridden through their
conventions in order to place us in this position, with a
constitutional change foisted on this democratically elected
House.</hs_Para>

that we will not have boundary review until 2018 if we disagree to the
motion. That will mean that many Members will not be equal. Mr Speaker,
you said in response to an earlier point of order that all hon. Members
are equal, but they will not be equal in the representation they bring
to the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13012946001346" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012946001346">4

third regret is that Labour Members believe that some Members are more

Liberal Democrats, whose arguments were put by one of their most noble
Members, have exposed themselves—this is often the case with
Liberal Democrats, as hon. Members who have fought them on the doorstep
will know—as people who have one idea at one time and change

nothing can excuse the Labour party trying, by every kind of sophistry,
to present arguments as to why one person’s vote should count
for more than another person’s in different constituencies,
including ones that neighbour each other. As a result, their position
debases our democracy. Labour Members should answer to the electorate

Members agree that this is a serious issue, and that we should look to
try to have more equal constituencies, but the logic that has been
followed does not do that. We need common-sense proposals for the next
Parliament that hon. Members can unite around. We need constituencies
that do not cross county boundaries and major council boundaries, and
ones that are geographically commonsensical. The measure needs to be
tied in with individual registration, as the Bill should have
been.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012946000550" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012946000550">If

amendments 7, 10 and 11 will enable voters waiting in a queue at close
of poll to be issued with ballot papers and to vote, even if the time
of close of poll has passed. Following debates on the subject, the
Government have decided to accept the principle of the amendments
introduced in both Houses, to ensure that people are able to exercise
their right to vote if they are already in the queue at 10 pm on
polling day. The measure has attracted cross-party support in both
Houses, and the Government agree with the sentiment behind a change in
the law to enable voters to vote.</hs_Para>

Government did not accept amendments previously tabled on this subject,
and have instead introduced their own group of amendments to address

the amendment tabled by Lord Pannick did not apply to Northern Ireland

the United Kingdom.</hs_Para>

tabling their own amendments, the Government remain concerned that all
potential consequences for other aspects of electoral law of any new
provisions relating to close of poll should be dealt with at the point
at which the new provisions take effect, to reduce the risk of
unintended consequences. I will not dwell at length on those
amendments; suffice it to say that the term “close of
poll” is used in a number of electoral provisions, including
those that determine when exit polls may be published and the point by
which postal votes must be returned. Some of those provisions attract
criminal penalties and it would not be right if the impact of a change
were not considered and addressed, to avoid a position in which people
might fall foul of the law
inadvertently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:22:57"></hs_TimeCode>.
The amendments therefore provide for a proportionately limited power
that will allow the Government to make any such consequential changes
that might be required on
commencement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012946001200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012946001200">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:23:08"></hs_TimeCode>
me make it clear that, although the Government are introducing these
amendments, we remain of the view that proper planning by returning
officers must be the first priority to reduce the risk of queues
forming. However, this change to the law will provide an effective
back-stop to supplement that planning. The Government have also
consistently argued that administrative points remain to be addressed,
and we will work closely with the Electoral Commission and electoral
administrators on the best way to implement the amendments for voters.
However, putting aside those points of detail, I hope that we can agree
to support this change to the law for the benefit of
voters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:23:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012946001201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012946001201">The
other amendments in the group relate to the transition to, and
operation of, individual electoral registration. That is the core of
the Bill, through which we aim to tackle electoral fraud and the
perception of fraud. Under IER, electors will be required to register
individually, rather than by household. In that way, we will be moving
to a system in which individuals will have to provide information to
verify their application, and so take responsibility for their
registration to vote. That will modernise our electoral registration
system, facilitating the move to online registration and making it more
convenient for people to register to vote. Our aim is to tackle
electoral fraud, increase the number of people registered to vote, and
improve the integrity of the register.</hs_Para>

to rebut a few points made in the previous debate, as they properly
relate to the subject matter in this group of amendments. I was
concerned to hear the Labour Front-Bench team whipping up scare
stories. It felt to me that they had little else to say, and their
opportunism led them to introduce some confusion into our debate. It is
important to note that the figures occasionally quoted, as I understand
it, by the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:25:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane) who is not in his place, related
to an opt-out that was included in the draft legislation published in
June 2011, and not to the transition to individual electoral
registration in general. The hon. Gentleman quoted the concern of the
Electoral Commission about completeness, potentially leaving, in his
citation, 16 million people unregistered. Those comments were, I
suggest, a misquotation of the Electoral Commission’s
chairwoman, Jenny Watson. She clarified her opinion in a follow-up
statement. I hope that is of help to the House.</hs_Para>

believe that when others are helping people to register in households,

Smith:</Member></B> My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. The
innovation of data-matching will allow us to cross-reference, we hope,
about 70% of electors against other sources of data held by the
Government. That will, in large part, assist the endeavour outlined by
my right hon. Friend. It will help to ensure that the register is both
as complete and as accurate as possible, and that those who should not
on the register are not
included.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13012946001348" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012946001348">4.30

recognise that the transition to individual electoral registration
poses a risk to completeness rates. We are introducing safeguards which
will avoid a drop in the number of registrations, but will also help us
to ensure that the right people are on the register. Data-matching,
which I have already mentioned, confirms the accuracy of the majority
of entries. Most electors will not have to do anything in order to
remain on the register if it is correct for them to be included on
it.</hs_Para>

have already spoken about Lords amendment 7, and about the need to
modernise our electoral registration system. As I have said, our aim is
to tackle electoral fraud, increase the number of people registered to
vote, and improve the integrity of the register. The Bill also includes
provisions to improve the administration and conduct of elections,
which will serve to increase voter participation, and to make a number
of improvements in the running of elections.</hs_Para>

amendments 1, 2, 3 and 4 would require the forms of acceptable evidence
used to verify entitlement to register to be prescribed in secondary
legislation. The Government have always intended the evidence required
in an initial application to be prescribed in regulations, although the
Bill as introduced permitted Ministers to prescribe the types of
evidence. The amendments were tabled in response to scrutiny by the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform and Constitution Committees in
the other place, requiring such evidence to be placed in regulations
subject to the affirmative procedure.</hs_Para>

amendments 6, 8, 9, 20, 21 and 22 would provide for an extended
carry-forward of non-individually registered electors from 2015 to 2016
unless that was deemed unnecessary. The effect would be to postpone the
final date for the transition to a register entirely made up of
individually registered electors until December 2016. The Secretary of
State would, however, have the power to take the final step in
2015—in keeping with the existing plans for implementation of
IER—if he was satisfied that the transition to IER could be
concluded at that point, by means of an order that would be subject to
the negative procedure. I hope that Members will welcome the
reassurance that that change would bring: the reassurance that
following the implementation of IER, the electoral register will be as
complete and accurate as
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012946001216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012946001216">Let
me stress that the amendments do not alter our aim to deliver an
IER-only register in December 2015. They simply add a safeguard so that
Parliament has a say in the removal of electors from the register in
that year. I note that the Electoral Commission agrees with us that it
is necessary to encourage electoral administrators to work to that
deadline.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012946001217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012946001217">The
remaining Lords amendments are minor and technical amendments that
would improve the smooth running of individual electoral registration.
Lords amendments 12, 16 and 19 would ensure that the provisions on
anonymous entries on the electoral register continued to work following
the transition to IER. Lords amendments 13 and 14 would help
to ensure that as many eligible applicants as possible are included in
the revised register published on 1 December by removing a time limit
that would prevent some applications from being added until the January
update. Removing that restriction would not affect people’s
entitlement to object to an application for registration, or the
registration officer’s duty to determine
objections.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012946001218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012946001218">Amendments
15 and 18 are intended to improve the functioning of section 49 of the
Representation of the People Act 1983, ensuring that challenges to the
eligibility of an entry on the electoral register do not result in an
elector being unable to cast their vote. Under section 49, it is not
necessary to set out the dates to which an allegation relates for there
to be a successful objection to an elector’s registration.
Amendment 17 would ensure that there is no ambiguity about the
continued application under IER of the existing criminal offence
relating to non-disclosure of information in response to the annual
canvass or about providing false information in
response.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012946001219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012946001219"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T16:35:09"></hs_TimeCode>The

we welcome the fact that the approach taken by the other place is more

am also pleased that the Scottish Government have taken action and that
the views of the Electoral Commission have been taken on board. I
remind the House that, in the aftermath of the May 2010 general
election, the Electoral Commission produced a report that identified
four key factors in what had gone wrong. There was evidence of poor
planning assumptions in some areas, and of poor conduct of the election
on polling day. The use of unsuitable buildings and inadequate staffing
arrangements at some polling stations were also an issue. It was said,
too, that the contingency arrangements were not properly triggered or
were unable to cope with demand at the close of poll—that was
very evident. Finally, the Electoral Commission found that there was
restrictive legislation which meant those in queues at polling stations
at the close of poll were not able to be issued with a ballot paper.
The Government were initially trenchantly opposed to that objective
view. They now agree that it is necessary to accept it and to introduce
corrective legislation. I welcome that; this House supports the
Government’s conversion.</hs_Para>

second substantive issue is to do with the so-called
carry-forward—or carry-over—and the commencement of full
individual electoral registration in December 2015 or December 2016. We
support the Government’s amendments in that regard and recognise
that there has been a move, albeit a more modest one than on the other
big issue, to try to accommodate the legitimate concerns expressed in
the other place. However, the Electoral Commission has reservations
about these amendments and, indeed, they are a rather convoluted

that, on occasion, it sounded as though she was speaking double Dutch.
The Bill is to contain a delay in the implementation of full IER from
December 2015 to December 2016. We might think that that is fair
enough, as it will allow greater parliamentary scrutiny, greater
parliamentary involvement and a greater opportunity to get more people
on to the electoral register under IER than would have been the case
otherwise. But, unfortunately, the Government will not go the whole
hog, and they are introducing a byzantine system whereby having a cake
and eating it is the order of the day. They are saying, “Yes,
that change will be in the Bill, but we reserve the right to contradict
what is in the Bill by saying that our implementation plan stays in
place. We will still want to do what we always

make matters worse, the Government have introduced a complicated
procedure—the negative assent procedure—involving both
Houses, and that will make the situation even more complicated. Let me
try to be helpful to the Minister, as always, by suggesting what the
Government might do to resolve their internal contradiction. She began
by sensibly saying that the implementation date will move from December
2015 to December 2016, but there remains a right for the Secretary of
State or Lord President of the Council to make an order to remove those
carried-forward entries in December 2015. Given the mood of the House
and what has been said generally this afternoon, I suggest that the
Government give a firm commitment not to implement that, so that
everybody will be clear that the implementation date will be 2016. We
will support these amendments, but it would be enormously helpful if
the Minister responded positively, recognising the mood of both Houses,
by saying, without any equivocation, that there will be a delay in the
implementation of IER until December

Friend will agree, this is also a very good example of why we need a
revising Second Chamber rather than another House at the other end of
this Palace of Westminster that challenges everything we do and makes
things difficult for the process of government. We need a House that
looks again at what has been said and done in this Chamber and makes
sensible suggestions. In this case, the suggestion made by their
lordships is almost exactly the same as the suggestion I made on 27
June; I am delighted that their lordships agree and I am extremely

the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs Laing) on her foresight and vision.
It is great that the Government are taking on her suggestion, because
there is no doubt that if a queue of people is waiting at the polling
station to vote, it is not beyond the wit of man or woman to put a
polling clerk or somebody else in the line to act as a marker between
those who arrived before 10 o’clock and those who arrived
afterwards. I cannot see any great argument for saying that that would
delay the whole process, because at the count many boxes come in from
all over the constituency and some will arrive first, meaning that
their contents can start to be counted, whereas others will arrive
later. We got ourselves into a bureaucratic nightmare that could be
fixed quite simply. I am delighted that the Government have accepted
the Lords amendment, and I congratulate my hon. Friend again on her

Gentleman, we want the transition to IER to be as clear and easy as
possible for electors and administrators. The Electoral Commission is a
key part of that work through its delivery of both the nuts and
bolts—that is, the forms and operational guidance—and the
publicity campaign that will accompany the transition.</hs_Para>

is important that we are all clear on the implementation plan. As my
noble Friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire stated in the other place when
outlining these amendments, we expect the transition to IER to take
place on the time scale set out in the implementation plan published
last July. I reassure the House, the Electoral Commission,
administrators and electors that we are committed to implementing the
transition to IER during 2014 and 2015, resulting in a register
published in December 2015 that includes only individually registered

the Government were quite keen to have a grubby little compromise and
the Bill deserves better. It is far too important in principle to have
a convoluted, contradictory implementation date. What we need, again,

straightforwardness, as I have done several times now and will happily

Government amendment was tabled in response to concerns expressed in
the other place. It strikes a sensible balance, and I note again all
the benefits of a two-year transition that we have planned for, such as
two canvasses and, of course, a general election where interest in
politics will be high, starting in November 2013—that is, the
transition, not the general election—backed up by our national
campaign with the Electoral Commission to maximise registration.

ability for the then Government to take a reasoned and data-driven view

Government have a principled position, as I believe that we do, in
wanting to ensure that as many people as possible who are entitled to
be on the electoral register are indeed on it. As was mentioned earlier
this afternoon, there is a great deal of concern that the Government
might not be doing as much as they could to get groups that are
traditionally under-represented on the electoral register engaged in
the new process. In the Minister’s concluding remarks, will she

not—I would like it noted—in response to the frankly
lurid accusations that have been made this afternoon by Members who are
no longer present in the Chamber. The Government’s aim is to
tackle electoral fraud and to improve the integrity of the register. We
are indeed undertaking a programme of activity to get the maximum
number of eligible people on to the electoral register. That is vital.
The Bill enables the introduction of a modernised electoral
registration system that makes it easier for people to vote. It will

he has rightly pointed out, I am aware of what the BVRLA has 
<?notus-xml column=858?>put together. It has been lobbying for a change to the calculation
because at the moment it estimates that a UK operator could incur a
small loss when it delicenses a vehicle—typically when it is
sold—compared with the existing rebating regime for vehicle
excise duty, which rebates in twelfths.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:05:44"></hs_TimeCode> BVRLA has
identified that a small extra cost to operators could be introduced by
the way in which the levy is rebated compared with how VED is

when a vehicle is delicensed—typically when it is
sold—the previous owner can claim back the outstanding whole
months of VED, with the rebate calculation done in twelfths. From the
introduction of the levy in 2014, UK operators will only be able to
reclaim VED on the same basis that the levy can be reclaimed, namely in
tenths. Setting the annual rate at 10 times the monthly rate complies
with EU law and will maximise the revenue from the monthly charges.

for Poplar and Limehouse has said, up to £2.7 million a year.
That estimate is on the high side, to say the least, because the BVRLA
assumes that half the refunds would be for vehicles in the most
expensive levy band, whereas, in fact, only 4% of the UK fleet is in
that band. Most UK vehicles—83%—are in bands costing
between 36% and 65% less. I would therefore question whether the cost

BVRLA also assumes that all refunds are claimed in the 10th month of
the VED cycle for each vehicle, which is a worst-case scenario. In
fact, there is a peak in vehicle disposals at around month three or
four of the cycle, reflecting the fact that vehicles are often
purchased in September and sold in January, to deal with Christmas
business. The loss for any vehicle at this point is some 60% or 70%

that most vehicles will lose in the region of between £30 and
£50 when delicensed. That is not a regular event, but it would
happen, for example, when a 
<?notus-xml column=859?>vehicle is sold. The loss therefore needs to be set in the context of
the vehicle’s whole lifetime, which can be about 10 years. For
example, a typical vehicle that lasts 10 years and is sold twice during
that period at a typical stage in the VED-levy cycle would incur
between £60 and £100 in rebate costs over its
life, because the loss is incurred only when the vehicle is sold or
delicensed for other reasons. That cost equates to about £6 a
year. Operators can avoid that cost by selling the vehicle taxed or by
disposing of it only at the end of the VED-levy cycle so that there is
no amount to

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:11:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Poplar and Limehouse that under the amendment, all rebating would
be done under clause 7(4), which is designed for shorter periods of
time than one year. Rebating the annual levy under that subsection
would not resolve  the tenths versus twelfths issue, but it
would allow some foreign operators to drive on the UK’s roads
for free for up to two months when they purchase an annual levy. That
is because, as we discussed in Committee, they would be able to claim a
rebate for whole outstanding months at the monthly levy rate, rather
than at the discounted

well as the potential for free use of the roads, a further consequence
of using clause 7(4) as the rebating mechanism would be to allow anyone
to make a claim for more than they had paid, without ever driving on
the UK’s roads. For example, if an operator purchased a levy
starting at a future point in time, say 1 February, and immediately
asked for a rebate, they would be able to claim 12 times the monthly
rate because the levy period would not have started. That would

the fundamental point that vehicles that use and cause wear to our

to the Bill being passed in the House today, although the financial

payment, even though such charges are common in other countries and our
hauliers pay them when they use roads overseas. Foreign-registered

colleagues in the House may be aware, any form of road user charge is

inflation. By that stage it will equate to about £10 per day,

use roads in the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:18:14"></hs_TimeCode>. I recognise
that many trips by foreign hauliers last longer than one day, so they
will also be able to pay the levy for different periods—daily,
weekly, monthly or annually, for up to one year. For the largest
vehicles, the annual charge will be £1,000, and proportionately

Government have estimated that the revenue gained by charging foreign
hauliers will probably be between £18.7 million and £23.2
million annually. I appreciate—this was discussed in Committee
at some length—that that may not be an enormous sum in the grand
scheme of things, and I am sure some of my colleagues would like it to
be higher, but the levy is set at the highest level allowed by the
Eurovignette directive. Other measures—principally the reduction
in VED—mean that nine out of 10 UK vehicles will pay no more
than they do now. That will ensure a fairer deal for UK-registered HGV
operators, who should not, and will not, have to bear an additional
financial burden as a result of the levy. As we have announced

dealt with the Bill’s timetable, enforcement and reduced
pollution certificates. On all those issues, I am happy to say that the

should make one or two brief comments on the issues we have raised. The
Minister made a stout philosophical defence against hypothecation, and
the Opposition could not argue against it because we too would have

enforcement and the question of using some of the money as
supplementary funds for the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency, the
Minister reassured us on his confidence in the system. We have moved on
a lot—we have the success of the congestion charge in London and

one question on which those on both sides of the House have raised
concerns was road safety and the disproportionate number of crashes
caused by foreign vehicles. Perhaps the Bill will deter some foreign
hauliers from coming to the UK, which might in turn reduce the number
of crashes caused by foreign hauliers. In that respect, the Bill will
have an impact on road
safety.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012952000027">The
Opposition also raised the question of giving a tokenistic measure of
support for road safety. We suggested using some of the money
raised—either from fines or the levy—for road safety
purposes. It was suggested that <I>The Times </I>cycling campaign,
which has been championed by my hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of
State and other hon. Members, was an appropriate campaign to benefit
from the levy. That was clearly not going to happen, but we considered
it and demonstrated cross-party support for the campaign and for road
safety in general, and so indicated that we need to maintain our rigour
in respect of trying to reduce the numbers of people killed and
seriously injured on our roads. This measure ought to help in that
regard.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012952000028">The

the Bill. I understand that the Minister is bound by the vignette-type
legislation from Europe, which means that we can charge a maximum of
€11 a day, and in the future we must look to increase that
significantly. Someone running a heavy goods vehicle from France is
helped significantly by the fact that the diesel is 10p to 20p a litre
cheaper. A lorry coming over here can have a couple of tanks of diesel
on it and deliver goods all over the country using it—so there
is still a very big advantage to be had. Moreover, a British lorry
using motorways all the way to the south of France will have to pay
nearly €1,000 for a return trip at the péages. It is bad
enough with a domestic car, let alone the charges for an HGV.</hs_Para>

good start to making the playing field more level, and I recognise that
the shadow Minister was graceful in accepting that it should have been
done on Labour’s watch. I am glad that he supports the Bill. I
welcome the Bill, but our hauliers have suffered greatly over the years
from unfair competition, with lower-priced fuel coming across in the
lorries, which then do a lot of business in this country because they
can outbid our hauliers. I look forward to seeing this levy rise
substantially.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012952000032">I
have one final point. Many foreign lorries that come over here seem to
have a sat-nav system for domestic cars, and they end up going down
some of our rural roads, taking out bridges and walls—even
cottages. It is very hard to reverse those huge HGVs when they have
gone down a tiny country lane or through a very small village. That
also needs to be looked at

Transport Committee first looked at this issue midway through the last
Parliament, which is quite a few years ago. We continued in the present
Session, and we looked at the issue in two ways. First, we looked at it
in relation to the haulage industry, including fair treatment of and
fair competition for the British haulage industry. Secondly, we looked
at it in relation to road safety. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick) has said, we noted the high
proportion of accidents caused by lorries from the continent. We
attributed that to lower safety standards, and noted issues that we

Transport Committee in the last Parliament certainly shared the
frustration that no action was taken. It did appear at one stage that a
Bill would be brought forward on the subject, but it did not happen. I
am pleased that the matter has been taken up in this Parliament. It is
important that the Bill should have been looked at in such detail in
Committee, and it is stronger as a result. I give it my full support,

might have taken at least two Parliaments and many years, but we have

Alan Reid</B> (Argyll and Bute) (LD):</Member> I, too, join the welcome
for the Bill from both sides of the House. Until now,
foreign-registered lorries using our roads have not paid anything
towards their construction or maintenance, whereas UK hauliers pay
tolls and other charging schemes when they travel around the rest of
Europe. Clearly, foreign vehicles cause a lot of wear and tear to our
roads on the approximately 1.5 million trips they make to the UK each
year, and it is not right that the UK taxpayer has to foot the Bill for

levy on all heavy goods vehicles. For the first time,
foreign-registered hauliers will make a contribution towards the wear
and tear they cause to our roads.</hs_Para>

€11, the effects of the Bill will be limited, but it is still a
welcome step in the right direction and I hope that the €11
limit will be increased significantly in the future. I also welcome the
Government’s intention to make consequential reductions in
vehicle excise duty to ensure a fair deal for UK HGV drivers. It has
been estimated that 94% of UK hauliers will pay no more than they do

Connarty</B> (Linlithgow and East Falkirk) (Lab):</Member> I want to
raise a couple of issues just to put them on the record. We have had a
debate, and eventually an agreement, not to press any of the worthy
amendments to a vote. As my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and
Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick) said,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:31:42"></hs_TimeCode> Bill has
been a long time in gestation, going back to our time in office. People
wanted to see something done, a point made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:31:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish), and felt strongly that there
was an imbalance and a disadvantage to the UK haulage business for many
reasons, including diesel prices and the lack of any contribution to
our road network.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012952000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012952000040">Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:32:09"></hs_TimeCode>
of the points that have been raised are sound. Kent county council made
an excellent contribution to the argument for hypothecation on the
basis that a large percentage of the vehicles coming into the UK use
its road system that it then has to maintain. Given that the Government
are now in the ludicrous position of rate-capping every
council—they call it council tax freezing; it is rate
capping—the money available to Kent through the normal levy
powers is diminishing, so it was looking to see whether this measure
would bring some money  
<?notus-xml column=865?>into its coffers to help it to maintain its roads. However, we are told
that it will all go into the Consolidated Fund—into the back
pocket of the Treasury.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012952000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012952000041">A colleague
from the north-east of England made a good case for the need to upgrade
the poor quality roads in the north-east of England. The point was made
very well that to drive from Scotland to Tyneside, a major European hub
for roll-on/roll-off transport and tourism, one drives down what is
virtually a country road for about 20 or 30 miles. I have done that
journey and can verify that feeling of having lost one’s way
because there is no decent road network leading to that major port. I
can see why hypothecation would make a lot of sense. I made a bid for
hypothecation for a major bridge project in Avon gorge in my
constituency, a choke point where accidents happen all the time. It was
decided, however, that there would be no hypothecation.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012952000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012952000042">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:33:57"></hs_TimeCode>
still question the decision that the money raised should all go to the
Consolidated Fund. There are two points about that. One of those points
is to level the playing field up in terms of making charges on those
from abroad who use the roads, and who at the moment do not do pay.
However, everyone who gave evidence from the Freight Transport
Association made a bid for some, if not all, of that money to be put
into the road network.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:38:10"></hs_TimeCode> idea that
some of that money will go into the Vehicle and Operator Services
Agency and some into registration recognition cameras is a small point
in policing, but that does not raise the quality of the road network,
which is what the transport companies were speaking about.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012952000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012952000043">The question
we need to ask over the years is whether the money going into the
Consolidated Fund comes out at the other end so as to benefit the road
user in any way, particularly heavy goods vehicles, which deliver goods
to the shops, homes and companies in this country. That is one question
that I leave to be considered over time. It should be looked at in the
review that the Minister kindly offered during the debate on the
amendments. I like the idea of reviews, because although I am sure the
Bill is grand and well thought through, there is always the law of
unintended consequences to be taken into account.</hs_Para>

second thing I want to address is the question dealt with by our
amendments today. In reading the Bill, one thing was clear to me. I do
not know the kind of transport detail that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:35:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Tiverton and Honiton and others seem to know—including,
possibly, the Chair of the Transport Committee—but I have a
large number of heavy goods vehicle depots in my constituency, in and
around Grangemouth, which is the only recognised totally inter-modal
hub in Scotland. It has road, rail and a major shipping port—the
biggest container base in Scotland. People tell me that cashing in
their HGV licence at particular times can be sensible business; the
problem now is that they have to work out how to cash it in at the same
time as not losing money on the levy. I know that the Minister said
that the figure of £2.7 million that the leasing companies gave
us was high—possibly every vehicle had to be in the worst
category, and so on. The point I was asking about was the principle and
what, on first look, I thought was a dislocation between the fact that
someone who does not come into the UK and does not pay their
levy—because 
<?notus-xml column=866?>they are not coming in—faces a zero sum and the fact that someone
with a British-registered vehicle who pays the levy but cashes it in at
the wrong time will be out of pocket.</hs_Para>

Minister says the figure turns out to be only £6 a year. That
may be the case, and that may all right for the industry. However, the
industry would not have rung the alarm bells—it perhaps rang a
bigger bell that it should have—if it had not felt that there
was some justification being made for the concept of placing an
imposition on UK hauliers. That was not the point of the Bill; the
point was to place an imposition entirely on non-British-registered
vehicles coming into the country. If, as a consequence, we put an
imposition on what is an already very burdensome industry to work in,
with the cost of diesel and all the regulations that have to be
faced—I get it all the time, and I sympathise with
Malcolm’s, Russell’s and all the others based in my
constituency who tell me they carry small amounts, but over a large
number of vehicles and a large number of trips, which makes them
uncompetitive compared with others coming into the country—we
will have failed in what we set out to do. We set out to level the
playing field up, not push UK road hauliers up a bit further so that
they do not bridge the gap to the point intended by the levy.</hs_Para>

need to ensure that the review is a serious promise from the

people in the road haulage industry and see whether we have got it
right. I commend him and his team for bringing the Bill forward. I know

welcome the proposals, as I have said. We have lots of haulage in the

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:40:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish), who is no longer in
his place, made the point about foreign wagons not following their
sat-navs. On Saturday night, I was trying to get through part of my
constituency and, lo and behold, a huge wagon was blocking the road for
the umpteenth time. It had got stuck under a low bridge, and the driver
had probably not seen the road signs. That seems remarkable to me, as
Derbyshire county council does everything it can to divert those
wagons, but it still does not seem to work.

operators in the High Peak, many of which have dozens of wagons, and

like to charge more, provided that the discount on vehicle excise duty
was available for our own wagon drivers, and I hope that one day we
will be able to do so. We shall have to see how the EU goes on that
one. There is unfair competition at the moment, and the foreign wagons
have the advantage, which is wrong. When our wagons go across to
Europe, the drivers have to pay road tolls. That applies, for example,
to those who drive the length of France, unless they avoid the main
autoroutes. These measures are trying to straighten some of that
out.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:41:38"></hs_TimeCode> As I have

there had been a clear undertaking that there would be no extra costs

topic. Sadly, it was too far down the Order Paper to get heard that
day, but we are now three years on and we have finally tackled this
problem. It is a big issue when haulage businesses small and large feel
that there is unfair competition whereby overseas hauliers can use our
roads without paying anything. As we heard earlier, they sometimes do
not even buy fuel over here, while our hauliers pay a large amount of
money. I think this Bill takes us towards the fairness whereby those
who use our services and our roads should pay for them. The Government
could do further work in different areas to get to the same place, but
that is not for today’s
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:46:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012952000060">My
view is that vehicle excise duty has had its day, and that its
long-established purpose is now usurped by different ways of
enforcement. We could move to a 
<?notus-xml column=869?>stage where we do not need the duty and have a separate charge for all
hauliers to use our roads. That would probably be a lot easier to
administer than the scheme we are going to end up with, but I guess
that the Minister will say that it is a Treasury decision so we cannot
get into it today, but I think that is the direction in which we should
travel.</hs_Para>

have never been a fan of hypothecation, but I see logic in using this
revenue to address some of the issues affecting our main trunk roads.
If someone happens to live near them and is blighted by the noise and
the pollution, that presents a real problem, and there has been a lack
of money to deal with it. I have two sites on the A38 in Amber Valley,
which are down as priority sites for noise remediation work.
Unfortunately, that means that it will not actually happen until
something like 2020, so this money could be used to accelerate that
sort of work. The Minister is more than welcome to come and hear how
much noise is created. I think it would be a positive step to say,
“It is lorries that cause that noise; here is some extra revenue
taken from lorries; let us tackle that issue.” That could take
away the blight from which nearby residents suffer.</hs_Para>

As I have explained earlier on Third Reading, on the Ways and Means
motion and on Second Reading, we are limited to what level of fee we
can charge. I am sure that we will, as with other aspects of the Bill,

the views of the BVRLA. I understand the concern that the organisation

“urban artics” mentioned by the hon. Member for

is the case for all Members, hundreds of my constituents suffer from
epilepsy, and I am grateful to many of them for their input into this

better than those who suffer from the illness.</hs_Para>

the record, I should point out that epilepsy is defined as a tendency
to have recurrent seizures, sometimes called fits. The seizure is
caused by a sudden burst of excess electrical activity in the brain,
causing a temporary disruption of the normal messages passing between
brain cells<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:58:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
Epilepsy is, of course, not one condition but a composite of about 40
different types of seizure and up to 50 different
syndromes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T17:58:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0003.htm#13012952000092">An
epilepsy diagnosis can be a shattering blow to the individual
concerned. All sorts of things that have been taken for granted are no
longer automatic: they might lose their driving licence, for instance,
or their employment, which might in turn lead to benefit dependency.
Approximately 600,000 people have epilepsy, which is about one in 100
people, and every day about 87 people are diagnosed with it, which
amounts to 32,000 each

an epileptic, I find that one of the issues we face is that although
the condition affects half a million people there is a stigma around
it, and that has stopped clinicians and society in general addressing
the underlying issues we face. It is incredibly important that we have
this sort of debate and ensure that we are more public about what

referred to the Epilepsy Action report, and it is important that people
look at it because it showed some worrying results. I am sure that the
Minister will have read it. Two thirds of the clinical commissioning
groups—66%—do not have or do not intend to produce a
written needs assessment of the health and social care needs 
of people with epilepsy. Only 27% of the 113 out of 149
local authorities that replied included a section in their joint
strategic needs assessment mentioning the care of people with epilepsy.
Only 17% of the clinical commissioning groups have appointed a clinical
lead for epilepsy and only 20% of acute trusts stated that the average
waiting time for an adult with suspected epilepsy to see an epilepsy
specialist consultant was two weeks or less.</hs_Para>

only half of the people interviewed by Epilepsy Action told the

them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:06:52"></hs_TimeCode>. In its
guidance, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence

provision.</hs_Para>

through them all. All in all, however, there seems to have been no
major improvement in services although I stress that, as with so many
other matters, the provision is patchy, with some excellent services in
some parts of the country. My local trust, Guy’s and St
Thomas’, does an excellent job with the resources it has. Dr
Michael Koutroumanidis leads the team and as well as running the

have some questions for the Minister. If he has read the report,
perhaps as his bedtime reading last night, he will be aware of some of
them. Will he ask the Secretary of State for Health to refer the whole
of epilepsy services to the National Audit Office and invite it to
conduct a value-for-money inquiry? That is one of the key requests from
Epilepsy Action. Way back in 2007, the all-party group estimated that
the avoidable cost of 
<?notus-xml column=876?>providing the current poor NHS service was £189 million a year
based on the NICE figures. The main reason that such money could be
seen as wasted is the shocking misdiagnosis rate, which is 20% to 30%,
and the poor access to specialist skills. The financial consequence is
that patients receive inappropriate, costly and ineffective treatment
at the expense of the NHS and the public, never mind the personal
consequences of their true condition not being treated.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:09:14"></hs_TimeCode>I hope that the
Minister can say that that might be a useful piece of work for the
Audit Commission.</hs_Para>

issue that I want to ask the Minister about is the revised NHS
constitution, where the word “pledge” will be used. We

offered a written record of that agreement. Again, published research
shows that only 14% of people will epilepsy have a care plan. All those
things are important. If the current review of the NHS constitution
recommends making care planning a pledge from the NHS to patients, that
should be toughened up to encourage a programme of care planning and by

securing this debate, and I congratulate Epilepsy Action on producing
the report. This is a wonderful opportunity to remind the Minister of
my ten-minute rule Bill, in which I ask for two simple things. First,
immediate referrals from GPs to specialists are needed. That is where
the costs arise—both monetary costs and the cost in lives. If
people can be referred directly to a specialist, they need not go
through an interim stage to someone who is not a specialist. This
covers a wide range of conditions, although it manifests itself as
epilepsy—other related conditions might not manifest themselves
at all—so anyone might have absences, and they need to know why.
Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:13:26"></hs_TimeCode>, we

was surprised to learn from a recent parliamentary written answer that
the Access to Work scheme in England and Wales between May 2010 and 30
June 2012 helped just 1,360 individuals with epilepsy. In my
constituency no one with epilepsy was helped by the Access to Work
scheme. There seems to be a lack of awareness of the scheme and
inadequate information being given to people. I hope the Minister will
continue to address the problem. Many constituents claiming sickness
benefits want to work, but have ended up on benefits because they did
not have the proper support when they were in employment. The Access to
Work scheme could have prevented them from leaving employment. It is in

NICE guidelines on epilepsy make it clear that epilepsy may sometimes
result in significant disability, social exclusion and stigma, which
many Members have mentioned, and that people with epilepsy would
commonly encounter problems in employment. According to the work
capability assessment handbook, the Atos working group panel on
epilepsy was clear that if a person has epilepsy which occurs less than
once a month, that is unlikely to impact significantly on their ability
to work. I urge that consideration is given to the effects of the
disorder on each individual, rather than making such a blanket

are obviously cases where an individual who may drive as part of his

from driving for 10 years without medication. That sometimes means that
he would lose his job and end up on benefit. The whole employment and
support allowance system is insufficiently sympathetic in such

Hoey:</Member></B> The hon. Lady is absolutely right. The earlier the
true diagnosis is made and the person is referred to a specialist, the
sooner they are seen as having an illness that can be treated and have
the chance of a positive future. I am sure that everybody in the
Department of Health feels like this. However, something more needs to
be done at the local level among clinical groups and PCTs, and even
GPs, to create this sense of understanding. The hon. Lady heard the
very moving testimony from Jemma, who spoke at the launch about the
difference between having a good doctor who understands and gets
someone the right referral immediately and another doctor who perhaps
does not understand and does not take the time to do so.</hs_Para>

is keen for the Government to change the law so that it complies with

in London who cannot drive because of their epilepsy may be eligible

backed by other disability organisations, is campaigning for the
Government to make changes to the pass in London and to the disabled

Transport under the English national concessionary travel scheme. In
particular, the organisations call for the pass to include travel
during peak hours, which is very important if someone is trying to keep
a job. In some cases, a free companion pass may be necessary, as is
already possible in Scotland and in Wales. If

this comes back to a lack of awareness about information on many of
these schemes. There is a lot of help and support around, but people
need to be very savvy or to have a very savvy parent, or to have a link
into one of the organisations that provide support, to find out all the
information. Government cannot do everything, but there may be ways in
which they can ensure that local authorities and others with
responsibility do a little bit more.

people with epilepsy who get continuous anti-convulsive therapy may be
eligible for the NHS medical exemption certificate. They have to fill
in a form at their GP surgery to get this, and it allows them to get
free prescriptions for five years. One would think that anybody in this
position would automatically know about that, but it is amazing how
many people do not. Perhaps GPs do not always think that they have to
tell people about these things. Where it is useful to do so, we can
continually raise these issues in a cross-party way within Parliament

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:33:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Vauxhall talked about the problem of mis-diagnosis. Some people are
diagnosed as having epilepsy who do not have it, and some people who
have epilepsy are diagnosed as having a different condition. Such
mistakes result in poor or substandard care. Increasing the awareness
of the condition among health care professionals is a key factor in
improving its early diagnosis and treatment. Detailed advice on
epilepsy has therefore been made available on the NHS Evidence website.
That is supported by the updated clinical guideline on the diagnosis
and management of the condition that was published last year by the
National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_29_PT_1/5EAA1FD1940F7928BF61F031FE692C988466810F" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="29 January 2013">Tuesday

treatment of long-term conditions is one of the NHS areas prioritised
by the Secretary of State for Health, and it has featured prominently
in the mandate to the NHS Commissioning Board and the NHS outcomes
frameworks. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:34:48"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Vauxhall mentioned the awful jargon with which we all
have to deal. I have my own personal war against jargon in the
Department of Health, confronted with it as I am on a daily basis. As a
quick aside—given that we have a bit more time than
usual—we need to use language that people understand, rather
than jargon that too often excludes people.</hs_Para>

mandate and outcomes framework set out the Government’s
objectives for the NHS, and highlight the areas where we expect to see
the biggest improvements. The mandate sets an objective for everyone
with a long-term condition to be offered a personalised  care
plan by 2015 that reflects their preferences and agreed decisions.
There is a legal requirement for the Commissioning Board to seek to
meet the terms of  the mandate, and it is potentially powerful
to say that everyone with a long-term condition should have a personal
care plan that they have been involved in designing and drawing up. Too
often, whether for epilepsy or mental health—another area I have
great interest in—people simply do not have such a plan and have
never been asked for their views on their care and treatment. If we can
effect the transition so that everyone with a long-term condition
benefits from it, we can make a real difference.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:36:21"></hs_TimeCode>Epilepsy Action

been raised time and again in the House, and I am pleased to announce
that, as part of this work, the NHS Commissioning Board is appointing a

chronic disability, including epilepsy, is a positive step.</hs_Para>

other specific conditions. They will receive an investment of
£42 million and play an important part in driving up quality and
consistency in treating those conditions. If everyone within the
service is linked into expert networks, the chances of improving
treatment on the ground become greater.

GPs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:39:07"></hs_TimeCode> have an
important role to play in that, and in ensuring that those living with
epilepsy have their condition kept under control with correct
medication. Ultimately, however, responsibility for self-care 
<?notus-xml column=883?>lies not with health professionals, but with patients. Through NHS
Choices, the expert patients programme, and support from health
professionals and voluntary sector groups, people with epilepsy can
receive the information they need to stay safe and independent, and to
manage their condition on a day-to-day
basis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0004.htm#13012952000154">On
the wider Government response, the hon. Member for Vauxhall referred to
the role of education and schools.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-29T18:39:39"></hs_TimeCode> understand
that the Department for Education is working to support children and
young people with epilepsy, as some are not reaching their full
potential in school and further education. For example, the Department
has issued guidance to schools on how best to manage medicines for
pupils diagnosed with epilepsy and other conditions. For those pupils
who cannot attend school because of their condition, the Department has
provided guidance on what alternative provision should be
made.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0004.htm#13012952000155">In
addition, the forthcoming children and families Bill will introduce a
duty on local authorities and clinical commissioning groups to
commission services jointly—a much more integrated approach than
we had in the past—to meet the needs of young people with
special educational needs and disability, including those with
epilepsy. The Bill will introduce a streamlined, single assessment for
the young person. It will also inform an education, health and care
plan for the individual. The plan will enable families and young people
to buy services through direct payments—we are putting the
individuals in charge and giving them real power—thus extending
their choice and control. That approach is currently being piloted
across 20 pathfinder sites. I understand that the lessons learned will
inform the development of secondary legislation and codes of practice,
and help with
implementation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0004.htm#13012952000156">For
many adults with epilepsy, employment is a major quality-of-life
issue—the hon. Lady rightly raised the importance of employment.
Studies have shown that people with epilepsy are up to twice as likely
as people without the condition to be at risk of unemployment or
under-employment relative to their skills and experience. The
Department for Work and Pensions has confirmed that, although it does
not target employment programmes exclusively at individuals with
particular conditions, its programmes, including specialist disability
employment programmes, aim to identify and meet the needs of the
individual, including those with
epilepsy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0004.htm#13012952000157">The
Department for Work and Pensions also recognises the important role
that cash benefits can play in supporting people with a disability or
long-term condition to remain independent. Entitlement to disability
living allowance, and to its planned replacement, the personal
independence payment, is not based on a specific health condition.
However, my understanding is that people with epilepsy may be eligible
for support, depending on the severity of their condition. The hon.
Lady mentioned the Atos-conducted work capability assessments and made
the legitimate point that they should concentrate on the individual. We
can have guidelines to help to steer assessors, but the
individual’s needs should be properly and fully assessed. That
is outside my departmental responsibilities, so I will refer her
remarks to the  right
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0004.htm#13012952000158">The
Department for Work and Pensions has advised that, throughout the
development of the new personal independence payments policy, it has
engaged and consulted with a wide range of disability organisations.
That includes 
<?notus-xml column=884?>a discussion with Epilepsy Action on the assessment criteria for the new
policy. For those who face barriers to work because of their condition,
financial support may also be available under the employment and
support allowance—that, too, is subject to
eligibility.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0004.htm#13012952000159">I
should refer to some of the hon. Lady’s specific
questions—I will ensure I give her a full reply later. She
mentioned bus passes. I understand that some local authorities in
England have implemented their own bus pass concessions and extended
the hours of free travel to include peak times, but the majority have
not. Ultimately this has to be a matter for local decision making. I
recognise that such variations are not ideal, but the local authority
has the power to do this, and pressure can be put on the local
authority in any particular area to do what others have already
done.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012952000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0004.htm#13012952000160">I was
slightly confused because the hon. Lady referred to both the National
Audit Office and the Audit Commission. The point is that we should
focus on the important issue. She argued the case for some sort of
inquiry into epilepsy care to see where we can improve its quality. The
right approach is probably through the work that NICE is doing. If we
can establish what good care looks like, we can encourage all clinical
commissioning groups to seek to deliver that quality of
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0004.htm#13012952000161">The
hon. Lady also talked about outcome indicators, and I will look at that
and come back to her. We need to try to understand the jargon, but the
important point is that we should, as far as possible, be seeking to
focus on the results for individuals. Too often in the past we have
focused on processes and not enough on what we seek to achieve through
health care. If we can, through the outcomes framework, identify things
that we are seeking to achieve for patients—improving their
quality of life—and that can then drive the system, that would
be a good thing. We will look specifically at
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0004.htm#13012952000162">The
hon. Lady talked about the constitution and the right of involvement.
We have been updating the constitution and putting patients’
rights much more centre stage—focusing on the personal rather
than a more paternalistic approach. That is the right approach, and
through the combination of what the constitution will say with what the
mandate will require of the NHS in providing the personalised care
plan—with the involvement of the individual and based on their
priorities, not just presented to them—we can make real progress
in putting the patient centre
stage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0004.htm#13012952000163">The
hon. Lady talked about the lack of engagement of CCGs. That point has
been heard, and it is good that she has had this opportunity to make
the point. The Commissioning Board will do what it can to
ensure  that the quality of care is improved at local level,
and it will be the board’s responsibility to engage with CCGs on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012952000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/debtext/130129-0004.htm#13012952000164">The
hon. Lady also mentioned children and the fact that they are not
achieving their full potential. I think that I have addressed that
point already, but I will come back to her if I have missed anything.
She and others referred to the absolute importance of a speedy referral
from GP to specialist, and the hon. Member for Walsall South (Valerie
Vaz) also mentioned the action plan for children in schools. She is
right to raise both those issues, which were addressed in her
ten-minute rule Bill.</hs_Para>

targets or satisfy neighbourhood or other pressures, which might
distort their proper objectivity. I am attempting to argue that if any

the whole thrust of the debate is to highlight something of which I

whose principal function is to deal with animal welfare, and the

the animal welfare agenda on the ground, leading to precisely the sorts

Hart:</Member></B> I think the situation in Scotland is deemed to be
perfectly satisfactory from the point of view of animal welfare
charities. I do not think that they are particularly governed by
statistics. I am intrigued by the 98% success rate, because nowhere in
the RSPCA documentations could I find any reference to conditional or
unconditional discharges, which I think make quite a difference to the
overall figure. I believe—and I stand to be corrected on the
point—that those are included in the 98% success rate. I suggest
that the lawyers in the Chamber might consider that slightly
misleading.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012938000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012938000059">I
want to press on somewhat, and discuss something that I think is a
commercial disincentive, using the Freedom Food brand as an example. It
is a wholly owned brand of the RSPCA, launched in 1994. The society
claims that more than 75 million farm animals and salmon were reared to
RSPCA welfare standards under the Freedom Food scheme in 2011. So far,
so good—I have no problem with that. Yet in the 19 years since
the scheme was introduced, the RSPCA has not brought a single
prosecution against a Freedom Food member, despite several members of
the programme having been prosecuted—not by the RSPCA—for
seriously compromising animal welfare standards. It is odd that in that
instance the CPS is deemed expert enough to prosecute under animal
welfare legislation, whereas in other cases the RSPCA argues that it
alone possesses the necessary skills and resources to do so. That
raises 
<?notus-xml column=185?>the question—I put it no more strongly than that—whether
in a case where there is a commercial risk to the
RSPCA brand, it is dissuaded from bringing prosecutions, whereas it may
be tempted in the direction of a tantalising, juicy case that it might
want to get its teeth into because of its political or financial
benefits. Those are unnecessary and unfortunate consequences of trying
to mix prosecution with politics.</hs_Para>

bear-baiting and other barbarous activities that use animals as objects
for sport and entertainment, but we have got that far, and those who

conditions here. All kinds of loopholes were put into the law, which
hunters have since used every possible means to exploit. We need

investigating cruelty against animals. We have come to a
situation—I will conclude on this point—where a case has
drawn attention because of a particular prosecution involving
high-profile people, including  the Prime Minister of the land,
who is a member of the hunt, and all we have today is the malice and
spite of the pro-hunting lobby fighting again. Let them have a 
<?notus-xml column=188?>debate in this House to restore hunting as it was in the past. They
cannot do that because they know they lack a

was a huge supporter of the RSPCA for most of my life. I was born on a
livestock farm, and I became a huge supporter of animal welfare mainly
because of the annual ritual of slaughtering the family pig. Anyone who
remembers that will know what a terrible thing it was. Children who
experienced it became supporters of animal welfare, and I was one of
them. As I became older, it stayed with me. When I took over the family
farm, I abandoned rough shooting on the farm, which had been a
tradition. Indeed, for a while I stopped any form of hunting on the
land simply because I wanted my farm to become a wildlife centre. At
some stage later, I realised that that was not the right way to go to
benefit wildlife, so I changed the entire policy. The farm had rough
shooting and people investing in shooting, and I welcomed back the
hunt. The hunt now meets on my farm because I was so outraged by the
previous Government’s hunting
ban.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012938000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012938000087">This
debate is on the specific role of the RSPCA and the way it is carrying
out its job. The RSPCA is doing a range of things, but we are
addressing the specific role of prosecutions. For most of my life I was
a huge supporter of the RSPCA. When I was a member of the National
Assembly and chair of the relevant Committee, quite often the advice of
the RSPCA was hugely beneficial and a big part of our decisions, but in
my mind it was always an animal welfare body; I now find the RSPCA to
be what one might loosely describe as an animal rights body. My
personal support has disappeared. I do not feel that sense of support,
and I think a huge number of people in this country who were previously
big supporters of the RSPCA and saw it as making a huge contribution to
the cause of animal welfare no longer see the RSPCA like
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012938000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012938000088">I

RSPCA is a vital member of our charitable sector and its work across
the country is invaluable and widely appreciated. The RSPCA is
supported, for a range of reasons, by Members of all parties. I know,
as do most MPs, just how important the RSPCA’s campaigns are for
my constituents, who care about animal welfare and who welcome the
opportunity through their membership to ensure that their concerns are
heard. I have never felt that a campaign to highlight animal cruelty,
bad practice and neglect has been run for purely political reasons.
Under the previous Labour Government there were innumerable campaigns
to raise awareness and to enable MPs to ask questions and seek answers
from Ministers. It is absolutely right for a charity to inform Members
of this House, because, ultimately, we are the people who write the
laws.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012938000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012938000096">The
main thrust of the RSPCA’s work is to investigate, thereby
hopefully changing behaviour and making people aware of the
mistreatment of pets and livestock. So much mistreatment arises from
ignorance. However, there are those who are only too aware that their
actions are outside the law and that they are laying themselves open to
prosecution, private or
otherwise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012938000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012938000097">The
RSPCA’s investigations rarely end in prosecution, and it is
important to emphasise that the RSPCA’s prosecutions department
is independent and separate from the investigators. The RSPCA had every
right to investigate and prosecute the Heythrop hunt and those involved
in the maiming of foxes last
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012938000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012938000098">Those
seeking to criticise the work of the RSPCA, and ultimately defend
hunting as a sport, have pointed to the significant figure that the
RSPCA spent on the 
<?notus-xml column=190?>case to bring about, in their view, a fairly insignificant punishment.
Criticising the RSPCA for pursuing political motivations in bringing
the prosecution is completely unfair. The RSPCA does not prosecute
unless there is just cause, and it considers the public interest test
of the code for Crown prosecutors before deciding whether to prosecute.
The RSPCA is supported by, and has good relationships with, Members on
both sides of the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012938000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012938000099">I

his interpretation of the Charity Commission’s letter. Yes, the

its powers are revoked in any way, hundreds of cases of animal cruelty

Member for Montgomeryshire (Glyn Davies) suggested that it ought to
concentrate on animal welfare. The bulk of what the RSPCA does is on
animal welfare, and to suggest otherwise is grossly misleading. That
work would not be carried out by any other body. The Association of
Chief Police Officers has stated that if the RSPCA were to decide not
to do it, no other public service could pick it up, and animal welfare

the RSPCA has a 98% prosecution success rate, compared with 50%
at the CPS, it would seem to 
<?notus-xml column=196?>be pretty well practised at assessing whether a case looks set to
succeed. In the instance of the Heythrop hunt, the charity’s
judgment was correct and a conviction secured. It was a landmark case,
the first time that a hunt has faced corporate charges for illegal
hunting and the first case brought by the RSPCA for breaches of the
Hunting Act. That case was based on footage of foxes being chased by
dogs, filmed on several occasions in Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire
during November 2011 and February and March 2012. Expert analysis
verified that the offences were deliberately
committed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012939000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012939000038">All
of that indicates that the charity thought carefully before bringing a
prosecution under the Hunting Act. It considered the evidence and
judged accurately that the case was likely to be won. It assessed the
impact of the case in acting as a deterrent and in sending out a clear
message about upholding the ban on dogs chasing and killing wild
mammals, thus preventing animal cruelty. Judging by the interest that
the ruling has attracted, the charity made a pretty smart call on using
resources
effectively.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012939000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012939000039"><Member ContinuationText="John McDonnell" PimsId="1799" UID="13012939000136" xid="379" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012939000136"><B>John

of the interest has been about the amount of money spent, with concerns
expressed that the expense was not justifiable. I disagree. It was a
test case and one based on a high volume of evidence, which needed
careful examination to determine whether it constituted a strong enough
case to bring to court. Ironically, many critics of the cost are also
questioning the RSPCA’s judgment on the prospects of success,

prosecution was appropriate and its experience of other high-profile

turn to serious matters. The British are rightly famous for our love of
animals, and the public take animal mistreatment very seriously. It is
a matter of public policy and blights not just animals’ lives,
but if unchecked leads to serious social problems. The illegal trade in
wild animals, for example, is worth £12 billion, and that money
is not put to good use. Underground dog ownership means that animals
are brutalised and used as weapons in parks and cities; they are used
in dog fights, and by gangs of poachers and hare
coursers.

are experts, but unfortunately it seems that their funding will end at

we have a series of checks and balances in our legal system that allows
prosecutions to go ahead without the process being abused. In fact, a
process may be stayed on the basis that it is unfair, wrong and an
abuse of the process. It is for a magistrate to decide that, not the
RSPCA. A prosecution may be brought before a court, and it is for the
magistrate to stop it if necessary. There are checks and balances
before warrants such as search warrants are issued. There are always
checks and balances in our system. In our view, the RSPCA does a good
job, and is bringing prosecutions on behalf of the public and ensuring
that we remain a civilised society. It is for the courts to ensure that
prosecutions are not brought wrongly.</hs_Para>

Service prosecutes cases instituted and referred to it by the police.
They include hunting and wildlife offences. Since 2005, the CPS has
prosecuted 378 offences under the Hunting Act 2004, and it regularly
prosecutes other wildlife offences. In 2011-12, it prosecuted 298
offences under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, 16 offences under the Deer
Act 1991, 43 offences under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992, and 54
offences under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The

and of prosecution of wildlife offences generally on its website. If I

the other hand, is a private prosecutor when bringing prosecutions. It
is an unusual set-up, but the right to bring a private prosecution in
England and Wales is an ancient right, which has existed from the time
when the state did not have prosecution authorities and citizens were
required to prosecute cases themselves. That certainly was the position
when the RSPCA was set up. Although most prosecutions are now conducted
by public prosecuting authorities, the right to bring a private
prosecution remains, preserved by Parliament in the Prosecution of

personally, I once threatened to bring a private prosecution when I was
dissatisfied because the police were not taking action, which did at
least lead to my getting a proper explanation from the police as to why
they were behaving in the way they were. I believe that it is a
fundamental and important right that we have in a free society. Private
prosecutions allow an individual to bring a prosecution when the state,
for whatever reason, does not. Prosecutions by the RSPCA are, however,
just that—private prosecutions. It has no public or special
status as a prosecutor. The RSPCA sets out, in accordance with its
charitable aims and in its own literature, that it applies the full
code test for Crown prosecutors. If I may say so—I do not mean
this in any way pejoratively—that is a self-assertion. The RSPCA
may well be correct, but it certainly cannot  be independently

That must be done by the police. Obviously, if the police are involved
with the RSPCA in an investigation, although they are fully entitled to
use the RSPCA’s expertise to help them on a joint investigation,
the police must apply their own criteria and codes when deciding how a
case should be 
<?notus-xml column=203?>disposed of—whether it should be prosecuted or dealt with in some
other way. The police should not be influenced—I have no reason

1985 Act preserves the right to bring a private prosecution, it also
provides—this is absolutely key to the debate—that the
DPP can take over the conduct of such proceedings. The CPS will always
consider a request to exercise that power and take over such a private
prosecution, including from defendants, and has in the past received
requests in relation to some RSPCA cases. I will come back to that in a
moment. The approach that the CPS will take in such cases is published
on its website. It will review the case in accordance with the full
code test contained in the code for Crown prosecutors and consider
first whether there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic
prospect of conviction, and if there is, whether a prosecution is in
the public interest. It will also consider whether there is a
particular need for the CPS to take over the prosecution, either to
stop it or to continue it. That is entirely a decision for the CPS. The
DPP’s policy is that a private prosecution should be taken over
and stopped if, upon review of the case papers, either the evidential
sufficiency stage or the public interest stage of the full code test is
not met. The Supreme Court has recently upheld the DPP’s policy
on private prosecutions in the case of
Gujra.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012939000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012939000099">The
RSPCA says that it applies the full code test when deciding when to
prosecute. It undoubtedly has its own prosecutions department and is
seen as having expertise in this field, both as an investigator and
prosecutor. However, if an RSPCA prosecution is referred to the CPS,
and the CPS considers that the prosecution does not satisfy the code
for Crown prosecutors, the CPS will take over that case and discontinue
it. Since the CPS began to keep records in that area, it has only been
asked to review RSPCA prosecutions on four occasions. One of those
requests is still under consideration, but in relation to the other
three, the CPS saw no reason to take over the prosecution, and it
continued in the hands of the RSPCA. There are also safeguards in the
trial process itself, including the court’s ability to exclude
evidence from the trial, and to stop a case entirely if it is satisfied
that the proceedings amount to an abuse of process, for example when
the court judges that a fair trial will be impossible.</hs_Para>

mentioned, the CPS is prosecuting wildlife crime where wildlife crime
is referred to it, and where it 
<?notus-xml column=204?>considers that such a prosecution is justified. It has a multi-agency
approach and works closely with the police and other relevant agencies
in case building, so that cases can be effectively prosecuted. There
are 13 area co-ordinators. To support its wildlife specialists in
assessing evidence in cases, the CPS has published legal guidance. It
delivers wildlife training to prosecutors and has done so for some
time. In particular, in 2006 and 2009, the CPS worked closely with the
police and other stakeholders to hold a Partnership for Action against
Wildlife Crime court training day, exploring how to investigate and
prosecute cases involving wildlife issues. It is likely that further
such events will take place. In February 2011, the CPS held a seminar
on prosecuting wildlife and heritage crime for CPS prosecutors, which
looked at specific cases involving the Hunting Act 2004, the convention
on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora,
and the Control of Trade in Endangered Species (Enforcement)
Regulations 1997, as well as the National Wildlife Crime Unit, the Bat
Conservation Trust, gamekeeping and trade in plants. Those are offences
that the CPS takes very seriously, and when cases are brought to it
that pass the full code test, they will be prosecuted.</hs_Para>

raised by hon. Members is that when the RSPCA prosecutes, a cause for
concern is that if the RSPCA prosecution is unsuccessful, costs are
awarded to the defendant from central funds, and not from the RSPCA. I
want to make it clear that first, that will only happen on indictable
offences, and secondly, exactly the same rules apply to any other
public or private prosecutor. The reason is that if somebody is
acquitted, it does not necessarily mean that the prosecution was wrong
in principle. There would be a detrimental effect on prosecutors if
they were liable to pay costs each time a defendant was acquitted. That
may result in prosecutors being more reluctant to bring prosecutions if
they feared the cost consequences. Cases that are properly brought can
end in an acquittal. Even those cases that are dropped before the trial
begins may well be properly started. Although the decision to prosecute
anyone should not be taken lightly, I suspect that nobody in the House
would wish to see a situation where prosecutions are brought only if
there is an absolute certainty of
success.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012939000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012939000104">However,
in the event that a judge or magistrates thought that the prosecution
had been wholly inappropriate, they would have enormously wide
discretion in how to deal with the matter, including the possibility of
ordering a prosecutor to pay the defendants’ costs out of their
own pocket. Or on a conviction—as happened in the Heythrop
case—they have the power to say that only a small part of the
costs should be paid by the defendant, and the rest has to be borne by
the RSPCA itself. It is a matter for the court’s
judgment.</hs_Para>

have been asked whether Her Majesty’s Crown Prosecution Service
inspectorate could review the work of the RSPCA. That produces quite a
big problem. The HMCPSI exists to review prosecution arms of the state.
Applying that to a private prosecution would, I think, be extremely
difficult.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_29_PT_1/BCD9928B54C490CDC791C55656E346D7BDD78369" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="29 January 2013">Tuesday

Anne Main</B> (St Albans) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to speak
under your chairmanship, Mr Williams. We have a very short debate, so
you will have to excuse us if we rattle through it. We need to explore
the history of the Radlett site and the role of the metropolitan green
belt in protecting communities from harm. We need to explore
the professed support or otherwise given to green-belt land by the
coalition Government and by the previous Labour Government and the
views of key players  such as the Minister concerning the
appropriateness of development, particularly in the green belt, to see
whether there has been any slackening of resolve to protect communities
such as mine in and around the Radlett
site.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012942000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012942000005">It
is worth restating that green-belt land serves specific purposes. It
may fulfil one or more of its five designated functions: to check
unrestricted sprawl of built-up areas; to prevent neighbouring towns
from coalescing; to safeguard the countryside from encroachment; and to
preserve the setting of historic towns while encouraging the recycling
of derelict and other urban land. The Radlett green-belt site fulfils
all those functions, so it serves a very valuable purpose, even if it
is not all beautiful woodland. There is no bad green belt. We ditch
that principle at our peril. My constituents in St Albans and those of
my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr Clappison), who will speak
in this debate, need to know whether the green belt is safe under this
Government, or will the economic imperative to get the country building
mean that we ditch those worthy principles when it suits
us?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012942000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012942000006">Given
the “minded to grant” decision on a rail freight
interchange by the Minister on the Radlett aerodrome site, which
comprises 300 acres of metropolitan green belt—the site
represents 10% of the entire green belt around St Albans—it is
important to explore whether the Minister is fully supportive of
protecting green belt policy or if he believes it to be an inconvenient
blockage that stands in the way of the drive for growth. Is the
Minister to stand accused of supporting the green belt when it is
politically expedient to do so but jettisoning his principles when the
need arises or under pressure from the
Treasury?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012942000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012942000007"><Member ContinuationText="David Simpson" PimsId="709" UID="13012942000119" xid="919" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012942000119"><B>David

the Minister convince the House and my constituents that he does have a
passion for the green belt and that he has a coherent and consistent

used as a grass aerodrome in the 1930s. In 1947, the runways were
upgraded to concrete. All that was before the introduction of the
metropolitan green belt protections, which were fully implemented in
1955. By 1970, the runway was no longer in use; most of the structures
on the site were removed and it was restored to farmland. However, for
a second time the community of Park Street was required to allow its
land to be utilised for the greater good of the country when it was
revealed that significant sand and gravel deposits lay under the site.
In common with communities across the country that have such deposits,
a firm undertaking was given that full restoration and landscaping of
the land would occur and that it would be returned to  the
community as an open green space—in our case, green
belt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012942000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012942000011">In
1978, 1985 and 1990, the site was used for gravel extraction, with the
runways dug up to access the gravel. That ceased in 1997. The site has
undergone a full environmental restoration, which has nearly been
completed. The people of this community, like other communities that
endure mineral extraction, rightly expected the restoration of the site
as a community green space and nothing else. They were horrified to be
targeted by developers for a massive rail freight site in 2006. That
application was made because the Government of the day had a stated

2007, the hon. Member for Glasgow South (Mr Harris), who was
then a Transport Minister, said that the importance of rail freight had
been acknowledged in terms of its significant contribution to the
economy and productivity. In 2009, Lord Adonis
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13012942000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012942000081">“Rail

has therefore always been a battle between the economy, the need to
build and the protection of our countryside. The economic imperative
has been a material planning consideration whenever a proposal to build
on the site at Radlett has been considered. However, the question has
always been whether the strength of protection afforded by green-belt
status would be overridden. It has been a David and Goliath struggle,
costing my local council more than £1 million, and STRiFE, a
valiant group of local residents to whom I pay tribute, huge amounts of
time, money and effort in fighting for their community and,
importantly, for the green

recently as 19 September, the Secretary of State for Communities and

Secretary of State is of the view that the two schemes raise similar

merits will be a significant material consideration in his
determination of the Radlett proposal. Furthermore, he considers that a
decision on the Radlett proposal and the reasoning for that decision
may have a significant bearing on his determination of the Colnbrook
proposal. Given this, he is of the view that re-opening the inquiry
into the Radlett appeal and conjoining it with the planned inquiry into
the proposed SRFI at Colnbrook is likely to lead to a more coherent and
consistent decision-making process

Secretary of State’s view on 19 September could not have been
clearer, nor could the subsequent U-turn. How can he take the view in

unnecessary?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012942000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012942000052">The
majority of respondents to the Secretary of State’s letter of 19
September were in favour of a conjoined inquiry, and, in any case, all
the responses to the consultation were what would have been expected
from the relevant parties. The Minister needs to explain to my
constituents and those of my hon. Friend how 
<?notus-xml column=211?>that change of mind came about. It is not good enough to say, “I
have changed my mind.” Ministers need to give reasons. We cannot
have capricious decision making. As matters stand, the Minister is,
according to his Department’s own argument on 19 September,
taking a course likely to lead to inconsistent and incoherent
decision-making processes overall. That was the view in
September.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012942000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012942000053">Any
reasonable person observing the contortions  of ministerial
decision making in such a short period of time would be driven to the

one would more readily associate with a mediaeval despot than a

explanation as to why there has not been an alternative sites
assessment. We have a Minister saying in 2010 that the alternative site
could be less harmful and then saying in 2012, “No, it will not
be less harmful.” I do not think that Slough has moved since
July 2010 and I am certain that St Albans has not moved.

my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr Clappison) on contributing

unfortunately, I am not able to comment specifically on this proposal,

very well. It is entirely open to the local authority or any other
party to ask for that. Unfortunately, that means that I, with my
quasi-judicial function, cannot go into the reasons for the Secretary
of State’s decision before Christmas about being minded to allow
the proposal, which are set out in the decision letter. Although I
completely accept that the specific reasons do not satisfy either my

freight interchanges. Significantly, this one is a strategic rail
freight interchange, which therefore means that there are also
regulations about its having a sustainable work force. It has been
acknowledged that this site will have no sustainable work force, and
that there will be no economic regeneration. Indeed, it is anticipated
that the work force will come from Luton, which is the very site area
that wants a rail freight interchange. That is why there is
incomprehension. That is what we do not understand; it is not that we

the remaining time, I simply say that the planning job is one of the
most difficult ones at any level of government. I am not pleading for
sympathy; I am simply observing that the job is one in which we have to
balance very difficult and important but entirely contradictory or
competing demands. Of course, a good planner tries to do whatever they
can to resolve those demands, by finding a way as much as possible to
meet both of them. However, there are some occasions—when
building a new prison, a new nuclear power station or, as we are
discovering, a new vital high-speed rail infrastructure that will
connect our major cities—when decisions unfortunately have to be
made that will never be acceptable to local people or win their
support, and which will always cause them a level of pain, misery and
disappointment that they will feel can never be alleviated by any
mitigating measures. That is profoundly to be regretted, and is not
something that any decision maker, whether a local councillor, an
inspector or a Minister, does lightly or with
relish.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13012942000115" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0001.htm#13012942000115">11.30

Sinn Fein down the years. The seat had been represented by Tom

Members of Parliament have been asked to raise issues by people in that

said, my party opposed that situation from the very start. When the
idea of paying special allowances to Sinn Fein was first raised by the
then Labour Government, we were forthright in our opposition. Others
were equally forthright when they were sitting alongside us on the
Opposition Benches—now they are on the Government Benches. That
is why the Democratic Unionist party backed Conservative proposals to
end the payment of these moneys to Sinn Fein. The Conservative party
correctly judged that the prospect of lavishing taxpayers’
largesse on a party that does not come to this place or represent the
constituents here was an intolerable concession made for cynical
political reasons. The decision was connected with buying Sinn
Fein’s complicity in the political process in Northern
Ireland—serving up goodies to them to bring about the complete
ending of the IRA criminal enterprise. We supported the Conservative
opposition to that concession, and we are now calling on the
Conservatives to make good in government the promises they made in
opposition.</hs_Para>

the background to this situation. While making much of their public
contempt for this House and the other institutions of our United
Kingdom, Sinn Fein has devoted considerable time and energy lobbying to
enjoy access to the financial resources of an institution that they
profess to hate. As we say in Ulster, “They hate the crown, but
they love the half crown.” They first raised the issue in 1997,

McCrea:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for making such a valid
point. We are constantly being reminded that we are in a deep hole
economically, yet we find that representative money is without the same
scrutiny and accountability that applies to Short money and to every
other political party and elected representative. We all know that the
Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority has stringent rules for
MPs’ expenses. There is a proper accountability, and rightly so.
However, unlike every other party in this House, Sinn Fein can use that
money for political ends and political purposes, rather than being
subject to the accountability of using it for representing
constituents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012945000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012945000024">On
the scrutiny of MPs’ expenses, it was interesting to note that
one Sinn Fein Member made a single flight to London from Northern
Ireland, yet they claimed £18,000 that year for accommodation. I
do not know what hotel they were staying in or what champagne 
they were drinking, but it must have been very  expensive. They
claimed for one flight and £18,000 for accommodation,
yet this House and the scrutinisers did not lift an eyelid in surprise.
Of course, we should not be surprised, bearing in mind the other things
that Sinn Fein-IRA were up to at that time. It was a cynical ploy,
which it has used right up to this present
moment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012945000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012945000025">Pensioners
are not able to get appropriate moneys and there are cutbacks in the
welfare budget and every other budget, yet we are told we will still
play the game for one political party in opposition to every other
party. Every other party has to play by the rules of the game in
politics, so it is not right that one political party is able to absent
itself from that situation. It is a disgrace. It is discriminatory and
therefore totally unacceptable. Why should pensioners, young people and
the unemployed or people who are endeavouring to get into work find
themselves in difficult situations financially when we have a political
party walking away and enjoying the fruits of not representing its
constituents in this mother of
Parliaments?</hs_Para><hs_ParaIndent UID="13012945000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012945000125">Sinn
Fein also sits in the Northern Ireland Assembly. It says it does that
because of its political allegiance to a united Ireland, so it is
showing its distaste and objection to the United Kingdom and being a
part of a British institution. Let us examine that. Sinn Fein sits in
the Northern Ireland Assembly, an institution created by statute of
this House of Commons. It is a British institution. The laws passed
there, just like the laws passed here, go to Her Majesty the Queen to
receive Royal Assent. Sinn Fein Ministers participate in that process
on a day-and-daily basis. As a benefit of its participation in the
Northern Ireland Assembly, Sinn Fein receives money for party
administration and support staff, just like every other party. It takes
that money as a benefit of its participation in the Assembly at
Stormont—participation that it does not undertake here, yet it
is paid the money without
representation.</hs_ParaIndent>

I suggest that everyone is equally subject to, as well as equal under,
the law. That ought to apply to Gerry Adams and to Martin McGuinness;
it certainly applies to my hon. Friends and colleagues and to every

catalogue of publicly stated positions, there can be no doubt as to the
stance of the Conservative party, which is the major partner in the

roost. It was easy for the Conservatives to point the finger at the
Labour Administration. It was easy for them to go through the voting
Lobby whenever a proposal came from the Labour Government, but now the
responsibility rests with this Administration and they will not be able
to get out of facing up to it. That is what government is all about,
and we are told day-and-daily that government is about taking hard
decisions. I suggest that this Government have taken many harder
decisions than this, on cutting benefits and so on, and they believe
that they do so in the interests of the economic well-being of the
country. I do not doubt their sincerity or the premise on which they
present their case, but if they make such decisions on those grounds,
there are no grounds whatsoever for them to move away from the

being treated with
equality.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012945000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012945000035">There
were clear and unambiguous statements that an incoming Tory
Administration would mean the end of the wasteful and anti-democratic
use of public resources. I can imagine the Government spokesman, the
right hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake), preparing
the argument that this is not a Conservative Administration, and that
is true. But it is a Conservative-led Administration, and the Prime
Minister is a Conservative Prime Minister. He might say that there is a
coalition and, as a consequence, some things that were said on the
assumption of an overall Tory majority have to be reviewed. The logic
of that argument is correct, and it means that we need to consider the
matter of the Liberal
Democrats.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012945000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012945000036">The
Liberal Democrats, for whatever reason, did not adopt a formal position
on the issue back in 2001, choosing instead to afford their Members a
free vote, and I have not heard or seen anything from the Liberal
Democrat leadership to indicate a change in that position. Liberal
Democrat Members can vote freely on the matter, and I have no doubt
that a great many of them, perhaps even a majority, would be persuaded
by the arguments made so eloquently by their coalition partners. I
certainly hope that that will be so. The coalition has taken hard
financial decisions to try to rescue our country from the economic pit
that it finds itself in, so it has to face the hard decision concerning
this
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012945000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012945000037">The
logic for introducing the changes back in 2001 was flawed. Not only was
it based on handing out concessions to a political party that at the
time refused to come up to the same minimum democratic standards as the
rest of us, it served to create two classes of MP and to render as
nothing the rules of this House. In practice, it has demonstrably
failed. If the plan was to kill off abstentionist politics through
financial inducement, it has not worked. The Sinn Fein position is as
immovable as it was 20 years ago. Despite the fact that Martin
McGuinness can meet the Queen or that Sinn Fein Ministers participate
in the institutions at Stormont, Sinn Fein has indicated repeatedly
that it would not, even if the Oath or affirmation were removed, attend
the House of Commons. Its Members receive allowances from the Northern
Ireland Assembly as a benefit of their participation there, and the
same logic should 
<?notus-xml column=221?>apply here. No show should mean no pay. I urge the Government to act in
that regard without further delay, and make good their many and
repeated public promises on this

should recall the scale of Sinn Fein’s income, including
representative money. According to the most recent accounts submitted
by Sinn Fein, the party had an income of £1.25 million in the
last recorded year. To give an idea of the pro rata scale of that
income, it would be similar to the Labour party having an income of
some £35 million and spending about £33 million or
£34 million. The difference is that the Labour party would not
be spending more than £30 million on employing hundreds of
people, many of whom used to kill people, which is what Sinn Fein does.
Sinn Fein employs scores of “former combatants.” When
Sinn Fein runs out of money to employ people on that basis, as has been
the case in the Stormont Assembly, it sometimes tries to employ one of
the “former combatants” as an adviser to a Minister until
there is a furore and it has to sideline that person and bring in
someone else. That is what Sinn Fein uses the money
for.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012945000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012945000046">Sinn
Fein is a wealthy political party. Indeed, according to the most recent
figures in the public domain, it is the wealthiest political party in
Northern Ireland. No one should get caught up in some sort of false

Sinn Fein’s capacity to represent

contention is simple: Sinn Fein should abide by the rules in the same
way as everyone else. Abiding by the rules is a concept that, up to 15

of this House. We spent a long time with the Conservative party when it
was in opposition before the last election, and with the Government
since the election, reminding them of their commitment before 2010 on
the need to ensure that people in Northern Ireland had a degree of
assurance that moneys were being spent
appropriately.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012945000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012945000050">Every

one party alone. There is rising resentment in Northern Ireland, and it
is not confined to Northern Ireland, because on occasion I have had

of weeks ago by an abstentionist Member to inform other MPs about what
was happening in Northern Ireland. Those visits normally coincide with
the issue we are debating coming to the fore again. Why is that? It is
not just a cynic who would be led to believe that when Sinn Fein
Members see the prospect of this special money being reviewed and
possibly taken from them, they hop on a plane from Belfast to London,
and a hurriedly arranged meeting to update Members is on the cards.
People are asked to come along and hear what is happening with the flag

ask questions about those issues and be updated on them, but not on the

“hard-pressed taxpayers” lightly, but people are
suffering. They are examining each and every aspect of Government
policy. They are looking at welfare reform and every pound they spend,
as well as every pound the Government spend. When people see an

most recent ploy of holding little seminars and little meetings is in
many ways an affront to democracy? Over the years, Sinn Fein Members

of the representative money can be used in a creative fashion. Sinn
Fein are masters not only of financial creativity but of a series of
other creative measures. Anyone who denies that Sinn Fein is not just
misusing this money but using it for purposes for which it was never
intended is living in cloud cuckoo land. The time for this matter to be
reviewed has long since passed. Time needs to be set aside for a
review. Every Member who is elected to this House has to be treated on
an identical basis. If we take our seats and make representation,
whether it be good or bad, we are judged at the following election by
our electorates in our constituencies. If we decline to take our seats
and are elected on that basis, we should not get representative money
for failing to represent our constituents.</hs_Para>

clearly the position, and that is where we stand on the matter. The
2008 motion, however, which was specifically for those who do not take
their seat, allowed such a party to access the money for its
representative business. As I was listening to my colleagues, I
thought, “Sinn Fein are the hokey-cokey party.” They are

a lot of talk about equality and fairness, in relation to Members and
the constituencies that they represent. People in all parties are
concerned about fairness and equality among Members of the House. Some
parties may not be represented here today, but it has been made clear
in their discussions with us that they do not accept as proper and fair
a situation in which, although they are confined to spending
parliamentary allowances on constituency and parliamentary
work—as everyone accepts is right and proper—under the
representative money arrangement, Sinn Fein can spend that money on
party political campaigning and activities, without reprimand or

of their great mantras, and we hear it over and over again, but in this
situation, they want a unique position, in which they have a special
class of MPs who can avail themselves of the moneys without taking
their seats and enjoy an advantage over everybody else in the use of

money for Opposition parties in the House of Commons was introduced by
resolution of the House in 1975 to assist Opposition parties in
carrying out their parliamentary business. Although that is not defined
precisely, the money is used largely for the employment of research
staff and support to the Whips’ Offices. In addition, Short
money is used for funding for Opposition parties’ travel and
associated expenses, and funding for running costs of the office of the
Leader of the Opposition. Levels of funding are calculated with
reference to the number of seats won at the previous general election,
with a sum for the number of votes gained by the party. I had wondered
whether other parties from Northern Ireland might attend, to ask why
they were not entitled to that funding. In the House of Lords,
Cranborne money, the equivalent of Short money, was introduced in 1996.

our education system is predicated on the expectation that children
will go to school, go through the primary and junior years, go into
secondary education at 11, take their GCSEs at 16 and be
successful, and go through to the sixth form and get the qualifications
to go into higher education. That does not apply to the majority of

dramatically, although there has been some change in nuance and there
are some changes going through now. However, the fact is that we have
been frantically trying to find ways in which to engage young people in
meaningful further education, whether that be in colleges, by which I
mean FE colleges, or whether it be through young people going into
apprenticeships, going directly into employment—employment with
training or, sadly, without training—or, of course, going into
the hands of private trainers. There has been a range of
opportunities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000016">The
private training sector is very underestimated. I know the private
training world very well. Unlike most parts of the education system,
there are brilliant private sector educators and trainers, and there
are some average ones and some not quite so good, but the market in
private training is such that if someone does not perform, they are
more likely to go out of business or see their business shrink quite
dramatically than if they are running a college. That is the truth of
the matter.</hs_Para>

cold wind coming through the whole education system and particularly in
relation to the area that we are talking about today—the
employability of young people and their getting the right skills for

accountability for what is delivered, whether it is the private sector
through the Work programme, Jobcentre Plus and anything that it
contributes, or what colleges
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000018">We
all have to be very conscious of the last annual report of the chief
inspector of schools. I was surprised that there was such a critical
evaluation of the quality of FE in our country, which I felt, as a
former Chairman of the Select Committee, was a slumbering giant. I was
recently on the Skills Commission, looking at specialism in further
education. Where further education is good, it is really good. We need
only look at Newham and Hackney. We need only look at the brilliant
experience in Cornwall. A fantastic-quality education is being
delivered off six sites. People there know absolutely what the labour
market is like and are engaging absolutely with small and medium-sized
enterprises, not just the easy big ones, and delivering relevant skills

done wrong in primary school education? It is the new frontier. More

other sibling may be starting a different sort of
apprenticeship —one in a different sector and perhaps of
a different length—or a traineeship. What should the 14-year-old
do? Should they stay in school or choose another option? What support

have given up on careers information, guidance and advice. They have
more or less said, “If you want that sort of thing, it is up to
a school or you do it on the internet.” I was on the Skills
Commission inquiry into careers information, advice and guidance, and
about 17% of young people were using the internet to access such
information then—that percentage is probably in the 20s now. All
the research shows that the key to getting through the pattern of
complex choices is face-to-face guidance from a human being with
experience, knowledge and
networks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000031">I

‘Go into that classroom and show us you can teach.’ I
know nothing about choosing a career, but I’ve been asked to

two choices: ignore it and fill schools with people who do not want to

experience. I have never been one of the naysayers about work
experience. It is important. Having four brushes with work experience
at school increases the likelihood of a person getting a job by
10 times. Young people at those ages must have 
<?notus-xml column=238?>opportunities for good traineeships and apprenticeships. Most of the

the party political shouting match and agree that we want our young

education, training or doing work experience, and should not be living
on the margins of society on tiny bits of benefit, otherwise we will

Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman). He has experience and a
long-held passion. He was Chairman of the Select Committee on Education
and Skills in the previous Parliament and clearly has a huge amount to
say. It is important and valuable for young Ministers such as me to
listen to what he has to say. I strongly agree that there is
cross-party consensus on tackling youth unemployment, which rose too
much in the good years and, although it is still far too high, is
thankfully now falling.</hs_Para>

point of partisan contention was the rather disappointing part about
information, advice and guidance. The new duty on schools to provide
independent and impartial advice, the age range for which has since
been extended, only came into force in September and is now in place.
It did not replace a system. The Connexions system was widely regarded
as a failure. It is incumbent on us all to ensure that the information,
advice and guidance duty on schools is in place. Misrepresenting it, as
the hon. Gentleman did—for party political reasons, he
said—is unhelpful, because this is an area with broad party
political support.</hs_Para>

the opportunity to answer the series of questions the hon. Gentleman
raised. I will try to get through as many of them as possible, but I am
happy to answer them all in more detail if I cannot get through them in
the seven or eight minutes I have left. The debate about the future of
16-to-18 education takes place in the context of raising the
participation age, which was set out in legislation in 2008 under the
previous Government and which we are taking forward. Since 2009,
participation in education and work-based learning has risen from 78.8%
to 82.2%. It is going in the right direction, but we must ensure that
the tools are in place to make it go further. I shall touch on six
areas where we are taking action to achieve that aim.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman rightly mentioned apprenticeships and their value and
importance. Doug Richard’s recent review into apprenticeships
puts employers in a central role, setting standards, overseeing testing
and becoming more demanding purchasers of training. We can all sign up
to and agree with that. He wants a shift from what he 
<?notus-xml column=239?>saw as a box-ticking assessment to having clear standards towards the
end of an apprenticeship, accompanied by a more open and innovative
training market, with greater freedoms in how people are trained and
greater emphasis on the outcome. I am very attracted to that model,
which builds on some of the principles being tested through the
employer ownership pilot. We will respond formally to the Richard
review in the spring, and we will consult employers, educators,
providers and apprentices, but we welcome the review’s direction
of
travel.</hs_ParaIndent><hs_Para UID="13012962000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000037">We
know that, as apprenticeships become more rigorous, many young people
are highly motivated by the prospect of work, but need support to get
into it. I strongly endorse the hon. Gentleman’s support for
work experience. The statistic that four episodes of work experience
lead to a 10 times greater chance of getting a job was new to me; I am
interested in the analysis behind that and want to know more about
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000038">The
idea behind having a high-quality apprenticeship programme is that, as
employers often tell me, young people lack the right skills and
attitudes to succeed in the application process. When they have to
compete against adults for jobs, they risk being passed over because
they do not have such skills. Traineeships will support a significant
number of young people into apprenticeships. We are consulting very
broadly on their design, but our aim is for them to be available for
young people from September 2013. They will offer a combination of
extended work placements, work skills and English and maths, together
with other flexible training and support to suit individual
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000039"><B><Member ContinuationText="Caroline Dinenage" PimsId="5684" UID="13012962000132" xid="1097" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000132">Caroline

fundamentally disagreed about is that if a school has no independent
voice with experience about careers information, guidance and advice,
all the emphasis is on keeping children in school, because bums on

anywhere else, the school loses money. There is a terrible agenda in

financial position in western countries is bad. Between the fourth
quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2012, UK GDP grew from an
index of 102.8 to 102.9. People who have not looked at the
source data think that the economy flatlined, when it in fact crawled
up a single tenth of an index point, but the consequences are much the
same. I have argued for some time that the high price of oil, and hence
the high price of energy, will reduce economic activity. Unless we see
a material reduction in energy prices, we will continue to have a
stuttering
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000049">That
affects the public finances, because tax revenue is anaemic and more
people are out of work. To keep sovereign debt interest rates under
control, we need to control public spending. Unless there is a very
high economic spending multiplier, additional spending will not result
in a sufficient increase in tax revenues to allow a reduction in
borrowing. Little of the fiscal debate concerns the key issue that we
are in fact borrowing to keep up revenue spending, and that there is no
space for additional spending. Furthermore, we must reduce Government
spending to reduce the deficit and show sufficient commitment to keep
gilt interest rates down. It is important to remember that every one
percentage point on gilt interest rates increases costs by more than
£10 billion a year in additional cuts or additional
taxes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000050">The

local government had a great ability to increase central Government
financing merely by putting up the council tax, because a major
proportion of council tax was paid by central Government through
council tax benefit, with an increase of the council tax resulting in

the future, but I would expect it to be needed for at least a decade.
Any additional funding could be only by discussion, not through
automaticity, as has previously been the case. The old system gave

local councils will have the difficulty of a 10% cut in that support,
but they will have the ability to raise additional costs from empty
properties, flexibility as to how to provide support for people on
lower incomes and the offer of grant support, which would be
£2.1 million for Birmingham. There is an argument that it is a
good idea for everyone to contribute something towards local government
spending. A contrary argument is that it is silly for all of
someone’s income to come from benefits and for there also to be
an additional tax
transaction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000057">My
own view is that we need to look at things from the perspective of
someone on £56.25 or £71 a week after rent. They have
certain fixed costs, such as water and energy bills, for which there is
no support. Without a phone, such a person will have more difficulty
getting a job. I was uncomfortable about their falling behind inflation
by 56p or 71p, but Labour is proposing to charge those in band
H—and some people in band H are on benefits—up to
£8.50 a week in Birmingham. The food budget is about £20
a week for somebody on £71 a week, and Sir Albert is asking for
more than a day’s worth of that budget for the council.
Furthermore, food costs are expected to increase and energy costs do
not look as though they are on the way
down.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000058">It
is true that the average stay on JSA is about four months, but we must
have a system that enables everybody to cope. I accept that some people
have no recourse to public funds. We cannot say with certainty that
everybody who cannot get a job in 12 months is a scrounger. There is a
baby and bathwater problem—if we make the system too tough, we
start hitting a lot of people who are trying hard to get a job and just
find the economic situation too tough.</hs_Para>

news, if it can be called good news, is that the courts will only
attach benefits of up to £3.55 a week—5% of the 25-plus
JSA figure—for council tax and so on. Hence, in the end, the
council can only get £3.55 a week, but that is five times the
cut that the Opposition opposed last week. The figure of £3.55 a
week includes the £65 summons fee. Hence on Birmingham’s
figures after collection costs, there would even be a cash shortfall
for people in band A. The council has not taken that into account in
its calculations.</hs_Para>

looking at the figures behind the calculations. In 2012-13, Birmingham
expects £88.2 million of council tax grant, and it is likely to
get £79.5 million in 2013-14. That is a shortfall of £8.7
million. Using a 98% collection rate for the new charges, the council
can get £6 million from additional empty homes charges, with
only an 80% collection rate on the 150% charge.</hs_Para>

offering a grant of £2.1 million, which leaves a shortfall of
£600,000. That can be covered by changing the rules on
backdating, which will potentially bring in £883,199. In any
event, that allows the council to cover the costs of the cut without
charging people on JSA a penny. The Government grant allows a charge of
between zero and 8.5%, and I believe that the passing of the Welfare
Bill justifies the zero charge.</hs_Para>

to the sting in the tail of Sir Albert Bore and Birmingham
Labour’s approach on charging people on JSA council tax. They
put out a misleading consultation that argued that they should keep
support costs within the level of Government funding. That means taxing
poor people to pay for benefits for the poor. They estimate a 1.45%
increase in the cost of council tax more generally, an increase of
£1.3 million. The real sting in the tail, however, is the taxing
of a “contingency” figure of £882,316 on those
people on JSA.</hs_Para>

of such a policy is obvious in the long term. It will require a further
increase in the proportion of tax on those on JSA for each year that
the council tax is increased by 1.45%. However, the key is that we
should ask for the burden to be shared, and not simply hit those people
on the lowest incomes with a tax to pay for people who also have low
incomes. Yes, that does mean that somehow the cost of £1.3
million should be found from the general fund. Furthermore, the
contingency risk, which could go either way, should be borne by the
general reserves. However, the general fund is getting an additional
£1.4 million from an increase in the tax base in any
event.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000064">Sir
Albert, in his “jaws of doom” graph, says that inflation
will go up by £18 million from £8.2 million in 2012-13 to
£26.2 million in 2013-4. He has recognised that that is too high
by more than £5.3 million, but there is still an increase of
£12.7 million. That is more than a doubling in the
council’s assessment of inflation and easily allows the
£1.3 million needed to avoid taxing the poor to be
found.</hs_Para>

problem with low pay. The biggest problem is the driving of wages down
towards the minimum wage and it may be worth having visas for Romanians
and Bulgarians from 2014 to reduce that effect. However, Sir Albert
Bore’s “jaws of doom” graph suggests a cost to the
council of £11.5 million in 2016-17 for increasing the pay of
the employees of contractors. That is a nice thing to do, but when we
are taxing the poor—including those people affected by that
increase—in part to pay for it, that has to be
questioned.</hs_Para>

minimum wage are not paying council tax, and Labour’s proposals
would increase their costs also by the full amount of 20% of JSA. Given
the wage increase and the tax increase, someone in band C would get an
additional £28 a week after tax, but lose £9.46 in
additional council tax. Those who do not work for contractors would
just pay the additional tax.</hs_Para>

Government, however, cannot come out of this without having to think
carefully about the future. The funding provided in this year should
also be provided in future years. This issue may not have got the media
attention of the cut in child benefit for higher earners, because
inherently very few people in the media are on JSA—they have
jobs—whereas quite a few are affected by the cut in child
benefit. It is, however, a very important

foreign aid.</hs_Para>

us recognise that the Welfare Benefits Up-rating Bill is coming in. If
we ladle things on top of people, it gets very difficult. They are
householders, so they are having to manage being in a household. The
courts will not enforce the whole tax bill, and the council has ignored
that, but the point is serious. It is a political choice made by the
authority. The grant that I want to be continued costs only
£100 million. I say
“only”—£100 million is quite a bit of

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Brandon Lewis):</Member></B> It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship today, Sir Roger. I am grateful to my hon.
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming) for providing
us with the opportunity to debate the policy of localising council tax
support, which will be delivered through the Local Government Finance
Act 2012. I will touch on the salient points generally as well as the
specific points about the council in Birmingham if time
allows.</hs_Para>

widespread recognition that welfare spending needs to be targeted
better. My hon. Friend made that point. More needs to be done to tackle
poverty by getting people off benefits and into work. Council tax
benefit expenditure more than doubled between 1997 and 2010 under the
previous Labour Government. Localising support for council tax delivers
a 10% saving on council tax benefit expenditure, making a vital
contribution to deficit
reduction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000085">Importantly,
however, this reform also gives local authorities control over how this
saving is delivered, and it gives them a direct financial stake in
supporting local people into work. I am clear that councils are best
placed to understand local priorities and the needs of residents on low
incomes. Localisation enables them to take local factors into account
when deciding on levels of support and
programmes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000086">Localising
council tax support gives local authorities a real stake in the
economic future of their areas. We want local authorities to do more to
grow their local economy and reap more of the benefits of local
economic growth. Making local authorities responsible for council tax
support reinforces the positive benefits of driving economic growth in
their areas. Funding for local council tax support schemes is being
provided through the retained business rates system itself, further
strengthening the incentive for local authorities to grow their local
economy and get more people into work in the first place. In doing so,
local authorities will not only be helping to create jobs, but will be
increasing the income from increases in business rates and, therefore,
the amount that they can spend on other valued local
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000087">Through
our other local government reforms we have been clear that we want
local authorities to be fully accountable for the decisions that they
take. At present, councils can put up council tax without considering
the impact on council tax benefit costs. Localising council tax support
will change that and encourage greater local financial accountability.
It will also strengthen the incentives to drive down fraud and error.
We have shown that local authorities can do far more about
that.</hs_Para>

choices about how to design their schemes and manage the reduction in
funding. As well as being able to choose whether some awards should be
reduced, they can also manage the reduction by reconfiguring funding
for other services through efficiency savings, using reserves, or using
the flexibility that we have now given over council tax charges. I am
aware that some local authorities, such as East Hampshire district
council, Bristol and the London borough of Merton have decided to do
just that, so that council tax benefit claimants in their areas see no
reduction in the level of support that they currently receive, which
shows that it can be
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000089">Local

will see claimants pay a maximum of 8.5% of their council tax bill and

current four. The council has also set up a hardship fund to assist
people who experience genuine financial difficulties as a result of the

or on fixed low incomes with their council tax. It is being told by the
Government that for two years, perhaps—no commitment after

Government say. The Government’s financial envelope, looking
forward to the next five years, will leave Birmingham with a shortfall
of £625 million, although it is being told that if it freezes
council tax, it will get another bung, but only for two years. This

Lewis:</Member></B> I will touch on a comment that was made by the hon.
Member for Birmingham, Yardley earlier. To be fair, he made the point

Parliament in representing their residents when they criticise the hon.
Member for Birmingham, Yardley and make comments about supporting
Birmingham. The job of an MP is not to support the council; it is to
support, defend and stand up for the residents. There is nothing wrong
with a Member of Parliament standing up for the residents and
challenging the council on whether it is doing the right thing and
putting in a good scheme. I have already given examples of councils
that are doing the right thing by their residents. If Birmingham

it happens I do not agree that that is the difficulty; it is just part
of a wider package. As ever, Opposition Members tend to pick on one
thing rather than look at an issue as a whole. The flexibilities that
we have given to local government, along with councils’ ability
to crack down on fraud and error—£200-odd million last
year alone, which in most people’s books is a lot of
money—give local government enough to deal with the measure.

am disappointed that some councils have failed to rise to the challenge
to explore every option, and that they are taking what they perceive to
be the easier route of looking at double-digit across-the-board cuts.
That is a short-term approach that slashes entitlements for the poorest
without looking at other ways in which to manage the funding reduction,
and it is not sustainable. It is common sense that asking the poorest
to pay contributions of 30% is simply unreasonable and, in the longer
term, as the funding for council tax support is built into the baseline
level of business rates funding, councils have everything to gain from
helping people back into work. That is where their focus should
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012962000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/halltext/130129h0002.htm#13012962000101">It

give them regarding council tax and encouraging local growth. The
benefits will come during and towards the end of the first year, and we

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Mr Eric
Pickles):</Member></B> I have today laid in Parliament an order to
revoke the last Administration’s regional strategy for Yorkshire
and Humber. This follows an assessment as outlined in the written
ministerial statement of 25 July 2012, <I>Official Report</I>, House of
Lords, columns
WS66-68.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13012941000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/wmstext/130129m0001.htm#13012941000012">The
revocation of the regional strategy for Yorkshire and Humber and its
flawed top-down targets heralds another important step for localism. It
delivers a decentralised planning system where local councils and local
people can own the planning agenda for their communities and so shape
and deliver development where they live. Such engagement is the key to
creating a planning system that works with, not against, local
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13012941000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/wmstext/130129m0001.htm#13012941000013">The
City of York does not currently have a local plan in place with defined
green belt boundaries. The environmental assessment process indicated
that revocation of the York green belt policies before an adopted local
plan was in place could lead to a significant negative effect upon the
special character and setting of York. Following careful consideration
of the consultation responses received, we have concluded that the best
solution would be to retain the York green belt policies. This approach
expresses the importance that the coalition Government place upon the
green belt and our recognition of its invaluable role in protecting our
treasured environmental and cultural
heritage.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13012941000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/wmstext/130129m0001.htm#13012941000014">Once
the order takes effect, development plans across the former Government
office region, with the exception of York, will comprise the relevant
local plan, and where they exist, neighbourhood plans. In York, the
development plan will continue to include the regional
strategy’s green belt
policies.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13012941000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/wmstext/130129m0001.htm#13012941000015">The
reasons for the decision to retain the York green belt policies, and to
revoke all other parts of the regional strategy, are set out in a
post-adoption statement, which has been placed in the Library of the
House and is available online at:

already collects and publishes a substantial amount of data on the
supply of graduates from UK Higher Education Institutions from
different disciplines, including science subjects. For example, HESA
recently published information on higher education qualifiers by

and Qualifications Obtained at UK Higher Education Institutions
2011/12', which can be found at the following
link.</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13012985001116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/text/130129w0001.htm#13012985001116">http://www.hesa.ac.uk/content/view/2667/393/</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13012985000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/text/130129w0001.htm#13012985000214">Subject
information is collected and published by HESA using the Joint Academic
Coding System (JACS); this allows for the statistics to be made
available to a fine level of detail, such as aerospace engineering,
microbiology or mathematical sciences, while also allowing users to
group the information at the broader levels used in the publication

also collects and publishes information on the employment outcomes of
graduates from UK Higher Education Institutions; the most recent
publication of such information was in the Statistical First Release

specific single data source on the demand for graduates in STEM
subjects. A key issue here is that graduates in these subjects can fill
a wide variety of jobs. Some of these jobs will be clearly
subject-specific and STEM-related, whereas others will be less directly

are not using their STEM
skills.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012985000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/text/130129w0001.htm#13012985000217">However,

London borough of Newham, London borough of Lambeth and the London

Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps), wrote to the
Leaders in May to highlight the importance of participation, and five
of these local authorities are now actively providing, or finalising
internal and database systems to provide, data. Importantly, this means
that all London local authorities should be providing data from April
2013. Portsmouth city council is the remaining non-participating local

methylphenidate that concluded in January 2009. Throughout this review
independent scientific expert advice was obtained from the Commission
on Human Medicines on the available evidence. This concluded that the

their risks, when they are used in their approved indication for
children aged six years or over and adolescents with attention deficit

In 2007, the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Prison Service (now the
National Offender Management Service) and other agencies that make up
the criminal justice system agreed a common definition of monitored
hate crime which included the following five strands: disability, race,
religion or belief, sexual orientation and transgender identity. Only
notifiable offences are
included.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>2</Sup>
The totals are not a count of crime as more than one form of hate crime
can be assigned to an offence. 37 out of the 39 police forces in
England were able to provide data that included multiple hate crime
strands being assigned to a single
offence.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>3</Sup>

investigative tool for the police in preventing and detecting serious
and violent crime. The tactic has been independently reviewed by HM
Inspectorate of Constabulary and the specific issues arising from the
case of Mark Kennedy are currently the subject of litigation in the
High Court and in the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. We therefore have
no plans to hold a judge-led public inquiry into this or related

it is only possible to present data broken down by age grouping and

preferred 25.25m option of the Huddersfield report was ruled out in the

research showed that the 18.75m/44 tonne option was likely to give the

privatised. The service under the future contracts will continue to be
managed by HM Government, and tasking will remain a state activity.
Bidders for the contracts have sustainable long term strategies for
recruitment and skill retention to ensure today's high standards are
maintained. Contracted helicopter search and rescue services have been
operating very successfully in the UK since 1983. Extending the
contracted arrangements to cover the whole of the UK will not lead to
any change in the level of service delivered to the public. Public

departmental resource budgets of 1% in 2013-14 and 2% in 2014-15.
Because the Ministry of Defence (MOD) has, for the first time ever,
included annual unallocated provisions in its budget, and because of
exceptional flexibilities agreed with the Treasury, these reductions
can be absorbed without impacting on the core defence equipment
programme in 2013-14 and 2014-15. The budget for 2015-16 will be set
out in the 2013 spending review.</hs_Para>

Department for Communities and Local Government published a number of
documents as part of the Local Government Finance Settlement on 19
December 2012. As part of this, the value of the Early Intervention

early education and the funding centrally retained to support early

the Secretary of State for Education, my right hon. Friend the Member
for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), has previously explained, the overall
funding for early intervention is increasing, from £2.2 billion
in 2011-12 to £2.5 billion in 2014-15. The transfer of funding
for early education for two-year-olds from lower income households from
the EIG to the Dedicated Schools Grant reduced the size of the EIG from
2012-13 to 2013-14. However, this funding is still allocated to local
authorities. In 2013-14 the total EIG itself will be
£1,708,918,200, and in 2014-15 it will be £1,600,026,400.
The value of the early intervention grant has been reduced in 2013-14
by 1% as a result of the 1% reduction to Departments' resource budgets
announced at the autumn statement, and by 2% in 2014-15 as a result of

Although it is theoretically possible that some farms raising bulls for

payments are directly related to the amount of land owned and not to

Benyon:</Member></B> Pesticides are tightly regulated in the UK in
accordance with EU pesticides legislation and neonicotinoid insecticide
products authorised for use in the UK meet the current standards set by
the regulatory system. Legal restrictions are in place to limit the
exposure of bees to these products. A code of practice is in place for
professional pesticide users, such as farmers, on how and when
pesticides are used so as to minimise the impact on bees. All pesticide
users must comply with all the conditions of a product's authorisation
which will include limitations on the use to a specific
situation(s)/crop(s) along with application rates and timings, and

Alongside 
<?notus-xml column=756?>our current work we are carefully considering the recent reports
published by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) which review the
risk assessments for three neonicotinoids (clothianidin, imidacloprid,
and thiamethoxam) following a mandate from the European Commission. The
reports consider the risks to bees from these insecticides and conclude
that more data is needed to update the current risk assessments. As the
EFSA makes clear in the reports, the assessments were carried out using
existing regulatory data against new requirements which have yet to be
agreed, and which reflect developments in regulatory science. Our
initial view is therefore that the conclusions are to be expected
(although we have raised concerns with the EFSA that these conclusions
are not accurately represented in their accompanying Press Release).
The EFSA reports will be considered by the European Commission who will
decide whether to make a proposal for further
regulation.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="1301303000455" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/text/130129w0003.htm#1301303000455"><B><Member PimsId="1771" UID="1301303002014" xid="375" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/text/130129w0003.htm#1301303002014">Steve

Benyon:</Member></B> Before any insecticide is authorised there is a
thorough assessment of its potential effects on human health, based on
a range of scientific tests. This assessment takes account of the
different circumstances in which people may be exposed to
pesticides—either by being in or near the treated area or by
eating treated food. Safety for people is established by a suitably
high margin between likely exposure and no effect doses in experimental
animals. Products are not authorised if the exposure estimates are
above the safe
levels.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301303000494" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/text/130129w0003.htm#1301303000494">Neonicotinoid

impacts of neonicotinoids on insects largely result from their strong
binding to nicotinic receptors. The data strongly suggest that the
binding of neonicotinoids to mammalian nicotinic receptors is much
weaker than to insect receptors. In addition, scientific studies show 
<?notus-xml column=761?>that neonicotinoids are not as potent in vertebrates
(including humans) as they are in insects. Although this does not mean
there are no effects in mammals, there is a large margin between doses
required to kill insects and doses of potential concern for
people.</hs_Para>

report made by the EU Commission on the impact of the legislation on
the welfare of animals during transport (Council Regulation (EC)

epidemiological assessments that if 5% of sheep farms from the midlands

malformed lambs with an in-flock prevalence of 10%, the costs to
industry are estimated to be around £1 million. From infection
that occurred in 2011, on-farm prevalence of malformations in lambing

are currently no import or export bans for the UK. This is not a
notifiable disease and as such trade bans are not appropriate. The
Commission has issued a statement to reinforce this. However, several
third country authorities have put additional requirements on exports
of live ruminant and ruminant products, excluding milk products, which
is having an impact on the export of
germplasm.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1301303000537" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130129/text/130129w0003.htm#1301303000537">At
first there were some third country impacts, but these have mainly been
resolved through bilateral agreements to provide some pre-export
testing. However, the UK only has a limited export market for live
cattle and sheep, so this is mainly impacting on the limited

woodland creation as an emissions abatement measure are typically in
the range £0 to £100 per tonne CO<Sub>2</Sub>e. However,
evaluating cost-effectiveness of woodland creation is highly complex
and these values may therefore not be directly comparable with those
for carbon capture and storage. For this reason, a contract has

woodland creation in the UK, fully consistent with Treasury guidance,

how the cost of compliance might be reduced through changes to the cost

re-offending from the start of a court order over a 12 month period and

so an offender may no longer be subject to a court order at the time of

information between the two Departments for all our recognised
