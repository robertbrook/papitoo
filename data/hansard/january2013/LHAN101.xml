the new exams in 2015 risk causing serious long-term damage to our

construction, and neglecting creative learning? Can he also confirm
that it is the Government’s intention to issue pupils who do not
pass their EBacc certificate with a certificate of attainment which, as
anyone with experience in the state sector knows, will have no value at
all with employers and universities? Finally, does he accept the

a little confusion about the stimulus to the system we have created
through the EBacc and a broad and balanced curriculum. I should like to
reassure the noble Baroness that the Government are determined to
ensure that all pupils study a broad and balanced curriculum so that
they have the cultural capital to be able to compete both in this
country and in the modern world. We have had to stimulate some
behaviour through the EBacc because all the international evidence we
have studied shows that successful international countries 
<?notus-xml column=1178?>include these core academic subjects, and that stimulus has been
extremely successful. Over the past two years, the proportion of pupils
taking the EBacc has risen from 23% to 49%, and for those schools with
a high element of free school meals, it has risen from 10% to 41%.
However, we will also be exhorting all schools to teach a broad and
balanced curriculum, as they are obliged to do and as Ofsted inspects

Bichard:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister agree that the
creative industries represent one of the most important sectors of the
British economy? However, is he aware of the acute concern across that
sector about the way the Government appear to undervalue the teaching
and learning of creative skills, not least in the proposals for the
EBacc? Further, could he use his considerable influence to persuade the
Secretary of State for Education just once to make a public speech that
recognises the importance of creative
skills<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T11:09:42"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Nash:</Member></B> The Government do recognise the importance of
creative skills. As I have said, we are keen for all pupils to have the
cultural capital that enables them to compete. As my old friend Sir
Peter Lampl at the Sutton Trust has pointed out, 7% of the population
of this country go to independent, private, fee-paying schools and get
44% of the top jobs. Some 4.9% go to grammar schools and get 27% of the
top jobs, while the rest, 88%, get less than 30% of the top jobs. In
order to enable our pupils to compete both in this country and
internationally, they need a broad curriculum and they must have that
cultural capital. However, I hear what the noble Lord says and I will
take these matters away for consideration.</hs_para>

Walmsley:</Member></B> Does my noble friend the Minister accept that
assessment only by examination at the end of the course discriminates
against girls and some pupils with particular disabilities, who find
that they can demonstrate their learning more effectively through
coursework? If there is some concern about cheating in coursework,
surely there is another way to deal with that problem, rather than just
disposing of coursework as an assessment

Nash:</Member></B> As well as seeking views through our public
consultation, we have also held focus discussions with a number of
disability and SEN expert groups and are reviewing a wide range of
views covering the proposals for all pupils. The assessment method
should be suitable for the knowledge in schools, and be fair and
practical. The noble Baroness is right to point out the potential for
unfairness with coursework but I know that many schools feel that
controlled assessment, which was introduced to combat parents doing
their children’s coursework for them, is burdensome and takes up
a substantial amount of time that could otherwise be used for
teaching.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000009">I
will consider the point the noble Baroness raised about girls. Although

that reply. Does he accept that, with one-third of disabled people
living in poverty and an estimated 42% fewer being eligible for
mobility support—many fearing that they will become prisoners in
their own homes—his admission that under the new regime some
disabled people will have their specially adapted vehicles taken away
from them or offered to them to buy has caused widespread disbelief and
considerable distress? Will he say how many repatriations will be
involved and at least ensure that those four words he has referred

“repeatedly” and “timely”—remain in

a really difficult area for people. It is difficult to understand and

people will need to be approved by the DWP. Autism is among a group of

very least, the change to 20 metres should have been clearly stated in
the consultation documents. The lack of consultation with disabled
people and all supporting evidence from experts in disability access as
to what distance enables practical mobility and participation mean that
there is a real risk that this issue will be open to judicial review.
Is the Minister willing to take that
risk?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000027"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Freud" PimsId="5439" UID="13012450000770" xid="2007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000770">Lord

great concern among disability organisations about the previous draft.
The concern was that only people in wheelchairs would qualify for the
higher rate—that was picked up by Parkinson’s UK, the
Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Disability Benefits Consortium and the
National AIDS Trust, among others. That is why the change was made. I
admit that I would have preferred there to have been more consultation
on the 20 metres, but there is no effective change in the number of
people receiving higher-rate mobility allowance because of this change.
I hope that noble Lords will accept my assurances on this. That change
has made it clearer and simpler to operate this measure; it has not
changed the numbers affected. Before we start reassessing people in
2015, we will have had a full independent review which will have gone

is probably the largest fleet of its type in the world. I fully support
the principle that the welfare state should help those most in need,
and government are actively implementing that principle, but we must
appreciate that uncertainty about the effect of these changes will 
<?notus-xml column=1182?>cause considerable worry and stress for many disabled people and their

has been spoken about today, there is concern among disabled people at
the recent change from 50 metres to 20 metres as the
distance specified in the regulations for higher-rate

The noble Baroness is right; it is two years since the start of the
revolution. Of course we have some concerns as to how the constitution
was adopted. Among other things, although the vote in the end may have
been over 60%, the turnout itself was quite low at just over 30%. We
also have some specific concerns about contentious elements within the
constitution but we are encouraged by the fact that there is now a
review process. Like the noble Baroness, I look forward to
parliamentary elections later this year.</hs_para>

strengthen civil society to be much more vocal about concerns over
forthcoming elections. We continue to engage with all authorities in
Egypt. The Foreign Secretary was there in September; the Minister

journey in regeneration. This journey began over 25 years ago and was
led by the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, who took the first tentative
steps in arresting east London’s decline by creating the London
Docklands Development Corporation and later encouraging the development
of the Canary Wharf financial district. Through his bold vision the

emerging in the lower Lea Valley. Many of us locally call it Water
City, and here I must declare an interest as chairman of the Water City

the O2. It takes in City Airport, which is growing fast, and the
accelerating global investment in the Royal Docks—which includes
the Abu Dhabi national exhibition and conference centre, the Siemens
Crystal and the Emirates Air Line cable car, the £3.7
billion of investment taking place in Canning Town and the business

scale of international investment in the lower Lea Valley is truly
staggering. Ten minutes on the Jubilee line will take you to the
Westfield shopping centre, which has had more than 48 million visitors

director of the LLDC, where we plan to build five new villages and
connect these communities into the surrounding area. Then, of course, a
short distance to the west, in Hackney, you have Tech City: a
significant growth area in modern technology whose tentacles are

of us locally call this colossus Water City because of the 6.5 miles of
river and canals that surround London Docklands and connect the many
pieces of this regeneration jigsaw. Water has driven

years. The time has come to capture the glorious history of east
London’s trading past and to build a new city fit for the
future, a city not defined by poverty and dependency, as in east
London’s recent past, but by human endeavour and entrepreneurial
spirit. We are in the moment: the biggest opportunity which we all must

those of us living and working in the lower Lea Valley, the big story
for us—barely noticed by the Olympic project—is the
entrepreneurial culture that is growing among local people as
communities embrace an enterprise culture in its many forms and move on
from a dependency culture that is so often driven by the public sector
institutions. As one example, when I arrived in east London 30 years
ago most charities were suspicious of business. Today, the Bromley by
Bow Centre, which I founded, has only 6% of its funding dependent on
the public sector; most of our relationships as a local community
organisation are with business. A part of this big story is the
practical working relationships developing between major businesses and
the social enterprise

how do we similarly turn the rhetoric of legacy into reality? What
needs to happen now to maximise this legacy opportunity and grasp the
moment? First<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T11:43:12"></hs_TimeCode>,
we must start with the people and the place, not with the policy or
strategy. The Olympics showcased what can be achieved when this latent
energy and talent is harnessed. In my experience, communities and
places often reinvent themselves organically from within, and the good
news is that the conditions are now right: many local leaders and
entrepreneurs are up for this journey in east London. There exists in
east London a real opportunity for innovation: to explore, for example,
on the first Olympic village what those key words in the Health and
Social Care Act “enterprise”, “innovation”
and “integration” might actually mean in practice. How do
we explore them, and how do we prevent the procurement rules preventing
us from doing innovation?</hs_para>

take the long-term view. Phase 2 of this 50-year regeneration journey
is just beginning, and we have at least 25 years of focused hard work
ahead of us. One of our problems in east London is the public sector
endlessly restructuring itself around those of us trying to build fully
engaged communities. We have too many good people coming and going in
the merry-go-round of public sector structures. The recently defunct
London Thames Gateway Development Corporation, for example, spent many
millions of pounds on policies, strategies and plans, but actually
built very little. We need to understand, as the noble Lord, Lord
Heseltine, describes in his excellent 
<?notus-xml column=1189?>report <I>No Stone Unturned</I>, that the energy and drive in local
communities does not come from Whitehall or necessarily from London
government but comes from those already living and working there. But
government needs to get behind these people and start showing active
and sustained support. The GLA says that there will be no money in
2015, and some people are privately murmuring, “Let’s
throw it all in the air!”. No. Let us stick with the project,
talk with the private sector and work it out. All our experience tells
us that we need consistent leadership in east London over the next

did so much to try and make this happen, but maybe my noble friend Lord

Brian Cox—I declare my interest—aims to connect science
education to health and business development on the edge of the park,

King of Bridgwater:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble
Lord, Lord Mawson, on introducing this debate and on the excellent
speech that he made in setting out his vision for what needs to happen
in the development of east London. Many of your Lordships know that few
people know more about that area, or have contributed a greater
personal commitment to it, than the noble Lord. I think that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T11:52:32"></hs_TimeCode> only thing
that he got wrong was the time. As he was speaking, I reflected on when
I first got involved. In 1979, 34, years ago, Michael Heseltine and I
flew over the dockland area. We looked down on 5,000 derelict acres,
which were a couple of miles from some of the most valuable real estate
in the world—the City of London—and made a great cry that
something must be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T11:52:18"></hs_TimeCode>. I had the
privilege of taking through the Local Government, Planning and Land Act
1980, which set up the London Docklands Development Corporation, out of
which flowed so much, including Canary
Wharf<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T11:52:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000079">I
must declare an interest. For the past 18 years, I have been involved
in the creation and establishment of ExCeL, which is now a world-class,
international convention and exhibition centre. Kindly, the noble Lord,
Lord Mawson, referred to it as one of the key growth elements in east
London. That is particularly satisfying because I agree very much with
what he said about government bodies and public bodies coming and
going. I am very proud that we built ExCeL. It was a private sector
venture, without any great government subsidy. Most big convention and
exhibition centres around the world are owned either by the city or the
government. They usually lose money and are a charge on the ratepayer.
I am very proud that ExCeL has established itself as a successful and
valuable addition to the economy of
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T11:53:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

was a great battle to get recognition for east London. When I first
talked about ExCeL, a lot of people thought that it would be somewhere
near Southend. There used to be a great bias in favour of
west London and the centre of London. In terms of the population and
its distribution, the centre of London has now moved: many noble Lords
will know that it used be at Hyde Park Corner, is now thought to be at
Tower Bridge and is steadily moving east. A lot of people thought that
it was rather inaccessible. One of the most valuable legacies of the
Olympics has been the recognition by so many people of how easy it now
is to get there. There was enormous investment by successive
Governments, both the present and previous, in improving communications
in east London.</hs_para>

is now considered to be probably one of the best connected major venues
in the world in terms of its communications given the proximity of the
DLR, the Jubilee line and the City airport, not forgetting one of the
most amazing attractive new ventures comprising the Emirates AirLine:
that is, the cable car which runs from the O2 to ExCeL. I recommend it
to any of your Lordships who have not been on it. I took my grandson on
it during the Olympics and he insisted on going on it three times as he
found it so enjoyable. However, the area has battled to get
recognition. In this respect the Olympic legacy to which the noble Lord
referred is very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T11:55:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

million people visited ExCeL. The figure for the Olympic Park is even
more substantial. In 2012, 5 million people visited ExCeL. An important
element of these major success stories in east London is that we have
made people recognise how accessible the area is and the quality of the
facilities that now exist there. The area will create enormous economic
benefit for London and considerable economic benefit for the United
Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T11:56:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000083">ExCeL
is now in the business of trying to attract major international
conventions. London, with all its amazing attractions and facilities,
was ranked 20th in the world in market share of big international
conventions. I am proud to say that, given the number of bookings taken
at ExCeL, we have already moved up to seventh in the world ranking.
Given the quality of the other facilities that London offers, I cannot
believe that it will not end up in the top four, with all the benefit
that that would bring. ExCeL generates £1.8 billion worth of
economic benefit a year. A recent PwC report said that 32,000 jobs are
derived directly or indirectly from activities at ExCeL. We have
latched on to an important industry in the world today: that is,
hospitality and tourism. It is a major employer in all sorts of
different activities and a major boost for the economies of those
countries that can develop it. It offers considerable employment at a
time of obvious concern about employment opportunities. I am not
talking just about ExCeL but the whole tourism and hospitality industry
in which the United Kingdom needs to have a

regards the Olympic legacy, one of the things that people around the
world noted was not just the quality of the facilities at the Olympics
but the niceness of the people involved in them. The Games makers and
the Games ambassadors did a wonderful job for London and for Britain.
Until I came to prepare my speech, I did not realise that 40% of
London’s population were born overseas. Therefore, whatever
country you come from, you will probably find a few of your fellow
countrymen in London willing to welcome you to the city, and that was
the case with the Games. Indeed, the Games makers were almost as
important as the quality of the facilities. That is one of the legacies
that will undoubtedly
survive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T11:58:28"></hs_TimeCode> and I
hope that other parts of the country recognise
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T11:59:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000085">The
noble Lord, Lord Mawson, and I have worked together closely in a number
of areas, and we know how good the co-operation is between the
different bodies—Newham council, the City airport, Westfield,
Canary Wharf, Transport for London and the DLR. We know the people
involved in those bodies and are on Christian name terms with one
another. This legacy is coming together for the benefit of the people
of east London and London as a whole. It is developing and has reached
a critical mass. As the noble Lord said, it will take many years to go
forward but the only way is up. I congratulate him on the contribution

opportunity that the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, has offered the House to
reflect on the legacy of the Olympics. Like the noble Lord, Lord 
<?notus-xml column=1193?>King of Bridgwater, I pay tribute to his extraordinary role, not only
over the past 20 years but in the way he has seized the opportunities
that the Olympics presented to go forward. That was clear in his
excellent speech. He has agreed that I can extend the terminology of
the debate very slightly to talk about our physical and cultural
heritage, but I can also reflect on what he has said in that context
about regeneration and the way in which that heritage not only formed
some of the most powerful images of the Olympics but helped to show
some of the opportunities available to
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:00:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000088">The
Olympic vision gave essentially and crucially a defining and dynamic
role to our heritage. I declare an interest as the chair of English
Heritage. I was very impressed by the way in which the confidence in
our culture, our creativity and our communities came across in those
images and what they said to the rest of the world, not least in terms
of community engagement. I start with the fabulous opening ceremony,
which depicted the extraordinary sweep of history from ancient
earthworks to the rural and pastoral scene, to the Industrial
Revolution and to the National Health Service. It presented
breathtaking imagery, which told us who we are, who we think we are and
where we have come from. What I found most stirring was the dramatic
demonstration that our present brilliance in the two critical creative
industries of design and engineering, in which we have a global lead,
are rooted in the genius of the Industrial Revolution, stretching from
Brunel to Sir Tim Berners-Lee. We witnessed the extraordinary forging
of the rings from the furnaces of the past and the creation of a
beautiful, exemplary democratic torch, an illustration that our legacy
must lie in our future with intensive investment in innovation, design
and engineering, because that is what we are very good
at<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:01:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000089">The
point is that we know how to do it. You have only to walk through St
Pancras these days and look at the way in which the Kings Cross quarter
is developing to see the extraordinary fusion of three centuries of
engineering and architectural genius and the incorporation of the old
and the new. We must think not only of London but of the images
presented of the rest of the country. They include the mills and
weaving sheds; the fragile and rather scarce industrial memories, which
are becoming the powerhouses of the future; communities engaged in
setting up local technical universities; vibrant arts centres;
community enterprise; and high-tech industries. We hear no longer the
clacking of the looms but the whizzing and whirring of brains in
these

aspect of our community legacy will be to ensure that our heritage is
seen as something that serves the future—something to be picked
up confidently at local and community levels as part of regeneration
and industrial policy, as it is already doing in the East End. Indeed,
English Heritage invested £1 million in one project, High Street
2012, which saw the restoration of buildings along Mile End Road and
new listings along the route, involving children in identifying the
most important buildings and drawing them, showing which
meant the most to them in their community. That is an excellent legacy
for the protection of the future</hs_para>

all, the Olympics connected with the reality of who we are and the
diversity of our community—a country used to living in the light
and shade of history. Everywhere people saw where they lived in a new
light as they saw their reflection in the torch as it went through,
whether it was at Stonehenge or in our medieval and historic towns. Who
will forget the images of London, the three-day eventing in Greenwich
Park or beach volleyball on Horse Guards Parade?
Apart<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:03:32"></hs_TimeCode> from the
sheer pride in place— which is beyond price—the community
benefits in other ways. First, it benefits, I hope, in the way in which
heritage is viewed, valued and will be protected in the future. As the
noble Lord, Lord King, said, we have seen the extraordinary phenomenon
of joyful volunteerism, which I think, like measles, will spread to
places that it may not yet have reached. I know that English Heritage
will be taking advantage of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000092">I turn
specifically to the Cultural Olympiad and one of the projects in which
English Heritage was involved, Discovering Places, a grass-roots
campaign of live events, performances, online blogs and social media
bringing together more than 250,000 people in this country to discover
their local built and historic environments. These were pioneering
partnerships. Of course, arts and heritage go together. There is no
contest; it is not new. But the Cultural Olympiad broke down some of
the barriers between culture, the arts, heritage and technologies. It
encouraged risk, shoved out the boundaries and engaged on an innovative
scale. It showed that there are innovative ways of bringing arts and
heritage together in the physical framework, such as, for example,
setting fire to Stonehenge. That actually worked all right. I could
give many examples, but what I am trying to say is that the Olympics
and Paralympics gave us a unique opportunity to showcase the monuments,
the buildings and the beautiful places that are our legacy. That legacy
would not have existed if our predecessors had not recognised that it
was necessary to protect it. Part of the legacy should be to ensure
that we understand and care for it, and protect it more effectively, so
that it can serve the future more

shall end by advising noble Lords that 2013 may be the morning after
the party but for our cultural heritage it is the beginning of the
party, as we celebrate in 2013 the centenary of the Ancient Monuments
Act, introduced in this House by a Private Member’s Bill. The
Act recognised for the first time that there are some physical remains
of the nation’s history that are so special and so significant
that only the nation itself can look after them properly to secure
their survival and lay the foundations for a world class heritage
protection system. That collection of 850 monuments all over Britain,
cared for by the leading cultural institutions—English Heritage,
Cadw and Historic Scotland—tell the story of the nation. This
year we will be telling the story of the nation in that way, and I hope
that noble Lords will enjoy it and join us in doing it. We are
celebrating what our predecessors achieved, and we will be inviting
those communities to step further into history. One of my hopes is that
there will be increasing commitment in local communities to looking
after their local heritage. Above all, I want that legacy and the
Olympics this year, which made it 
<?notus-xml column=1195?>so much more plausible, to show that we are neither tied to the past nor
indifferent to it. We are very comfortable in making the old serve the
new. Our heritage is not static; it is not separate from life but
dynamic. It is something that we are not afraid to change. It is our
competitive edge and we should build on it. That is something that we

modern Olympic movement was created by Pierre de Coubertin, an amateur
boxer, but also a part-time poet. The cornerstone to his vision in
reviving the Olympics was to bring sport and culture together in one
great festival. That, of course, was precisely what London did in 2012.
Its Cultural Olympiad was a triumph, and here I pay tribute to the
noble Lord, Lord Hall of Birkenhead, who so brilliantly chaired the
Cultural Olympiad board, Ruth Mackenzie, director of the Cultural
Olympiad and Dame Tessa Jowell who was so pivotal in its original

the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, I refer back to Danny Boyle’s
opening ceremony—a beautiful, brilliant spectacular. It was
complex, self-deprecating in its narrative, although not in its
conception and execution, and deeply humorous. As well as a celebration
of the entity that is the United Kingdom this was a showcase for our
creativity and for our creative industries. Take James Bond, which is,
first, the product of writer Ian Fleming; then of film makers, actors,
special effects creators, costume and set designers, and those who make
the costumes and sets. And finally, in Boyle’s dazzling tangle
of fiction and fact, the fictional spy gets to meet the factual Queen
and her
corgis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000097">The
ceremony also celebrated music, television and art, and how art and
design come together in such wonderful creations as Thomas
Heatherwick’s cauldron and, centre stage, literally, Tim
Berners-Lee, the British creator of the world wide web. It was shot
through with recognition of our creative accomplishments—and it
was a huge accomplishment in its very
self.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000098">This
debate invites us to take note of the role of communities. The Cultural
Olympiad pledged to encompass thousands of local and regional events as
part of our nationwide celebration—and it did. Martin
Creed’s “Any Bell. Anyone. Anywhere.” was one of
the Olympiad’s biggest community projects. At 8.12 pm on 27
July, almost 3 million people across the UK rang bells to celebrate the
first day of the Games. They included individuals, communities and
organisations; enthusiastic children; change-ringing experts; Big Ben;
and the bells of the UK Parliaments and of British embassies across the
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000099">In all,
621 productions and projects resulted in 13,000 performances and events
at 1,270 venues across the UK. There was street art and high art, hip
hop and ballet. Everywhere, new audiences were introduced to the arts.
LOCOG estimates that 19 million people participated in the Cultural
Olympiad, and that 10 million people have been inspired to
continue to take part in 
<?notus-xml column=1196?>cultural activity. We are here to talk about legacy, and we must ensure
that these people continue to do this. We must ensure that the fact
that the strongest interest in the Olympiad came from younger audiences
and ethnic minorities is not lost but built upon. We must ensure that
the innovative new partnerships that creators forged online, and at
local, regional and national level,
continue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000100">We
on these Benches welcome the Arts Council’s initiative of a

the setting up of a creative people and places fund that will focus
investment on parts of the country where people’s involvement in
the arts is significantly below average. However, the most important
thing is that we continue to create the creators. In this area we face
not a jobs problem but a skills problem. The <I>Next Gen.</I> report

skills<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>. The good
news is that the coalition Government listened. A draft programme of
study for ICT, which from 2014 will include a computer programming

graduates to train as computer science

Henley’s report on cultural education is another crucial element
in delivering a lasting creative legacy. The Secretary of State for
Education greeted the Henley review with huge enthusiasm. The
government response to the review, published last February, stated that
a national plan for cultural education would follow immediately. The
last time I asked when this would happen—because despite the
“immediately”, it still has not—I was told that it
would be at the beginning of this year. Will the Minister assure me
that this is still the case and therefore that publication is
imminent?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000102">There

levels of physical activity and what elite sport is going to look like
in the 1,289 days to the Olympics and 1,322 days to the Paralympics in
Rio. That is okay. Through the Games, I was introduced to a much wider
constituency of people. I found that people from culture were not

different. We must continue this

park cannot be an oasis that isolates or displaces the local community.
In the lead-up to the Games, much time and thought was given to the

an athlete, I moved in and out of cities, often not spending much time

village and media centre a year before the Games for $264 million but
the Paralympics had a different village, as there was concern that
people would not want to live where all those disabled people had been.
However, they did sell the village on. Many disabled people at that
time were begging on the streets, and the Games gave them the
opportunity to change their lives. It was sad, however, that many of
the Paralympians who we saw compete were not able to carry on their

themselves, but if you looked carefully you could see
“knitteds”. Many knitted Games makers were proudly being

evidence which lends great credence to what he has said to us

the time that is available, I want to concentrate on only one lesson.
That does not mean the others are not important but colleagues have
already addressed them. I want to look at that part of the Motion which
refers to lessons that can be learnt more broadly and concentrate on
only one. We can talk about a lasting legacy and occasionally get the
feeling that the Government, the public or local government have
the responsibility for it. It is none of these. Trust the
people. They have the ideas and the aspirations, and in the east end of
London they have the multicultural base on which to build and
develop.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000126" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000126">This
is a good forum in which to say that it is a mistake to believe that
lasting legacy is solely or, indeed, overwhelmingly guaranteed by the
spending of public money. It is much more important than the spending
of public money. The lesson I would like to draw from the Games as a
foundation for lasting legacy is that which we have learnt from my
noble friend Lord Coe and the then Mr Deighton. It is the lesson of
leadership. We rightly celebrate the athletes and para-athletes and we
rightly celebrate those who worked on the ground to make the Games an
enormous and impressive spectacle and such a happy occasion. But there
needed to be firm leadership and a broad-based understanding of what
constitutes leadership, in that it is not all in the public sector or
the private sector. It is a sensitive combination for the common good.
That leadership is frequently not as available in our society as many
of us would like, so I want to thank the people who had the
responsibility for organising and delivering the Games on time and on
budget, neither of which is inevitably the consequence of activities in
our
nation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:26:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Ministers have a role to play in all this, but it is not the role of
providing exclusive leadership. The noble Lord, Lord Mawson, is perhaps
the most sterling example of the fact that you do not have to look to
Government to lead renaissance and change. I would like to suggest that
the role Ministers should play is that of—if I may use a rather
inelegant colloquialism—banging heads together. It is to say to
people, “Your mindset is wrong. Your locality cannot move
forward unless you address the mindset”. Those who are involved
locally find it hard to do that, so they need guidance from outside.
Sometimes Ministers need to move in to resolve turf wars which hold up
progress on the ground. Sometimes they need to move in and say,
“I understand your focus on the detail, but actually the bigger
picture is this, and this is what we should be doing”. Sometimes
Ministers need to say that the relationship between Government, local
government and the private sector is simply not good enough and needs
to be changed.</hs_para>

we have learnt from the Olympics is that change creates challenges. I
would say to Ministers and to my noble friend: in case you think there
is nothing for you to do, take all of your colleagues down to
Bromley-by-Bow and let them see what has emerged from virtually
nothing. It is one of the most 
<?notus-xml column=1201?>impressive displays of social entrepreneurship anywhere. We are focusing
on the European Union these days and it is more impressive than
anywhere in the Union. The question to be asked is this. What
head-banging needs to be done to enable Bromley-by-Bow to move even
further ahead and to see that being replicated across the whole of the
Lower Lea Valley? Stratford station is sitting there. Perhaps my noble
friend would like to encourage one or two of his colleagues to ensure
that the station is actually used, and used properly. I declare an

the Channel Tunnel and the building of Stratford

how the Olympic stadium might be used in the future. It might get tied
in to football. It ought to have some tie-in to athletics, and maybe a

Doocey:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord
Mawson, for introducing this debate. I begin by declaring that I was
heavily involved in monitoring the delivery of the 2012 Games on behalf
of the London Assembly. Throughout that time, my main concern was the
Olympic legacy. The bid promised that,</hs_para>
<hs_quotefo UID="13012450000658" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000658">“the most
enduring legacy of the Olympics will be the regeneration of an entire
community for the direct benefit of everyone who lives
there”.</hs_quotefo>
<hs_parafo UID="13012450000596" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000596">We must do everything
possible to ensure that that promise is kept. However, this
regeneration will not happen by itself. It requires proper planning and
execution. It also requires some government funding. Without this, we
will be at the mercy of private
developers.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13012450000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000132">The
focus of the legacy plans is the Olympic Park, the lower Lea Valley and
the surrounding communities, which are set to become an important area
for business investment. The regeneration of this area provides an
opportunity for innovation and engagement with local people, but the
Government must help rather than hinder this process. I say this
because, whenever a big idea or large-scale scheme is being launched,
all tiers of government have a tendency to reinvent the wheel by
setting up a new organisation to deliver it. Time and again, we end up
with cumbersome bureaucracy and fail to use the expertise of people on
the ground. Ministers and the Mayor of London should not get involved
in the detail but should set out a clear vision and then leave the
implementation to experienced people who understand the needs of local
communities and businesses.</hs_para>

principle in practice is the work of the Lee Valley Regional Park
Authority, which owns and operates three Olympic venues: the White
Water Centre, the VeloPark and the Hockey and Tennis Centre. The
authority uses a tried and 
<?notus-xml column=1202?>tested business model for sports venues, which allows it to make profits
while remaining focused on the needs of local communities. This
business model encourages the widest possible range of visitors,
including both grass-roots and elite use. It is a very innovative
authority. When it won the bid to build the White Water Centre for the
Olympics, it decided also to build an easier course for the general
public. This has become a huge commercial, sporting and social success,
with visitor numbers and income more than double the original
estimates. The authority’s programme for the VeloPark will
include a mix of first-timers, schools, major events, leagues, races
and sessions for a variety of groups: the over-50s, disabled people and
women-only activities, because women are greatly underrepresented in
cycling
activity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000134">I
have highlighted the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority because it
illustrates very well what can be achieved when government sets out a
broad strategy and then leaves it to people who know what they are
doing to get on with it. This principle should be applied to other
legacy
projects.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000135" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000135">However,
there are real challenges. The work done by the Arts Council in
developing an arts and cultural legacy is a good example. Some really
excellent arts projects were delivered in the run-up to and during the
Olympics but, sadly, very little of this was designed to appeal to
people living in disadvantaged communities, who are seriously
underrepresented in the arts. This is largely because the Arts Council
is relying on the usual partners instead of working with people on the
ground who understand the kinds of activities that appeal to local
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000136" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000136">The
problem is not achieving a legacy but achieving the right kind of
legacy. The transformation of the Olympic Park is well under way. But
in the present tough economic climate, some major challenges must be
addressed to ensure that local people get the range of homes, jobs and
business opportunities they were promised. The provision of the right
number and type of affordable homes, for example, requires some very
difficult decisions by the Government and the Mayor of London. It is
essential to maximise the number of affordable homes and to invest in
high-quality schools and health facilities for the residents, but these
needs will have to be balanced against the availability of
grants and the requirement to repay to the National Lottery the funds
generated from Olympic Park land
sales.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000137" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000137">I
entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, that we need
international trains to stop at Stratford, and we also need a new
Thames crossing in east London. The Government must invest in local
infrastructure to boost private sector investment in the area. Most
importantly, we need government at all levels to lay out a clear and
cohesive vision, to stick to that plan and to allow experienced people
on the ground to deliver it without undue interference. This will give
the private sector the confidence to invest. It will also invigorate
the greatest resource in the area: the local people and communities
whose entrepreneurial energy has already driven so much change in
east
London.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000138" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000138">William

we took seriously enough the commitment to deliver a multilingual

contention is that if, as Olympic hosts, we had made more connections
between the official language services during the Games and language
teaching in schools, we could have matched young people’s
enthusiasm for the Games with an injection of new enthusiasm for
learning foreign languages, and perhaps even seen an increase in the
number of teenagers sticking with languages after the age of
14.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012450000141" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000141">This is
such an important legacy issue because the lack of language skills in
the UK is currently damaging our economy and competitiveness. The
employability and social mobility of our young people is seriously
limited as they compete for jobs in a global labour market. Employers
are recruiting from overseas because neither school-leavers nor
graduates from the UK have the language skills, and the cultural
knowledge that goes with them, to meet the needs of business. Robust
evidence shows that lack of language skills is a barrier to export
growth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000142" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000142">Of
course, the irony is that London is the most multilingual city in the
UK and Newham is the UK’s most multilingual borough. Dozens of
local schoolchildren could have easily spotted the embarrassing mistake
on the sign at the entrance to the Olympic Park, which said
“Welcome to London” in various languages but the Arabic
section was written back to front. This faux pas in an otherwise hugely
successful international event led to Britain’s inability to
cope with foreign languages being ridiculed not only in our own media

find out what else was being done and whether community resources were
being tapped. I was told that the chief interpreter and the head of
language services for the Games were too busy to meet the all-party

showcase London as a richly multilingual venue, even though we know
that this is a major factor for global companies deciding where to
locate their headquarters. More than 200 languages are spoken by
schoolchildren in London, yet most of their languages are not formally

first point at which I really had doubts about the process of doing
this, but knew that the challenge was there, was at a dinner I was
asked to many years ago, which first brought people from the arts world
to speak to people from the sports world, at the start of the planning.
A few parliamentarians were there as well. As the discussion got going,
after people had swapped pleasantries during the meal itself, I felt
that I was looking at a sort of peace conference between the Martians
and the Venusians, where they were talking together for the first time.
The look of total blank astonishment when it was actually suggested
that they might have matters in common was quite comical. However, it
was also ridiculous, because they do have very similar
attitudes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000152" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000152">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:49:45"></hs_TimeCode>

exactly the same dynamic going on. The fact that they were brought
together to create one thing that worked well is one of the broad

Games have shown us how to bring these two together. They have also
probably shown us the limitations of this at the moment. The Cultural
Olympiad was very important, because something other than just the
Olympics had to bring people in. Effectively, I felt that the Cultural
Olympiad was a little like a Christmas present: it was that very
important, enticing bit around the outside—the
wrapping—that made it look good and gave you the buzz and
excitement beforehand. The fact that there was something going on was
very important: the Olympics were happening and there was something
coming. That was so important to the general feel of the Games for such
a long time. However, it was not the Olympics themselves. The hard core
was the sport. If we can take that model, for instance, when sport
provides some wrapping for a cultural event, we will at least have

However, unless it goes beyond saying, “Wasn’t it
great?”, which we have all done and which I did when I saw them,
you have failed to work on the initial steps that have been taken here.
We learnt to do it in the planning. The political parties had a common
goal in the preparation 
<?notus-xml column=1206?>and planning—or rather they learnt and then continued to remember
that they had a common goal—which is why the bid was successful
and why we were able to take it forward without the normal position in
politics of simply opposing and backing, to make sure we had something
coherent in the planning stage. That is what allowed us to win in
Paris.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000155" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000155">Unless<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:49:45"></hs_TimeCode>

something here. We gained something very important: the chance to say
that it is not just somebody’s—ours or yours—but
co-operation at various levels. Learning to buy in to something that
you do not have control of is probably one of the signs of growing up.

prompting this insightful and multifaceted debate. Every aspect of the
2012 Olympics and Paralympics was a triumph and a tremendous credit to
all who led those fine ventures from beginning to end, not least in our
House and not least the noble Lord, Lord Hall, who is with us today.
The bid itself was hard won—but well won. The gigantic
infrastructure and arena construction programme was a model of
successful implementation. Once the Games started, the outstanding
achievements of our Olympians and Paralympians were a testament to not
only individual talent, application and determination but, as we know,
to skilful investment choices, to the professionalism of the coaching
and to the rigour of the performance
management.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000157">The
opening and closing events were sublime; Danny Boyle’s opening
ceremony was his masterpiece, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Bonham-Carter, eloquently expressed earlier. As an event, it was
audacious and deeply British. It captured our history and the
transition from a picture-postcard, pastoral Britain to the very
crucible of the Industrial Revolution. It reminded the world of the
sports of what we have invented and of our writing tradition, from
Shakespeare to James Bond to Harry Potter. It conveyed Britain’s
unsurpassed contribution to modern popular
music.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000158" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000158">The
opening ceremony held some delicious surprises and two of the best
jokes ever, starring Rowan Atkinson and, unforgettably, Her Majesty the
Queen. The stage management of the event, with a cast of thousands, was
awesome and effortlessly smooth. The design, whether the amazing,
inflating industrial chimneys or the use of the lighting tablets, was
spellbinding, producing, as the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, said
earlier, breathtaking imagery. All in all, as I said, it was a
triumph.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000159">One
part of the overall legacy was that these Olympics defined all that is
best in Britain at this moment in time; and they bound us all together,
unashamedly proud of our Britishness. This very British staging of the
Olympics also had, for me, some unexpected consequences. On holiday in
Italy a few weeks after the Games, I was struck by the sight of
innumerable 
<?notus-xml column=1207?>young Italian men and woman wearing union jack T-shirts. In Sri Lanka
recently, I noted exactly the same. In Paris in the autumn, wandering
along the Boulevard Saint-Germain, I spied in the window of an upscale
shoe shop an array of vastly expensive velvet slippers—not my
kind of thing particularly—one pair of which had a beautifully
stitched union jack as its main motif. Surprised and curious—I
used to be a journalist—I went in and inquired of the manager
whether there was any demand for such ostentatiously British wares
among the citizens of Paris. He told me, and he insisted on this, that
it was by far the hottest-selling item in his shop and that all the
buyers were French. President de Gaulle, of whom I have just read an
excellent biography, will be turning in his
grave.</hs_para>

weeks ago, I happened to have lunch with a group of young Chinese
journalists who volunteered, unprompted, how much they had enjoyed the
opening ceremony—I promise that I did not prompt them in any
way. One young woman journalist giggled and observed, “You
British, you are gentlemen. And you are funny”. I thought that
that was not a bad epitaph. She paused, then declaimed roundly,
“Mr Bean!”. At which point, the whole table
laughed uproariously, all remembering Mr Bean’s hilariously
disruptive, and wholly unexpected, appearance as a London Symphony
Orchestra keyboardist during the opening ceremony. We can surmise that
every aspect of the Olympics and, above all, its opening, was a
powerful statement about Britishness, not just for us but for the rest
of the world, and that this statement will bring the United Kingdom
many benefits in multiple
spheres.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000161" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000161">One
lesson that I take away from it all is that our extraordinary success
as a country in creating and funding national institutions such as the
Arts Council, our art schools or the BBC, which husband and nurture our
most creative and innovative talents, has a payback well beyond the
edification of our citizens. Another lesson is that, with both a
challenge and a deadline on the one hand and a governance structure on
the other that brings together and unites the political parties, we can
be creative, rigorous and disciplined, and achieve extraordinary
things.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000162" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000162">What a
contrast there was between the dizzy heights of the Olympics and the
Paralympics that we all remember so well—the unity that we all
experienced—and the immediate gloom of a prolonged economic
crisis, in some part of our own making, and of a decaying national
infrastructure. What a contrast, too, with a reminder of our inability
to develop a fit-for-purpose national air hub, one of our main economic
lifelines to the rest of the world. The Olympics and the Paralympics
showed that if we can find effective ways to combine and assemble our
best talents, and if we can set aside our poisonous and disputatious
political culture, we truly can as a nation achieve absolutely anything
that we set out to
do.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13012450000699" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000699"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:55:40"></hs_TimeCode></I>12.55

Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to mention
the green legacy of the Games. The big space of the legacy park in east
London presents us with an opportunity to create a green lung for that
area. It could be a place where urban wildlife thrives 
<?notus-xml column=1208?>and an outdoor classroom for many of the schools in the area. I hope
that woven into the design will be the spaces, and even the messy
areas, that wildlife needs—for example, along the edges and on
the riverbank—and the sort of meadows that the London Wildlife
Trust has developed so well. The trust’s membership demonstrates
that just as many people who are interested in all these things live in
that part of London as anywhere else. In fact, urban wildlife can be
more thrilling than rural wildlife because it is often in much greater
proximity to us, so we can see it better—indeed, going back to
Lambeth the other night, I met a fox not a half a road-width away and
it was quite
exciting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:56:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000164" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000164">The
green legacy is important, but I want to talk about one particular
aspect of it—one particular community that had to make a big
sacrifice for the Olympic park and one very special space that was
lost. I shall say why the promises that were made when that sacrifice
happened need to be kept. The space that I am talking about is the
Manor Garden allotments that used to be beside the River Lea. The land
was given before the First World War by Major Arthur Villiers, who
bequeathed it for use in perpetuity by East End families, whom he saw
as being in great need of allotment space because their diet was so
poor. In the Second World War, the allotments became a model for the
grow-your-own Dig for Victory campaign. There was some hope at the
beginning of the development of the park that perhaps the allotments
could be kept, with their 100 year-old apple trees and fig trees, as a
model of Englishness—because allotments have a lot to do with
what Britishness is. The community that ran the allotments, the Manor
Gardening Society, was a very good model of community, being mixed in
age, background and ethnicity, but it was brought together by a common
interest in growing food. However, the difficulties in keeping the
allotments where they were were considered too great and they were
relocated temporarily but with a crucial promise that, when the
compulsory purchase order was granted, they would be given a space in
the legacy park that was equivalent both in size and quality once the
Games were
over<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:58:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000165" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000165">Now
we are into that period of looking at the legacy. The space that has
been offered is split between two different sites. Although the area is
exactly equivalent in size to the former allotments, it does not have
any of those margins around the edge of the river bank. In theory, this
is more provision than the society originally had, but that is only if
one counts the actual allotment space and not the surrounding wild land
verging on the plots. It is that combination of both allotment land and
land for wildlife that can create symbiotic biodiversity, meaning that
pollination takes place, that people are concerned about the wildlife
and that you can create a very living green lung. We need to ensure
that. I hope that the members of the corporation who are here today
will take this back and think about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T12:59:56"></hs_TimeCode>. The Manor
Gardening Society has struggled on through its relocation. It has been
difficult. Some members gave up because they could not travel as far as
their temporary plots. However, its waiting list has
grown.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000166" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000166">That
brings me to another issue that needs to be solved. The offer of
replacement allotments now appears to be only to individual plot
holders, not to the society as a whole. The society is the embodiment
of a particular 
<?notus-xml column=1209?>community interested in growing. It would be a shame if as vibrant and
historic a community as the Manor Gardening Society did not have its
rightful place in the park. I have talked to Mr Dennis Hone about that,
and he was kind enough to write back to me. He
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13012450000634" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000634">“The

the one hand, the LLDC agrees that the society has a role to play and
has extended the community space available but, on the other, it wants
to deal only with individual plot holders. That may seem a detail but
given the effort across London, from bodies such as the London Food
Board under the terrific chairmanship of Rosie Boycott, that has gone
into spaces where Londoners can grow food, and considering the effort
that the Department for Education is putting into the Food for Life
initiative so that schoolchildren understand about growing food, that
detail must be got right for the legacy of the park. If we are
interested in children having an all-round healthy lifestyle and in
tackling issues such as obesity, this detail is extremely
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:02:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_24_PT_1/6C25A23513B0435695667D7F5DB8C49765AF6E48" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 January 2013">Thursday,

also declare interests, as I leave the Royal Opera House and head

Olympiad board. I should point out that the Cultural Olympiad board has

as has already been mentioned, one of the most striking aspects of the
London 2012 festival was the level of participation. At every event,
from the spectacular Fire Garden at Stonehenge to the UK’s
biggest celebration of dance, the Big Dance to Unlimited, I saw how
people of all ages and backgrounds seized the chance to be part of
something creative, ambitious and big. We put events outside and in
public places, and the audiences, large and diverse, found them. We
wanted free events, and it paid off: 19.8 million people took part; 80%
came for free.</hs_para>

overall, 38% of those taking part were under the age of 24. This to my
mind shows the immense appetite for culture among the young. One of the
legacies must be to secure future opportunities for participation in
culture for both young people and those who commonly feel excluded from
the
arts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000170">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T13:04:15"></hs_TimeCode>
festival also used the fact of the Games to highlight how good we are
at arts and culture. About 40,000 journalists were in the UK to cover
the Games, which meant that we could secure publicity for arts and
cultural organisations both here and across the world. For example, the
Cultural Olympiad programme 
<?notus-xml column=1210?>in the West Midlands alone secured media valued at £11 million.
That underlined the huge value of linking large-scale events to the
arts and the importance of linking into similar nationwide events in
the future, such as the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. By the way, the
arts also need to work in close collaboration with agencies such as
VisitBritain, building the importance of the arts and culture in
tourism.</hs_para>

Britain saw something that it liked about itself during the summer and
during the festival. The world saw the strength of our arts and culture
and why Britain is such a fantastic place to visit. However, as we all
know, the artists and leaders who made it possible, such as Stephen
Daldry, Danny Boyle, and many others came originally from the
subsidised sector. Indeed, the festival could not have happened without
the commitment of the publicly funded organisations—museums,
theatres, galleries, opera houses, concert halls, and so on. Their
financial strength over a long period gave them the security to create
the ambitious commissions that we saw in the festival. Stable
investment in the arts must be sustained if we are to maintain that
legacy. With every £1 of public subsidy for the arts generating
£4 of earned income, it also makes financial sense to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000172" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000172">To my
mind, the festival underlined the strength and economic value of our
cultural industries and the importance of nurturing creative talents in
future generations. I am still really impressed by the way that the
Tate, working with CBBC and the animators Aardman—the people who
produced Wallace and Gromit—offered 34,000 children the chance
to learn how to animate and create a film, “The Itch of the
Golden Nit”. The film has already won a children’s BAFTA
and a place in the <I>Guinness Book of Records</I> for the largest
creative team ever. I guess that we will have to wait 20 years to judge
its true success: to find out how many lives we changed and how many
new animators and filmmakers the project
created.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000173" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000173">I
know that the House has recently debated the EBacc, but I briefly add
my view. The arts must remain at the heart of the national curriculum
to allow all children, regardless of their background, the chance to
develop their creative talents and contribute in future to our
world-leading arts and creative industries. One day, we will look to a
new generation to create an event of a magnitude to rival London 2012.
Let us give them the skills to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000174" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000174">The
Cultural Olympiad also gave us a chance to show the value of a creative
education in helping young people to find jobs. Inspired by the work
that we have been doing at the Royal Opera House, where 1% of employees
are apprentices, the festival offered unemployed young people in the
host boroughs apprenticeships in the arts. Forty per cent of the
participants had secured a job by the time the scheme ended. That is
why the Arts Council decided to fund a comparable, national creative
employment programme. That alone could be an enormous legacy of the
Cultural Olympiad, and one that demonstrates how much we achieve by
investing in the creative talents of children and young
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000175" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000175">The
festival also highlighted something key about the role of the BBC and
the media more broadly. From the beginning, it was vital that the BBC,
as a 
<?notus-xml column=1211?>public broadcaster, was at the heart of the Cultural Olympiad. It
delivered collaborations and coverage of exceptional scale and quality.
It built, for example, on the World Shakespeare Festival, which was an
extraordinary achievement, to create its largest ever education
project. In the Radio 1 Big Weekend, it gave young people from Hackney
and the East End the chance to work with their musical heroes and learn
production and backstage skills. By the way, as I found out, it was a
fantastic, exhilarating
weekend.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000176" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000176">The
Cultural Olympiad showed how the BBC, working with cultural
organisations, world-class artists and public and private funders can
teach creative skills and transform the life chances of young people.
It also underlined how important the media—in particular the
BBC—are in fuelling public appetite for the
arts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000177" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000177">One
amazing example of that from last summer was The Space. This digital
platform, funded jointly by the Arts Council and the BBC, gives people
wherever they are a chance to experience the arts directly online. You
could enjoy a private view of the Goldsmith College degree show or
hear, if you wanted to, the Stockhausen helicopter string quartet as it
played above Birmingham. There were many other rich, amazing events. It
is clear to me that The Space and other digital innovations like it
have immense potential for promoting the arts and giving people direct
access to artists, performances and art. It is a profoundly important
development, which comes out of the cultural

Lord Addington, said by remembering that, as we proved in that summer,
if we bring everyone together—whether it is through sports,

so well captured in the book of photographs that many of us have
received thanks to the noble Lord. I think the last time that I saw the
noble Lord, Lord Hall, was at the aquatics centre when he was giving
out medals and I was giving out flowers—there is a job for
everyone in this world. I wanted to congratulate also Danny Boyle. I
have a whole list of other really fantastic people, such as Stephen
Daldry and Mark Tildesley, who were all involved in the various opening

is concerned, it had nearly 20 million visitors and there
were more than 25,000 artists from all competing nations—what an
achievement. One of the most inspiring occasions, which my noble friend
Lady Bonham-Carter mentioned, was in being part of the 3 million taking
part in Martin Creed’s work when we all stood there at 8.12 am
on the opening day, ringing whatever bell we could find to hand. That

Hackney, Shoreditch, Tower Hamlets, Bethnal Green and beyond. In
recognition of that commitment the Barbican has been asked to mount,
with the east London artistic partnership Create, the weekend to
celebrate the public reopening of the Olympic park in July. That work

extensively. I entirely agree; we had a debate on that subject only
last week and the feeling within this House was quite unanimous. Then
we have the issue of the resourcing of the DCMS and the budget of the

must be able to capitalise on their involvement in the games. Suppliers
must be allowed to promote their work for the Olympics or similar

suppliers were promised a long time ago that that would be settled.
Finally, there is, I hope, the great prospect of another London 2012

arts and cultural experiences that will enrich people’s lives.
Between 2011 and 2015, £1.4 billion of public money from the
Government will be invested in the project, and a further £1
billion has been pledged by the lottery. In 
<?notus-xml column=1218?>March 2013, there will be a full evaluation of the London
festival—other noble Lords have mentioned this—and we
await that publication with enormous interest.</hs_para>

debated here very fully today, and it remains a strategic priority for
the Arts Council. The noble Lords, Lord King and Lord Mawson, and many
other noble Lords reminded us that the transformation would not have
happened without the Olympiad. It is all the more welcome as east
London was a deprived area that was desperately in need of
regeneration. The noble Baroness, Lady Doocey, shared with us her
unique engagement and regeneration experiences and demanded the right
kind of legacy. How we agree with her. We also welcome the
apprenticeships and paid internships in the arts sector, which were
mentioned by many noble Lords. They are invaluable at a time of such
high unemployment. Innovations in music and dance schemes offer great
opportunities. Many areas are committed to this initiative, and
foremost among them are the Royal Opera House and the London Symphony
Orchestra. The noble Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter, spoke about
educational opportunities, and she was quite right. With such
internationally renowned contributors, many others will surely follow.
My noble friend Lady Andrews and the noble Baroness, Lady
Bonham-Carter, spoke inspiringly about the opening ceremony, as did
other noble Lords. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Hall, who is to be
congratulated on his new appointment, will ensure that it is screened
regularly, just to keep in our minds what a wonderful moment it was
when we looked in disbelief at those great nurses dancing around and
all the other things that we witnessed and identified with as we
retaught ourselves a history lesson that all of us should remember.
This debate has been unique in the all-star line-up who have spoken
today. They have shown us what is being done and what can be done. It
is a message that must be widely
spread.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000209" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0001.htm#13012450000209">So why
I am still left with a sinking heart? Why does the political cynic in
me have misgivings about the legacy? Why, even after today’s
uplifting debate, do I feel a bit like Ruth amid the alien corn? Quite
simply, it is because the Government’s ill considered actions
with regard to local authority funding and the inexplicable actions of
Michael Gove put all these things in doubt. As to the first, local
authority funding has been slashed. Clearly, at a time of economic
stress that would not be unlikely, but what is clear is that the
funding reductions have been cynically targeted at Labour councils,
often in areas of high deprivation, to such an extent that libraries,
theatres and museums are under threat. Much has been said about the
fine city of Newcastle. We await with trepidation the outcome of those
negotiations. These are people centres. We have talked about them this
morning, and it is vital that people have access to cultural activities
all over Britain. All the good work being done, as we have heard today,
will be undermined by unfair funding, and the legacy should be felt by
everyone in Britain, not just by those in east London.</hs_para>

much has been said already in this Chamber and in the press. His
proposals, yet to be finally published, could totally dismantle
grass-roots sport and culture in our state schools. I remind noble
Lords that these schools educate 94% of our young 
<?notus-xml column=1219?>people, but Michael Gove’s proposals threaten to tear the heart
out of primary and secondary schools. His curriculum proposals spell
doomsday for our next generation of young people, and for the hopes
that the legacy so clearly brought us. The noble Baroness, Lady
Benjamin, reminded us in a powerful speech that we must put children
first. Children must be introduced to sport and the arts at the
earliest opportunity. We must ask why Michael Gove is ignoring that
fact. No amount of outside enrichment can compensate for state schools
devoid of ring-fenced funding and the provision of properly trained
teachers. Michael Gove chooses to ignore all

I regret those negative observations, I am convinced that the legacy is

our nation. The UK delivered the largest nationwide cultural festival

Lord, Lord Hall of Birkenhead, with the Cultural Olympiad board and its
director Ruth Mackenzie and her team, led this celebration of the UK as
a centre for cultural innovation and creativity. The many public and
private sponsors and supporters who worked together to ensure its
success deserve our considerable thanks. As the noble Lord, Lord Hall,

festival was high, particularly among younger age groups and minority
ethnic groups. The “Unlimited” series of
commissions—29 commissions of work by deaf and disabled
artists—ensured that the shift in the UK’s perceptions of
disability was seen in culture as well as in sport. As with the
delivery of the Cultural Olympiad, the cultural legacy of the Games is
one that the Government want the sector to lead, with support from
government. They have asked the Cultural Olympiad board to look at
further options to maximise the legacy of the Cultural Olympiad. As the

time in the curriculum for pupils to take other subjects. The
importance of creative subjects such as art, drama and music is fully
recognised as part of a broad curriculum. The Department for Education
is currently considering how to ensure that high-quality qualifications

of the Games was not by chance. It was due to stable and consistent

remembered as a summer of excellence for Great Britain. They should
also be remembered for helping to shape and foster our future
communities and culture for the national good. That means inspiring a

across the globe; namely, that we are seen as a warmer country, a
friendlier country, a country that came together and a country that is
at ease with itself. I also suspect—one can be quite moved about
this—that we feel rather differently about ourselves because of
the Games, which is one of the most powerful legacies that I have

like to beg your indulgence if I break with tradition. Today is a sad
day for the House because, during this debate, my noble and gallant

serving in the Royal Green Jackets, having both originally joined the
Rifle Brigade, although at different times, will make his final speech
on its Floor. Few people have contributed more, in so many ways, to the
life of the nation than my noble and  
<?notus-xml column=1225?>gallant friend as Chief of the Defence Staff, Lord Lieutenant of London,
President of the MCC and, for the past 26 years, an active Member of

hope I may also share a personal memory that I suspect he may have long
forgotten. Almost 53 years ago, I first played cricket under his

the match, I hit the biggest six of my life, and, if I shut my eyes, I
can still see the ball soaring over the trees at the edge of the
ground. However, as I walked towards the pavilion, not out, I was taken
aback not to be welcomed by my captain but rocketed for playing such an
irresponsible shot when we were fighting for the draw that we had
achieved. With such commitment to the cause, it is no wonder that he
became Chief of the Defence Staff. I am sure that the whole House will
join me in thanking him for his many contributions and wishing him and

course, some details of every weapon system must remain classified and
there is more to replacing a so-called independent nuclear deterrent

reluctance of successive Governments to examine the criteria that
should guide the choice of any nuclear weapon system. Our original
deterrent was procured during the Cold War and, given the capability of
our then presumed opponent, Trident was a credible replacement for
Polaris in the late 1970s, if we were to convince the Russian Politburo
that a pre-emptive attack on the United Kingdom would risk a nuclear
response involving unacceptable damage to the territory and people of
the Soviet Union. However, we are not at war now, except in the eyes of
those who accept the assertions of George W Bush and Tony Blair that we
are involved in a “war on terror” and a “war on
drugs”, whatever those two terms mean. No one in their right
mind can think that Trident is a usable or appropriate weapon against
the Taliban or al-Qaeda, so why the unwillingness to allow scrutiny and
debate on an issue that affects us

criteria, as with any weapon procurement, must begin with the
operational requirement and include two questions of national
self-interest. First, who is it that we are seeking to deter from doing
what? Secondly, what level of capability is required to achieve that
effect? Military choices alone cannot provide the answers to these
because nuclear weapons with the destructive power of Trident are
instruments for influencing the behaviour of political leaderships, not
for achieving results on the

reason why my noble friend Lord Hannay and I sought this debate now and

because the prospects for multinational nuclear disarmament are so

their being realised are debated, conscious that others, including my

aspects in more detail. Here I thank and commend Ian Cruse for his

out the efforts to achieve a weapons-of-mass-destruction-free zone in
the Middle East, which is a separate although related subject, I echo
the hopes that others have expressed that the president will move
quickly to make progress on the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
without waiting for Russia to respond; that he will re-energise focus
on the United States disarmaments commitment contained in the 2010
non-proliferation treaty action plan, conscious that the 2015 review
conference is getting ever nearer; that he will take an active lead of
the P5 plus one negotiations over Iran's intentions, conscious that
opportunities for compromise are draining away and Israel's position
remains crucial; that he will use a commitment to nuclear disarmament
to unblock the stalemate over agreeing a programme for the current
United Nations Conference on Disarmament, particularly over the Fissile
Material Cut-Off Treaty; and finally, that he will encourage the Senate
to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, originally negotiated by
the Conference on Disarmament in the
1990s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:11:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
Inevitably the prospects for achieving multilateral nuclear
disarmament, to which all these have important contributions to make,
will depend on every nation, whether it possesses, is thinking of
possessing or does not possess nuclear weapons, agreeing to that aim

entirely the wrong reasons, or that that influence could also be

suggest that it is on our decision on whether to replace Trident with a
similar system capable of taking out Moscow that our real credibility

on careful examination of the criteria, the same was not true of either

nuclear disarmament, while acknowledging uncertainty about possible
future threats that included a major direct 
<?notus-xml column=1228?>nuclear threat to the United Kingdom, threats from states with more

do I conclude from all this? In terms of the context in which
multinational nuclear disarmament is being debated, there is no doubt
that 9/11 changed the nature of warfare in a way that is likely to
shape the demands on every national defence strategy for years to come.
The task of a defence strategist includes determining whether military
force should be used at all, and, if so, with what weapons. Nuclear
weapons, with the potency of Trident, were appropriate weapons in Cold
War strategy but are not appropriate in the post 9/11 world. Defence
strategists also have to consider current circumstances that may affect
the achievement of any national aim. In this case, I believe that
insufficient attention is being paid to the ever-increasing threat of
cyber warfare. Cyber weapons can not only disarm an adversary before he
has even begun to fight, but render sophisticated armouries and even
nuclear deterrence obsolete. Furthermore, as has been proved in Estonia
and Georgia, cyber weapons threaten every aspect of a nation's
existence, and therefore defence against such attack must be a major
requirement of every Government. As an aside, just I regret that the
cost of what is essentially a political weapon—the nuclear
deterrent—is now laid on the defence budget, because of its
inevitable impact on required military expenditure, I hope that the
same mistake will not be made with cyber, which affects not only the
governance but the economy of the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:16:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000258" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000258">Therefore,
if progress is to be made with the United Kingdom's published position
with regard to multilateral nuclear disarmament, and if Britain is to
make a credible contribution to achieving that aim, my plea to the
Minister is that she will recognise the unease and suspicion created by
the Government's apparent reluctance or refusal to examine all the
criteria associated with continuing our possession of nuclear weapons
and denial of objective scrutiny and searching debate, and undertake to

have selected this most timely debate—moved by my noble friend
Lord Ramsbotham, whom I thank for his very kind and generous
remarks—to make a final contribution for two reasons: first,
because there can be no more important question facing this country
than the vexed one of nuclear weapons, and in particular our
country’s own nuclear deterrent; and secondly, because in my
maiden speech, made in March 1987, I reminded noble Lords of the
positive contribution that the possession of nuclear weapons had made
to Europe in terms of its stability and an unusually long period of
peace, for the simple reason that no prize that might have been gained
by military means would have been worth the risk of possible nuclear
retaliation.</hs_para>

those days of the Cold War I therefore fully supported the generally
accepted philosophy—I might almost say theology—of the
deterrent, and believed that because the prize was no less than the
domination of Europe, it was—just—a credible faith. On
this I disagreed with my more distinguished predecessor as Chief of the
Defence Staff, the late Lord Carver, who I then thought was ahead of
his time. I say this because, not having had any emotional antipathy to
the useful possession of such weapons, it gives me, I hope, slightly
greater credibility if now, a quarter of a century later when things
have moved on, I want to deal with the practicalities of nuclear
weapons and their future rather differently.</hs_para>

now, with the Cold War over, the world has changed significantly, both
politically and in terms of its conflicts, and is likely to continue to
do so. I now feel that it is possible—indeed, I would say
essential—to look at the whole question from an entirely
different point of view. I shall therefore ask three different but
closely related questions. Perhaps I might now be allowed to continue
while sitting

first question, from a military point of view, is whether we still need
the successor to Trident which the Government presently seem to have in
mind. Will it be able to go on doing the job it is supposed to do under
any relevant circumstances? To this I believe the answer is
unquestionably no. For all practical purposes it has not and, indeed,
would not deter any of the threats and challenges—now more
economic than military—likely to face this country in the
foreseeable or even longer-term future. It has not stopped any
terrorist outrage in this country nor, despite America’s
omnipotent deterrent, did it prevent the very traumatic 9/11. It did
not stop the Argentines trying to take over the Falklands, nor did any
nuclear deterrent stop Saddam Hussein marching into Kuwait or firing
missiles into Israel. Nor indeed, in a now intensely globalised and
interlocked world, could our deterrent ever conceivably be
used—not even after a serious hostile incident which it had
presumably failed to deter—without making the whole situation in
the world infinitely worse for ourselves as well as for everybody
else.</hs_para>

all practical purposes our deterrent has never been truly independent,
and if this country had not had a national deterrent over the years,
dominated by 
<?notus-xml column=1230?>the formidable balance of terror between the USA and the old Soviet
Union, it would certainly not be seeking to acquire one
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:21:36"></hs_TimeCode>. I see no
reason why these circumstances should change, because conflict is
moving inexorably in an entirely different direction. Indeed, even that
often-quoted justification for such a status symbol—a seat at
the top table—has worn a bit thin, with prestige and influence
more likely to be achieved by economic strength, wise counsel and
peacemaking than by an ability to destroy en masse.

the very large extra expenditure needed to set up and maintain an ever

particularly as in the gracious Speech the first of only three small,
rather opaque references to defence was a determination to reduce the
threat of nuclear proliferation—I ask how we could possibly make
any positive contribution to the current dialogue, and ultimately, one
hopes, to a widespread reduction of nuclear weapons, if the only
example we set is to be a wholly negative one, by going ahead with
possessing for ourselves such an excessive capability for at least
another 40 years, and at the same time claiming, however fallaciously,
that for a country like ours it is the only way that we can guarantee
our security in all circumstances. I imagine that that line of argument
is not lost on those who may now wish to acquire such weapons for
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:23:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000266" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000266">Other
countries may not necessarily follow our example if we were to start to
run down our own white elephant and be seen to be stepping further down
the nuclear ladder. However, to encourage them in the completely
opposite direction, to follow our particular stance, seems to me to be
very irresponsible for a country such as ours, which rightly has
aspirations to be a leader in international affairs.</hs_para>

my third and final question is whether, in the real political world we
live in, can this Government politically afford not to be seen to have
the best nuclear weapon that money can buy? Even if they were mindful
to take a rational step, could they really defy any populist feeling
which could so easily, and certainly would be, whipped up by those ever
keen on contriving a row on key issues—and there could be no
issue more key than this—that somehow the Government, however
inaccurately, were giving away Britain’s ultimate guarantee of
homeland security, while at the same time, heaven forbid, the French
may be—probably would be—holding on to theirs? It may
therefore be politically easier to let a successor to Trident go ahead
despite the many and considerable down
sides.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000268" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000268">Nevertheless,
ever an optimist, I believe that there can be a sensible way of getting
round this impasse and giving the Government the opportunity to get off
the hook. For instance, they should give urgent consideration to
adopting a more practical, realistic and, I hope, cheaper way of
keeping at bay or warding off any likely threats to the integrity of
our nation and the safety of our citizens, which at the same time 
<?notus-xml column=1231?>would be seen to be giving a lead in the active non-proliferation
dialogue. I believe that there are a number of convincing and capable
ways of achieving this, some of which may be expanded on by
other noble Lords.</hs_para>

begin with, we should recognise that in today’s world we do not
need to have a nuclear-firing submarine at all times to demonstrate an
effective deterrent capability. Periodically one boat would have to be
at sea for training purposes, and at others a submarine could be put to
sea at short notice if the threat to us or our vital interest was
perceived to have increased. This variable state of readiness would
still maintain some useful sense of uncertainty and could even, at
times of particular tension, actually appear to enhance our commitment
and resolve. Some useful economies would arise from a system of reduced
readiness which might even, by adding to the time span of the existing
Trident, go some way to assuaging any lingering electoral doubters.
Even more importantly, it would allow a breathing space in which to
perfect—hand in hand with improved intelligence, both satellite
and terrestrial—a more relevant economical and useable system,
and therefore to allow work on the replacement submarines exclusively
for Trident’s successor to be cancelled or at least

would hope that this stepping down from the no-longer-credible
immediate response nature of our current nuclear stance could be
implemented in a way that persuaded people that it was both a sound and
progressive step, designed not quixotically to re-prepare for the last
war, but to present a better balanced, more relevant defence programme.
Moreover, by making a further and significant contribution to the
general dialogue for multinational nuclear disarmament, which everyone
seems to approve of, it could even enhance the value of our counsel in

speaking truth to power, as he has done all his life, and for his
illustrious and remarkable military career, starting with the Military

on personal grounds—his distinguished action as Colonel of the
2nd Gurkha Rifles. I mention that because my son-in-law, who died
earlier this year, was a junior officer in the 2nd Gurkha Rifles. He
served in Hong Kong and in that neighbourhood, including Malaya. Over
many years he told me that nobody was more admired by the Gurkhas than
the Field Marshal, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, who did so
much to help and assist them in their deep dependence on this country

second point to the noble Lord is that the person who was the subject
of a long interview in the <I>Guardian</I> on Monday was not the shadow
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the distinguished Mr Douglas
Alexander, but Mr Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.
Few people in the Government could know more about the cost of Trident
and, if I may say so, could have made as acute, perceptive and
distinguished a contribution to the debate as he did. Anybody who reads
it will know why I say that. It was an extraordinarily candid

I refer to another contribution in the <I>Guardian</I>. It was made by
a former Minister for the Armed Forces, my friend Nicholas Harvey. He
was an excellent Minister and he wrote a very candid and frank article
in which he cast as much doubt on whether it was wise to go ahead with
Trident as a former Minister possibly could. He spoke in terms as
eloquent and forceful as those of the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:31:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000275" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000275">I
will turn quickly to some of the issues. First, the structure of
control and governance over nuclear weapons has essentially rested on
treaties signed by the so-called P5—the recognised, official
nuclear powers. One of the first treaties set up the IAEA, which is a
major inspector of nuclear weapons developments. The second, which
sadly has never been ratified by the United States, was the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. The third was the attempt to get
a fissile material treaty that would cut off fissile materials. That
would mean in effect that it would become almost impossible to develop
further nuclear weapons because no fissile materials would be fed into
the process. The final one, which I mention in passing, was the attempt
to bring about a tougher inspection system, of which the additional
protocol is at the
heart<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:32:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000276" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000276">I
believe very strongly that the President of the United States, in his
re-elected second term, will be determined to proceed further, and as
far as he possibly can, with these crucial treaties. Already there is
evidence from members of the President’s staff that he is
utterly determined to do that. There is also stronger evidence in his
remarkable appointment of a new Secretary of State, Senator Kerry, to
succeed the excellent Mrs Clinton; and, secondly and perhaps
even more significantly, in his appointment of Senator Hagel as Defence
Secretary. It was a most unexpected appointment. Senator Hagel has had
the courage to speak out against any military action against Iran, and
to say quite a few things that echo what the noble and gallant Lord,
Lord Bramall, said about the destructive capacity of nuclear weapons,
and the fact that therefore they should not be used 
<?notus-xml column=1233?>except in the most extreme circumstances. The appointment of these two
gentlemen, both of them highly controversial in American politics and
not likely to be totally welcomed by all members of Congress, is clear
evidence of what the President intends to do. I believe that he will
take matters as far as he possibly can, with the support of his
allies—that is important—in the next four years of his
presidency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:34:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000277" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000277">I
will go back for a moment to say something about each of the treaties.
The CTBT has long been resisted by the United States, and equally by
other countries including China. It is critical that we should try to
pass it now. Secondly, the START agreement was passed by a very narrow
majority in the US Congress. It opens up the prospect of major
reductions in nuclear arsenals. The treaty has been passed but not yet
implemented. If it were implemented, we would see a dramatic decline in
the arsenals of nuclear weapons that—here I agree completely
with the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham—serve no useful purpose at
all and tend to decline in effectiveness over the
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:35:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000278" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000278">The
Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty has been blocked for the past few years
at the conference on disarmament in Geneva by one country: Pakistan.
That is very serious and we need to think very hard about ways to get
around that. Since Pakistan’s major fear is not Russia or China
but India, I will say that the whole world owes a huge debt to the
present Prime Minister of India, Mr Manmohan Singh, for flatly refusing
to retaliate after the Mumbai and Delhi terror attacks. It is one of
those moments in history when one has to be grateful, for the safety of
the whole world, to just one brave politician. He was exactly that in
refusing to retaliate against a major attack on Mumbai. Nobody knows
who made it, but many people suspected a body in
Pakistan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T14:36:03"></hs_TimeCode>.
Thirdly in the list of treaties, there is a real chance that we may be
able to move ahead also on the additional protocol now signed by a
number of member states of the IAEA. This is absolutely critical if we
are to have effective

there were time, I would love to turn to a number of other, very
serious issues: for example, China’s commitment to the
no-first-use doctrine, which although helpful has acted as a block to
much of the thinking about nuclear weapons and about the way in which
we might develop an effective system of controlling them. However, I
will echo the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and the noble and gallant
Lord, Lord Bramall, in saying that we live and move in a very different
world to that of 30 years ago. As the noble and gallant Lord eloquently
said, there very little point in having nuclear weapons, and certainly
in having nuclear weapons continuously at sea. Our main fears are of
terrorism or possibly a serious accident—to both of which a
nuclear deterrent is

other main point to make about the new developments, many of them in
the laboratories of the United States armed forces, is that, as the
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, they are moving towards cyberwarfare
and increasingly precisely targeted weapons, including some of the
conventional weapons that today terrify Russia. Russia is scared stiff
that the United States is rapidly overtaking it in terms of
conventional warfare. Therefore, it depends increasingly on nuclear
deterrence, which in many ways is becoming

saying that for many years between the wars—this is relevant to
the discussions we will have in the coming year about the First World

an unassailable and invulnerable defence. Right up to the beginning of
the Second World War, the French military continued to believe in the
Maginot Line, which lasted a matter of days and was then gone. Like the
Great Wall of China, it was a deterrent that did not work. I suggest
strongly that we should look to the developments in cyberwarfare, which
are terrifying, and at developments in robot warfare, of which we have
the example of the drone, which is used increasingly in Pakistan and
Afghanistan and is likely now to be used in west Africa, in countries

will conclude with a final thank you that deserves to be part of this

some time he was an adviser to the previous Prime Minister, Gordon
Brown. Mr Brown gets a lot of criticism, but with the help of the noble
Lord, Lord Wood, he probably took greater steps in reducing to its
bare, effective minimum the British nuclear deterrent, in working on
verification and in seeking to get wider agreements to reduce the power
of nuclear weapons, as far as this could be done. It is appropriate and

It has attracted the attention of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord

he described it. I, too, would like to mention not only the noble and
learned Lord’s distinguished record from the D-Day landings
through to being Chief of the General Staff at the time of the
Falklands, but the fact that he is a neighbour in Crondall. One day he
said to me, “I don’t know. You’re called Lord Lea
of Crondall. Why aren’t I Lord Bramall of Crondall?”. I
think the answer is that no one else around the place has a name like
“Bramall” but there are plenty of Leas around, and that

<?notus-xml column=1235?>in a publication by the Royal United Services Institute when he was
Liberal Democrats defence spokesman in the Lords. He was arguing for
leaving the decision on replacing Trident as late as possible.
Incidentally, he attracted me to become involved in the group that he
set up and chaired for some years, the All-Party Group on Global
Security and Non-Proliferation, which is now chaired by the noble Lord,
Lord Hannay, who we look forward to hearing from later in this

points made by Lord Garden. First, he noted rather ruefully that the UK
retains some leverage in the process of non-proliferation while it has
some weapons, so you have to have some weapons to be involved in
non-proliferation. I say “ruefully” because he was more
than hinting at the Alice in Wonderland quality of the logic that we
are all trying to grapple

he noted that the opportunity costs of other conventional capabilities
are considerable and that the lack of knowledge about conventional
needs and available resources so far in advance argues for decisions at
the latest possible stage. In a week when we have seen what has
happened in Algeria, I think that the truth of the trade-off of

Trident replacement study clearly has to be distinguished from the main

over what the Trident replacement study is. It certainly does not mean,
“Do we replace Trident?”. I think that people are
confused about what it means, but it just means looking at what the
alternative ways are of delivering nuclear missiles. I can put both the
noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham,
right. It is partly my fault that I did not draw this to the noble
Lord’s attention. There is nothing wrong with what the noble
Lord said about the Written Answer in December but it was only late
last week that ordinary mortals saw the text of the coalition
agreement, which refers to a decision to publish the report of the
alternative review. It was not in the public domain before then. It was
announced separately in the House of Commons, even later than the

know that there is a double meaning of “alternatives to
Trident”, but at some point we must turn to seeing how this
relates not just to alternative ways of using a nuclear warhead but to
alternatives to Trident itself. The question arises of how this fits in
with multilateral disarmament or a multinational contribution to the
non-proliferation process. Common sense would suggest 
<?notus-xml column=1236?>that a contribution to a multilateral process would be along the lines
of, “If we do this, will you do that?” That is what
normally happens, from being at school onwards. That is what a
trade-off is. However, I have not seen any sign of such a proposition,
let alone a trade-off in practice. We are told that it is perfectly
logical for there to be twin tracks: the track of the nuclear powers
looking at their weapons systems and the track of non-proliferation.
The trouble is that the non-proliferation industry has become exactly

noble Baroness, Lady Williams, tried to make the case for saying that
quite a lot was being done under the treaty and that it was not just a
question of people flying around to conferences. The fact is that there
is a great danger in letting the present position drift. I refer to the
case of Brazil, which has forgone nuclear weapons on the grounds that
it believed what it was being told—that we would respect our
commitments under article 6 of the non-proliferation treaty. If it
thinks that it has been duped and that its agreement was not worth the

there is the argument that we cannot really do anything much of
substance. That means that we independently put our nuclear weapons

we’ve got to have one too”. I can understand our friends

have never doubted that the interests of this country are best served
by remaining a member of that nuclear club and being a nuclear power of
credibility. Many arguments have been put forward from the original
decision immediately after World War II to become a nuclear power; to
retain and, as required, update the credibility of that power. I also
never doubt that the primary purpose is not for war fighting but for
deterrence, although the worth of that deterrent posture and power have
to be maintained and reinforced, particularly in times of

when budgets are tight, and conventional defence means are underfunded,
expenditure on the nuclear deterrent, both in capital and in running
cost, could be of greater value to the national interest if devoted to
conventional requirements. Nevertheless, legacy nuclear costs will
still have to be met, and these will not be small. However, virtually
all experience of the initial funding of the national deterrent is that
it would be financed outside the defence budget, though for convenience

a Government ever to undertake to match defence funding to some outside
measure—for example, as a percentage of GDP—and to stick
to that undertaking over a period of years, then perhaps the relative

related to each other in financial terms. Lacking that commitment, the
arguments for a deterrent posture have to be related not so much to the
funding but to the widest possible interests of the country.</hs_para>

say the dangers of the current environment and their uncertainties
strengthen the case for our continued reliance on nuclear weapons. In
the short term, I agree with them. I was partly responsible for the

support the unilateral abandonment of an independent UK deterrent.
However, this is not 2006 and relevant factors have changed even since
then, as has their significance. It is becoming clear that deterrence
as a cornerstone of our defence strategy is decreasingly effective and
increasingly risky. As nuclear technologies spread, it will be more
difficult, not easier, to prevent acts of nuclear terrorism. In 2006 I
believed that our deterrent could play a role in deterring nuclear
terrorism by threatening any state known to support it, but as the
sources of material used for terrorism multiply, it will be more
difficult to pinpoint the state responsible. If one cannot do that, one
has no target for a credible threat of retaliation.</hs_para>

Attribution of the source is difficult, if not impossible. Where one

they offer less of an insurance policy against the challenges we will

I invite noble Lords to reflect on recent research into the climate
change impacts of even a small nuclear exchange, let alone the effects
of one between superpowers. Since 2006, new scientific research has
revisited the nuclear winter theme. The research, employing more
sophisticated climate models, stresses the devastating climate effects
that would follow the use of nuclear weapons. A major use would be
suicidal. It would so alter the climate and, as a consequence, our
agriculture, that the attacker’s population would starve to
death, even without any nuclear retaliation. Even a smaller nuclear
exchange, for example, between India and Pakistan would produce global
temperatures colder than any experienced in the last millennium, with
massive impacts on agriculture affecting up to 1 billion
people, particularly in China and the United States, causing economic
damage and huge political instability around the
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000309" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000309">If we
want to be secure against nuclear and other threats, we have to think
more creatively than our current reliance on deterrence implies. We
have to shift the emphasis away from the threat of massive retaliation
to prevention of nuclear catastrophe and resilience in the face of any
attacks. On the nuclear side, we must plan for the unthinkable, but
prevention is our main route to safety. Fewer nuclear weapons and
materials in the world must be better than more of both. Those who
argue the opposite are dangerously overconfident about our ability to
keep control of nuclear weapons and materials, particularly in the face
of terrorists’ ambitions. Prevention means a number of things.
First, we have to get and keep better control of the world’s
nuclear weapons and materials. It is essential that the nuclear
security summit in the Netherlands is ambitious. This is an issue for
continued leadership attention. It is important that world leaders
reaffirm their commitment to continue this process, and talk of the
meeting in the Netherlands being the last of the series is
foolish.</hs_para>

we have to cap the problem by making progress towards a fissile
material cut-off treaty. The issue of such a treaty cannot be allowed
to languish in the conference on disarmament any longer; it has been
there for far too long. Thirdly, it is essential that President Obama
and President Putin meet and pursue a follow-on deal to the new START
treaty as soon as possible. The US needs to show flexibility on missile
defence, agreeing to share more details because that is the key to
unlocking the door to further nuclear reductions and a deal in which
the US could agree to reduce the warheads it holds in reserve and
Russia could agree to cuts and more transparency about its
non-strategic nuclear weapons. Fourthly, we must never miss an
opportunity to tell both the US and China that they have a solemn
international responsibility to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear

harder to strengthen the grand bargain at the heart of the
non-proliferation treaty or risk losing it. We are becoming dangerously
complacent about it. All states have a responsibility here, but the
nuclear weapons states bear a special responsibility. Successive
Governments have reduced the number of warheads in the UK arsenal, but
we need to do more. Formally, we are committed to the like-for-like
renewal of Trident and the operational posture of continuous at-sea
deterrence. The Government and all Members of this House need to
reflect further on this position. Are we telling the countries of the
rest of the world that we cannot feel secure without nuclear weapons on
continuous at-sea deployment while at the same time telling the vast
majority of them that they must forgo indefinitely any nuclear option
for their own security? Is that really our policy? If so, do we expect
the double standard that it implies and indeed contains, to stick in a

weapon states to pursue disarmament. Some of that disarmament must come
through multilateral negotiation and agreement, but some of it can come
through independent action, as in the case of several rounds of
announced reductions in the size of the UK nuclear warhead stockpile,
none of which we negotiated with anyone else. The time is now right, in
my view, to change our posture and to step down from continuous at-sea
deterrence. This would demonstrate that nuclear weapons are playing
less and less of a role in our national security strategy, and along
with the reductions in stockpile numbers we have made, it would
strengthen our ability to argue internationally for the kinds of

confronted with firm international action and other states must also
step up and take their responsibilities more seriously if we are to
avoid the worst. If a disastrous nuclear incident does occur, it will
not be all or even partially the fault of this country, but what
consolation will there be in the blame game the morning after London
has been devastated by a terrorist nuclear attack? What consolation
will there be when we cannot secure incontrovertible evidence of the
source of the attack and therefore cannot use the nuclear weapons we
have on continuous deployment, even should we wish to? What will the
value of our insurance policy be then? Where will the consolation be if
even a small nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan has the kind

<?notus-xml column=1241?>means that its shelf life is eroding. To achieve our objective, we now
need to shift the emphasis to the kinds of measures I have talked
about—on to reducing the chances of any nuclear weapon ever
being used anywhere. That means the relentless pursuit of nuclear
weapons reductions, a relentless strengthening of nuclear security and
non-proliferation regimes, and a decreased reliance on nuclear weapons
for national security by all, including
ourselves.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_24_PT_1/005A3FFE968CDC09250EB91BF33E74BA0B8C28B9" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 January 2013">Thursday,

Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</Member></B> My Lords, earlier this week I
asked myself why a debate of this importance has attracted relatively
few noble Lords to speak in it. Is it because the debate is seen as one
really for the big boys with military, defence or diplomatic
experience, who can easily examine these complex issues and get their
minds around the treaties? Having heard the quality of the speeches in
the debate, I would have to say yes, and I am sure that the speeches to
follow my own will doubly prove the
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:07:35"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
I am afraid that it is also because many of your Lordships are stuck in
a time from before that at which the noble and gallant Lord, Lord
Bramall, has arrived. I explored this view anecdotally at the Long
Table on Tuesday, when I asked many of my neighbours why they were not
going to speak today. The answer volunteered was that nuclear weapons
have kept the peace since World War Two and there is nothing more to
say on the subject. I am glad that the noble and gallant Lord has again
made such a powerful speech today and I hope that Members of the House
will read it. In a way, I wish he could have done a warm-up to
encourage more debate. I am sure that the Trident debate will help as
it progresses, because it will force people to engage with the
issue.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012450000316" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000316">I want
to spend a little time talking about why parliamentarians really must
get more involved in the debate. In this House we have tended to put
nuclear matters rather in a silo. We have had debates on the strategic
defence and security review, but there is no real place for these
issues to be discussed in those. We barely mention them in debates on
European defence matters because, of course, they are not a European
competence. However, today is the day and I congratulate the noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, on securing the debate. It is one in which, as
parliamentarians, we all need to engage because traditional nuclear
deterrence means targeting major centres and aiming to destroy cities
and civilian populations. That is one of the reasons why the
organisation Mayors for Peace has such a vibrant and growing world-wide
membership.</hs_para>

nuclear deterrent is now highly questionable and is exactly the sort of
issue that the legal minds in your Lordships’ House should start
to examine. In the rest of the world, the non-nuclear states are
becoming more convinced that nuclear weapons are contrary to
international law. The International Court of Justice ruling in 1996
said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13012450000669" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000669">“the
threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the
rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, and in

law”.</hs_quotefo><hs_para UID="13012450000318" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000318">Since
1996, that argument has been gaining ground. Already whole regions of
the world are declaring themselves nuclear-free zones—regions
that are likely 
<?notus-xml column=1242?>to be future forces in development and growth and therefore much more
powerful, such as Latin America. The noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall,
mentioned Brazil in particular. He is right. Countries in these
nuclear-free zones are going to start questioning why the P5+1 are not
taking seriously their obligations under the NPT. Other nuclear-free
zones include south-east Asia, central Asia and
Africa.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000319" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000319">I meet
many parliamentarians from these regions through the international
organisation Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-proliferation and
Disarmament—PNND—which exists to facilitate dialogue on
these issues. It has just published a handbook. The handbook is not a
route map or a document espousing one particular policy or solution any
more than a recipe book is a definitive guide to what you must eat, but
it is a toolkit of what parliamentarians can do within the scope of
international treaties and in their own domestic situations to make a
nuclear world safer step by step. If those steps lead to a nuclear
convention and nuclear zero that will be terrific, but there are many
steps we can—and should—take before that.</hs_para>

enable us as legislators and scrutinisers of our Governments to do a
better job with regard to the nuclear weapons debate. I welcome it

It never seemed very credible at the time. We are discussing something
that there has been no occasion to use in

turned into fuel for nuclear power stations. I am delighted to see, in
the excellent brief that was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, the very real US-Russian co-operation that is going on. The
US is spending $1 billion on helping the Russians to combat the spread
of nuclear materials from the former Soviet Union. In their joint
Megatons to Megawatts programme, they are turning highly enriched
uranium into lightly enriched uranium for use in power stations. They
have already converted nearly 20,000 warheads’ worth of nuclear
material into fuel, making it unavailable for use in warheads. I
understand that there is a bit of a freeze and some tension in the
US-Russian relationship at the moment, and in the interests of the
whole world I hope that that is not too long-lasting.</hs_para>

background that one looks at the future as vividly described by the
noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall. It is of course an
extraordinarily dangerous world, and we can only be reminded of that by
the upheavals that have happened, all so rapidly, barely in the past
couple of years. The whole of the Middle East has gone into spasm:
Libya; the appalling carnage in Syria at present; the issue of whether
Iran is developing a nuclear weapon; Israel, with the CIA assessment
that it has 300 to 400 warheads, and the question, after its election,
of whether it may or may not decide to make any use of them; and
obviously the situation in Yemen, Somalia and, now, Mali.
The issues that we face include terrorism, Islamic
fundamentalism, piracy and cyber threats. However, against none
of those do nuclear weapons look like God’s gift to
solving the problem. It is against that background that I look on the
present situation. It is certainly not obvious to me that there is any
longer a need for a major nuclear system based on 24-hours-a-day,
seven-days-a-week availability. None the less, it is an unstable world
and my judgment is that we would be wise not to abandon totally some
nuclear capability, not least because one looks at Iran, North Korea
and the development by Russia, and I think by Pakistan as well, of
non-strategic nuclear weapons, which is obviously a very dangerous
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T15:18:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000328" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000328">As
the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, said, the blockage to this
has really been the political judgment. Can any political party in this
country go to the electors and say, “We have dismantled the
basic, fundamental, ultimate defence of our country”? That is
the challenge that we face and that has to be addressed. As to whether
it ultimately gives us top-table credibility, in the current world we
live in, top-table credibility comes from being available to help with 
<?notus-xml column=1244?>peacekeeping and conflict resolution, and in having Armed Forces that
are able to exist, co-ordinate and co-operate with the new
high-technology and highly sophisticated systems. We know that, in any
co-operation with the United States, there are very few countries now
that can do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000329" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000329">Against
that background, the cash pressures are very much an issue here. I
think that our place at the top table would be more threatened by
committing ourselves to a system for 40 years or more that may mean, in
what are likely to be pretty stringent economic times for the
foreseeable future, that we are less able to contribute in the United
Nations and under United Nations leadership in some of those other
roles than by whether we can say that we have these very substantial
weapons, which we have never had occasion to use. Our position and the
need to play our part in the world means we must now review this very
carefully as it comes forward—I am glad it is Danny Alexander
and not Douglas Alexander who is leading this particular
exercise—to see whether we can find an alternative way forward

always particularly telling when people with such a strong military
background speak out in the way that he has spoken out today. I also
want to say how moved I was by the speech of the noble and gallant
Lord, Lord Bramall. Ever since coming into this House, over 20 years
ago, I have admired his contribution almost without limit. He speaks
with the firm authority of a former Chief of the General Staff but he
also speaks with great enlightenment. I shall never forget his speeches
before we went into Afghanistan and before the Iraq war, and I wish

control are essential elements in an effective defence policy.
So-called irregular, and indeed terrorist, activities underline this,
and Afghanistan, Mali and Algeria are all recent examples. The easy
availability of dangerous and lethal arms makes arms control all the
more imperative. Light arms, vehicles, spare parts and, more
sinisterly, the biological, chemical and crude nuclear possibilities
are all part of this. Nuclear waste from civil industry is highly
relevant. The international arms trade must be under constant scrutiny.
Sadly, the prevailing culture seems still too often to be that arms
exports are an important part of our export drive and should be
debarred only when there is some overriding reason for doing so.
Surely, the culture should be that, in our highly turbulent and
unstable world, arms and ancillary equipment are highly dangerous and
lethal exports which should be permitted only to the closest firm
allies in whom we have total confidence or for very specific
controllable reasons of international security and defence. Confidence
about end-use and potential end-use is

of the introduction of the nuclear, biological and chemical dimension
of all this, I hope that noble 
<?notus-xml column=1245?>Lords will permit me to say a word on the arms trade treaty
negotiations. The final conference, after failure to agree in July
2012, will be in less than two months’ time. If that conference
again fails to deliver a treaty, the issue will return to the UN
General Assembly in its current session, where the assembly as a whole
will take over, with the possibility of voting a treaty through. The
methodology in negotiations has been to proceed by consensus. However,
this must not be allowed to become a treaty at any cost. That would not
be a success—quite the reverse. It must be effective and curb
irresponsible transfers. In other words, it must uphold the original
purpose of the ATT; it has to cover a comprehensive range of arms and
ancillary equipment; and it has to include ammunition. Upholding human
rights must be a key part of it all. The Government, like their
predecessor, have played a dynamic lead role in emphasising all this
and in taking the conference forward. It would be tragic if they were
to weaken and fall at the last fence. A treaty must of course meet the

on multilateral nuclear disarmament, the need is urgent. There is
growing evidence of pressure for still more proliferation. There are

cornerstone the firm commitment of existing nuclear powers to pursue
nuclear disarmament themselves. Our nuclear policy must at all times
be, and be seen to be, consistent with that. How do we influence
constructively if we are perceived to be moving in the opposite
direction? To argue that our own nuclear weapons are essential to the

been powerfully argued that nothing would better promote nuclear
disarmament than for us to announce the intention not to replace the

our submarines and to put them on the negotiating table as a challenge

the P5 process. It is going slowly at present. The Chinese are blamed,
but more could be done to find out from them what they require in order
to have confidence in the process. We could take Russian concern and
apparent paranoia more seriously. This paranoia harms our own security
as well as the prospects for arms control. We have to address more
convincingly their concerns. We could open up Britain to inspections
that mirror the US-Russian transparency in the new START process. Why
do we have to be more secretive than the US and the Russians? Indeed,
we could have our own bilateral arrangements with Russia. Central to
the current considerations by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime

negative assurances—Trident is then for use only in deterring a
nuclear strike. We could then recommend to the P5, alongside China,
that they agree a no-first-use treaty. No first use would be an
important confidence-building measure for the wider community of

course require extraordinary legal, political and practical measures.

or more dangerous? Do we believe that a nuclear disarmed world would be
safer or more dangerous? Clearly, a nuclear disarmed world would be a

we need to recognise that the landscape of 2012 was pretty bleak.
There, I entirely share the analysis of the noble Lord, Lord Browne of
Ladyton. The euphoria provoked by the Prague speech and the new START
agreement between Russia and the US faded. Neither NATO nor Russia made
any meaningful progress towards reducing and eventually removing
tactical nuclear weapons from the front line in Europe. The failure at
the end of the year to implement the 
<?notus-xml column=1247?>agreement to convoke a conference on a weapons-of-mass-destruction-free
zone in the Middle East has merely stored up problems for the future.

meetings between the five recognised weapons states will surely need to
assume a more operational significance and scope. I hope that the

aspirations in respect of the next P5 meeting. Surely the P5 offers the
ideal forum in which to discuss the content of a fissile material

supported. The P5 could also seek ways to get around the deadlock in

conceivable benefits, whatever one’s view of the morality or
international legitimacy of so doing. That points to major efforts
being required to revive the search for diplomatic solutions, which
will also require some willingness to compromise on both sides of the
very tense relationships over those two countries. In the case of North
Korea, the search for compromise would seem to require some meeting of
minds between China and the United States. In the case of Iran, it

very different international circumstances from those for which it was

not to publish any part of it. I was therefore delighted to hear the

has been mentioned by several other noble Lords, I would like to say a
word about the false argument that Britain’s permanent
membership of the Security Council of the UN somehow depends crucially
on our possession of nuclear weapons. That is simply not the case; it
is totally unhistorical to 
<?notus-xml column=1249?>suggest that it is. When the five permanent members of the Security
Council were established under the UN charter, only one had nuclear
weapons. China, the last of them to join, did not have them for another
three decades. The link is really not there. The noble Lord, Lord King
of Bridgwater, put his finger on it when he said that the sustaining of
our permanent membership depends infinitely more on the role that we
play in peacemaking, peacekeeping and conflict prevention, and matters
such as that, than it does on making this false linkage with nuclear
weapons. As I have said, I am not a unilateral disarmer. I am not
suggesting that we should give up our nuclear weapons, but is important
that we keep them for the right reasons and not for the wrong

this debate I speak as a dinosaur. I became interested in the question
of disarmament and nuclear weapons in 1954, when I was briefly the
secretary of the British delegation to the sub-committee of the
Disarmament Commission. How optimistic we were in those days. We were
led brilliantly by a lost leader, Sir Anthony Nutting. We had with us M
Jules Moch, one of the most brilliant and eloquent French socialists.
We also had Governor Harold Stassen, who had been a presidential
candidate in the previous United States election. We also had the spiky
and bureaucratic presence of Mr Gromyko and Mr Malik for the Soviet
Union, but they were not as bad as they are sometimes cracked up to
be—or, rather, cracked down to be. On one occasion, in May 1955,
when I was there, the Soviet Union accepted the British and western
disarmament proposals. This was an alarming moment for us. We had to
reconsider everything about which we had been talking for a long
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000353" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000353">The
Soviet Union also made the interesting observation that there were
circumstances beyond international control that could not be guaranteed
by any imaginable inspection agency. We had suspected this since an
article on the subject had been written in the <I>Spectator</I> the
previous autumn by the distinguished physicist Sir George
Thomson. No one took much notice of it and we continued our
deliberations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000354" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000354">I
remember those occasions in the mid-1950s for several other reasons.
There was a preoccupation with interweaving the question of nuclear
disarmament with that of conventional disarmament. We put forward the
idea that before we took any nuclear disarmament steps of our own, we
would insist on a one-third cut in Soviet conventional forces. That was
one important element. Another was that we talked a great deal about a
control and inspection agency, which, even if it was not perfect, would
be a great deal better than anything that we had at the time. If there
were ever to 
<?notus-xml column=1250?>be the kind of nuclear catastrophe that the noble Lord, Lord Browne,
mentioned, our minds would come round immediately to the
idea of something
similar.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000355" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000355">The
United States began the Cold War with a proposal for the complete
international ownership and management of nuclear activities. There was
to be no distinction between peaceful and military uses. Both would be
organised and owned by an international control agency that would have
the unique capacity to deal with nuclear possibilities. That seems a
very idealistic and improbable concept now, but I think that if there
were to be a catastrophe, we would probably find ourselves going back
to all sorts of interesting ideas that were rejected because they were
considered impractical in the
past.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000356" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000356">What
happened—I make no bones about citing something that happened
over 60 years ago—was that at the end of the world war, there
was a great deal of pressure among United States scientists to devise
some method of putting the genie that they had unleashed back in the
bottle. First, Dr Oppenheimer devised a scheme that was made political
by two distinguished United States politicians, Mr Dean Acheson and the
head of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Mr David Lilienthal. The scheme
was for complete international ownership of nuclear weapons. It was
thought that the controllers would remain happy because they would have
something to do. They would not just be checking that people were not
making mistakes but helping to develop the nuclear industry of the
world. That was put forward as a United States proposal by Mr Truman in
May 1946, and the spokesman was the improbable figure of a businessman
called Bernard Baruch, who was a great friend of Winston Churchill, as
was Mr Truman. This scheme was considered to be the best way
of scientists making up for what they had done by creating such a
dangerous world with nuclear weapons.</hs_para>

fortunately, that there will be any kind of breakdown that would
justify such extreme reconsideration. After all, gas was not used in
the Second World War, although when people talked about war in the
1930s, it was thought likely that it would be used. Indeed, the
self-control of states in not using nuclear weapons has been one of the
striking elements of international politics since 1945. Nevertheless,
it may happen. There may be a catastrophe and, if so, we should be
prepared to take extreme measures afterwards to organise a method of

ourselves why multilateral disarmament is so vital to the
world’s safety and security. First, the end of the Cold War
marked the expiry of Cold War security doctrines that relied so heavily
on nuclear weapons, in particular the American-Soviet deterrence
doctrines. Deterrence of course remains crucial, but relying
excessively on nuclear weapons to do the deterring is not only more
hazardous, but less effective in a world where the threats we face are
changing in character, where states still threaten but, increasingly,
not only states
threaten.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000361" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000361">Secondly,
the international community’s commitment to multilateral
disarmament is the corollary of its determination to prevent nuclear
proliferation. Maintaining minimally sufficient arsenals, inside an
international legal framework that has verified constraints on nuclear
weapons, is the only way to combine national security needs with a
minimisation of the risks of proliferation. Reversing our reliance on
nuclear weapons globally is integral to preventing their proliferation
into dangerous hands. However, there is a moral pressure point here,
too. If we demand that states without nuclear weapons commit to never
having them, possessor states have a duty and self-interest to take the
necessary steps towards co-ordinated disarmament. It is the bargain at
the heart of the non-proliferation treaty, and as concerns about North
Korea, Iran and nuclear terrorism increase, its logic becomes more, not
less,
compelling.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000362" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000362">Over
the past 25 years, I am proud to say that Britain has been a leader
both in its own unilateral actions and internationally. We have
eliminated two complete weapons systems. We are the only possessor
country to have a deterrent based on just one system. We have reduced
the number of warheads by 75% since the end of the Cold War,
so that we now have less than 1% of the global stockpile. We have led
the way on nuclear security through our global threat reduction
programme, which has helped nearly 20 beneficiary countries so far. We
are world leaders in innovation in the development of
proliferation-resistant nuclear fuel cycles and in proposals such as a
generalisable nuclear fuel guarantee. I pay tribute to this Government
for continuing our leadership on reducing dependence on nuclear weapons
with their decision to reduce the number of operational warheads and
reducing our overall
stockpile.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000363" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000363">That
is a strong moral lead, and it puts the UK in a position to be a
demandeur with our allies and beyond, and to make real and continuing
progress in multilateral disarmament. As Malcolm Rifkind said last year
at the Munich Security Conference, momentum is everything. 2009-10 was,
as many speakers have said, in many respects a period of optimism.
There was the innovation of the nuclear security summit cycle; a new
START 
<?notus-xml column=1252?>treaty and the NPT Review Conference in 2010. However, that momentum has
now stalled. Optimism about further progress in US-Russia disarmament
discussions is hard to find. Progress on the outcomes of the 2010 NPT
conference has been limited at best. The attention of the possessor
states is rightly focused on the dangers posed by Iran, North Korea and
others, but the price has been a further detachment between the twin
goals of non-proliferation and multilateral disarmament. Meanwhile,
there is the continuing backdrop of China, India and Pakistan focusing
more on expanding and modernising their nuclear weapons capacity than
seeking to limit it.</hs_para>

needs to be done? I think the challenges lie in four different areas,
and I ask for the Minister’s view on the Government’s

architecture of treaties and regimes that breed confidence, and that
attempt to bring as many states as possible into the net of
international legal obligations around nuclear weapons, nuclear
material and nuclear
security.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000366" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000366">Specifically,
we have slightly less than two years to show concrete progress on the
range of commitments under the NPT Treaty before the 2014 PrepCom
meeting. What are the UK’s priorities? The Comprehensive Nuclear
Test-Ban Treaty still awaits the signatories of eight countries that
hold nuclear technology. Key to this is the United States. President
Obama has said that he will pursue ratification with the Senate. Can
the Minister reassure us that we are using our relationship with the

commitment?</hs_para>

also ask the Minister for her assessment of the prospects of two other
initiatives. As the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, mentioned, the
postponement of the Helsinki conference for a Middle East zone free of
nuclear weapons suggests bleak prospects, but I hope that she can
provide some silver lining. What are the prospects for the elusive
fissile material cut-off treaty? They should have improved since
President Obama reversed the Americans’ long-standing problem
with verification methods. As the noble Baroness, Lady Williams,

we need to continue momentum in measures to increase nuclear security.
This is crucial to confidence-building, perhaps more than anything
else, and is key to unlocking progress on both the non-proliferation
and the disarmament fronts. The nuclear security summits cycle has been
one of the best developments in recent years. The summits have led to
important first steps in areas such as safe disposal of highly enriched
uranium. Britain has led the way in this area—in research work,
in international assistance to other states, and in transparency by
opening up to review missions from the IAEA. Will the Minister confirm
that the UK is on course to meet its commitments for the next nuclear

we need to build on the real achievements of the START treaty signed in
2010 by Russia and the USA in significantly reducing the numbers of
deployed strategic warheads and missile launchers, and in achieving
some progress on monitoring and inspections. That treaty looked for a
while as though it would be the prelude to further milestones on
US-Russia co-operation on disarmament. As many speakers have said,
sadly, that has not materialised. What does the Minister think is a

as I was about to come to that issue. There are also issues around
Britain’s own deterrent which have been widely discussed today.
We must ensure that disarmament activity is conducted in a transparent
and verifiable manner. That is why the previous Government initiated
their work with Norway on verifiable warhead dismantlement, as
mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, and hosted the first P5
consultations on disarmament in London in September 2009. The dangers
of nuclear proliferation, nuclear terrorism and insecurity around
nuclear materials should make us more determined than ever to achieve
co-ordinated disarmament but they also continue to justify our
retention of the minimum capacity needed to achieve our deterrence
objectives. Coming to the noble Baroness’s point, we in this
party have said that we are open to examining any new evidence since
our review of Britain’s nuclear weapons arsenal in 2006 and we
will consider its findings alongside other studies, such as the
cross-party BASIC Trident Commission, which is chaired by my noble
friend Lord Browne, to see if there are credible
alternatives.</hs_para>

Anyone coming here and listening would have realised that this House
gives the lie to the suggestion that we are not grown-up enough to be
able to take part in this debate. The quality, content and
understanding in what has been said show me conclusively why it is so
important that the expertise in this House is deployed during this
consideration of one of the most important questions that we face. It
is clear that everyone in this House is committed to the cause of
multilateral nuclear disarmament. I did not hear anyone suggest that
the first thing to do was just to wipe all nuclear weapons off the map
and take a unilateralist line. That is not practical politics and it is
not sensible.</hs_para>

example, I am glad that the issue of continuous at-sea deployment was
questioned, which is not just a question of practicality but also must
be included in any question of the cost and development of the future
weapon, quite apart from its efficacy. I am glad that the possibility
of more precision weapons was represented. I am also glad that the
question of cost came up, because in this connection I have always been
a follower of the advice given to me by my late master, Field Marshal
Lord Carver, that there are two definitions of affordability. One is,
“Can you afford it?”, and the other is, “Can you
afford to give up what you’ve got to give up to afford
it?”. That has extreme relevance in this situation when we are
considering what we need to conduct ourselves in today’s world

the light of this change, our report necessarily focused on the first
element of banking union—the single supervisory mechanism. We
sought to address a number of the key questions. Was it appropriate for
the European Central Bank to take on a supervisory role? What would be
the impact on its governance structure? Which banks should be directly
supervised by the ECB? What accountability mechanisms were needed? What
would be the impact on non-euro area member states, and when could such
reforms be realistically and reasonably
introduced?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000418" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000418">Our
conclusions were as follows. We noted the worldwide trends, including
here in the UK, towards combining supervisory and monetary policy
functions in one institution. In our view, giving supervisory
responsibility to the ECB was indeed the only viable option. Yet this
would create a significant concentration of power in one institution.
Again, it was vital to ensure that there was no conflict of interest
between the ECB’s twin tasks of exercising monetary policy and
the supervision of the banks. The ECB needed to be fully accountable
for its supervisory role, including 
<?notus-xml column=1263?>to national Parliaments, and I am pleased that the vice-president of the
ECB came before my committee to report on the
proposals.</hs_para>

unrealistic to expect the ECB to engage in intensive supervision of all
6,000 euro area banks, yet the crisis has demonstrated that
it is not just the largest institutions that can pose a systemic risk,
as exemplified by Northern Rock in this country. We concluded that,
while the ECB would concentrate on the day-to-day supervision of only
the largest and most systemically important banks, it should retain the
power quickly to assume responsibility for the supervision of smaller
banks as and when required. However, this model could work only if
there was close and positive co-operation between the ECB and national
supervisors, and I would ask the Minister whether he could comment on
that necessity.</hs_para>

of the banking union proposal is that non-euro area member states
should have the right to participate, but this presented significant
dilemmas. How could non-euro area participating member states enjoy
equality with euro area member states within the ECB decision-making
process, and how would all this impact on those member states that
wished to remain outside the banking union, of which of course the
United Kingdom has declared through the Prime Minister that it will be
one? He has said that,</hs_para>

profound implications for the UK. We were particularly concerned about
the impact on the European Banking Authority, the regulatory agency
tasked with developing the single rulebook for financial services
throughout the European Union. We feared that a dominant ECB could
undermine the EBA’s authority in defending the EU-27 and the
single market—in particular, given the likelihood that banking
union participants would caucus around a single position advocated by
the ECB inside the European Banking Authority’s decision-making
process. This raised the spectre of the United Kingdom being
consistently outvoted in setting the rules by which the financial
sector operates. Given this threat of marginalisation, we urged the
Government to do all that was necessary to ensure that the City of
London’s leading position was not imperilled and that the
integrity of the single market was not compromised. At the very least,
the European Banking Authority’s voting arrangements had to
ensure that it was able to defend the interests of the single market as
a whole.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000422" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000422">The
Commission’s proposals as originally drafted failed sufficiently

wholly unrealistic. Even the revised aim of agreeing a legislative

<?notus-xml column=1264?>had been struck, which, the Government assure us, “will preserve
the EU’s single market and protect the interests of those
remaining outside the banking union”. The commitment to break
the vicious cycle between banks and sovereigns was reasserted, as was
the intention to bring forward in 2013 a single resolution mechanism
proposal. A “double majority voting” principle was agreed
whereby decisions in the EBA will be subject to a majority of both
participating and non-participating member states in the banking union.
The Government have also pointed to the so-called
“non-discrimination clause”, which, they argue,
“guards against any restriction of the UK’s role as a
financial centre in the single market”. That is all very
promising but, as ever, the devil is in the detail, and I would ask the
Minister to respond to a number of questions.</hs_para>

supervision. Last week the <I>Financial Times</I> reported that the
commitment in Brussels to break the vicious circle between banks and
sovereigns and to take forward proposals for the single resolution
mechanism may be weakening. Can the Minister confirm this? What update

it would be remiss of me not to comment on the Prime Minister’s

“essential foundation” of the European Union—which

a referendum, which has been dangled in front of us, worries me
considerably. In the case of the 1975 referendum, the then Prime

Callaghan, to go round and get the assurances of other capitals in the
community that that was all right. The second problem is that
referendums are a newfangled way of dealing with the assessment of
public opinion in this country. It begins to take away from the tried
and true parliamentary approach that we have had for so long in this

want to focus initially on two of the major issues in the
sub-committee’s report. The first relates to what the
noble Lord has already referred to as the incomplete nature of the EU
proposals for a banking union. The committee had pointed to the need
for the single supervisory mechanism, proposals for which
were published in September 2012, to be joined by a common resolution
mechanism and a common deposit insurance scheme.</hs_para>

mechanism was agreed by heads of government at the December European
Council meeting but will not, as I read it, be operational until some
time in 2014. The Council also called for work on proposals for
directives on recovery and resolution and on a deposit guarantee to be
accelerated so that the directives could be agreed by the end of March
2013, enabling the Commission to bring forward a proposal for a single
resolution mechanism in the course of 2013. I must say that that
timetable seems remarkably optimistic and I look forward to what the
Minister has to say on that point. Parenthetically, I suspect that the
two different timetables were deliberately chosen so that the German
voter would not be scared
off<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:40:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000433" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000433">Another
major concern of the Select Committee was that the UK should secure a
mechanism that would ensure that the eurozone members would not be able
to dominate the non-euro members. Initially, there was understandable
scepticism about the Government’s prospects of achieving this,
so we should congratulate the Government on having achieved substantial
progress on it. As Commissioner Barnier said in a speech just after the
December Council
meeting:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13012450000650" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000650">“According

by the use of this term “modalities” in a European
context because it does not really tell you anything about what the
mechanism actually is. However, looking at other material, it would
appear that this requirement for approval by a majority of countries

the European Banking Authority’s regulations, so that there is a
clear legal basis for it

is just the key decisions in the EBA. What about other decisions? The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Greg Clark, in his letter to my
noble friend Lord Boswell, said that the double majority, “will
also apply to key decisions including those relating to binding
technical standards that will apply to firms across the single
market”. He says that this is a, “supplementary
requirement to existing voting arrangements”. Can the Minister
clarify this? I have not seen anything that indicates how this
supplementary requirement is actually inserted: what is the legal
mechanism that brings this supplementary requirement into place?
Furthermore, Greg Clark says that this will not be a permanent
arrangement because the requirement will be reviewed if there are four
or fewer euro
states.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000435" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000435">Commissioner

committee, in accordance with its usual practice, confined itself
strictly to the banking union and considered that in a consensual
manner. It did not go into other developments and related
matters that might be slightly more controversial, but I shall tiptoe
into those areas where the committee refrained from treading. Banking
union itself will not be enough; it will need a fiscal union and an
economic policy union. These matters are coyly mentioned in the
December Council conclusions
as,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13012450000675" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000675">“further

these will require treaty change. However, probably at an earlier
stage, by one means or another, it will require what the Germans call a
transfer union. At the moment, how and when that will kick in is
shrouded in mystery, but it will have to. Some of us had the pleasure
of meeting the Bundestag’s EU committee here a few weeks ago.
Its chairman emphasised to us that Germany was prepared to accept the
burdens that would flow from the banking union and, in response to a
question from my noble friend Lord Flight, said that he recognised the
balances that had accrued through the “target”
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T16:44:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13012450000437" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000437">On
all these matters, my doubt is principally whether the safeguards that
our Government have achieved can be sustained. For those who believe in
“ever closer union”, the achievement of that goal must
now be focused on the eurozone, with the non-euro countries either a
temporary expedient or a long-term
aggravation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000438" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000438">If
the euro survives and if the “outs” move to being
“ins”, as most of them are obliged to do, it is probable
that the views and interests of the ins will dominate the operation of
the single market. Unless our safeguards 
<?notus-xml column=1267?>are embodied at treaty level, it is difficult to see them surviving
generally—and certainly when the review kicks in after the
number drops to four. How we then respond will depend on what we think
is the value of the single market, a market with which we have an
adverse trade balance, which takes a minority and declining share of
our exports while imposing costs on our global business activity, and
which, we must remember, is even now a social market rather than what
most of us in the UK would call a free
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000439" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000439">My
other doubt is whether the Council and the Commission are heading in
the right direction. Many years ago, when I had the pleasure of being a
member of Sub-Committee A, we did a report on the euro 10
years on. This was before the credit crunch struck. In preparation for
that report, we spent a fair amount of time with witnesses on the
possible vulnerabilities of the euro—of course, very little of
this went into the report because it was essentially speculative. Those
who gave opinions to us generally agreed that the eurozone could be
vulnerable if struck by a serious, asymmetric shock. The crisis which
followed was such a shock. I remember one witness who mentioned this
possibility also saying that we must remember that a country can take a
lot of hurting. He explained this by reference to Italy, where, in the
1860s, the Mezzogiorno, or the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies which it was
before that, was rapidly integrated into the new Italian state on terms
which left it locked into poverty and low development in contrast to
the prosperous north. Even 150 years after that integration, there is
no sign of that uneven relationship changing. Today, there is the
prospect of the European Union’s Mediterranean countries
becoming effectively an enlarged Mezzogiornio, in a crisis which was
caused partly by the euro but from which the euro prevents
escape.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000440" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000440">I
would say to those pressing for banking union and the other unions that
flow from it, “Don’t reinforce failure. Don't subject the
social fabric of the Mediterranean countries to this awful
strain”. They, and maybe some others, too, need a better model
for the
future.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_24_PT_1/EA21ED15117E29D915D585B767127446B36B093D" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 January 2013">Thursday,

Falkner of Margravine:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble
Lord, Lord Harrison, and his committee for this excellent report on the
European banking union. In doing so, I make one or two observations in
general about the European Union Committee and its reports. I can see
in the Chamber five brave people who were not involved in the report of
the committee, when our debates can attract, as we know, an attendance
of perhaps 450 a day. It saddens me to see debates on reports of such
significance to the lives of people, both men and women, in this
country so poorly attended. I am extremely glad that the chairman of
the European Union Committee is in his place, because I wonder whether
the House might consider debating reports from Select Committees on
scrutiny days so that they attract wider dissemination, wider knowledge
sharing and greater attendances. My gender, which represents more than
50% of the people of this country, is equally affected by the
implications of banking union and the financial crisis, and it saddens
me that we do 
<?notus-xml column=1268?>not seem to have in this Chamber the interest in these issues that we
might have. I spoke to the noble Baroness, Lady Vadera, last night, who
has all the expertise to be able to add to debates of this kind. Of
course, she is on leave of absence. I was meant to speak in the earlier
debate on nuclear non-proliferation until I noticed the composition of
the speakers list for this debate and decided that it was important
that I bring my non-expert knowledge, but some voice, to it as a
priority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000442" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000442">Roughly
a year ago, we were debating the break-up of the eurozone in this
Chamber. At that point, it appeared possible that the scale of the
problem, the lack of its recognition among some eurozone members and
political inertia, combined with institutional sclerosis, would lead to
a Greek exit, with the potential for Portugal, Spain, and Italy to
follow. In this Chamber, we were divided between those who believed
that the demise of the eurozone altogether was nigh and those who, such
as us on these Benches, could imagine a winding road ahead but
recognised the determination within the leaders of the eurozone
countries to avoid that catastrophic

are still on that winding road, but the pointers for the way ahead for
the eurozone are clearer. What has been less clear this afternoon is
where the United Kingdom is going. While a significant part of the
European Union is negotiating deeper integration, the result of which
is not yet evident, I find it difficult, apropos the Prime
Minister’s landmark speech yesterday, to consider a referendum

the eurozone, the landmark event was last year here in London, when the
Governor of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, spelt out the

and overarching priority is to address the so-called death spiral born
of the interdependence of banks and sovereigns within the single
currency. For those participating in the eurozone, the price of
stability will be the loss of sovereignty, with all the political
implications that that brings. So although progress towards creating a
federal structure in banking has been kicked off with the creation of a
single supervisory mechanism, there is, nevertheless, a loss of
momentum on a common resolution authority, or indeed a common deposit
protection scheme, as the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, mentioned. That
impasse has been attributed to the German electoral timetable; and
people suggest that we will not see moves to resolve other
institutional questions until after September 2013. I am a little
pessimistic as to the pace of progress even after that. I fear that the
emergence of slow growth in late 2013 and the relief that the crisis is
abating, will act as a drag on action necessary for stability to be
consolidated.</hs_para>

so important to proceed with a complete federal settlement to underpin
the single currency. At the time of the Maastricht treaty, serious
academic work was undertaken in the UK on the experience of the United
States in the early operation of a single currency there. The American
example still stands us in good stead today, and suggests why, if the
eurozone is to succeed, it will have to become more like the United
States. In doing so, I draw on an excellent paper from the Centre for
European Reform, <I>What a Banking Union Means for Europe</I>, which I
was very glad to see this morning included in the Library briefing pack
for this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000448" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000448">As
the paper points out, the US has undoubtedly had a faster and stronger
recovery from the 2008 financial crisis than that seen in
the eurozone economies. Part of the reason for that is that the
decentralised state-level institutions in the eurozone states have
actually served to amplify the initial shock from 2008, transforming a
financial crisis into an existential crisis for the single currency.
Without a federal budget, fiscal forbearance for banks is made on the
basis of national considerations and political risks. The mutualisation
of deposit protection makes free-riding more likely, so it does not
exist, and the bonds of solidarity between states are naturally weaker
than they are in the US, despite its federal
diversity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000449" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000449">Significant
key functions are now recognised across the board, even here in the UK,
as being necessary if we get a banking union and then, eventually,
fiscal and political union within the eurozone. The first, as the
committee recognises, is to break the death spirals within the eurozone
whereby individual states are pushed towards insolvency by bank
rescues, being completely at the mercy of financial markets with higher
and higher borrowing costs. Ireland knows the lessons of this well,
which is why it is so keen to use the European stability
mechanism’s funds for direct recapitalisation of its
banks’ legacy debts. It will be interesting to see how this
argument sits with the German taxpayer.</hs_para>

issue is the lack of a eurozone authority to restructure or wind up
banks that run into difficulties. In the US, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation does this; since 2008, it has wound up more than
450 insolvent banks in an orderly manner. Within the eurozone
framework, zombie banks continue—thanks to cheap ECB
funding—so while we have a road map for single currency
stability, there is still much detail to be worked on.</hs_para>

the issues that engage United Kingdom interests more directly. It was
instructive to read the response from the Financial Secretary to the
Treasury, Mr Greg Clark, to the letter from the noble Lord, Lord
Boswell, regarding the committee’s concerns. The Government
should undoubtedly be congratulated on their success in negotiations at
the December Council. We have progress on the institutional
relationship between the ECB and the EBA and, significantly, we have
achieved solid protections in respect of the voting rights between the
“ins” and “outs” when decisions are taken
in the EBA. I recognise the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Trimble,
and I note that Mr Clark does not give complete reassurance, as there
is still no clarity about what will happen if and when there are four
or fewer “outs” left in the system. 
<?notus-xml column=1270?>However, that is some way away and, in my view, we could not have got a

will also be affected by events beyond our control as we go forward.
Just this week, we have seen moves towards the establishment of a
financial transaction tax for 11 of the eurozone members. This came
about as a result of the enhanced co-operation, which will now leave us
without a say at the table as the shape of this tax is
negotiated—with significant implications for eurozone banks that
operate out of the City of London. While some Eurosceptics might be
pleased at the potential gains for the City of London, particularly if
the actual proposals result in driving trading in shares, foreign
currency or derivatives out of Frankfurt and Paris into London, I would
warn that there are dangers, too.</hs_para>

that the regulation might be sufficiently light touch, with a very
narrow focus on individual share transactions, not to result in any
greater business for the City. What is seen now as an obstacle to
growth—the FTT—might have no adverse impact at all but
bring revenue gains to the participating countries. Alongside this, we
would have the scenario of the UK being seen as an uncertain bet, with
the spectre of its referendum. City institutions may well consider it
more worth while to be based within a recovering and more stable
eurozone.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012450000454" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000454">The
overarching issues for both the United Kingdom and other EU and
eurozone countries are the looming recession in most eurozone states,
the seemingly never-ending austerity, with its record
unemployment—never experienced before—and, most urgently,
the loss of competitiveness in relation to emerging markets. These
problems on their own, if taking place against the kind of recessions
that we have experienced before, would have significant effects.
However, taking place as they are against a backdrop of political
uncertainty and shaky political resolve about seeing the thing through
to its conclusion, they do not augur well for a speedy resolution to
the eurozone crisis. That does not remove the responsibility for the UK
to play a positive, engaged and compromising role if we are to see
it
though.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_24_PT_1/95439F14D44E1A54E00F39BB423E09907C94C5EE" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 January 2013">Thursday,

European Council that discussed banking union. The noble Lord, Lord
Harrison, himself could not take part in the debate in this Chamber. I
paid a well deserved tribute to his chairmanship, and also to the role
played in the committee by the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton. In the light
of the remarks by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, I should also have

that is, for member states that choose not to be members of the
European banking union. My concern today is to try to establish just
how secure these protections are. I want to make a couple of general
points first, and then I want to put three specific questions to the
Minister. They are questions which are pretty obvious really, and they
cover exactly the same territory as the noble Lords, Lord Harrison and
Lord Trimble, and the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, took us into. So
there will not be any shock or
surprise.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13012450000459" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000459">I
shall take my general points first. First, if we were to leave the
European Union, the sort of protections that the Prime Minister was
talking about are written on water. We would have no say in EU
legislation, regulation and supervision if we were not members of the
EU. I entirely agree with what the Prime Minister said yesterday about
the impossibility of seeing the United Kingdom in a Norway or
Switzerland situation. I think it is very important to recognise that
the sort of protections that you get in the single market require you
to be a member of the European Union as well as the single
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000460" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000460">Secondly,
I worry that the possibility of our leaving the European Union could
have a chilling effect on the City. The City has critical mass, of
course, in a way that no other European financial centre does. We have
not seen entities flee the City because we are not in the
eurozone—at least I have not; I do not believe that there has
been much—but nor have we seen, until yesterday, a British Prime
Minister raise the possibility that he might, in a referendum,
recommend our leaving the European Union. That is the logic of what he
said yesterday—that it is conceivable that he might. The new
settlement he seeks depends on our convincing every other member state
either that they buy our prescription for “fundamental,
far-reaching change”, or that they agree that we may have
carve-outs, specific to the UK, from existing EU treaties to which we
have previously signed up. Either of these is quite a tall
order.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000461" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000461">Therefore
it is at a minimum conceivable that the new settlement will not be
available, or that it will be so small and so trivial that the Prime
Minister’s party will mock him if he says, “This is a new
settlement”. Where then does he go? He was not prepared to
acknowledge the logic of his position yesterday when Nick Robinson put
the question to him. My worry is that foreign investors may draw their
own conclusion. I do not know how big this effect will be, and I may be

<?notus-xml column=1272?>exaggerating the risk; but in this House we have all, when talking about
Scotland, agreed with the Government in their criticism of Mr Salmond
for delaying his referendum until October 2014, because of the
chilling effect on inward investment of the uncertainty
created and prolonged for two years. We have now created for the United
Kingdom as a whole a precisely similar uncertainty, which is actually
more existential for the financial services industry which we are
talking about in this debate. I do not know how valid the point was
when it was made about Scotland, but to the extent that it had validity
when the Government made it about Scotland, they should be
acknowledging it when it is now made about the United Kingdom as a
whole.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012450000462" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000462">The
protections that the Government secured seem to be threefold. First,
the non-discrimination clause states that,</hs_para>

an achievement. I agree with that. I think that what the Government
said about it is correct. It is worth having, although it says nothing
more than is in the treaty. It is worth having because we have cases in
the European Court of Justice on precisely this point. It will have
some beneficial effect in those cases. What goes without saying is
often best said. So I regard that as an
achievement.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13012450000463" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000463">Secondly,

other supervisors. I am not really sure what that is worth. I do not
think that it is worth very much, because whatever the principle, the
ECB will be a very big beast on this stage. It is going to be a very
big supervisor. There will be only one other very big supervisor, and
that is the Bank of England. I think that the text that we have not
seen—that has not been drafted, that does not yet
exist—of the proposed memorandum of understanding between the
Bank of England and the ECB is probably much more important than a
European Council text enshrining this
principle.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13012450000464" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000464">The
third protection—the really big protection, the one that has

review if the number not participating falls below five.</hs_para>

specific questions to the Minister, and there are three. First, how
many member states have, like the United Kingdom, declared that they
definitely will not be part of a banking union? I think that it is only
the Czechs so far. Is that right? Secondly, how many of the
non-eurozone 10 have declared that they definitely will join? I think
that it is four. Is that right? Thirdly, what view do the Government
take of the likely decisions of the others—four, if I am right,
but I do not know whether I am or
not?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000466" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0002.htm#13012450000466">It is
really very important for reasons that previous speakers have given and
because we know that the ECB intends to ensure that the majority group
in the 
<?notus-xml column=1273?>EBA speaks with one voice. That is what the ECB’s opinion says,
so retaining a viable minority group matters, and if the review clause
is triggered, we all know what will happen. The matter will then go
into the Council where, by definition, we will not have a blocking
minority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:09:41"></hs_TimeCode>. I ask
because, given the risk that the only strong protection secured in
December—this one—falls away, it really is important for
the City to know how many friends we have. Is the number going to fall
below five or

and briefly, market practitioners will make their own decisions about
all these things. European Council and ECOFIN conclusions and ECJ cases
are all very important and keep people like me very happy, but they do
not actually determine what the market does. As, us apart, the eurozone
becomes over time more coterminous with the European Union, we need to
think about what perceptions market practitioners will have. Will they
believe that it is plausible that the majority eurozone group, plus the
extra members of the banking union who are not members of the eurozone
but are candidates and postulants—pre-ins—to the
eurozone, will conclude for all time that their major financial centre
should still be offshore, in our country? Will they believe that the
ECB will be willing to allow non-euro-area resident entities here in
Britain to have free access to its free discount facilities? Will
practitioners believe that they might be wise to reduce their
counterparty risk by relocating into the eurozone? I do not know, but I
am speaking of the possible perceptions of market
practitioners<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:11:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in the single market is absolutely correct. Going to the Court when we
think that these rights are under attack is absolutely correct. I am
sure that we can play a good defensive game. But markets will make
their own judgments. Financial services can relocate very fast, far
faster than any other industry. That is one reason why I am so worried
about our increasing isolation in Brussels, and about the signal that
we have sent this week. The Channel is getting wider so quickly that I
fear the movement may be visible from Tokyo, Beijing and New York. We
already know that our friends in Washington have seen it and
worry about it. I think that we should all worry about
it.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_24_PT_1/53A2F43D31E4984A1941E2F7B61F4A5AC8D049EB" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 January 2013">Thursday,

know how many people have actually read it; certainly not an awful lot
of action has been taken on it. We must be well aware that the single
supervisory mechanism has been adopted, but an awful lot of other
things that were heavily recommended in our report have not. I refer
particularly to the recovery and resolution directive, which is
possibly equally important, if not more so. Of course, the
intention was that it would be introduced at the beginning of this
year. I now gather that the Dutch and others who see themselves as
picking up the tab for ECB intervention into banks have backed off.
They do not want to get involved in that anymore. They are going back
on earlier undertakings, which is rather typical of how the EU operates
most of the time. It takes two steps forward and one step back, and if
everything gets rather difficult or if things, as it seems to believe
today, are looking rather better, it is a wonderful excuse to do
nothing. If that is the EU of which we all want to be part, that is
fine, but it certainly does not seem to be the answer for the United

greater integration but it is quite difficult to see how that will

witnesses said that eurozone bank indebtedness would disappear like the
snow in the sunshine once we had economic growth in the eurozone. There
are two problems with that. First, we have absolutely no idea of the
scale of bank indebtedness in the Club Med countries in the eurozone.
However, we know that we are reaching a situation where a number of
countries—because they are faced by serious social
problems—have said that their banks cannot repossess properties
and throw people on to the street. That means that people in those
houses stop paying their mortgages because they cannot afford to do so.
The next thing you have is moral hazard when someone says,
“Well, hold on, my neighbour is not paying his mortgage
repayments because he can’t. But I think I won’t pay mine
either, although I can”. That leads to a very major problem in
the banking sector because all the mortgages are going wrong and you
are talking about sliding property prices

agree that economic forecasting seems to have gone a bit wobbly right
across the board, but if there is any consensus it is that there will
be absolutely minimal growth in the eurozone for the next two years. I
do not think there is any point in looking much beyond that. However,
two years is a long time to have no growth and no relief on this side
of things. For that reason, the banking crisis is certainly not over.
If the ECB is not going to make itself liable for bank debt, another
banking crisis will lead to a sovereign debt crisis and we will be back

are also serious questions about how much freedom the ECB has to buy
sovereign debt. Officially, it is not allowed to print money and the
Germans are desperate to try to keep a hold on how much money the ECB
spends. They want to pass resolutions in Parliament before very much
more money is extended to the ECB. We must accept that, although the
recovery and resolution directive has not gone through, there probably
will be a crisis which will eventually force it through. Then we will
have a very interesting situation. There has been a lot of comment in
this debate already about whether we are covered by a double lock
voting system in the European Banking Authority. But, come on, let us
live in the real world. In the real world, the executive arm will be
the ECB, which will make up the rules as it goes along. I do not think
that it will constantly refer back and say, “We have a crisis on
our hands. Is the EBA happy that we can do this, that or the
other?”. I think that the guidance that will come from the EBA

also have the problem of what on earth we do about democratic

absolutely none as regards the ECB—you will have some very
serious problems when things start to go wrong with banks. This is all
far from being satisfactory and does not bode well at all for those

Davies of Stamford:</Member></B> My Lords, it has happened more times
than I can recall since I have been in this House, nearly two and a
half years, that I have had the 
<?notus-xml column=1277?>pleasure of following the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, or he has had the
task of following me. Although I rarely agree with him about very much,
it is a great pleasure to debate with him. However, I did agree with
two things that he said this afternoon. First, I share his view that
the ECB, in practice, is likely to have a dominating and increasing
intellectual influence on the EBA. Secondly, I very much agree with his
characterisation of the way the European Union makes progress as two
steps forward, one step back. Although he probably would not agree, I
think that is a very sensible, sound and prudent way of advancing in
difficult territory, and I am very content that that has been and
continues to be the process. Had he put the order the other way around,
I would have very much disagreed with him, but his judgment and mine
are very much the same in that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:26:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000483" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000483">I
want to add my own word of tribute to the noble Lord, Lord
Harrison, and to everyone on the committee for having brought forward a
very interesting and timely report. I want to address just two of the
issues on which the committee focused in drawing up that report, and
then to say a few words about the position of the British Government.
First, I recognise that the testimony that the committee received was
rather conflicting. A very important and fundamental issue is whether
it is right to have the monetary authority—in this case, the
European Central Bank—as the supervisory authority for the
banking system. It seems to me that it is right. There is often said to
be a conflict of interest between financial stability and monetary
policy. I see it not so much as a conflict of interest but of
objectives. It is not the sort of conflict that can be eased or solved
by separation of responsibilities. On the contrary, it is the sort of
conflict that can be made a great deal worse by the excessive
separation of responsibilities, because if there is a problem and in
difficult times the supervisory authority feels it necessary in the
interests of financial stability to provide more liquidity to the
market, for example, or to support a particular bank by replacing
deposits that may be fleeing elsewhere, or otherwise, that decision
would immediately have monetary consequences and could be implemented
anyway only by the central bank.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012450000484" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000484">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:27:14"></hs_TimeCode>
central bank needs to be brought in—inevitably, it must be
brought in—and the earlier the better. What is more, the central
bank is in a very good position because of its open market operations,
because it can see to what extent banks are varying their levels of
deposit with itself, and because it knows about any drawings through
the back door by banks in its area of responsibility. It is in a very
good position to see whether liquidity problems are emerging for
institutions in their area. Therefore it seems to me extremely
important that the supervisory authority and the central bank should
work together anyway. The idea of having two different directorates
within one institution—the ECB—responsible for stability
and for monetary policy seems to me a very good solution. I personally
have the greatest confidence that, if there is a difficult decision to
be made—as there will be, inevitably—it should be Mario
Draghi, a person in whom I have the greatest confidence, who has the
responsibility of making that
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:29:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

want to address, which was dealt with in the committee’s report
at some length, is whether it is desirable or acceptable for the
banking industry come in in stages. Only the first stage so far has
been agreed. Of course, it cannot be certain that there can be any
agreement with the second or third stages, the first stage being the
supervision regime and the second and third stages being retail deposit
insurance and resolution procedure and mechanism. Clearly, it is not
ideal; it is not the way one would wish these things to be, but I think
it is a reasonably acceptable situation on a temporary basis, and a
good deal better than nothing. I am glad that we have the process
going<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:29:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:29:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000486" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000486">I
have to say that I think the Germans are not being rational. Maybe the
Germans, and the Dutch, are resisting a European Union-wide resolution
and retail deposit insurance system simply because if there were a
problem and a run on the banks in one member state because in that
particular context depositors no longer had confidence in the
credibility of the retail deposit insurance system, and if that
confidence depended entirely on the credibility of the national
Government, unsupported elsewhere in the EU, there would inevitably be
a systemic crisis. Similarly, if it was necessary for a particular
member state to recapitalise the banks, and that task was out of
proportion to the financial resources of that particular member state,
that would engender immediately a sovereign debt crisis for that
country.</hs_para>

European Union<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:31:11"></hs_TimeCode>.
If Greece went down, we know that there would be effects elsewhere, or
if Portugal went down again there would no doubt be strong effects in
Spain. The consequences of that would be that German and Dutch
banks—to take the examples of the two countries that are
resisting the logic of the banking union, which I think they
are—would find that they are making great write-offs of their
assets that were exposed to these particular markets and deposits with
those banks, and so on. They could be supported only by their own
banks, which would have to be recapitalised by their own national
Governments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:31:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000488" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000488">The
cost of such a bailout would be enormous and vastly greater than any
credible drawing in respect of one, two or three particular
institutions on a retail deposit insurance scheme. I think that the
Germans are being quite illogical about this. They are not looking at
the matter in the long term or in the round. No doubt intellectually
they might agree with me, but they find themselves under political
constraints. I hope that with the various events that are in the

now want to say something about the position of the British Government
in all this, which seems to be perfectly ludicrous, if I may say so. I
understand that they see the banking union as a good thing for others
but not for us. That immediately is a slightly suspect argument, and
one wonders why it is the case. I looked at the committee report to see
what the British Government’s analysis of the national interest
was, and why it was not in our interests to join the banking union if
it made sense for other people. There is no 
<?notus-xml column=1279?>such explanation in the whole document. I shall read what

saying is precisely the reason why the British Government do not want
to join the banking union. They are saying that there must be
mutualisation through the European Central Bank and the banking union

would be sensible for the British Government to share in that
liability, and that if, as he described graphically, there were to be a

to the noble Lord and to the House. It would be very much in our
interests to do so, for the reason that I thought I had explained.
Perhaps the noble Lord did not follow my argument, which was that if
there were a run on the banks in a member state, left to itself it
could engender a systemic crisis that would be far more costly to us,
because British banks would write off a very large portion of their
assets as a result of collapses elsewhere. In order to restore those
banks to financial viability, we would need to recapitalise and support
them in ways that would be much more expensive than the likely cost of
any contribution to the system. I do not want to detain the House for
too long, but I believe that we should have interventions such as this,

position of the British Government is clearly that they are not
interested in making a dispassionate and functional analysis of the
national interest in this area. If they were interested in doing so, it
would have been quoted in the report and we would all know about it.
They have simply decided that on party political grounds, because of
the need to conciliate the Eurosceptics in the Tory party—we
know that this is the way the country’s foreign policy is now
being run; 
<?notus-xml column=1280?>it is being bear-led by the Eurosceptics—it is impossible to do
the rational and sensible thing, so they have simply excluded a priori
any possibility of our joining the banking union, even as a participant
that is not a member of the euro. A large number of countries will join
on that basis—almost certainly a good deal more than the four
that have already announced they will. I expect that every east
European country other than the Czech Republic to come into that
category. As the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, very convincingly argued, that
would cause great problems for us. It is absurd for the British
Government to say that one of the major difficulties here is the voting
system, because the problem would be resolved if we were part of the

we do not join the banking union, there are only three logical
possibilities. I do not think that any Member of the House will want to
argue with my logic, which is very basic and elementary. The first is
that we have a supervisory system that in practice simply tracks that
of the ECB; we will do exactly what the ECB does in its area of
responsibility, for example in matters of licensing, authorisation,
intervention and guidance to banks. That would mean that we were de
facto part of the system, with the important difference that we would
not be part of the decision-making mechanism and would not have the
kind of influence within the system that otherwise we would have
had<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:38:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000497" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000497">The
second possibility is that we adopt a supervisory system that is
somehow stricter and more severe than that adopted on the continent by,
for example, the Republic of Ireland under the ECB. That would mean
that banks here would find that they were at a competitive disadvantage
doing their business out of London as opposed to doing it out of Paris,
Frankfurt or somewhere else. That would not be a very intelligent thing
to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:38:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000498" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000498">The
third possibility is that we adopt a regime of supervision that is
lighter and more complacent than that adopted by the ECB. In the short
term, that might attract institutions that do not like the stricter
regime on the continent, but in a crisis we would be much more exposed
because we would have a lesser degree of credibility. It would be
considered that our institutions and banks were less safe and sound
than those across the Channel, or indeed across the Irish Sea. That,
too, would be a bad day’s work for the country. We would face a
situation in which either we would have no advantage at all, but the
disadvantage of not having the influence that we ought to have and that
is commensurate with the importance of the City, or we would be
otherwise disadvantaged either in competitive terms or in our ability
to withstand crises. That would be a profoundly bad day’s work
for the country—and it is exactly the day’s work that
this Government have done. I deprecate it very strongly
indeed.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_24_PT_1/F058997F98A40240C51F1B9A1735782A43B4AADF" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 January 2013">Thursday,

to be involved in this important developing system and framework. That
is a matter of great concern, and the sooner we have the courage to
align ourselves with these proposals, the better. That may take some
time, and of course nationalism raises its ugly head all the time and
we have to contend with that. My noble friend Lord Hamilton of Epsom
would not admit this or agree with me but, as a result of being driven
out of the exchange rate mechanism in 1992—that hugely
humiliating moment under a Conservative Government—the United
Kingdom was subsequently very scared of the euro, afraid of the single
currency, nervous as hell about what it might develop into and always
looking for things to go wrong.</hs_para>

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may take the House back to the
European banking union proposals and start with my own tribute to the
noble Lord, Lord Harrison, as an enormously courteous and conscientious
chairman of our committee. At least for me, I allowed myself to go to
Brussels, feeling slightly worried as to whether I might be
contaminated by doing so. Two things struck me during the visit. The
first was that President Van Rompuy is a much more impressive and
determined person than I had perceived previously and, to my mind, he
will have had considerable influence in persuading Germany at a crucial
time that it was not a good idea to allow, encourage or force Greece to
leave the euro. Secondly, I cannot resist teasing the noble Lord, Lord
Kerr. While we were wandering around the buildings he said to me,
“The trouble is that none of the young people in the Foreign
Office want to come here any longer because they know we will not be
members in five years’ time”. I thought that that was
quite an interesting little judgment.</hs_para>

further general points. The first is that while the single market
sounds wonderful, what we really want, please, is single market free
trade. I know from my own commercial career that a great deal of the
single market serves the interests of the large players in their
sectors and is highly uncompetitive. Wide access is a fair point, but
to my mind the single market needs a really good dose of free trade if
it is to achieve what it is supposed to achieve. Secondly, I want to
make a point about the City of London and its business. It is becoming
increasingly global and is not just an adjunct of Europe. The
impression I am being given by various European operations in the City
is that you would have to have an EU that was very protectionist and
was even threatening to impose capital controls for it to be
uncomfortable for people in London. If you had an EU which was doing
that, I think that people would not want to put money there anyway. I
am not complacent about the position of the City of London and I well
remember many people warning that if the UK did not join the euro the
City of London would collapse. But, of course, nothing like that
actually
happened<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T17:53:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

union, the first question to ask is: how important are these proposals,
what are they about and what has given rise to them? I have to say that
they do not address the real underlying problem, 
<?notus-xml column=1285?>which is that of different levels of competitiveness, and the point made
by my noble friend Lord Trimble, the risk of locking less competitive
areas into permanent depression, which has happened in the deep south
of America as well as in the south of Italy. The solution to that is
not necessarily internal devaluation, when that is what I call gold
standard austerity. In the big debate about what to do about the
competitiveness issue, common banking supervision is somewhat
peripheral.</hs_para>

banking supervision is important and relevant, I thought it was
supposed to be getting banks better regulated, with a view to the ECB
managing the extent to which the ESM fund was used to bail out banks
where necessary. Now it seems we are being told by Germany that that is
not wanted and it has to be sovereign states that bail out their banks
when they are in trouble and maybe the sovereign states will be helped
by the ESM fund. That is entirely contrary to the principle of trying
to separate the problem of the banks and the state rather than
compounding the two problems. It is pretty important in terms of the
underlying objective as to how this is going to be
resolved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000520" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000520">I
have two more points about supervision. First, I am not entirely clear
how much of the banking system it is going to cover. It looks as if it
will be only the large banks. There is a slight danger of moral hazard
there. The German Landesbanken, the savings banks that control about
€2,500 billion, seem not to be part of it, and lots of other
smaller banks will be left to their local central banks. I make the
point that I think others have made: Credit Anstalt, which started some
rather nasty banking developments in the past, was a small bank. It is
almost as important that small banks are regulated well as for large
banks to be regulated
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000521" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000521">When it
comes to deposit insurance, as Martin Wolf said when we interviewed
him, Germany does not want to have to pay a penny more than it
absolutely has to. I am rather doubtful that deposit insurance will
develop if there is a free-riding risk. You may have similar principles
as to how it operates but I think it extremely unlikely that you are
going to get a system where each country in the eurozone is there to
cover the risks of the
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000522" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000522">What
about the UK and banking union? As we were considering the first point,
I was struck by how considerably it reminded me of the Financial
Services Bill, which we were debating here in Committee, and there was
a quite extraordinary similarity between the proposals for the PRA as a
sensible supervisor rather than regulator of the banking system and the
proposals for what the ECB would be responsible for. Indeed, to
whatever extent there was open discussion, it is absolutely clear to me
that the two go hand in hand—nothing wrong with that at
all—and that the Bank of England will be sensibly collaborating
with the ECB, as it has for a long time, in trying to get the best of
banking supervision both in London and on a pan-EU
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000523" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000523">The
point has been made, but it is important, about the extent to which the
Government did a good deal in terms of the voting powers for the EBA.
It is the EBA that lays down the rules so it is pretty important. I
think it is probably reasonable. We have to have only 
<?notus-xml column=1286?>four countries left that are not participating, which is fairly
unlikely, and three have already indicated that they are unlikely to

have made the point—in particular, the noble Lord, Lord
Hamilton—about the lack of ECB accountability, which is crucial
in a world of gold standard austerity. Rather cynically I make the
point that when people in southern Europe find that the funds from
Germany are not flowing in transfer payments in the way that is
expected as the quid pro quo, that is going to become extremely
difficult politically. The ECB will have to make a real effort to make
itself accountable. Then you have the big issue as to whether it is
going to be accountable to national parliaments or to the European

Desai:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, join other noble Lords in
thanking my noble friend Lord Harrison for an excellent report. I shall
not talk about either Mr Cameron or the UK but want to
concentrate on the banking union. One question I want to pose is why
the eurozone members thought, in the middle of the crisis, that a
solution to the problem was a banking union. If you think about the
financial crisis, both the US and the UK had a banking
union—they were each a single banking union—but it did
not prevent a collapse. Having a single banking regulatory authority,
in our case the FSA, did not prevent the collapse. It is very good that
structures are created but we ought to ask whether those structures
actually do the job they are supposed to

remember in your Lordships’ House about two years ago, or maybe
more, sitting in a discussion about the European system of financial
supervision. A huge structure was set up for a banking authority, an
insurance and occupational pensions authority, and a securities and
market authority. It is obvious that none of those things helped when
the crisis came—or they certainly did not make any impact in
preventing anything that happened. We are now adding another
institution and, as noble Lords have pointed out, there will be
problems in respect of the overlap between the EBA and the
ECB.</hs_para>

basic problem here is that we are only slowly understanding the nature
of the euro, which, in a sense, is a private currency. It is not a
national currency, such as sterling or the dollar, where Governments
have more control over money creation. Euros can be created only if the
ECB is approached by a commercial bank that gives collateral, sovereign
debt or something else, and counterpart money is created. As the noble
Lord, 
<?notus-xml column=1287?>Lord Flight, said, it is like a gold standard but without the
Californian or Australian mines suddenly adding more gold to the total
supply. In particular, the strong deflationary character of the euro
was understood only when the crisis started. Until then, nobody quite
understood what the euro was all about. It is a currency for which
there can be no democratic accountability, because the whole Maastricht
treaty was designed, on the lines of the Bundesbank’s authority,
to have the central bank immune from any democratic control, which was
thought to be the standard of monetary responsibility.</hs_para>

think the ECB is a marvellous institution—right now it is the
only institution which is working at the eurozone level, and it did a
splendid thing by having its outright monetary transactions authority
save Spain from seizing up. However, we have to understand that we have
created a currency in the eurozone which will be permanently
deflationary. Unless you break the Maastricht treaty and allow the ECB
to directly monetise sovereign debt, it will remain
deflationary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000530" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000530"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:04:37"></hs_TimeCode>As
far as I can see, something miraculous will happen to our
competitiveness, but, by and large for the next 10 years or so, the
eurozone will be stagnant. It will be more or less a 0%-to-1%
growth-rate economy. Let us remember that Napoleon looked at a map and
said, “There is China; there’s a sleeping giant; let it
sleep”. Well, that is going to happen to the eurozone. I am not
a Eurosceptic—I am a great admirer of the EU—but this is
what we have constructed for ourselves. Let us remember that, in the
gold standard, you could thrive only with extremely flexible labour and
commodity markets; now, you
cannot<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:05:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000531" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000531">As
many noble Lords know, the EU is not a genuine single market as yet and
we are still waiting for the Lisbon treaty recommendations on flexible
markets to be implemented. In that context, a deflationary
currency has a problem. One of the problems facing the banking union,
as the report quite properly points out, is that you cannot envisage
the ECB looking after 6,000 banks. The ECB will look after the big
players, especially those which have cross-border operations. It will
be like the Premier League—I think the previous speaker said
something about the Premier League council. The problem here is that
you will have to be the national supervisory authority of those banks
to concede power to the ECB. There will also be macroprudential
problems. Those large banks will also have connections with smaller
banks within their own territory, which will then be supervised by
their national authorities. It is not clear that co-ordination between
national authorities, which will be guarding the smaller banks, and the
ECB, which will be guarding the larger banks—the hub-and-spoke
idea that people are talking about—has been worked out as yet.
You will therefore have to devise a set of engagement rules between the
various national regulators and the ECB, because, as far as I know, the
national regulators need not legally be subservient to the
ECB—they may be, but they will not be. That is going to be a
substantial
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:07:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000532" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000532">Along
the way, in a deflationary climate, there might also be mergers and
consolidation. Those 6,000 banks will not remain 6,000 banks; we will
probably 
<?notus-xml column=1288?>see consolidation. I wish that we had fewer banks in Europe than we have
right now, because if you have got a single currency, why do you need
so many different banks? It is not clear to me how the ECB will deal
with the trickier problem of the dynamics of consolidation, mergers and
acquisition and still maintain its authority as a
regulator<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:08:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000533" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000533">Where
the issue will finally come to a head is in whether banking union will
help the recapitalisation of banks which could possibly fail. When in
June 2012 the proposal was made to speed up banking union, the idea was
that it would somehow make it easier to recapitalise banks. As the
noble Lord, Lord Flight, pointed out, there are difficulties about
that, because we lack in the eurozone a genuine pooling of risk.
Governments are not willing, so far, genuinely to pool risks. They
would rather that each Government look after their local failing banks
and recapitalise through issuing more sovereign debt, which the market
may not want to buy at any reasonable price.</hs_para>

Liddle:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin with two personal points. First,
I declare an interest in that the think tank that I chair, Policy
Network, has in the past received support from the City of London
Corporation. Secondly, it is a pleasure to welcome the noble Lord, my
brother-in-law, to the Front Bench opposite. Therefore, there will not

always, it has been an interesting debate, not least because of the
final contribution from my noble friend Lord Desai, which I am still
trying to absorb. My noble friend Lord Harrison began the debate with
an admirable summary of his report. As usual, one wishes that the
country was governed by the committees of your Lordships’ House
rather than by the prejudices of its Executive, because we would be
much better governed. It is an admirable report.</hs_para>

off-the-wall point was made by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner. It is
something on which I have long reflected: why is discussion of Europe
such a male-dominated subject? That is not something that we should
discuss at length today, but we have to take it very seriously if the
pro-Europeans want any chance of winning a referendum, so thank you to
the noble Baroness for raising that
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:12:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

points. First, on the state of the euro itself, I believe that
adjustment is on the way. Things are a lot better than they were. The
question is whether what is occurring is socially and politically
sustainable. I do not think that it will be without more fiscal
flexibility. Nor do I think that it will be sustainable without
considerable debt write-offs, particularly after the German elections
in September. There will have to be an element of a transfer union to
make the position of the mezzogiorno of the south, which the noble
Lord, Lord Trimble, mentioned, sustainable. That will require further
steps towards banking union, particularly in the case of Spain, because
there is such an obvious link between bank debts and the sovereign debt
position.</hs_para>

second point is on the Britain in Europe debate. Banking union is the
fourth major institutional development since the euro crisis started
from which the United Kingdom has stood aside. There was the European
stability mechanism, the euro-plus pact, the fiscal compact and now the
banking union, which was agreed in principle in June 2012, and which
the British urged the eurozone to get on with. Indeed, I think George
Osborne first recommended it as long ago as January 2011. He was very
foresighted about that, but it is something from which we have chosen
to stand aside.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012450000542" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000542">If you read what this
is about, while in the British debate it is presented as a measure to
rescue the single currency, in the continental debate it is about the
creation of what is called a financial market union. I think the noble
Lord, Lord Kerr, pointed that out. In the British Government’s
view, this is all part of a clear narrative in which the eurozone is
integrating and we have to establish a new kind of settlement and
relationship with the members outside it; that is the British
Government's narrative. However, the real question is: to whom does
this narrative apply, other than the United Kingdom? How many other
euro-outs share this conception of the British narrative? I might ask
the Government what their view of that is.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012450000543" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000543">That is a crucial
point, first, in informing a view about the sustainability of the
safeguards that the Government obtained on the banking union in the
December 2012 summit. Secondly, it is fundamental to whether David
Cameron’s essential assertion in his speech
yesterday—that the core of Europe is the single market—is
right. For most members, however, will it actually be the single
currency? This point is fundamental because it is a question of whether
we are going along with the support of other euro-outs, to try to
negotiate a balanced relationship between outs and ins, or whether we
are just making a case for special treatment for Britain, which will be
far more difficult to negotiate.</hs_para>

to make is about the position of the City of London. These are not just
intellectual exercises; we are talking about something that is
fundamental to our national interests. I have long believed that the UK
is overdependent on financial services and I support the whole concept
of rebalancing the economy towards manufacturing. My noble friend Lord
Mandelson’s comment was right; there has been too much financial
engineering and not enough real engineering. I agree with all that.
However, the City is a crucial national interest and the financial
centre of 
<?notus-xml column=1290?>the single market. I also agree with the noble Lord, Lord Flight, that
it is global and very resilient but it has benefited a lot from the
single market in Europe—particularly from the opening-up of the
financial single market, a lot of which occurred under the previous
Labour Government.</hs_para>

worried about this at the time because it was the era of light-touch
regulation. No one worried about the financial imbalances that were
building up between countries and the lack of cross-border regulation.
Well, the banking crisis changed all that and the Government recognised
the need for regulation at EU level. It was a good thing that the
Conservative Government, including Chancellor Osborne, accepted when
they came in what Chancellor Darling had already agreed to: the
establishment of European regulatory
agencies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:18:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Flight:</Member></B> Could I just make this point to the noble Lord?
The investment management industry, in which I spent 40 years of my
career, has still failed to penetrate the EU. There are a variety of
cultural and other barriers, but a lot of American firms came over
thinking that Europe was like America and that all they had to do was
have offices. If one looks at how much money the London retail funds
business has got from the EU, it is still pitifully
small.</hs_para>

one of the reasons why so many foreign-based banks are in London is
because it is the financial centre of the single

point is that the banking crisis has changed the way that we thought
about the City. It has made regulation absolutely essential. The euro
crisis has made banking union essential in order to break the link
between sovereign debt and the fact that nation states have had to
underwrite their banks. It raises difficult issues for us in the UK. As
long as we see ourselves as being outside the single currency, the
centre of the European financial market will be remote from the core of
the banking union. There is also the block vote problem: if regulation
is concentrated through the ECB, we could be
outvoted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000549" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000549">The
UK made a disastrous attempt in 2011 to try to tackle this problem of
what to do. This was at that year’s December summit, where a
paper was circulated late at night without prior consultation with
anyone. Full of complex detail, it had at the top the horrible word
“unanimity”. Basically it was asking for unanimity on
questions of financial services. Not only was this tactically
maladroit, it was strategically misguided. If the sincere wish of the
British Government is to deepen the single market in the European
Union, we cannot go around demanding unanimity on a specific UK
interest, because every other member state will demand unanimity on an
interest specific to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000550" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000550">That is
why the proposals of, for instance, the Fresh Start group are extremely
worrying. They do not demand unanimity but in cases of financial
services they do demand use of the Luxembourg compromise and they talk
about emergency brakes. If you believe in the single market, you cannot
put forward such things in the European Union. I should like to hear 
<?notus-xml column=1291?>from the Government that they have no intention of pressing for the
Luxembourg compromise or emergency brakes in this area. This would be
so damaging to Britain’s interests in pressing forward to the
single
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000551" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000551">However,
the Government achieved a notable success in December with the
acceptance of the double majority principle. I agree with my noble
friend Lord Davies of Stamford that, for protecting our position, this
is a lot better than nothing. Yet I also agree with the noble Lord,
Lord Kerr, who asks how robust this is and whether it will
last.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000552" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000552">First,
this double majority applies only to the banking agency, which is about
the implementing regulations, and not to ECOFIN, which draws up the
legislation. So we do not have a special position there. Secondly, the
noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, is right that the ECB will be the big player
in this and the EBA a weakly staffed and resourced organisation. How do
the Government intend to deal with that? Thirdly, there is the question
of time limitation. How many euro-outs, which are actually banking
union-ins, will there be? If there are a significant number of
euro-outs who will be banking union-ins, how long do we think that this
special double majority arrangement will
last?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000553" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000553">There
are alternatives. I am not saying that this is what the Labour Party
would propose but, as my noble friend Lord Davies said, we have not had
from the Government a proper cost-benefit analysis of what the
alternatives might be. Did they look at how, as a euro-out, we might be
a member of the banking union and whether it could be made to work?
Could we have built on the model of the European Systemic Risk Board,
of which the president of the European Central Bank is chair and the
Governor of the Bank of England is vice-chair? Could we have used that
as an umbrella? The Government have a duty to look at all the possible
alternatives here because this is an issue of such vital importance to
the future of the City. The fear that a lot of us have is that for
reasons of ideology and prejudice, the UK has opted for very much a
second-best, possibly a third-best, solution that would be gravely
damaging to our interests in the long run. I will be grateful to the
Minister if he can deal with some of these
points.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_24_PT_1/4D2CC4AB04E006EF8AA18534B09948C4B34C7814" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 January 2013">Thursday,

thorough work they undertook before they drew up their proposals and
thoughts on the European banking union. As we made clear before, we
believe it is vital for the UK that financial stability is restored to
the eurozone, and these proposals set out ambitious reforms to help
achieve that. Their potential impact is significant in the UK as well
as in the eurozone, and it is important that they are properly

aware, the Government support proposals to establish a comprehensive
banking union in the eurozone and have been engaging positively 
<?notus-xml column=1292?>in the negotiations. Achieving a genuine economic
and monetary union and restoring stability within
the eurozone will require a comprehensive set of
measures, including a single supervisory mechanism, risk
mutualisation plans, such as mutualised deposit guarantees, a common
fiscal backstop and a common framework for rescuing eurozone banks.
These measures together will help to break the dangerous, and mutually
destructive, link between indebted countries and unstable eurozone
banks by mutualising financial risk across eurozone
countries.</hs_para>

meeting marked a significant point in the negotiations to establish a

protections.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000557" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000557">First,
the ECB will have a duty to have regard to the unity and integrity of
the internal market in performing its supervisory tasks. The noble
Lord, Lord Kerr, said that that may not be a new duty, but it is quite
helpful to have it reiterated. Not only that, it will also be subject
to an obligation to ensure that no action, proposal or policy of the
ECB shall directly or indirectly discriminate against any member state
or group of member states as a venue for the provision of banking or
financial services in any currency. The ECB will be required
to agree a bilateral memorandum of understanding with the UK—by
which we mean the PRA—setting out how it will co-operate in
discharging its supervisory tasks, so we can look forward to a
constructive and collaborative supervisory dialogue underpinning the
robust supervision of cross-border firms and activities throughout the
EU. The way in which the supervisory authorities in the UK and the EU
work together now, not least the ECB and EBA, is through close,
professional working. It is not done in the spirit of two mutually
opposed forces coming together on a day-to-day basis with different
views. They are technicians, very often, trying to deal with common,
difficult, technical problems, and that has infused the discussions to

single market, which mean that the PRA and ECB will be operating on
equal terms. The Council agreed the principle that the ECB’s
supervisory powers should be analogous to those available under Union
law to national supervisors in non-participating member states. Powers
and decisions of the EBA, for example in cases of binding mediation in
the event of disputes between supervisors, will apply equally to the
ECB and other supervisors. So the ECB has no special

most importantly, as a number of noble Lords have pointed out, the
Council agreed that key decisions in the EBA will be made by a
double-majority voting system. Therefore, although we hope that the EBA
will continue to be driven by consensus, with votes very much the
exception, the voting arrangements will ensure that all member states,
whether or not participating in the banking union, will continue to
have a meaningful voice. In practical terms, where the 
<?notus-xml column=1293?>EBA votes on a standard which applies to firms throughout Europe, this
will require the support of those in the banking union and those
outside it. Not only will the usual qualified majority apply, but a
majority of the group of non-participating member states—which,
of course, includes the UK—will also have to support any
proposal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:30:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000560" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000560">A
number of noble Lords have expressed support for these protections. It
is fair to say that even if the Council had not actually read the
report of the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, it did
address a number of the other issues raised in it. First, it clarifies
the scope of ECB supervision. It establishes robust governance
arrangements in the ECB which separate the performance of the
ECB’s monetary policy and supervision tasks. These arrangements
will also ensure that those non-eurozone member states which choose to
participate in the SSM will have a voice in decision-making. We should
not think that separating those two elements of what the ECB does is
too difficult a job. That is, broadly speaking, what we are going to be
doing with the Bank of England, the PRA and the other bodies that we
have just established here. It is eminently doable. The way in which
the EU and the ECB are setting about doing it looks perfectly
reasonable.</hs_para>

participating member states, and decisions relating to debt
mutualisation and common fiscal backstops are more difficult still.
None the less, in the context of a banking union for participating
member states, the UK supports these concepts in principle. Having said
that, we cannot provide more detailed views until the proposals have

the specific points raised by noble Lords in their speeches, the noble
Lord, Lord Harrison, was the first to raise the question of the
concentration of power in the ECB, which I have spoken about in part.
As I have said, there is an analogy with the Bank of England to a
certain extent. For clarity, although there are 6,000 banks within the
eurozone area, the ECB proposes to directly supervise on a continuing
basis probably a couple of hundred of them. However, it will retain the

<?notus-xml column=1294?>power to go in if there is a particular problem, where a national
supervisory body may be thought by the ECB not to be dealing with an
issue adequately.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Flight, used the analogy of the ECB’s role
being a bit like the PRA as opposed to the FCA in the UK. It is not a
direct analogy but there are some relevant comparisons. We think that
the system we have set up will be robust. If that is the case, in
principle, the one being envisaged here also should be. The problem is
that it is a multiplication of the kind of problems that we had here
when the crisis struck. When everything is going well, you can make
things work. But, here, we had a real problem with managing a financial
crisis because two or three individuals could not make the system
work.</hs_para>

individuals but when you have a system involving a minimum of 17
national supervisors and a super-supervisor, as it were, no one in
their right mind would think that dealing with a crisis will be easy.
In particular, by definition, no one will have been through it before,
so they will be learning on the job. That is an inevitable consequence
of doing anything new. The ECB is working very hard to put in

attitudes are, like ours, dictated by their domestic debates. Some have
confirmed that they will not join for now, some have confirmed that
they are unlikely to join in the long term and others have said that
they intend to join at some point. However, given that the eventual
package is not known, we do not think that it is wise for us to give
names at this stage because it would be unfair to say that all those
countries have formed an absolutely settled view about what they are
going to do. As noble Lords say, if the number of “outs”

European Council. National parliaments of participating member states
will be able to hold it to account through questions. I think that for
the foreseeable future national parliaments will play a larger role in
terms of the profile of the accountability than does the European
Parliament, given its low profile. This debate here is an example of

misleading, given that we are working towards a common rulebook. So the
supervisory approach will be broadly common. For example, the recovery

common rulebook. However, supervision is about how strictly the
banks’ activities are looked at, and that affects authorisation,
licensing and review of the asset quality of the banks concerned. In
these areas potentially there will be very considerable scope for a
difference of approach by different supervisors. That is exactly what I

speak on financial services but also to report on Greece. The other
point made by the noble Baroness that the noble Lord, Lord Liddle,

European; they are British and European. Every report we ever write has
a large section on how the United Kingdom will be affected by what is

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Energy and

are today bringing before the House amendments to the Green Deal
framework regulations. We have been further developing the framework
over the past few months, in readiness for the full launch later this
month. This has resulted in a number of SIs being developed and laid
before the House. These changes are necessary to optimise the legal

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:54:19"></hs_TimeCode>before we begin
to debate, I would like to take the opportunity to speak about the
Green Deal—the transformational energy efficiency programme. I
am delighted that it will be going live next week, unlocking
unprecedented opportunities for both consumers and businesses
alike<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:51:03"></hs_TimeCode>. The Green
Deal will provide a stable, transparent and long-term policy framework
which consumers can trust and in which businesses can invest. It will
allow consumers to pay for some or all of the cost of energy-saving
property improvements through savings on their energy bills. The Green
Deal can be used to lever in billions of pounds of private investment
to improve the energy efficiency of UK properties. It will empower
small and medium-sized businesses to enter a new market as well as
offer consumers more choice and innovation than before. There has
already been interest from industry in getting involved in the Green
Deal and it is exciting to see a steady stream of participants becoming
approved and using the Green Deal quality mark prior to launch on 28
January.</hs_para>

role in helping to kick-start our “go-early” initiative.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:52:11"></hs_TimeCode> Government

now introduce the statutory instrument that will form the basis of our
discussion. We are making a small number of amendments to the Green
Deal framework regulations which, subject to the outcome of
today’s debate, will come fully into force on 28
January 2013. The framework regulations create an authorisation regime
to regulate the conduct of Green Deal market participants and ensure
that consumers are protected. They cover conditions that must be met
when a Green Deal plan is established and how it should be disclosed.
The amendments we propose will make enhancements to the Green Deal
framework. We have increased the frequency of some reporting
requirements from annually to monthly for all Green Deal participants.
These include the number and value of plans, cancelled plans, and the
number of resolved and outstanding complaints. This is to ensure that
we can monitor 
<?notus-xml column=1299?>compliance to protect customers without imposing undue burdens on
business and to protect the reputation of the Green Deal
itself.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012450000590" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000590">Other
changes enable us to streamline key processes. We are improving the
clarity of our complaints system by defining when a complaint should be
directed to Green Deal assessors and when to the providers. Further to
ensure effective policing of activity in the market, Green Deal
accreditation bodies have been added to the list of organisations that
can report a breach of regulations by a participant to the Secretary of
State.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012450000591" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012450000591">In
addition, an important technical update is being made to the
circumstances under which an energy performance certificate must be
updated by the Green Deal provider or customer. These include where an
energy efficiency measure has been removed, where the provider has
changed and where the liability of the bill payer to make payments has
changed. This update will ensure that customers and businesses have

little time before next Monday’s launch of the Green Deal, the
Government must react swiftly to urgent criticisms of the costs of the
scheme to potential consumers. Up-front charges, high interest rates
for finance, and penalties, are all increasing the reluctance of
households to take up Green Deal plans. At a time of rising energy
prices, falling living standards and stretched budgets, the Government
must not allow scheme charges to undermine the confidence of consumers
in going ahead with very necessary home improvements. Not only would a
successful Green Deal cut long-term energy bills for households, it
would reduce the nation’s energy demand and save the planet from
excessive carbon
emissions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:56:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012461000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012461000003">The
amending framework regulations are accepted as part of the refining
process to improve the operation of the Green Deal, with provisions
regarding energy performance of buildings certificates, reporting
requirements for the progress of the Green Deal and provisions
regarding enforcement. We expect further amending regulations—I
hope they will be few in number—as the Green Deal rolls out and
experience is
gained<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:57:18"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Green Deal has been a long time in gestation, and we will all welcome
the official launch next week on 28
January<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:57:26"></hs_TimeCode>. After
raising a few points on the regulations, perhaps it would be an
opportune time to reflect on the Green Deal and ask the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=1300?>for her forecasts and assessments, and for us to pass comments, with
constructive criticisms, on the likely uptake

regulations regarding the energy performance of buildings certificates
are largely technical and non-controversial. They will help to make
sure that information following Green Deal plans is up-to-date and
accurate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:57:57"></hs_TimeCode>.
Schedule 2 of the regulations lists the new monthly reporting of
information requirement for Green Deal providers. This will greatly
assist in monitoring the progress of the Green Deal and will provide
necessary statistics for analysis. However, one of the most
controversial aspects of the Green Deal concerns cancellation charges
and penalty charges for early repayment. It is generally regarded as
one of the key parameters influencing the consumer’s final
decision on whether to go ahead with a Green Deal
plan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T18:58:30"></hs_TimeCode>. If these
charges are disliked completely or labelled disagreeable, it may well
be that the Green Deal plan may not be taken up. Why are reports
regarding these questions not part of the monthly requirements? Will
the Minister clarify that paragraph 1(g) of Schedule 2, on page 7 of
the regulations, which
specifies,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13012461000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012461000037">“the

I might suggest some additional reports, for example of the total
number of Green Deal plans proposed but not taken up. Another report
could be of the total number of cancellation charges levied, together
with the average fee. On the issue of amounts repaid early, covered in
paragraph 1(f), could a requirement be included to monitor the number
of early repayments bearing charges, and the average
charge?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012461000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012461000036">On the
cancellations, it would also be useful to know what element or measures
in a Green Deal plan of many actions were not going to be proceeded
with. Does the Minister agree that this information may be critical in
assessing consumer confidence? Will she look at how this could be added
to the regulations, which, by convention, are not amendable? If she
rejects this requirement, how does she propose that this controversial
aspect will be monitored? Information must not just be for
business-gathering purposes; it must also inform policy and help
corrective
action<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T19:00:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012461000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012461000006">The
Minister in the other place, in response to my honourable friend
Luciana Berger, said that penalty charges could happen only when a
Green Deal provider would make a loss as a result, and that the onus is
on the provider to prove the case. Where is this in the regulations?
How will the provider make the case? To whom will the current consumer
have a

controversial aspect concerns up-front fees. When Labour raised the
cost of assessments with Ministers during the passage of the Energy Act
in 2011, Ministers replied that it was expected that companies would
not charge for assessments. However, from a <I>Guardian</I> newspaper
report, it appears that Ministers are wrong. Consumers will face
charges of up to £150 as an assessment fee, whether or not they
take out Green Deal plans. The report states that British Gas will
charge £99 for its experts to go into homes and judge what
measures, such as fitting cavity wall insulation, would be most
appropriate for each property. Two of 
<?notus-xml column=1301?>the companies contacted by the <I>Guardian</I> say that they would
refund the full assessment fee or part of it if works were carried out
by them. Does the Minister accept the YouGov poll that found that 51%
of consumers concerned about up-front costs rated them the biggest
obstacle to making energy-efficiency improvements to their
homes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T19:01:41"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012461000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012461000008">The
third element of the regulations concerns improving the clarity of the
complaints process by imposing sanctions and including the Secondary
State in the process, yet the regulations do not say what the sanctions
are. Will the Minister clarify whether they have been included
elsewhere and that it has escaped me? It is important to know and agree
what powers and sanctions are being given to the Secondary State. In a
debate on these regulations in the other place, the Minister stated
that he believed the expected cost to be £335 per complainant to
the ombudsman, and that the costs would be borne by the Green Deal
provider. Will the Minister confirm this figure and say whether there
would be any judgments at all whereby the cost or some part of it ended
up being paid by the
complainant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T19:02:38"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012461000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012461000009">Will
the Minister clarify the process of consultation? Were the measures in
the regulations consulted on with the public in a discrete fashion and
in a discrete consultation process? I have read the Explanatory
Memorandum, which seems to suggest that the regulations have arisen
from consultations and events generally from November 2011, closing a
year ago on 18 January 2012. Will the Minister please
clarify<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T19:03:13"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012461000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012461000010">A
few further considerations arise from the debate on these regulations
last Monday in the other place, and indeed the Minister has echoed
those remarks. In his opening remarks, Greg Barker, the Minister in the
other place, said that things had already got off to a flying start in
October with the Go Early initiative. Is this the initiative that
resulted in just five assessments? Is this the initiative that
highlighted problems in the software for assessments? Will the Minister
confirm whether the Minister in the other place was correct to state,
as she indeed has done today, that £22 million had been provided
to stimulate early demand in seven core cities? In the press release a
figure of £12 million was put forward. While a test or pilot is
to be recommended, this seems to be a soft launch. Was there a reason
why the important city of Liverpool was excluded from this
list<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-24T19:04:17"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012461000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012461000011">The
Minister in the other place went on to speak about the cashback scheme,
worth £125 million, launched on 14 January. I am surprised that
this is a government scheme when, according to Ministers, “the
market will provide”, and other matters seem to be a commercial
matter for the Green Deal Finance Company. Already this scheme seems to
have been amended. Can the noble Baroness confirm whether the
£1,000 maximum level referred to has indeed been lifted and

third element in the opening remarks of the Minister in the other place
and of the noble Baroness concerned the £2.9 million budget for

previous debates we have all acknowledged the ambitious plan and the
huge difficulties that the Green Deal faces. Unlike a commercial
operation, the Government have to do their thinking aloud as they make
the regulations to set out the parameters on which commercial companies

Government to hear when we offer advice and give warnings. I
am not sure that they are listening well enough when it
comes to the influence of certain aspects of the take-up of the Green
Deal plans on consumers. We have debated previously the influence of
the interest rate on whether consumers assess the Green Deal
as a good deal. Against a bank rate of only 0.5%, 7%, or even 6.9%,
does not seem a good deal, especially when it will, in
effect, double the amount of repayment over a
25-year period. This is a completely different circumstance to a
short-term payday loan and, like a mortgage, there is the security of

responding to the noble Lord’s point about high interest rates.
As he will be aware, the rate is to be set by the Green Deal Finance
Company and no doubt will reflect a safe and competitive level. The
rate has not yet been confirmed, but I expect that to be done in the
next day or so. The noble Lord will have to wait just a little longer
for a response to that question. However, I take on board his point
that the rate has to be competitive. That fits in with our wish to try
to ensure that we meet the golden rule, which he rightly
raised—namely, that no bill payer should pay more than what he
or she is currently paying. That is absolutely the right way to look at
this.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012461000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-0003.htm#13012461000022">The

about the forecast for take-up rates of the Green Deal. I would say to
him that it has been very promising and there is a great deal of
interest in it. However, as he recognises, we are proceeding with a
soft launch because we want to ensure that people understand what the
Green Deal is and that all the systems needed to deliver it are fully
tested and in place. The noble Lord is right to say that when the Green
Deal is taken up, many households will see a great difference in their
energy consumption and it will impact on their energy

important element. The industry and providers have also welcomed it. He
listed a number of other things that he would like to see included on

mentioned the £125 million provision for early take-up; the

£125 million for early take-up is a good way of encouraging
people to take advantage of the scheme very early on. Perhaps I

cities to the £22 million referred to by the noble Lord. He
referred to the fact that a newspaper had reported that it was
£12 million. We have given out £12 million to seven core
cities; we expect Liverpool to be added to the list of core cities.
That is the £12 million, but another £10

impose. Of course, this very much depends on the circumstances. There

to tell the noble Lord lots of things. My own view is that, having
talked to consumer groups and the industries within the sector, this is
going to revolutionise the way in which people think about how to make
their homes much more energy-efficient. It is about raising awareness.
While we are rolling this out, we are very keen to ensure that
consumers take control 
<?notus-xml column=1305?>and have responsibility over what happens in their own properties. This
approach is much more holistic. It is not just about short-term
planning on, say, loft insulation; it is about looking at the whole
property. I think consumers will be quite encouraged that this will be
a long-term gain for them and their properties, and of course on their
bills.</hs_para>

Adoption</I> describes the national crisis in adopter recruitment and
puts forward the Government’s proposals for addressing it in the
short and long term. Copies of this document have been placed in the
House Libraries. The number of children approved by the courts for
adoption has been rising steeply, with no comparable increase in the
number of adopters approved. We have identified some significant
structural weaknesses that undermine the effectiveness of the adopter
recruitment and approval system. These weaknesses must be addressed
swiftly and decisively in the interests of a significant and
sustainable increase in the number of adopters. We are therefore
proposing to take a new legislative power at the earliest opportunity.
This would allow the Secretary of State to require local authorities to
seek approved adopters from other
organisations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012437000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-wms0001.htm#13012437000006">If
necessary, we will use that power to reform the adopter recruitment
system. However, we recognise that this is a radical step. If local
authorities are able to bring forward alternative proposals that would
deliver a similarly radical shift in the system’s capacity, then
we will not need to use this
power.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012437000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124-wms0001.htm#13012437000007">We want
to see the system reformed for the long term, but we need short-term
action too for children in the system now. So today I am announcing
that the £150 million Early Intervention Grant
topslice, which the Secretary
of State for Communities and Local Government confirmed in announcing
the local government settlement for 2013-14, will be returned in full
to local authorities in the form of the adoption reform grant. This
funding will help to secure reform of the adoption system. The adoption
reform grant will be in two parts. £100 million of the
£150 million will not be ring-fenced and will be available to
local authorities to support adoption reform. It will enable local
authorities to target funding at the entire adoption process and the
specialist support children need. They will retain the discretion to
use this funding to address their highest priority needs, such as the
major backlog of children waiting for adoption.</hs_para>

£50 million will be ring-fenced. It will support local
authorities to address structural problems with adopter recruitment,
particularly the uneconomic fee that local authorities are charged for
adopters approved by other authorities, which is lower than that
charged by voluntary adoption agencies. It will also help in the search
for adopters willing and able to take children who are more difficult
to place, and so tend to wait longer for new homes.</hs_para>

council then discussed three issues relating to data protection: the
household exemption, the right to be forgotten, and sanctions. The
Commission explained the working of the regulation on all three points
and argued that the right to be forgotten was not incompatible with the
freedom of expression and that processing for journalistic or historic
purposes was specifically allowed. The UK supported a broader household
exemption than in the Commission proposal and advocated the use of a
risk-based approach. The UK also supported appropriate deletion rights
for data subjects, but voiced concern about unachievable expectations
in the right to be forgotten and felt that the starting point should be
the current directive. The UK thought national supervisory authorities
should be given greater discretion in deciding sanctions. The UK called
for the text to return to Ministers before any mandate with the
European Parliament was agreed in council. Many member states expressed
support for the direction of work proposed by the Irish presidency,

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member> It is for individual departments to
effectively manage their resources so as to remain within their
budgets. As each department is responsible for meeting the costs of any
redundancy compensation to be paid to their staff it is right, and
appropriate, for them to assess the efficacy of making any of their
employees redundant in the light of their business needs and financial
situation. The Cabinet Office exercises oversight of the operation of
the Civil Service Compensation Scheme so as to ensure that departments
are operating within scheme rules. This does not extend to monitoring
the numbers of staff departing under the
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012459000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130124w0001.htm#13012459000006">The
role of the scheme administrator appointed by the Cabinet Office is to
calculate and pay compensation in accordance with the scheme rules, and
ensure that the full costs are charged to departments. It is then for
individual departments to report these costs in their resource accounts
