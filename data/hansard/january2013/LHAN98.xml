million pregnant women and young children with nutrition programmes and

the year. The UK will continue to tackle global
hunger<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T14:43:23"></hs_TimeCode> in 2013,

minerals endure long-term malnutrition and consequent diseases,
stunting and premature death. Does the Minister therefore agree that
the G8 at County Fermanagh should offer clear support to the global
Scaling Up Nutrition movement, which provides an excellent framework
for donors and, indeed, for developing countries, calls for support for

the importance of good nutrition and the problems of stunting and

on voluntary guidelines on the management of land and other natural
resources. It is extremely important that there is transparency here,
that the governance of land tenure is addressed, and that when
countries consider the position on tenure in their countries they
consider food security, the impact on the environment and consultation
with those involved. We are very actively pushing that

on this area. It has been a diminishing problem, but it is still there
on a massive scale. That is what we have to tackle. We have to welcome
the fact that in many parts of the world now undernutrition has now
reduced, but he is quite right: it is still a major problem,
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. We are very supportive of
smallholders. We are helping in 13 countries. Some 500
million farmers are smallholders, with less than two hectares of land,
and they are at the margin in their ability to feed their

Lord, Lord Bates, put it so well the last time this was before us, it
is obscene that almost half the food available to us in the West and
the north is thrown away, while desperate people utterly dependent on
food production are seeing their land bought up by multinational
companies to service that greed? Must that not be a priority at the G8,
and it is not intimately related to the whole question of security, not
only in food security sense but in building stable societies less prone

we look at the situation in Mali right now. The Foreign Secretary is
quite right to emphasise that it is important that we are supporting
those in Mali through aid programmes. The noble Lord is right to
emphasise the problem of waste of food, but there is also a lot of
wastage among those smallholders simply because they do not have the
right storage for their crops, and so on. It has to be a very high
priority to ensure that, wherever it is in the world, food, which is so
important to relieve this problem, is not
wasted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T14:49:12"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T14:48:19"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T14:48:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I am sure he has noted that transparency in this regard is going to be
on the G8’s agenda. One important development is the risk to
companies and banks these days related to what they do in various
countries. The spotlight is potentially on them. We have seen the
backlash in the United Kingdom about the paying of tax, and we need to
get across very clearly the need for transparency, we need to highlight
what is happening in different countries and we need to point out to
companies that they incur risks

food production might decline by 7% by 2050 because of climate change,
and in some areas of the world by 20%. I emphasise that the
United Kingdom takes this extremely seriously. One of the
issues that came out of the hunger events that were hosted at the time
the Olympics was a focus in the United Kingdom on agritech business.
Defra, DfID and BIS are taking that forward because clearly investment
in research, in which we have great strengths in the United Kingdom,
should and could help to relieve some of these

in Northumberland, which has far more onshore wind farms than any other
county in England. Is the Minister aware of the concern there that
excessive subsidy-driven wind farm development is potentially harming
other parts of our regional economy, particularly the tourist industry,
which has achieved a great deal in recent years? While being supportive
of renewables and, obviously, of achieving a good energy mix, I ask the

of wind farm development, to look at the situation in Northumberland in

Howe:</Member></B> My department is engaging actively with the
financial services sector for the very reasons that the noble Lord
suggests. As I have said, care needs are very difficult to predict and
care costs can be open-ended in the current social care system. At the
moment, that makes financial products very expensive to buy and
difficult to develop. There are many reasons why people do not consider
financial products for their care at present, including a lack of
awareness that they have to pay. We very much hope that the
introduction of a Dilnot-type solution to this problem will encourage
the financial services sector to develop these products and we believe
that that will
happen.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_21_PT_1/2E435DF1737517102B4A844D7AE023538261A978" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 January 2013">Monday,

the death of Behrooz Rahimian and have made inquiries specifically in

residents of Camp Ashraf have moved to Camp Liberty. It is not a
refugee camp as such; it is a place where individuals are being
assessed as to the countries to which they could be relocated. Four
have already come to the United Kingdom, a fifth who was offered that
has decided not to come and about 52 others are being
considered for coming to the United Kingdom. In relation to property at
Camp Ashraf, I can assure my noble friend that about 100 residents of

responsible authorities to, let us say, be let off the hook when it

bugbear in this Bill, retrospective changes. In particular, the
protections that are present in Clause 20 do not apply to adverse
retrospective changes to any of the non-protected elements of public
service schemes—they only kick in if the adverse effect is
deemed significant. Amendment 116A would ensure that the protections in

protected elements in Clause 20(5): the extent to which the

purpose of the Bill—members’ contribution rates and
benefit accrual rates. However, this means some very important elements
of a pension scheme are not protected, most notably the definition of
pensionable earnings, early retirement rights and ill-health benefits.
If a responsible authority decides to make adverse retrospective
changes to something as important as ill-health retirement benefits, or
indeed to the definition of pensionable earnings, which will of course
knock on to the final pension provision, it is unacceptable for such
adverse retrospective changes to be excluded from the protections in

name adds to the definition of the “protected period”, as
it is called, to accommodate the different closure date of the local
government pension scheme. Clause 16 closes the local government
pension scheme on 1 April 2014, but all other schemes are closed on 5
April 2015, one year later. However, Clause 20 defines the protected
period as one of 25 years beginning on 1 April 2015. This
means that there is a window of a year in which the protections under
Clause 20 will not apply to the local government pension scheme. This
amendment would correct what seems to be a drafting error by ensuring
that there is 
<?notus-xml column=944?>no such peculiar window in which the protected elements of the local
government pension scheme are not, in fact, protected, as the
Government clearly seem to intend, by Clause 20. By aligning the

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:29:16"></hs_TimeCode> understanding

amendment to reduce that period to 12 years was not entirely random: it
was basically part of a previous amendment suggesting a post-2006
review  by the OBR of fiduciary valuations. However, the
fundamental point is that whatever Government are in power, they will
be obliged to make major amendments. We started off with a cash-flow
deficit of £15.4 billion by 2017. However, the ONS has advised
that the longevity assumption is six years shorter than it ought to be,
so that adds another £7.2 billion; and now that we have the
government single pension proposals, the public sector pension schemes
will not get the contracted-out NI contributions, which worsens the
cash flow by about another £5 billion. So, we are going to have
a cash-flow deficit per annum of approaching £30
billion.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012110000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-0001.htm#13012110000058">If
anyone thinks that that is sustainable in the present environment of
deficits which are well above maintainable levels, they are not seeing
reality. I repeat: whoever is in power in the next five years will be
obliged to review the whole aspect of public sector pensions if the
cash-flow deficits turn out to be at the sort of levels that now look
likely. Limiting the protected period to 12 years is hopeful—not

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a rather disparate group of
amendments. I will start with government Amendment 117. Amendment 117
is part of the wider 
<?notus-xml column=946?>package of amendments that seek to meet the desire of the Northern
Ireland Executive to be removed from the provisions of the Bill. The
provisions in question would have required a report to be laid in the
Northern Ireland Assembly, should the responsible authority have sought
to make changes to the protected elements in the schemes for which
Northern Ireland has devolved competence. Given that this is
consequential and in line with many other amendments relating to

currently intended that the new Local Government Pension Scheme will be
in place earlier than April 2015. Concern was expressed in another
place—which the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, expressed here
today—that the scheme would lack the protection in this clause
until 1 April 2015 had passed. The amendment seeks to deal with this
concern. Although the Government have no intention of making changes to
the core elements of the new Local Government Pension Scheme in its
first year, we are happy to rectify the situation. The amendment will

of times in your Lordships’ House. As discussed when we were
considering the potential amendments laid to Clause 3, the Government

Government’s position on the new 2015 schemes. First, we believe
that if the cost cap is necessary, it will work. If it does not, the
solution does not lie in reducing the consultation and reporting
requirements that govern fundamental changes to public service pension
schemes. To make this amendment would risk causing unjustified concern

118B was discussed in another place, and there the Government set out
their belief that the elements of the new pension scheme designs which
have been designated as “protected” are the right ones.
It is right that members and their representatives should seek
reassurance from the Government over their commitment to the new
schemes that have been negotiated. However, these schemes must work in
the real world. Public service pension schemes require regular tweaking
to keep them in line with all kinds of other legislation, and the
processes in Clause 20 are not designed for such changes. The protected
elements, which have been included by the Government in
Clause 20, are those which form the core of the new schemes.
The kind of regular, purely administrative, changes that are made to
the regulations of public service pension schemes are unlikely to touch
on these aspects of design. If they ever do, it would be right for
scheme members to be reassured about the impact of such changes through
the procedures in Clause 20. Those elements suggested by the amendment
go beyond this. These are aspects of design which are likely to require
administrative changes, and so the proper consultation requirements
which should apply to them are those set out in Clause 19. It is not as

earnings, for example, we are about to remove all references to primary
care trusts in connection with their role in establishing pensionable

reflect the fact that PCTs are on the way out. On ill health benefits,
we have made changes that allow scheme medical advisers to determine
that a member can satisfy the severe ill health condition for the

to include the scheme’s definition of pensionable earnings,
ill-health benefits and early retirement rights under the so-called

administrative, but they were not in the least reassuring. The fact
that there were a series of administrative changes does not mean that
future changes will also be of such limited significance,
because the clause allows for greater changes. It is like
saying that it might not be very significant if one player on a
football team has a shirt that does not quite match those of the
others. It is very significant if he is then not allowed on to the

sets this in the context of the cost of public service pensions having
risen by a third over the past decade to £32 billion and of
those increases having fallen mostly on the taxpayer. Subsequently, in
2010, the Chancellor announced a proposed increase in member
contributions of 3.2 percentage points, to be phased in progressively
over three years from April 2012. Let me be clear: the Government stand
behind the justification for these increases and fully expect them to
be implemented and carried forward into the new schemes. Proposed
scheme final agreements clarify this. The noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, is
right to raise the issue of participation, and I welcome the
opportunity to set out what we are doing to maximise
this.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13012110000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-0001.htm#13012110000077">First,
we have protected the lowest earners from the increases. We know that
they are those most likely to opt out, so there will be no increases
for those earning under £15,000, and limited increases for those
earning under £21,000. Secondly, we have split up each year of
proposed increases so that we can assess the impact, particularly on
opt-out, of year one, before finalising the approach for the next. As a
result, I am pleased to be able to say that following the increases in
contributions in April 2012, scheme data show that there has been no
discernible increase in opt-out. This perhaps should not come as a
surprise. Union representatives at the Bill’s evidence session
in the other place unanimously stated that they would continue to
advocate membership to their

reminiscent of the most notorious part of the Public Bodies Act, which

think that the House should be willing to accept this particular

create but we are dealing with people’s pensions, which is an

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government have always been clear
that pension reform should extend to all public service pensions.
Clause 28 and Schedule 10 are the means by which that work will be
continued, even after enactment of the Bill. To date, the Government
have focused their resources on reforming the largest public service
pension schemes as these affect the vast majority of public service
employees. As such, pension reform for the smaller public bodies is not
as advanced as the reforms to these major schemes. Noble Lords may be
reassured to know that reform of these smaller schemes is
anticipated to be completed by 2018, after the reforms to the larger
schemes are operational in 2015.</hs_para>

policy with regard to these schemes is clear: any public body whose
defined benefit pension scheme needs to be reformed is listed in
Schedule 10 or may be added to it. Members of these schemes should be
well aware that their pensions are in scope of the reforms. However,
the arrangements surrounding some of these pension schemes are complex
and it may be unnecessary to include them in Schedule 10 if they are
able to reform on their own initiative. If so, they will not need to be
listed.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012110000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-0001.htm#13012110000092">To
date, we have worked hard to ensure that all the public bodies that
operate pension schemes eligible for reform by the powers under Clause
28 have been listed in Schedule 10. However, we are trying to be
realistic with this provision: of the more than 400 public bodies that
provide pensions to their employees or officeholders, some may not yet
have been identified appropriately. That said, I can assure the noble
Lord that the vast majority of public bodies that provide pensions
through one of the major public service schemes will be reformed 
<?notus-xml column=955?>by Clause 1, so the number of public bodies that may have to be added
will be extremely low. However, if we need to include such schemes, the
Bill needs to provide for the Treasury to add them via Schedule

note what the noble Lord says about draconian powers but it is worth
noting that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did

that we want all public bodies to adopt schemes which are in line with
the provisions of the Bill. So, if the schemes do that, that is fine.
There are a number of schemes, some of which are listed already and
some of which may need to be listed subsequently, when the Government

enables IPSA, in relation to MPs and the officeholders within its

not happen because the structure of the clause means that it disapplies
the accrued rights protection in CRAG and the so-called “double
lock” enshrined in CRAG would not exist at all. At its most
simple, the difficulty with the clause is that it will import language
into CRAG that is inconsistent with the drafting that is there already.
With inconsistency comes ambiguity and that risks undermining the
double lock that currently exists. The clause fails, for instance, to
speak of the removal of the protection as applying only in respect of

not extend the application of the carve-out to any benefits other than
relevant accrued benefits? I realise that the second question has some
technical dimension to it, to which I shall briefly refer. It arises
from the wording currently in Clause 31 by way of proposed new
paragraph 29A(1) to Schedule 6 of CRAG. It provides that the carve-out
from accrued rights protections, to enable the introduction of an NPA
that uprates automatically with changes to SPA, is limited. It will
apply only to “relevant accrued benefits”. Defined at the
proposed new paragraph 29A(3)(d) to Schedule 6 to CRAG, they are

the noble Lord that the clause as drafted does not provide for a wide
power to amend accrued rights under the relevant schemes. The power 
<?notus-xml column=959?>provided for in the clause is actually very narrow and the disregard for
the accrued rights protections in CRAG applies only to this very narrow
provision. The power simply allows those responsible for the schemes to
amend them to create a link between normal pension age under the scheme
and state pension age, which would apply to benefits accrued from the
point the amendment takes place. That is to say, once that link is in
place any increase in state pension age will increase the normal
pension age, but only for those benefits accrued after the creation of
the link. That is the key point. The clause does not allow for changes
to the indexation arrangements for deferred members, sweeping changes
to the death in service benefits or removal of the final salary link.
All these areas will continue to have the same level of protection
under Schedule 6 as
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012110000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-0001.htm#13012110000109">I

considerable concern, as the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, said. I should
like to put on the record the Government’s view that this phrase
does not open the door to a wider interpretation of the benefits that
could be subject to the state pension age link as a consequence of this
clause. It is important to include this phrase, so it is clear that the
clause does not reduce the power the scheme already had to change the
normal pension age for benefits that accrue after the change. However,
it is also clear from the current drafting of the clause that the only
accrued benefits that come within the new power are
“relevant” accrued benefits, as defined in new paragraph
29A(3)(d). I hope therefore that the noble Lord will find sufficient
comfort in what I have said to be able to withdraw his

More than 40 were taken hostage and at least 12 were killed, with at
least a further 20 unaccounted for and feared dead. The Algerian Prime

questions remain about this whole incident, but one thing is clear.
This attack underlines the threat that terrorist groups pose to the
countries and peoples of that region and to our citizens, our companies
and our interests too. Four years ago, the principal threat from
Islamist extremism came from the Afghanistan and Pakistan region. A
huge amount has been done to 
<?notus-xml column=962?>address and reduce the scale of that threat. Whereas at one point
three-quarters of the most serious terrorist plots against the UK had
links to that region, today this has reduced to less than half. At the
same time, al-Qaeda franchises have grown in Yemen, Somalia and parts
of north Africa.</hs_para>

the threat we face was highlighted in our national security strategy in

also increasing our investment in fragile and broken

north Africa, as in Somalia, terrorist activity has been fuelled by
hostage ransoms and by wider criminality. To date, the threat it poses
has been to those north African states themselves and, of course, to
western interests in those states. But as it escalates, it is also
becoming a magnet for jihadists from other countries who share this
poisonous ideology. Indeed, there are already reports of non-Algerian
nationals involved in this attack. More than ever, this evolving threat
demands an international response. It must be one that is tough,
intelligent, patient and based on strong international
partnerships.</hs_para>

clear that this murderous violence requires a strong security response.
We must be realistic and hard-headed about the threats we face. Our
role is to support the Governments of the region in their resolve to
combat this menace, as many are doing at great cost. So we will work
closely with the Algerian Government to learn the lessons of this
attack, and to deepen our security co-operation. We will contribute
British intelligence and counterterrorism assets to an international
effort to find and dismantle the network that planned and ordered the
brutal assault at In
Amenas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012110000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-0001.htm#13012110000123">We
must work right across the region. In Nigeria, we will continue our
close security partnership with the Government as they confront
Islamist-inspired terrorism. In Libya, we will continue to support the
new Government on the urgent priority of building new and effective
security forces. In Mali, we will work with the Malians themselves,
with their neighbours and with our international allies to prevent a
new terrorist haven developing on Europe’s doorstep. We support
the French intervention that took place at the request of the Malian
Government and we are working to ensure that an African-led military
force can, with the appropriate training and support, help to ensure
Mali's long-term stability. That support will include the EU training
mission that was agreed by EU Foreign Ministers in Brussels last

our tough security response must be matched by an intelligent political
response. Al-Qaeda franchises thrive where there are weak political
institutions, political instability and the failure to address
long-standing political grievances, so we need a political approach
that addresses these issues. We must support effective and accountable
government, we must back people in their search for a job and a voice,
and we must work with the UN and our international partners to solve
long-standing political conflicts and grievances. Thirdly, we must be
patient and resolute.</hs_para>

partners in the region, we are in the midst of a generational struggle
against an ideology which is an extreme distortion of the Islamic faith

underlying conflicts and grievances that are exploited by terrorists
are in many cases long-standing and deep, and, of course, the building
blocks of democracy— the rule of law and the independence of the
judiciary, the rights of minorities, free media and association and a
proper place in society for the army—are a big part of the
solution but all take a long time to put in place. Yet this patient,
intelligent but tough approach is the best way to defeat terrorism and

whole country has been shocked as the horrific details of this

the Prime Minister’s unequivocal condemnation of those involved
in planning and carrying out this attack. It is they who must bear full
responsibility for the dreadful loss of life, and every effort must now
be made to bring them to justice. We on this side of the House will
give the Government our full support as they seek to achieve this, and
we endorse the thanks expressed by the Prime Minister to our embassy
staff in Algeria. We will also give the Government our support as they
consider how best to respond to the growing threat which al-Qaeda in

on the attack itself, people will agree with the Prime Minister that
the Algerian Government were faced with some extremely difficult
judgments about how and when to act. Nevertheless, do the Government
believe that there are any lessons to be learnt for Governments
handling terrorist incidents on their soil? Secondly, in light of the
attack, can the noble Lord the Leader say more about the work that the
British Government are doing with British companies operating in the
region, and can he tell us whether at this early stage any lessons can
be
learnt?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012110000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-0001.htm#13012110000134">Turning
to the broader context of what is happening in the region, on Mali we
support the actions of the Government to date, and we welcome the
confirmation by the Prime Minister that they do not envisage a combat
role for British troops. Do the Government agree that the efforts of
the French military must be supplemented by the much more rapid
deployment of West African forces, and what is the Government’s
view about whether this can be achieved? After last year’s coup,
the Government of Mali face both a security and a legitimacy crisis.
What further steps can be taken by the international community and
Governments to use diplomacy and development to stabilise the
situation? In particular, which international body should co-ordinate
this urgent work?

the Government agree that we are talking about a number of distinct
regional organisations—some using the banner of al-Qaeda, others
not—rather than a single, centrally controlled group? Each of
these threats needs to be monitored and countered appropriately.
Can<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:35:10"></hs_TimeCode> the noble
Lord the Leader outline what steps might be taken to improve the flow
of information and intelligence from the region, and whether it needs
to be better shared with key allies? We know that these threats grow
where governance is weak, as the noble Lord himself suggested. What
longer-term roles do the Government anticipate for the African Union
and ECOWAS—the Economic Community of West African
States—in securing greater stability in the region, and how can
the European Union support this effort? In relation to ready access to
arms, can the Leader of the House set out how the international
community can better prevent the spread of this weaponry throughout the
region, including weapons left over from the Libyan
conflict?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012110000136" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-0001.htm#13012110000136">Finally,
do the Government agree that if we are to meet the challenges we face,
we need a much greater focus of our diplomatic, development and
political resources on this region? We should also remember the events
of the Arab Spring, which demonstrated the desire of people across
north Africa to improve their lives through peaceful means, not through
violence 
<?notus-xml column=965?>and terror. We should support them. Indeed, I was at a conference in

Hill of Oareford:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Baroness the Leader of the Opposition for the support she has given to
the Government. I agree very much with her comments and the tone with
which she concluded her response. I think all sides of the House would
want to align themselves with what she said and the Statement my right
honourable friend the Prime Minister made. She was also right, at the
beginning of her comments, to emphasise the importance of understanding
the nature of this new threat. That is something we very much need to

some of her specific points, it is clear that the Algerian Government
found themselves having to deal with an extremely difficult and
complicated situation many thousands of miles away from the capital in
a very remote part of the world. All of us need to recognise the
difficulty they confronted. She asked whether there are lessons we can
learn from that. I am sure there are—we always need to learn
from events and it is vital that the British Government continue to
work closely with the Algerian

terms of progress on the ground and the involvement of other countries
in supporting the effort in Mali, there are some African soldiers on
the ground. We hope that more will follow soon. This will be
co-ordinated by ECOWAS and the United Nations, but she is absolutely
right to say that there is no quick fix for any of this. She said
rightly that we believe that this is the work of a number of distinct
organisations under the al-Qaeda banner. They are distinct but there
are connections between them and we will need to deal with them
individually but recognise those commonalities.</hs_para>

the flow of intelligence to the area, the noble Baroness will know that

African Union and ECOWAS, we certainly need to help build capacity for
the future to deal with those issues. We have stepped up our help to
Libya to try to remove weapons for the region. The noble Baroness
rightly raised the issue of security on the borders. One of the
priorities of all our work in Libya is to try to address that important
issue, and working with other countries and the Libyans to make the
region more secure. I agree entirely with the noble Baroness’s
concluding remarks on the importance of having a great focus on the
region. I agree with her remarks about the Arab spring, and the
long-term benefit to which that will give rise. There are obviously
difficulties through which we need to work, but we need that focus. It

for us to up our efforts in working with a range of interested parties,
whether through the EU or with other individual states; to address both
the security issue but also the kind of economic issue to which my
noble friend refers; and recognising that political and military
solutions need to go hand in hand. We must address some of the

sub-regional organisation, such as ECOWAS, to undertake a very tough
business like this and where keeping the regional powers in

United Kingdom through trade links, business links, links in relation
to prison reform and human rights, and through a whole range of other

that the Leader of the House also agrees that there is a real problem
about regional security in that part of north Africa. I want
particularly to raise with him the unresolved issue over the western
Sahara. In recent years, Morocco has told us over and over again that
because of the disputed territory there, the western Sahara is
peculiarly vulnerable to al-Qaeda activity, to training camps for
terrorists and to other activity of a really appalling
nature<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:49:21"></hs_TimeCode>. Are the
United Kingdom Government now prepared to raise this issue again
forcefully in the United Nations in order to try to get some proper
security into the western Sahara so that that territory cannot be used
as a launching pad for this sort of activity in the region in
future?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_21_PT_1/7A592415696FBC665EC51421996BDB55C67FF7CE" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 January 2013">Monday,

bringing back the remains of those who have died. To that end, I wonder

Lea of Crondall:</Member></B> Perhaps I may ask a couple of related
questions about African ownership of the solutions. First, for some
years I was the secretary of the All-Party Group on Algeria, after
Prime Minister Blair and President Bouteflika were starting a new
rapprochement. One of the problems, of course, is that they do not have
Westminster-style democracy in Algeria. On the other hand, does the
noble Lord the Leader of the House agree that we have to have
practical, in-depth parliamentary arrangements with Algeria, as we do
with Ethiopia or anywhere else where we may not have perfect
arrangements? Secondly, is there not scope for giving more
congratulations to the African Union on the string of successes it has
had right across the tenth parallel from Somalia through to Chad, South
Sudan and right the way across? I base this on a talk that I had in
Addis two months ago with the executive director for security of the
African Union. I think it is fair to say that they are remarkably able
people but very badly resourced. We ought to be a little less
schizophrenic about letting the African Union take the lead instead of
damning it with faint praise for not being as effective as it should

practical help is given to these and the other grieving families as

threatens other countries, especially Nigeria, will he look again at
the proscribing of Boko Haram, which has been responsible for hundreds
of

the easy recruitment of the disaffected, as well as the wisdom of

Williams of Crosby:</Member></B> My Lords, one of my favourite
political quotations is the famous remark of Edmund Burke that for evil
to triumph requires only that good men remain silent. The noble Lord,
Lord Alton, and his colleague, the noble Baroness, Lady 
<?notus-xml column=975?>Cox, are wonderful examples of good men and good women not remaining
silent. The courage that was required to visit North Korea time and
again in the face of all kinds of discouragements, fears and threats is
greatly to the credit of them both, and they stand as Members of this
House with every possible right to claim the respect and admiration of

North Korea that it is, as indeed the noble Lord, Lord Alton, implied,
a deeply traumatised state. It is a state with a very strong history of
being victimised—by the Japanese, by the Chinese and by those in
other countries—and one that has never really recovered its
balance from that terrible
history<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T17:13:36"></hs_TimeCode>. The
strange thing about North Korea—and in this respect I think it
is unlike Iran—is that the idea that one might sacrifice
one’s population to a nuclear attack does not seem to cross the
minds of the North Korean regime in the way that I think it crosses the
minds of all other regimes, including nuclear powers, such as India and
Pakistan, and would-be nuclear powers, such as Iran. North Korea has
destroyed or allowed the destruction of such a large part of its
civilian population that the one great barrier against using a nuclear
weapon—the fear of losing one’s own
population—probably has less effect in North Korean than in any
other country on the face of the earth. That is the most frightening
thing about North Korea. It looks like a county whose regime would be
capable of using a nuclear weapon because in the end saving the regime
is more important than saving the
population<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T17:14:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012110000194" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-0001.htm#13012110000194">Let
us look briefly at the security history, although I wholly take the
point of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that that is in many ways
secondary to the terrible, indescribably awful human rights regime that
has been conducted for so long by this extraordinarily strange dynasty
of Kim Il-sung and his successors, which has become a kind of secondary
religious heresy demanding the deification of its own
leadership<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T17:15:14"></hs_TimeCode>. The
story in North Korea is one of having walked away altogether from the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty—the NPT—to which it
originally belonged. It walked away from the NPT in order to breach
some of the key provisions, one of the most important being that there
would not be a continuation by its members of nuclear testing in the
face of what has not been a new treaty, tragically, but what has
certainly been a very long period of postponement and delay when no
nuclear power, with the single exception of North Korea, has continued
to test nuclear weapons. Other countries are frightening in their own
way, but this direct breach of this key provision, widely morally
accepted, if not legally accepted, is an extremely disturbing
fact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T17:16:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012110000195" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-0001.htm#13012110000195">North
Korea has about five or six nuclear bombs, based, as the noble Lord,
Lord Alton, rightly said, on the use of plutonium, ironically
originally provided as part of the nuclear materials for peace movement
in the United States in the 1970s. It broke the understanding and
conditions of that provision of nuclear materials for peace by
deliberately saving the plutonium from that programme and using it as
the origins of its relatively small nuclear arsenal. The best
information we have is that something between six and eight fully
realised nuclear weapons are owned by North Korea. 
<?notus-xml column=976?>That is one of the smallest nuclear arsenals in the world but it is

Korea went ahead to produce a great many short-range ballistic
missiles—we believe that it has some hundreds—and also
medium-range ballistic missiles, of which it certainly has scores. What
it has failed to do so far, with the exception that I shall come to in
a moment, is to produce intercontinental ballistic missiles, which has
become a major objective of the regime. By an intercontinental
ballistic missile, we mean one with a range of more than 3,000 miles,
capable of reaching Japan certainly, but also the west coast of the
United States. The first attempt by North Korea in 2009 to develop an
ICBM failed rather obviously and conspicuously and was noted with some
satisfaction by the rest of the world. Tragically, only a month ago, on
12 December 2012, once again the regime—this time of Kim
Jong-un, the son of Kim Jong-il—was successful and the missile
managed to find its way across Japan, flying high above Japan but
nevertheless into Japanese airspace, before it crashed some time later
into the Pacific. It was clearly a successful intercontinental

the moment, the belief generally held in the nuclear weapons community
is that North Korea has not been able to miniaturise nuclear warheads
to the point where the relatively small or low-power ICBMs it may be
producing could carry them intercontinentally to a country such as the
United States. But even having said that, the fact that it is now
capable of launching such a package, although not yet miniaturising it
to a point that it becomes effective, is obviously not far away from
what could be a fully fledged ICBM carrying a nuclear
warhead.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012110000198" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-0001.htm#13012110000198">The
one piece of relatively good news is that the speech that the new
“Young Leader” of North Korea made a few weeks ago to
mark his taking over of power—although there was very little in
it that was not Orwellian in its terminology and
philosophy—contained a small sign of light when he spoke of
creating a movement towards some kind of peaceful agreement with South
Korea. The possibility therefore arises, which might be worth pursuing,
of a non-nuclear Korean peninsula which fits into the pattern of the
non-nuclear zones which have now been established from Latin America,

table, as it has for several years, in the six-plus-one peace talks, of
which North Korea is a member, that in return for a decision to end
nuclear testing and development and fully to accept the additional
protocol of the nuclear peace treaty, North Korea would then have
opened to it investment, supplies of food aid and a willingness to
allow it to rejoin the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. As the noble
Lord, Lord Alton, pointed out, that is a fairly distant hope at the
present time for a country as strange as this one. If anyone deserves
such a response and the good will of the rest of the world, then the
noble Lord, Lord Alton, and his colleague, the noble Baroness, Lady

place last year was literally blown off the agenda by North
Korea’s decision to launch a satellite nine months ago. However,
the North Korean leadership should also reflect on the morality of

to admit that terrible events occur in places where the United Kingdom

draws together humanitarian crises and security. The dynamics of the
internal oppression in North Korea are generated in large part by the
belligerence of the state on regional and perhaps international scenes.
It is surely a function of the grandiose posturing of the leaders of a
small, militarised and impoverished state feeling the need to shore up
their power internally that they will brook no opposition or
alternative systems of thought, culture or media—as the noble
Lord, Lord Black, quite rightly pointed out—or religion, art or
indeed anything. It is a manifestation of a kind of paranoia, a fear of
internal close-at-hand phenomena undermining them and a wildly
exaggerated sense of importance, which I am afraid, some dynastic cults
manage to produce among themselves. As the noble Baroness, Lady
Williams, said, it is in part a product of a terrible history. It has
given rise to what I can only describe as a pathology. The nation

question is who can potentially influence events. Who might impact on
the risk of a growing nuclear arsenal? Who might successfully urge the
end of the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles? It seems
unlikely that the North Koreans will influence these matters
themselves. Their dynastic leader is perceived to be unprepared for
leadership and unable, even were he willing, to corral his
father’s allies. This may well produce greater internal
instability, which is capable of being translated into external
aggression. Indeed, it is only the routine acts of local antagonism to
neighbours that we can count on as the certainties: the
intercontinental rocket launch that effectively ended the huge aid
mission of the United States, the leap-day deal; and the links with
Iran over that rocketry. I have no doubt, as has been said, that they

probably played, at least for the time being, the key diplomatic cards
available to it to achieve the short-lived leap-day deal, which has now
melted away. If I am right, and in the light of the lack of
any progress, the various collapses of the six-plus-one talks
inevitably raises the question of the role of China. United States and
Chinese assessments may be linked in a somewhat paradoxical way. The
United States appears to believe that influence could be created by aid
and the support of humanitarian projects. In short, North Korea would
become dependent on the relationship. The noble Baroness, Lady Cox,
asked whether building bridges might be the right way or creating
dependence as part of the same strategy. The noble Lord, Lord Kerr,
rightly argued the same point just a moment

the Chinese thinking, but they may have concluded that, over long
years, a relatively chaotic client will come to depend on the one
steadfast friend it can probably count on: one source of trade, one
source of military cover, one source of diplomatic umbrella, and a very
powerful regional power to boot. It may be thought that this creates a
kind of marginal stability which is better than anything else on offer.
If that is right, the strategic choices of the United States and China
are diametrically different. If the views remain this dissonant, then
the prospects for much progress are probably
poor.</hs_para>

Warsi):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Alton of
Liverpool, for calling this debate and for the active role that he has
played in raising the profile of North Korean issues in Parliament. He
absolutely deserves the plaudits that he has received from across the
House today. Noble Lords clearly share our concerns about the North
Korean security threat, and the appalling human rights and humanitarian
situation there.</hs_para>

out the Government’s assessment of the current situation in
North Korea. Kim Jong-un has now been in power for more than a year.
Over the past 12 months there has been intense speculation as to
whether this new, young, western-educated man will lead positive change
in North Korea. We have certainly seen some changes in style: greater
openness about his family life, more public appearances and a surprise
new year’s speech claiming that North Korea wants to improve
relations with South Korea, and will focus on improving its economy. It
could be the distant hope to which my noble friend Lady Williams
referred. However, whether any of these statements will lead to real
changes for the people of North Korea remains to be seen.</hs_para>

Korea remains a significant security concern. It tried twice to launch
satellites in 2012, in both cases allowing it to test its ballistic
missile technology in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1718
and 1874. The success of the second satellite launch, in particular,
serves as a reminder that North Korea  
<?notus-xml column=989?>poses a real and severe threat to international peace and security. I
add my support to much of what we heard from my noble friend Lady
Williams. The UK simply cannot accept repeated violations of Security
Council resolutions by the Government of Pyongyang. It was right that
the UN responded to April’s satellite launch with a
strongly-worded UN Security Council Presidential Statement. We are
working closely with Security Council colleagues to respond to the
launch which took place in
December.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012110000264" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-0002.htm#13012110000264">North<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T18:07:22"></hs_TimeCode>
Korea also continues to sell its dangerous technology to any willing
buyer worldwide, presenting a broader risk to peace and security. The
UK continues to work with international partners to ensure that current
sanctions are rigorously implemented but, as the UN Panel of Experts on
North Korea noted in its most recent report, more needs to be done to
help others with implementation.</hs_para>

Lords will be aware of the speculation that the South Korean
President-elect, Park Guen-hye, wants to pursue dialogue with North
Korea during her five-year presidency. The UK would welcome
improvements in inter-Korean relations and would welcome in particular
the resumption of negotiations on the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, repeated provocative acts by North Korea have made it
difficult for others to engage in negotiations. We are therefore
concentrating our diplomatic efforts on urging North Korea to refrain
from further provocations and to take concrete steps to engage in
constructive dialogue.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T18:08:25"></hs_TimeCode>, the

nuclear issue is of enormous concern to the international community

your Lordships are well aware, North Korea has some of the most
repressive controls on civil and political rights in the world. The
noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred to the well publicised memoirs of Shin
Dong-hyuk, which have shown that the conditions for political prisoners
are truly shocking. Individual stories repeated in the House today
again have shocked many of
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012110000268" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-0002.htm#13012110000268">I remain
deeply concerned about the policies of some countries that, in breach
of UN conventions, continue to repatriate North Korean asylum seekers.
The UK has taken a leading role in ensuring that North Korean human
rights abuses have been highlighted in international fora. We
co-sponsor the annual UN General Assembly resolution on human rights in
North Korea. This year it was passed without a vote—a
significant first. As an EU member state we co-sponsor the annual Human
Rights Council resolution and have been actively lobbying North Korea
to allow the UN special rapporteur access to the country.</hs_para>

considering with UN partners whether there is anything more that we can
do to encourage North Korea to change its policy on human rights. The
UK has also undertaken small-scale work in-country 
<?notus-xml column=990?>to improve the treatment of vulnerable groups. One area where we have
seen some positive developments in North Korea is in the situation of
people with disabilities. Due to severe social stigma, 10 years ago it
was unusual to see a disabled person on the streets of Pyongyang; now
this is a commonplace. Last year, the British embassy in Pyongyang
provided funding for training at a deaf school in Wonsan. We also
assisted the North Korean authorities in sending swimmer Rim Ju Song,
the country’s first Paralympian, to London in 2012. Of course,
North Korea is very far from meeting international human rights
standards. However, the achievements to date in the way in which people
with disabilities are perceived and treated is one small
progress.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012110000270" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-0002.htm#13012110000270">We
also have concerns about the humanitarian situation in North Korea.
Assessments by the World Food Programme confirm that there remain
chronic levels of malnutrition. There also appears to be a widening
gulf between the visible relative affluence of Pyongyang and appalling
conditions elsewhere in the country. The UK contributes funding to
organisations operating in North Korea. Between 2011 and 2014 
we will contribute £100 million to the World Food
Programme’s global budget and we also contributed a fifth of the
Central Emergency Response Fund’s £15.4
million funding for North Korea. The British embassy in Pyongyang has
also worked with the  North Korean authorities on a number of
small-scale humanitarian projects, including a project to provide a
safe source of soybean milk to young children. The embassy also
sponsored a visit to the UK to provide training for North Korean
doctors treating spinal injuries and providing
rehabilitation.</hs_para>

work, we are clear that the North Korean Government bear significant
responsibility for their failure to feed their people adequately. Of
particular concern is the prioritisation of resources to the military.
This year North Korea has spent hundreds of millions of dollars funding
its satellite programme while simultaneously seeking aid. This money
could have been spent on improving the critical infrastructure, which
could have made it easier to transport food around the country, or,
simply—as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said—on
food<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T18:12:17"></hs_TimeCode>. We must
continue to be clear to North Korea that it cannot just rely on aid
from the international community. It needs to take measures to ensure
that the right conditions are in place so all of the resources that it
has available, including any aid, can be used most effectively, and it
must give real and tangible priority to improving the humanitarian
situation of its
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012110000272" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-0002.htm#13012110000272">If Kim

friend Lord Black of Brentwood made a fascinating and well informed
contribution. I agree with his assessment of restrictions on freedom of
expression. Our concerns were reflected in the General Assembly

continuously tries to find ways in which to expose the North Korean
people to the outside world—simple steps. For example, in 2010
we secured the broadcast of “Bend it Like Beckham”; we
have a British Council English-language teacher training programme, and

committee upon which the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, and I

important area of national interest, not least because of the amount of
public money that the agencies consume each year, something over
£2 billion. The nature of the work they do, and what they spend
the money on, must, of course, for the large part, remain secret.
However, the Intelligence and Security Committee ensures that there is
parliamentary oversight of this work, and it is right that we have, as

annual report covers a wide range of issues, and we have made a number
of recommendations. I shall, in the time available,
concentrate on a few of those. First, resourcing—the agencies
received a relatively generous settlement in the last spending review
of 2010, with what is known as a flat cash budget, which nevertheless
represented a significant real-terms cut over the four-year period.
With a combination of pay freezes and concerted efforts to control
other costs, the agencies are currently coping with this while
apparently preserving front-line capabilities. All the same, the
settlement commits the agencies, both individually and collectively, to
achieve significant savings before 2015. The committee agrees that the
efficiency savings 
<?notus-xml column=374?>need to be made, wherever possible, in administration and related areas.
However, we are not convinced, as we say in our report, that sufficient
progress is being made towards making them, and the Government have yet
to convince us that the agencies will meet the targets that they have
been set. If they do not, the agencies could be forced to cut
front-line capabilities, and that, as I am sure your Lordships agree,
would be extremely worrying. I hope that the Minister can assure us
that the axe will not end up falling on the front-line capabilities
that are so badly needed to protect our national

second area, also related to resources, is the ability of the agencies
to respond to unexpected events. We have seen—here I include
Defence Intelligence, whose role was, and continues to be,
crucial—how the agencies had to divert resources to the events
of the Arab uprising, which is a subject to which I will shortly and

concerned that, inevitably, these resources will have to be switched
from other areas. In these straitened times, particularly for Defence
Intelligence which has suffered round after round of cuts, our ability
to maintain sufficient coverage of all the areas of the
globe—the importance of which has been graphically and painfully
illustrated in Algeria over these past few days—is becoming
increasingly fragile. Yet our agencies need to be able to respond to
events anywhere and at any time. We may be able in the short term to
plug the gap but only by robbing Peter to pay Paul. If we do not
examine this more closely, sooner or later we will be caught
out—if that has not already

welcome the fact the central intelligence structures are now aligned
beneath the National Security Council. However, from past experience,
we are concerned to ensure that analytical judgments and policy
recommendations remain separate when advice is presented to Ministers.
As we have seen in the past, it has been easy for this distinction to
become blurred and it is crucial that it does

the agencies’ swift and commendable response to the Arab spring
or, as I prefer to call it, the Arab awakening. That presented a real
challenge to the intelligence community which had to reprioritise
quickly and redirect its resources towards the region. Of course, it is
often impossible to predict such events. However, the question remains
as to whether, once events began to unfold, the agencies should have
anticipated the possibility that the unrest would quickly spread across
the region and should have recognised the Islamist nature of much of it
and the crucial distinction between national and universal Islamism,
which is of such importance to our security. We are seeing this clearly
in what is happening in the Maghreb and the Sahel and potentially, even
more dangerously, in
Syria<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:37:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of al-Qaeda and its affiliates has been weakened in Afghanistan, the

<?notus-xml column=375?>a serious terrorist threat to the United Kingdom and its citizens. This
danger needs to be further and urgently pursued. Above all, this
demonstrates the risks inherent in drawing down effort on lower

there is cybersecurity which remains the most rapidly growing threat
that we face. Every day citizens and businesses in this country face
attacks on their computers and networks from criminals, hacktivist
groups—that is spelt with an “h”—and state
actors, ranging from actions which cause mere irritation to the
compromise of financial details and, at the most extreme end, the theft
of intellectual property and sensitive national security material. This
is a threat to the security and prosperity of the United Kingdom and,
in its report, the committee has welcomed the seriousness with which
the Government have addressed this. The additional
resource—£650 million over four years—is a
significant sum in these straitened financial
times<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:39:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000013">While
the committee’s interest has been primarily in the 20% of more
sophisticated attacks where national security has been affected, the
wider issues remain the same. We have noted the work of the
Communications-Electronics Security Groups and the Centre for the
Protection of the National Infrastructure which are increasing their
efforts to educate Government and business about the vulnerabilities
and weaknesses of their systems and how improving behaviour will
strengthen defences and benefit the entire country at the least cost.
However, it is more than two years since the Government announced
increased funding for work against cybercrime. While there has been
some progress in developing new capabilities, this does not appear to
have been as swift as might have been expected. In a fast paced field,
where new technologies are emerging all the time, we cannot afford
delays in our national response. The committee will keep this issue
under close
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000014">There
are many other important matters mentioned in our annual report,
including counterterrorism work, staffing and diversity in the
agencies, and access to communications data—to name but a
few—which other noble Lords may wish to raise. I will now turn
to broader issues. When we held this debate last year, the Government
had just published a Green Paper covering reform of the Intelligence
and Security Committee and increased protection for intelligence
material involved in civil cases. Since then, this House has debated
the Justice and Security Bill, which is currently being considered in
another place. I will not repeat the arguments that were deployed in
Committee and on Report in your Lordships’ House, but there are
one or two areas that I wish to raise
briefly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000015">As
noble Lords will be aware, Part 1 of the Bill concerns reforms to the
Intelligence and Security Committee itself. It is intended to formalise
many of its practices, which have evolved beyond the limitations 
<?notus-xml column=376?>of the statute under which the committee was originally established in
1994, and gives the committee greater powers to access information held
by the agencies. It will also make clear the committee’s
responsibilities to Parliament as well as to the Prime Minister, which
have not always been clear in the past, and underline that it is an
independent committee, which has also not always been clear in the past
to outside observers. These are important changes that originated from
within the committee and we are pleased that the Government and others,
both in your Lordships’ House and, I understand, in another
place as well, have in principle accepted them as being
necessary.</hs_para>

work to be done to bridge the final remaining gaps between the
committee and the Government and I hope the Minister can reassure me
that agreement on these issues is near. I think we are all agreed on
the need to strengthen the committee’s link to Parliament but
there are implications from formalising this relationship. While I
understand the Government’s nervousness around such issues as
parliamentary privilege, can the Minister confirm today that the work
of the committee will be adequately protected in
future?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000017">Secondly,
for the first time the committee is being given explicit powers to
investigate operational matters, subject to certain clear provisions.
These are that the matters are agreed between the Prime Minister and
the committee as being retrospective—that is, not part of any
ongoing operation—and of significant national interest. These
principles are not controversial and the committee has no intention of
becoming involved in the day-to-day operations of the
agencies.</hs_para>

that the legislation does not inadvertently tie the committee’s
hands. After all, the committee often investigates matters relating to
operations, sometimes even at the Prime Minister’s request; its
report into the 7/7 bombings is a case in point. It would be a
significant step backwards if the legislation did not allow for such
inquiries in future.</hs_para>

to the resources available to the committee. Our admirable staff
provide all our research, analysis, briefing and drafting in-house. If
the committee is to be able to continue its work, let alone take on the
increased role that the Bill envisages, the Government must ensure that
we have adequate support to do so. Our resources are meagre compared to
those of our overseas counterparts, as noble Lords who have been on the
committee and have visited other countries will readily agree, I am
sure. They are also meagre in comparison with inquiries such as that on
the detainees or the Iraq inquiry, the report of which we still await,
or indeed of the Committee on Climate Change, to name just a few. If
the Government are serious about supporting the measures in the Bill,
this committee must be funded correctly and adequately so as to be able
to carry out its responsibilities properly in the

the Justice and Security Bill is about the necessity of introducing
closed proceedings in civil cases where the protection of national
security material is involved. This was debated at length in your
Lordships’ House and I am pleased that the core of the
Government’s proposals has survived that 
<?notus-xml column=377?>consideration. The reputational damage to our agencies of legally
unjustified financial settlement with those questionably claiming
mistreatment cannot be allowed to continue. The public perception is
that the agencies have something to hide and we should not allow the
situation to continue where a judge is unable to rule on such
allegations. In addition, our relations with allies will suffer if we
are unable to guarantee that we can protect their secrets, especially
as we expect the same when we share our intelligence with partners

extremely busy year for the intelligence agencies, primarily due to the
burdens placed on them by the Olympic and Paralympic Games. That these
events not only passed off without incident but were such a widely
acknowledged success was in no small measure due to the enormous
behind-the-scenes efforts of the agencies to ensure that terrorists did
not take advantage of the situation. This took a significant effort on
the part of the Security Service in particular, and we have noted the
disruption that staff had to endure with long or unsocial working hours

although this is not a criticism of the report itself, the writers or
the committee, I would have been pleased if some of the gaps had been
filled. I am not talking just about the redactions, although on those I
did wonder about the process. Does the committee advise the Prime
Minister that certain matters are for his eyes only, as it were,
because as we discussed during the passage of the Justice and Security
Bill, responsibility for security is a matter for more than the
agencies? Indeed, much reference is made in the report to what is
called the wider intelligence community. It appears from the report
that the National Security Council, with a membership of Cabinet
Ministers, joins things up across government. The report
states:</hs_para>
<hs_quote UID="13012116000120" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000120">“It is evident
that the NSC has increased further its status and priority, and we are
reassured that the requirements of the NSC have been assimilated by the
intelligence community”.</hs_quote>

membership of the Joint Intelligence Committee is not quite aligned
with that of the NSC, which includes the Secretary of State for Energy
and Climate Change. However, DECC officials are not permanent members
of the JIC. The events of the past 
<?notus-xml column=378?>few days have confirmed the relevance of that. Perhaps the issue will
soon be water, but that could be a matter for another debate. The JIC,
on the other hand, includes officials from BIS but the Secretary of
State for Business is not a member of the NSC, which is interesting
given the problems of cybersecurity to which the noble Marquess has
just
referred.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13012116000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000025">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:54:32"></hs_TimeCode>
impact of the NSC on the intelligence community—to pick up that
reference—is one thing but what is important above all is its
impact on outcomes. The report’s very first recommendation
concerns the distinction between policy implications and analytical
judgments. Again, this has already been mentioned and the Government
agree with it. It cannot be easy to maintain that distinction or to
avoid blurring the line between the operational and the strategic. Two
of the quotations from the evidence from the Foreign Secretary which
are contained in the report were particularly interesting on this. He
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13012116000121" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000121">“We

that,</hs_parafo><hs_quotefo UID="13012116000135" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000135">“there
is a process of discussion. I mean, the weekly discussions that I have
with the Security Service are about where they are focusing their
resources and particular operations that require that resource and
questions I can ask about the issues that I see that need to be

accountability”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13012116000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000106">Accountability
is an interesting word there, because it is moving towards the
Executive. I am not saying that there is anything wrong in that
involvement or that I am critical of it, but I thought that this
highlighted the point. The noble Marquess, Lord Lothian, has asked the
Minister to confirm that resources will remain available for the front
line, which in my mind raises the question of who is responsible for
the allocation of resources within each agency by each agency, and how
much they should be told by the Government where resources should be
allocated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:52:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13012116000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000026">As
I read the report, the agencies are increasingly collaborating for
operational reasons as well as for efficiency. The Government’s
response stresses the importance of a tri-agency approach to conducting
and supporting counterterrorism investigations. No doubt the debate
about having separate agencies and the demarcation lines is a very old
one, but I wonder whether the time is coming for it to be revived and
for a reflection on where the demarcation lines should be, as the world
changes and we become more of one global
whole.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000027">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:53:10"></hs_TimeCode>
of the changes of course is the agencies’ increasing dependence
on IT. I was not surprised to read of the difficulties of retaining
talented people—to whom one must pay tribute, not only in IT but
across the piece. This is not a new issue in the public sector: the
attractions of the private sector have taken, for example, engineers
and planners out of local government for years. It means making the job
attractive, not only in terms of salary but in other ways. There is
talk of recruitment. I have been on to the websites and played with
what is there. However, I do not get much of a sense of what the
imaginative and innovative methods are to which the Government
refer—without fleshing it out—which would attract
possible applicants to  
<?notus-xml column=379?>look for jobs with the agencies and get to the point where they might
try to take the intelligence test, if I have used the term
correctly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:54:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000028">Turnover
within the agencies seems high. I assume that there is an analysis,
either within each agency or by the committee, of the levels of
seniority where there is high turnover and the reasons for it. Is
absence monitored? Sickness levels are often a very good indicator of
what is going on beneath the surface. This information is in the public
domain but, as regards discussing this area in public, taking evidence
from those who can give it is just the sort of thing that could be
considered—an issue that I raised during the passage of the
Justice and Security Bill—not at one stage removed, as we are
today. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:54:58"></hs_TimeCode>I readily
acknowledge that there are difficulties when one moves from the general
to the particular in this area but, for example, redundancy payments
are indeed high, as the report mentions. This makes me wish to
ask—but I cannot ask or listen to the question being
asked—whether there are false economies in making high
redundancy payments if that means recruiting a large number of more
junior
employees<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:55:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

recognised, is an issue in recruitment and, perhaps, retention—I
am not clear about that. Are the nationality requirements really such a
problem for diversity? How much effort is being made to learn from
other sectors? Is there secondment to and from the agencies and other
sectors? Presumably, that is not entirely impossible? I would like to
think that the committee has been told more than:</hs_para>

I return to the “what?”. The proportion of spend on
counterterrorism brings one up short. I noted, too, mention
of home-grown self-starters and lone actors. The sections on the
Prevent strand of the strategy reminded me of the difficulties in
another area—drugs. This is all about mindsets, and I wonder
whether there is any read-across that one can
make<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:56:45"></hs_TimeCode>.
I should be interested to know whether the ISC was content
with its recommendations on this.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:57:00"></hs_TimeCode> wonder, too,
if it was satisfied with the Government’s response to the
section on torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. It seems
that nothing is immune from being turned into an
acronym<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:57:14"></hs_TimeCode>. The
report refers to the risk of being linked to such activities.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:57:27"></hs_TimeCode> do not know
whether it is only my reading of the Government’s response but
it carefully does not address the difficult area of
“condoning” such treatment—if that is the right
word for not asking all the questions or ferreting away at
investigations that might reveal things that one might not want to
know; and yes, I have read the consolidated guidance and note the role
of Ministers in this. Perhaps that is for another
day<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T15:57:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

committee’s oversight is continuous and vigorous. Meetings are
not everything but I note that the committee met 44 times in the
year—almost once a week. As the committee and the noble
Marquess, Lord Lothian, has said, the real test is our response to the
unexpected. Perhaps the events of the past few days remind us that
behind this is the question of what is done to limit the unexpected. I
pay tribute to the

intelligence and security agencies of the state continue to have a high
profile in government. New requirements and threats arise, which the
intelligence agencies have a vital role in addressing. As the noble
Marquess, Lord Lothian, said, technology develops very fast, providing
new tools both for the agencies and for those who threaten us. New
issues arise in striking the balance between transparency and secrecy,
and between the effectiveness of the agencies, on the one hand, and the
freedom of individuals on the other. It is evidence of the prominence
of these issues that a major element of the programme of this
parliamentary Session is the Justice and Security Bill as well as
pre-legislative scrutiny of the proposed legislation to require mobile
telephone and internet providers to retain data for the use of the
intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The Intelligence and
Security Committee has been, and is, closely involved in all these
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:00:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000034">As
the ability of the state to intrude on the privacy of citizens has
increased over the years, so successive Governments and Parliament have
rightly put in place means of scrutinising the activities of the
agencies to provide protection against abuse. Since the activities of
the agencies have to be conducted in secrecy if they are to be
effective, so the scrutineers on behalf of the public have to be
admitted within the ring of secrecy. What is more, if the public are to
have confidence that they will have effective protection, they also
have to have confidence in the independence and integrity of the
scrutineers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:01:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000035">Our
legislation gives judges the duty to enter the ring of secrecy and
ensure that the intelligence agencies are operating within the
constraints of the law. Since 1994 it has given the parliamentary
Intelligence and Security Committee the duty of exercising a more
general scrutiny on behalf of the public and Parliament. The judicial
commissioners—and we have two very distinguished former
commissioners present today—have carried the confidence of the
public. However, the Intelligence and Security Committee has appeared
to be the creation of the Government and, because it operates within
highly constraining legislation, it has carried less public
confidence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:01:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:01:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:01:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

criticism of the committee has been largely unfair. Although the ISC
has not had the power to require information from the agencies, the
track record of the committee in protecting secrecy has given the
agencies increasing confidence to provide information fully and frankly
to the committee. The committee’s scrutiny has extended well
beyond the limits of policy, administration and
expenditure—which were the limits on it set out in the 1994
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:02:35"></hs_TimeCode>. In
the Justice and Security Bill now before Parliament, 
<?notus-xml column=381?>the legislation is catching up with reality and carrying it forward by
making the committee more genuinely a committee of Parliament and by
giving it the power to require information from the agencies and not
just request
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:03:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000037">Of
the matters which the committee has examined this year and which are
covered in the annual report, there are many which have had a high
salience in public consciousness. Perhaps chief among these, as the
noble Marquess, Lord Lothian, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee,
said, was the role of the agencies, police and Army in protecting the
security of the Olympic Games, or perhaps I should say the security of
the nation during the Olympic Games. Like others, the committee was
worried last year that the Games would necessarily be such a
preoccupation of the security agencies that they would open the way to
attacks elsewhere. In the event, the actions which the agencies took to
pre-empt and deter attacks were so effective that the efforts directly
devoted to the Games themselves, although large, did not drain other
areas of the resource to the extent feared, and protection in those
areas remained in place. Overall, I echo the comments of
others that that aspect of the Games, like other aspects,
was a spectacular
success<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:04:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

challenge to the agencies, in addition to the ongoing requirement to
support our Armed Forces in Afghanistan and to monitor the breeding
grounds of al-Qaeda terrorism, was the upheaval created by the Arab
spring. As the noble Marquess, Lord Lothian, and the noble Baroness,
Lady Hamwee, pointed out, recent events in Mali and Algeria have
tragically demonstrated that overseas eruptions of this
sort, even when they occur in areas known to be volcanic, are often
unpredicted—and perhaps unpredictable—by intelligence,
but they create a requirement for urgent action to catch up with
events. The fact that such unexpected events have happened at various
times in our history emphasises the need for the agencies to maintain
at least some capacity in all areas where British interests are
involved. Of all the agencies, GCHQ has the potential flexibility to
respond quickly in such situations, and overall the committee was
impressed by the rapidity and effectiveness of the response that it and
the Defence Intelligence Service were able to make to the events in
Libya.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000039">Another
area where the Government have been devoting substantial
effort—and need to do so—is cybersecurity, as has already
been mentioned. The committee has been monitoring the way in which the
Government have been using the £650 million they devoted to the
National Cyber Security Programme in the most recent public expenditure
settlement. It appears that the publicity given to this issue, not
least by the welcome initiative of the Foreign Secretary in holding the
London Conference on Cyberspace in November 2011, has been effective in
drawing attention to the danger that this form of espionage presents to
the UK and in alerting companies to the need to take action to protect
their commercial interests. Much more needs to be done, but within
Government there are still only hand-to-mouth arrangements for funding
the protective action necessary and the committee has had to repeat 
<?notus-xml column=382?>the recommendation it made last year that a more stable long-term
funding mechanism is needed for this vital
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000040">Because
of my personal background, I have taken a particular interest in the
ISC’s work in looking at how the central machinery for handling
and using intelligence has been developing. I think it is generally
accepted that the establishment of the National Security Council,
bringing the heads of the agencies to the top table with senior
Ministers in planning the UK’s defence and security priorities,
is a welcome development. I follow the noble Marquess, Lord Lothian,
and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, in saying that it also has its
dangers, by bringing the purveyors of intelligence directly into
contact with senior policymakers without the sieving mechanism that the
country so wisely put in place in the form of the assessment staff and
the Joint Intelligence Committee. It risks bringing the intelligence
moths too close to the policy-making flame. That risk was increased by
the fact that the operations of the Joint Intelligence Committee had
become, as the National Security Adviser himself admitted to the ISC, a
little “stately and formal”.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012116000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000041">In this fast moving
situation, particularly when British troops are engaged in active
military operations, it is all the more important that policymakers
have the use of immediate—but properly
assessed—intelligence: the very purpose for which the Joint
Intelligence Committee was established in the Second World War. It is
therefore welcome that the new chairman of the JIC, Jon Day, who has
extensive experience of assessment, has taken steps to make the
assessment machinery more fleet-footed in meeting the day-to-day needs
of senior Ministers, as well as producing longer-term assessments to
meet the requirements of the
NSC.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000042">I will
end with two more general remarks. First, it is striking how much the
challenge of dealing with internationally based terrorism has had the
effect of requiring all the agencies to work more closely together, as
the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, noted. The work of detecting and
pre-empting al-Qaeda attacks on the British homeland requires the
co-operation of the Security Service, SIS and GCHQ as well as the
police and, in some cases, military assets. I believe that they have
responded to the challenge very
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:09:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012116000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000043">It would be idle to
deny that tensions occasionally arise between the services, but on the
whole they are rare. Would it be better if we had a unified
intelligence service to deal with these interrelated threats? The noble
Baroness, Lady Hamwee, hinted at this question. I think that the answer
is no. As things are, each of our agencies and services brings to bear
its own skills, traditions and roles, which are separate. As long as
they work closely together, and the ISC both monitors and encourages
the agencies in that area, they are more effective as a partnership
than as a single
entity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:10:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012116000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000044">That brings me to
another point. Intelligence work has always raised ethical issues, and
again the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, referred to these, but modern
intelligence work, requiring extensive international co-operation,
raises such issues acutely. Our intelligence and security agencies find
themselves from time to time working with uncomfortable bedfellows. As
the de Silva report brought out clearly in the Finucane 
<?notus-xml column=383?>case, agents who penetrate terrorist organisations inevitably sail close
to the wind. But working with other Governments also brings our
agencies into co-operation with those who may have different standards
and different methods. It is therefore essential, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, that our agencies have clear guidelines
about boundaries which they should not cross. I believe that the
agencies and Ministers have given much attention in recent years to
creating such guidelines. However, it would be foolish not to recognise
that difficulties will sometimes arise, for example, when a partner at
one moment turns out to be a rogue at another. This is just one of the
many risks that members of our agencies and security forces have to
run. In general, what I have seen as a member of the ISC and previously
reassures me that we can have confidence in the ethical standards to
which our agencies and security forces seek to
operate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000045">The
world in which we are living has all sorts of instabilities and dangers
that are made greater by the power of technology in creating new and
ever more potent threats. It is the job of our intelligence and
security agencies to defend us against them without crossing lines that
would infringe the very liberties they are there to protect. They have
continuously to make hard decisions about priorities in using
resources, and those resources are necessarily limited. The agencies
welcome the scrutiny to which they are subjected because they know that
it helps to keep them honest and defends them against criticisms which
are unfounded or unjust. I believe that the Intelligence and Security
Committee and the commissioners are necessary to that scrutiny and I am
proud to take part in that work. I endorse everything the noble
Marquess, Lord Lothian, has said about the contribution of the staff of
the ISC and the need to give them the necessary resources as the
committee’s work expands. I am very glad to support the noble
Marquess in his Motion that the House takes note of the
committee’s
report.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_21_PT_1/CF79F620AE6A4419156BB315C38393730332146B" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 January 2013">Monday,

Taylor of Bolton:</Member></B> My Lords, thanks to the noble Baroness,
Lady Hamwee, I have learnt something that I had not expected to this
afternoon, which is that as a former chair of the Intelligence and
Security Committee, I now need to see the latest James Bond film. Also
as a former chair of the committee, I hesitated and wondered whether I
should hover like a ghost from the past over this debate, but I could
not resist taking part because it is sometimes good to have a degree of
perspective, and the committee is still relatively new, and therefore I
want to say a few words.</hs_para>

thank the two noble Lords who represent us on the Intelligence and
Security Committee. When I was its chair, Peter Archer—Lord
Archer of Sandwell—was a diligent member of the committee; we
now have two Members of your Lordships’ House serving on it and
I am sure that their contribution is very highly valued. It is an
extraordinary committee. While it is not a Select Committee or a
committee of Parliament, it is a committee of parliamentarians and
probably works harder than any other committee of this kind.
Mention has been made of the number of meetings it holds, but it is the
intensity of many of those 
<?notus-xml column=384?>meetings and the degree of responsibility held by its members that are
important. I am therefore happy to pay tribute and note with interest
some of the phrases that have been used in connection with the
legislation we have been talking about in the recent past actually
catching up with reality in terms of the information coming from the
agencies about operations or other areas. It is the case that this
committee has a great deal of power and that it has exercised it
informally, not least because the agencies want to have the confidence
of the committee. Therefore, whatever the statutory situation is, I
have always felt that the ISC has a great deal of power and holds great
sway with the agencies. It has been important to see that develop, and
it is interesting to hear how it is to develop in the future.</hs_para>

of caution about a theme that emerges time and time again, and that is
the need for transparency. We need confidence both in the committee and
in our agencies. There is a limit, as has been said, to the amount of
transparency that can exist. If we emphasise transparency too much, we
will lead people to believe that they can be told more than is the
case, and sometimes we need a reality check in that respect.</hs_para>

say a word about the success of the Olympics and Paralympics. As we
have been told, there was much concern beforehand about what might
happen and what the potential for disruption and danger was. The report
states that this put “unprecedented pressure” on the
agencies, and I can well believe it. I am glad that the report
recognises the exceptional effort made by staff, which the noble
Marquess mentioned in opening the debate. We all know that many real
sacrifices were made. It was an intense summer for many people who, for
example, lost their holidays or had difficulties if they had children.
This affected not only the agencies but MoD staff and, perhaps, more
widely throughout Whitehall. Although I am sure that many of those
individuals felt that it was worthwhile, there were real pressures and
we should pay tribute to them.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13012116000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000050">On the other hand, the
report recognises that the preparations that were made to anticipate
and avoid difficulties during the Olympic period meant that risks were
taken in certain other areas. This is a matter that we should not dwell
on but perhaps not push to one side because there are real and serious
potential problems here. Mention has been made of resources. We all
know that times are difficult. We also know that no Government want to
or can take risks with national security, which must always be a
priority. However, I am concerned, as are many other people, about the
pressures being placed on the single intelligence budget and I fear
that we are potentially getting to a critical period in terms of those
pressures and problems. We saw, as I mentioned, that the pressures
resulting from the preparations for the Olympics meant that squeezes
were made and gaps created elsewhere. The noble Lord, Lord Butler,
mentioned the increasing and intensifying danger of cyber attack and
how cyber security needs more attention and is more of a
challenge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000051">We
have seen how events as they are always called, such as the Arab spring
or awakening, which is probably more appropriate, are a real challenge
for the intelligence 
<?notus-xml column=385?>agencies. The report states clearly that there were gaps and problems.
We are seeing it at the moment so far as Mali is concerned; again,
clearly, there are problems. These are all unanticipated pressures. Who
knows what the next pressure will be: something in the Pacific or
somewhere else? The report expresses clear concerns about the extent of
global coverage that we have. Yes, we have got to work with allies, to
share intelligence and support, and to work with whoever we can
whenever we can, but I think that the committee is going to have a real
challenge here in finding out what the real pressures are and even
perhaps in anticipating what needs to be done to make sure that those
pressures do not create real problems. Recommendation S says

will watch that. I am slightly worried that there is a suggestion that

remain puzzled as to why it is the case because there must be very many
people who have the nationality requirements to join the agencies. The
two seats that I represented in Parliament—Bolton West and
Dewsbury—had many third-generation youngsters of families of
Indian and Pakistani origin who were born here, educated here, went to
university here, were well qualified and multilingual. I accept
entirely that there must be careful vetting of all
applicants—although in the past when there have been failures,
they have often involved stereotypical agency employees rather than
people from different backgrounds—but more could be done, more
should be done and more should have been done years ago. I
urge the committee to keep up pressure on this because not only do we
have an agency workforce that is not as responsive or representative as
it should be, but we are losing out on talent that we need. In the
past, we have had shortages, for example, of Urdu speakers, and yet we
have whole pools of them here who could be

Hennessy of Nympsfield:</Member></B> My Lords, I add my thanks to the
intelligence community for keeping us safe throughout our stellar
Olympic summer. As a historian, I hope the Cabinet Office has
commissioned an internal study of how it was done, for two reasons:
first, to serve as what Whitehall used to call in the old days a fund
of experience document, which can be drawn upon for the planning and
protection of future great national events; and secondly, when the
passage of time permits, so that the study can be declassified for
future generations to appreciate a job extraordinarily well done. As
far as one can see, as an outsider, the operation involved almost every
element of the British intelligence community.</hs_para>

thought of this old and ever present “secrets and
mysteries” problem that our intelligence-gatherers always face
when the files of the Franks inquiry into the origins of the Falklands
War were declassified a few weeks ago. The noble Baroness, Lady
Thatcher, gave absolutely riveting evidence to Franks—the
transcript of which, in parts, reads just like a film script. In one
section she expresses a degree of sympathy for the analysts, despite
her criticisms of the intelligence community on its pre-invasion
performance. Here she is in an exchange with Oliver Franks about such
criticism:</hs_para>

the easiest thing in the world for the JIC, or whoever does the actual
intelligence assessment, to say to ministers that every single thing in
the world could blow up into a major incident within the next few weeks
or months—Belize, Cyprus, Hong Kong … It would not be
helpful, it would be incompetent, it would be weak. They have to try to
alert us to some of the priorities, they have to make an assessment
which does not say everything is on a knife edge”.</hs_quote>

when reading the Franks inquiry transcripts. The great and the good
Oliver Franks asked each of the four Prime Ministers who gave
evidence—Harold Wilson, Ted Heath and Jim Callaghan, as well as
the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher—about the use they made of
their intelligence feed when they were in No. 10. In their different
ways they made it plain that among the piles of red boxes that the
private office prepared for overnight or weekend reading, they reached
first for what the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, called the
“hot box” containing the intelligence. It was so much
more interesting than yet another brief on local government rate
support grant, but that is my observation, not that of the noble
Baroness, Lady
Thatcher<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:35:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

happened already, it strikes me that it might be valuable if the ISC
conducted a survey with its questions modelled on the Franks approach
of how Mr David Cameron and the Ministers in the inner intelligence
loop make use of the product from our country’s remarkable
£2 billion a year intelligence and security machine. Again I
suspect that the results could not be published, but it would be
instructive and valuable, not least as an indicator, of how the new

have a final thought that is linked to the coalition’s <I>Civil
Service Reform Plan</I>. It contains a so-called “Action
11” which has aroused anxieties about a possible seeping
politicisation of the senior ranks of the Civil Service if Secretaries
of State are given the proposed “greater influence” over
new appointments. I hope that the ISC will keep a careful eye on this.
If there was the slightest whiff of politicising the top appointments
to the secret world it would amount to an anxiety of national
proportions. For almost above all others, the Queen’s most
secret servants possess an overriding duty to spare their ministerial
customers nothing; always and everywhere to speak truth unto power.
Theirs is among the toughest of callings in Crown service; placing

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a welcome opportunity
to debate this report today. Like the report, the debate has been both
fascinating and very illuminating. As the noble Marquess, Lord Lothian,
said at the start of his comments, it is right that we should thank the
intelligence and security services for their work. By the very nature
of the work they undertake, most of us will be unaware of anything more
than the occasional headline or special report, but what is so
important in what they do is the detail of their investigations and
their analysis. In most spheres of life, failure is not a matter of
life or death, but it can be for many in our three intelligence and
security service agencies—possibly their own, and certainly the
potential for the death of others if they get something
wrong.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012116000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000072">The
Prime Minister has made a Statement which is being repeated in your

situation and resulting military action in Algeria. That highlights and
emphasises the current international situation our security services
are faced with, while the noble Lord, Lord Hennessy of Nympsfield,
stressed the need to understand how and when the threat of terrorism
can emerge. It serves to highlight the importance and the dangers, and
the bravery of the staff who work for the agencies and why their work
is so important. It also highlights why the security and oversight of
that work is so important and that we must have processes that examine
and take evidence on the work of the agencies, in which Parliament and
the public must have confidence. The comments from my noble friend Lady
Taylor of Bolton on confidence and transparency were important: it is
crucial that Parliament has confidence in the work of the committee and
the
agencies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000073">We

of the report and the Government’s response. We have briefly
touched on the Olympics. Before the Games, when the report was
published, there were huge concerns, but in all ways the Games were a
great success, not least in terms of security and public protection.
The report highlights the challenges that the Games presented for
security, policing and counterterrorism, and it recognises the
“unprecedented” pressure—I assume that the word is
not used lightly—that the services were under. That was clearly
made much more difficult by the appalling problems with accreditation
and volunteers. We have said it before but should repeat our
appreciation of the professionalism of all those involved in security
for the Games, especially where emergency arrangements had to be made
after the failings of G4S and those responsible for monitoring its
plans and arrangements. It is worth re-emphasising our appreciation of
the work of the security services, the Armed Forces and the
agencies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000076">However,

there will be greater risk. But with finite resources and a major
national priority requiring greater effort over a defined period of

that the ISC and Parliament have confidence in adequate funding for the

point but this is something that is evident throughout the report and

Minister will recall the recent Urgent Question regarding Ibrahim
Magag, who was subject to a TPIM and absconded—apparently by
hailing a black cab. Many noble Lords across the House, who had vast
experience of counterterrorism issues, made the point that the removal
of the control order’s power to relocate someone who was
considered to be a danger made it easier for Mr Magag to abscond. The
Minister was reluctant to confirm, in that short debate, that the
Government’s policy change had to take some responsibility, but
the fact remains that while Mr Magag was subject to a
relocation order, he did not abscond. In fact, my understanding is that
nobody absconded while the power to relocate was included in control
orders.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13012116000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000090">Much
has been said today about the Arab spring, or Arab awakening. Although
the ISC recognises in its report that it can be impossible to predict
how and when events such as the Arab spring will begin, it also
questions whether the agencies should be better equipped to be able to
better anticipate how events might unfurl. Page 15 of the report has a
very helpful timeline that shows how quickly events can unfold. It can
be difficult to identify or predict the trigger that unleashes events
from an unstable situation, but I am not too clear—perhaps the
Minister can help—whether our intelligence services were aware
that the level of unrest was such 
<?notus-xml column=393?>that the potential for an escalation to the degree that we have since
seen was likely. As I said, I understand the difficulty in identifying
precisely how, when and why events will escalate—but was there
an awareness that they could escalate in that way? If so, were the
intelligence services able to advise Ministers
accordingly?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000091">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:54:52"></hs_TimeCode>
am not suggesting that it is on the same scale, but I think that the
recent and current situation in Northern Ireland illustrates a similar
point. I am sure that the intelligence and security agencies were, and
are, aware of dissident activity. However, although they must have
predicted that the flag issue in Belfast would be difficult, was there
any sense that the political disengagement, anger and fear felt by some
sections of society could have led to the violence we have seen? The
noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, commented in your Lordships’ House
when we discussed this issue that this was nothing to do with
flags—it was a wider resentment, fear and anger about a range of
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000092">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:53:00"></hs_TimeCode>
am not necessarily expecting answers to those points, but the issue I
am trying to raise is that the views and mood that led to the Arab
spring, and also to the current violence in Northern Ireland, were not
new. They did not rise up suddenly but were simmering. It then just
takes one incident to trigger the events that we have seen. In its
report, the ISC suggests that, in the case of the Arab spring, there
was a lack of understanding about the region, and it makes
recommendations to the Government on addressing this. Those
recommendations are crucial because there is also a downside to the
uprisings and changes in Libya, that of instability in the region. The
situation in Syria, and events in Mali and, particularly, Algeria,
illustrate how volatile and dangerous the situation currently is. The
wisdom of the committee on this specific issue is something the
Government should see as an asset and an
advantage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012116000093" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000093">My
final point is on cybersecurity and communications data. Clearly, the
way in which we communicate and how we conduct our business, including
financial business, has changed dramatically in a very short period of
time, and the threat to the resilience of those communications has also
increased. It is clear that the ISC shares the concerns that in the UK
we are at an early stage in developing our capabilities to protect UK
interests. In their response to the recommendations, the Government
seem to accept that. There is further evidence if the noble Lord looks
at the comments made in the recent report of the Defence Select
Committee in the other place, which was published on 9 January. It
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13012116000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012116000134">“The

comments and others throughout the report give enormous cause for
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:55:04"></hs_TimeCode>.
Clearly, the committee will continue to monitor this, but there are
grave concerns and we need to up our game and ensure that the work that

said “finally”, but my second finally is about the draft
communications Bill, which is currently in a Joint Committee of both
Houses. It is crucial that the Government bring forward a Bill that
recognises the 
<?notus-xml column=394?>need to bring legislation up to date with the technology being used by
criminals and terrorists. Parliament as a whole recognises that at the
same time there must be strong protection for public privacy, including
limits and safeguards on the use, storage and access to data, not just
by the police and the ISC but by private companies and other
agencies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-21T16:55:54"></hs_TimeCode>. I

It is, of course, of particular interest to the ISC. As noble Lords
will be aware, I had the privilege of leading the Bill through Report
stage in this House and participated in its full and thorough analysis.
I thank noble Lords for another informative discussion today
because Part 1 of the Bill concerns the oversight 
<?notus-xml column=395?>of the security and intelligence agencies. That is clearly of great
importance and interest to the ISC. I agree with my noble friend the

I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, will be
reassured by that and by what I am further able to say, because we also
intend to give the committee bespoke statutory immunities that will
provide it with protections that replicate certain aspects of
parliamentary privilege. Specifically, I can reassure my noble friend
the Marquess of Lothian that we are considering providing protection to
witnesses before the ISC so that the evidence they give in good faith

material proceedings will in fact allow for more cases involving the
intelligence services to be heard, including cases that previously
could not be heard at all. Nothing that is currently heard in open
court will be heard in secret in the future. The Bill is about ensuring
that allegations made against the Government involving intelligence
material are fully investigated and scrutinised by the courts, while
addressing the potentially severe implications that could arise if
sensitive intelligence secrets were disclosed in open court. In
response to the suggestion—made by some outside the debate

seriously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012118000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012118000007">The
ISC annual report, quite rightly, refers to counterproliferation as a
key issue and references, in particular, concerns regarding Iran and
its continuing efforts to enrich uranium in violation of six UN
Security Council resolutions. In response, we are committed to a
dual-track approach of engagement and peaceful pressure. The past year
saw a significant increase of pressure, including an EU oil embargo and
enhanced financial sanctions. Iran and the E3+3 grouping, which
consists of the UK, France, Germany, the US, China and Russia, met four
times to discuss Iran’s nuclear programme and, in December 2012,
a further round of talks was offered to Iran. I think that this is the
right
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012118000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012118000008">The
noble Baroness mentioned TPIMs. The ISC report noted its concerns about
the new terrorism and prevention investigation measures regime, and
there have been suggestions that the abscond of Ibrahim Magag has shown
that its concerns were well placed. National security is the
Government’s top priority, and the police, security services and
other agencies are doing everything in their power to apprehend this
man as quickly as possible. I would emphasise that this is not a
reflection on the effectiveness of the TPIM regime and that this
abscond had nothing to do with the change from control orders to TPIMs.
The TPIM Act provides rigorous measures to manage the threat posed by
terror suspects who we cannot yet prosecute or deport by limiting their
ability to communicate, associate and travel. This is the first abscond
by someone subject to a TPIM, and it should be noted that, in the six
years of control orders, there were seven absconds. David Anderson, the
independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13012118000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012118000023">“The
only sure way to prevent absconding is to lock people in a high

agree, and said so in the debate we had on the Urgent Question. Where
an individual cannot be prosecuted or deported, whatever steps are
taken and wherever they are located in the country, there will always
be a risk of their absconding, just as there were under control orders.
It has been suggested that a review of the TPIM system should be
undertaken. I am satisfied that the TPIM regime is a robust and
effective system for dealing with terror suspects who we cannot yet
prosecute or deport, but we will review our procedures following this
incident. I remind noble Lords that, as part of his role as the
independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson also
conducts an annual report that covers TPIMs. I would expect him to
examine this as part of his
review.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13012118000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012118000009">We
have spoken today, and there have been quite a lot of discussions,
about budgets and resources and the pressures faced by the agencies. My
noble friend Lord Lothian mentioned this in his introduction and many
noble Lords have referred to it. It has been the policy of successive
Governments not to reveal details of the individual agency budgets, and
I do not intend to diverge from this particular practice. However, I am
able to say that the Government welcome the ISC’s recognition of
the vital role that, for example, Defence Intelligence plays within the
Whitehall intelligence 
<?notus-xml column=398?>community. The reduction of the deficit is the Government’s top
priority—all noble Lords will understand that—which means
bearing down on public expenditure. The MoD, in common with the three
agencies, will have to make economies to meet the demands placed on it
by government, and no area of the MoD’s business can be exempt
from those economies. However, I am confident that DI will continue to
prioritise in those areas that matter most to UK national interests and
defence. DI retains the ability to surge people into these areas,
should the need arise, and work collaboratively with allies in areas of
mutual interest where it is a national priority to do so.</hs_para>

intelligence agencies budget is approximately £2 billion per
annum. It was and still is recognised that the spending review
settlement will be challenging for the agencies. They will need to
maximise value for money, efficiencies and collaborative working in
order to live within this settlement. Agency heads are aware of the
need to deliver efficiency savings while continuing to maintain
capability; and there has been steady progress towards this over the
past year.</hs_para>

to the budgets of the agencies and I trust that it will continue to
draw attention to any funding issues it feels warrant particular
consideration. For example, the noble Baroness, Lady Taylor, and my
noble friend Lady Hamwee talked about the recruitment and retention of
personnel. That must be a matter to which the Government and the ISC
should pay proper attention. I note the committee’s concerns
about the achievement of sustainable efficiencies, particularly from
collaborative working. The National Security Adviser will continue to
monitor the agencies’ ability to meet these matters.</hs_para>

Hamwee raised concerns over the agencies’ ability to maintain
effective staffing levels. In response to changes in the nature of the
threat and the economic climate, the agencies have reviewed their
staffing and skills requirements to ensure that they are in the best
shape to meet future national security challenges. Each agency
undertook a programme of redundancies or early release. These
programmes, alongside recruitment in key areas, have enabled the
agencies to grow the skills and expertise that they need to meet their
future objectives and provide greater room for capacity growth within
the organisations. The Government recognise that recruitment and
retention of internet specialists at GCHQ is a matter of the greatest
importance. We have therefore been working closely and urgently with
GCHQ to identify a sustainable package of measures to improve its
capacity to attract and retain staff with the necessary internet skills
and to implement these measures by the end of the year. We will of
course continue to monitor the situation and review these new
measures.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13012118000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012118000013">I
should make a point about diversity. Vetting is essential to the
agencies to ensure the security of their work. Nationality requirements
can pose real challenges in the case of some minority applicants and I
hope that noble Lords will understand that. However, we are working
with the agencies to improve diversity. A number of recruitment
campaigns online and in the printed media have been specifically
designed to attract those from diverse backgrounds.</hs_para>

substantial debate on an important matter of public interest. I am
grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in a debate on a
wide-ranging report. I warmly welcome the annual report and
look forward to future annual reports being equally or—given the
new arrangements in train for the ISC—perhaps even more
insightful. Finally, I conclude by paying tribute once again to the
enormous contribution made by the security and intelligence agencies in
ensuring that the British public are properly protected. The men and
women who work in our agencies are hugely skilled, professional and
dedicated. The burdens that secrecy imposes on their private lives can
be great and we owe them a great debt of gratitude.</hs_para>

Marquess of Lothian:</Member></B> My Lords, I can and will be brief. I
just want to make a number of comments in relation to what I thought
was a very sensible and insightful debate. The remarks made today have
reflected the essentially non-partisan nature of the ISC, which is one
of its great strengths. I start by thanking the Minister for his
remarks. I will not go into them in detail. He has given a number of
indications of amendments in another place and assurances as to
adequate funding, and we look forward to seeing those amendments and
hearing the outcome of those discussions on funding. It has been
helpful to have those
remarks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012118000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012118000017">With
regard to what has happened recently in Algeria and the lessons that
can be learned—we have missed the Statement so I do not know
what was said—it strikes me that something we should be looking
to for the future is a proper analysis of what happens to arms when
they disappear. We know that in Libya Gaddafi’s arms
disappeared, and we have indications that some may have reappeared in
Algeria this week. I have a great concern at the moment that
some of the arms that have been provided to the rebels in Syria,
vicariously or directly, may end up in the hands of al-Nusra and other
Islamist organisations, which would not be in the interests of this
Government in the future. I hope that area will be looked
at.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012118000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012118000018">I
mentioned retention last year and made a very strong point about it.
One of the reasons for talking about the retention of staff within the
agencies generally, 
<?notus-xml column=400?>but specifically within GCHQ, is that the nature of GCHQ’s work
means that the people who operate there are highly skilled in IT. They
are recruited because they are what the director-general described in
our report last year as “whizzes”. He said, “How
do I hold on to my whizzes when the outside world is trying to recruit
them at far greater expense than I could ever meet in order to keep
them?”. It is an unresolved problem that I hope the Government
will go on wrestling with. I am glad it was raised by a number of noble
Lords here
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012118000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012118000019">The
noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, raised the issue of redactions. This is
something that comes up every year. Redactions irritate us all. When I
was the shadow Foreign Secretary in another place, I used to enjoy the
debates because I would read out pages of redactions and it always got
a laugh. It was only when I joined the committee that I
realised how essential they are. The committee does not write its own
redactions. The committee writes its report as it sees things and that
report is to be seen by the Prime Minister. It is the Prime Minister
who will come back and say, “We feel there are certain areas
here that should not be in the report that is published”. In my
experience—and I may be wrong—I do not think there has
ever been a redaction, which can only be allowed on grounds of national
security, that has not eventually been agreed between the committee and
the Prime Minister, because if it is a matter of national security
there is no question in the committee’s mind that that should
not be redacted. We could write reports without redactions, but they
would not be as valuable to the Prime Minister or, indeed, the general
public.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13012118000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130121-gc0001.htm#13012118000020">My
final point is in relation to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord
Hennessy. Once again, we have heard an interesting and
