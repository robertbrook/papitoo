and I hope that noble Lords will view them in good
favour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000003">Amendment
1 inserts an expiry clause into the Bill whereby the Act will
automatically expire five years after commencement of the licensing
requirement in Clause 1. Clause 18 contains a review provision and I
would expect the Government of the day to carefully consider the
outcome of the statutory review and bring forward an appropriate

I am sure that the industry would prefer longer-term certainty, the
review and subsequent expiry will see early action if this regulation
is proving costly, difficult, or ineffective. That said, the Government
are confident that the provisions in the Bill will have the desired
effect and that any subsequent legislation will be based around this
regulatory regime. However, having listened to the arguments made
during the Bill’s passage in the other place for the inclusion
of an expiry clause, we agreed to its inclusion, which is why we have
laid this amendment today so that the Bill will automatically expire
five years after
commencement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000005">Amendment
2 modifies the review clause from five to three years. The statutory
review will require the Secretary of State to assess the extent to
which  the Act’s objectives have been achieved and a
shorter review period will therefore allow this consideration to be
made at an earlier stage. This review will play a pivotal role in the
development of future legislation and tie in with the timetable for
bringing forward any new legislation after five years.</hs_para>

reduces the scope of the review to remove the need to assess whether
the Act should be repealed. This requirement is no longer necessary
because Amendment 1 inserts a sunset clause—the expiry
clause—and the Act will therefore automatically be repealed
after five years. The review should, however, focus on assessing the
effectiveness of the regime and recommending any future legislation
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000007">These

Faulkner of Worcester:</Member></B> My Lords, I hold the noble Earl in
the highest regard, so I know he will not take personally the criticism
that I going to direct at the amendment which he has moved this
morning. In my time here, I can recall a number of occasions when
attempts have been made in this House to add a sunset clause to a Bill
that has come to us from another place. In every case, these clauses
had been felt necessary in order to improve an otherwise unsatisfactory
Bill—often to insert a safeguard into a measure that was
controversial or threatened civil liberties and human rights. That is
not what we have in front of us this morning. This amendment will not
improve the Bill; indeed, it will damage it in two material
respects<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T10:11:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000009">First,
passing the amendment will delay the Bill’s enactment, as it
would have to go back to the other place to get the amendment agreed.
Given the track record of a small number of Conservative MPs who
routinely try to use procedural devices to block Private
Members’ Bills, who can be certain that those who threatened to
talk out this Bill on 9 November—or some of their
friends—would not attempt to do the same thing again? If,
however, we pass the Bill unamended, it would not need to return to the
House of Commons and could obtain Royal Assent almost
immediately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T10:12:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T10:12:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000010">My
second objection to the sunset clause is that it sends the worst
possible signal to all those who are desperately attempting to tackle
and defeat the metal thieves. Heroic efforts have been made in the last
year by the British Transport Police and the civil police, local
authorities, trade associations, reputable scrap metal dealers, the
churches, the War Memorials Trust, the energy companies, Network Rail
and the train operating companies and the Home Office. They have all
worked tirelessly to bring down the incidence of metal theft, catch the
offenders and ensure
convictions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T10:12:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T10:12:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000011">As

have been numerous press reports of successful prosecutions and

of the noble Baroness, Lady Browning, and the Commons sponsor, Richard
Ottaway MP, we have an excellent Bill in front of us, which, as every
noble Lord who spoke on 30 November believes, will do the job expected

to give this House the opportunity to consider the addition of a sunset
clause—not to improve the Bill, but in order to buy off the two
Members who habitually cause trouble for Private Members’ Bills.

have this sunset clause. I hope that the Minister, on reflection, will
withdraw this amendment so that the legislation can go through

that we have Bills coming before this House—mainly originating
from European directives—where there is no possibility of having
a sunset clause and where the Government are unable to proceed. This
looks like a bit of window dressing. We should listen very carefully to

Davies of Oldham:</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly support the points
put by my noble friend Lord Faulkner. I have had experience of these
procedures in relation to the Commons. In 1977, I introduced an estate
agents’ Bill that tried to deal with the scandal, at the time,
of members of the public depositing money in the care of estate agents,
and then almost as soon as that money was received, the estate
agents’ offices closed down, the estate agents disappeared and
the money was lost. There was widespread support for the remedy of that
abuse and the House of Commons supported the Bill, apart from two
Members who persisted through all stages, not against the merits of the
Bill—how on earth could they do so?—but simply on the
grounds that there was far too much legislation and they saw no reason
why the Bill should go through. The result was that, two years later,
the incoming Conservative Government took up the Bill and eventually it
was passed and the abuse was remedied.</hs_para>

although they were not the reputable ones who would not have dreamed of
carrying out such a scandal, but fly-by-nights. The abuse continued for

Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who
contributed to this important debate. First, the noble Lord, Lord
Rosser, talked about the need to use Private Members’ Bills. The
noble Lord knows perfectly well how difficult it is to secure time for
a government Bill. My noble friend Lady Browning’s comments
reminded me of my Road Traffic (Enforcement Powers) Bill that I ran as
a Private Member’s Bill in your Lordships’ House on
behalf of the Labour Government and the noble Lord, Lord Whitty. I
experienced similar problems trying to get the Bill through the House
of Commons because of the sadly deceased Mr Eric Forth.</hs_para>

Lords will be aware that provisions to extend the life of a Bill are
relatively easy to make, either by a Bill with a tightly worded Long

experienced noble Lords well know. In answer to my noble friend Lord
Skelmersdale, I have already explained how the review system will work.
Once the Bill becomes law, the fact that it was a Private
Member’s Bill will make no difference. My noble friend Lord
Forsyth asked whether, if an amendment is not agreed, a Bill can go to
Royal Assent. Yes, of course it can, as all noble Lords well
understand. If we do not agree this amendment, the Bill will go on to
Royal Assent and become law. That is simple fact. However, future
government assurances about Private Members’ Bills will carry a

Ramsbotham:</Member></B> My Lords, although it is short and relatively
simple, I hope that the House will agree that the Prisons (Property)
Bill is nevertheless important. In introducing it, I must congratulate
Stuart Andrew, the Member of Parliament for Pudsey, for bringing it
forward and successfully piloting it through the other place and
express my gratitude to him for giving me the opportunity of continuing
his work and putting it before your Lordships. I am conscious that it
is not unconnected with the intention of the Prisons (Interference with
Wireless Telegraphy) Bill, recently taken through this House by my
noble friend Lord
Laming.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000071">I do
not think I need to delay the House by taking noble Lords through the
straightforward text of the Bill, bearing in mind that its provisions
are set out in some detail in the Explanatory Notes. However, because
some Members of the other place questioned why it was required at all,
it might be helpful if I explained its necessity. Very rightly,
prisoners are allowed to have in their possession sufficient property
to satisfy their daily needs. Such property is authorised by the
governor or director of a prison, with each item being recorded on a
prisoner’s property card. The purpose of this Bill is not to
interfere with a prisoner’s right to have and enjoy authorised
items but to deal with property he or she should not have or that has
been adapted for an unauthorised
use.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000072">Mobile
phones are one of the most unwelcome forms of unauthorised property in
prisons. Not only are they linked with some serious crimes in prison
but they are used to organise crimes, including murder and drug
dealing, in the community. The Offender Management Act 2007 and the
Crime and Security Act 2010 made the possession of mobile phones in
prison a criminal offence and introduced measures to try to reduce the
chances of their being smuggled in, on which the National Offender
Management Service has since done some excellent
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000073">However,
in 2009, the administrative court found that, in the particular case of
a mobile phone, there was no lawful basis for permanent confiscation or
destruction of property confiscated from a prisoner. As a result, the
Prison Service currently has to store unauthorised property confiscated
from prisoners in a central storage facility until their release, at
which time the governor is required to return it if the prisoner 
<?notus-xml column=892?>from whom it was removed asks for it, which, in reality, very rarely
happens. For example, in 2011 only 112 out of 41,000 mobile
phones—of which only 49% were attributable to specific
prisoners—stored at a cost of around £20,000 per year
were claimed. Noble Lords will therefore recognise why, in the eyes of
the Prison Service, the consequences of the administrative
court’s decision are perverse.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13011845000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000074">However, the problem
goes much wider than just mobile phones. Prisoners may be found in
possession of unauthorised items, which, while not strictly illegal,
are considered to be contrary to the safe and secure running of a
prison or need to be controlled for reasons of space. Governors are
also faced with the problem of authorised items that have been adapted
for an unauthorised use, such as shoes or radios adapted to conceal
drugs, or toothbrushes or razors adapted to create offensive weapons. I
am sure that noble Lords will agree that it is unacceptable for prison
governors and directors not to have appropriate powers to deal with
these
items.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000075">Therefore,
the Bill aims to put that right, supplementing the Offender Management
Act and the Crime and Security Act, by giving governors and directors a
statutory power to destroy or otherwise dispose of unauthorised,
unattributed or adapted property found in a prison or a prison escort
vehicle, should they consider such action
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000076">It
is important to note that the Bill does not require the destruction of
any property but merely confers a discretionary power on prison
governors and directors to destroy confiscated items. In cases where an
item is illegal per se, such as a mobile phone, the presumption will be
that it will be destroyed or otherwise disposed of, but where an item
is not in itself illegal, I expect that governors and directors will
confiscate it and then decide whether it should be held in storage, for
return on release, or whether the prisoner should be required to have
it removed from the prison.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13011845000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000077">There will be a
six-month delay from the commencement of the Bill before any previously
confiscated property can be destroyed or disposed of. In all other
cases, prisoners will have a limited time period, yet to be agreed,
during which they will be able to appeal against destruction or
disposal, which safeguards the ruling that this should be considered
only after all other options have been explored and deemed
inappropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000078">However,
the Bill is not about just the destruction of confiscated property. It
also gives prison governors and directors what I think is an important
option; namely, the power to dispose of an item, including the option
of selling it. If confiscated items have a monetary value, why should
that not be realised, with any profits raised not kept by the National
Offender Management Service but donated to an appropriate charity?
Governors could also donate such items directly to a charity 
or recycle them—subject, of course, to any security or other
requirements. I would not want to encourage noble Lords to think that
significant sums of money might be raised by this provision, because I
suspect that most confiscated items will have little or no monetary
value, but I think that it is an option that should be made
available.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=893?><hs_para UID="13011845000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000079">In
order for this new power to be truly effective, it must be
retrospective in respect of unauthorised cameras, sound recording
devices and electronic communication devices or mobile phones found
before the commencement of the Bill. Noble Lords will quite rightly
expect that where a retrospective power is claimed, safeguards for its
limitation and proper use are included. I hope, therefore, that noble
Lords will note that the retrospective provisions in the Bill are
strictly limited, being intended primarily to enable the Prison Service
to deal with the large number of mobile phones currently held in
storage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000080">This
Bill strikes a fair balance between a prisoner’s property rights
and interests on the one hand and, on the other, the public interest in
removing from prison and destroying property that may prejudice good
order and discipline or prison security. Guidance on the exercise of
the powers it contains will be given to governors and directors in a

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, one of the great attractions
of Private Members’ Bills is that they often provide an
opportunity to bring forward a non-controversial measure that is so
straightforward and makes such sense that one is left wondering why it
has not been done before. This appears to be one such Bill, and I
welcome that it does not seek to be overly complex, as sometimes can
seem the case with legislation. I concur with the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, in congratulating Stuart Andrew on bringing this Bill
forward in the other place and welcome the fact that the noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham, has brought it to your Lordships’
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000082">I
suspect that most people, had they given this issue much thought, would
have assumed that the powers this Bill seeks to provide were already in
place. My understanding is that governors, officers, parliamentarians
and others will welcome the Bill because of the clarity it
provides about the powers held by a prison governor or
director. The aim of the legislation is clear and realistic, as we have
heard. It will allow a governor of a prison, young offender institution

first position in government was as Parliamentary Private Secretary to
the Prisons Minister—now the noble Lord, Lord Boateng—and
it does appear that, whatever the level of security, these items still
find their way into prisons. Clearly, this proposed legislation does

is in itself a useful, practical and sensible
measure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000084">However,
if the issue of drugs, knives, mobile phones and iPhones getting into
prisons could be tackled, this Bill would not be needed—or would
be rarely used. I will take this opportunity to ask the Minister about
the action being taken to stop such unauthorised  and sometimes
illegal items getting into prisons. I am happy to have that in writing

address.</hs_para>

argued that items can be stored in a prison for a certain period and
returned to the prisoner on release, as we have heard, not only does
the cost of that storage fall on the National Offender Management
Service but there is the issue of whether it is appropriate to hold and
return unauthorised items. I cannot imagine anyone suggesting that
illegal items should be returned to prisoners on release. The current
rules state that any article belonging to a prisoner that remains
unclaimed for more than a year after he leaves prison, or a year after
his death, may be sold or otherwise disposed of. But at present
governors cannot destroy property, even unauthorised property, if the
prisoner says they want it returned at some  later

have heard, mobile phones are some of the most commonly found items in
prisons. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, did the House a service by
being very clear about the dangers and problems that are caused by
mobile phones in prison. In case anyone is in doubt, the use of mobile
phones in prison is not a benign or minor infringement of the rules. I
vividly recall, when I was a Member of the other place, the case of a
constituent whose daughter had been murdered. The man convicted of the
murder used a mobile phone to telephone the press about the case, and
articles based on the interviews with him were profoundly distressing
to my constituent. There are several more detailed aspects to that case
that are not relevant to this debate, but I use it to illustrate the
point—which was also very well made by the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham—that the rule not to allow mobile phones in prison is
there for very good
reasons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000087">Clearly,
mobile phones are legal outside prison—although some people who
travel on public transport might have doubts about that—but it
could be argued that these should be returned to a prisoner on release.

easy to identify ownership, so it is not always possible to return the
phone to its “rightful” owner, and this Bill clarifies
what should happen in such

the High Court ruling in the case of Coleman in 2009, I
understand—and it has been confirmed by the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham—that governors have been told that they do not have a
general power to confiscate permanently or destroy a prisoner’s
property, although they had previously done so. I also understand that
items had been sold in the past and profits or proceeds have been made
available to Nacro.</hs_para>

of this Bill, but it would be helpful to have some clarification on
just a couple of issues. Will the Bill remove any possibility of legal
challenge, as in the Coleman case, and ensure that there is not a case
for compensation from prisoners for their property after they
have left prison? What consideration has been given to how items will
be disposed of? We have all read and heard reports of where computers
have not been wiped. There is clearly a need to ensure that if items
such as mobile phones, including iPhones, and small notebooks have
information stored on them, it is removed before they are sold. Will
the Government issue guidance on whose responsibility 
<?notus-xml column=895?>that will be and what should happen to the proceeds of any sales? I know
that in the other place, although it was accepted that Nacro was an
appropriate body to receive such proceeds, it was asked whether Victim

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank the noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, for introducing the Bill for your
Lordships’ consideration and, as ever, for his important
contribution. I fully acknowledge and pay tribute to his extensive
knowledge of the Prison Service. As always, his knowledge and
experience is of great assistance to the House; we are eternally
grateful for that. I also think the noble Baroness, Lady Smith of
Basildon, for her full support of the Bill. Although, as has been
acknowledged, the Bill is short, it is also essential. It will make a
very useful contribution to the package of measures already in place to
keep good order and security in our
prisons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000092">As
the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, the Bill complements the Prisons
(Interference with Wireless Telegraphy) Bill, which I also supported in
this House last month, introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Laming. I
also thank my honourable friend in another place, Stuart Andrew, for
bringing forward this valuable Bill, which has the full support of the
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000093" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000093">It
may be of assistance at this juncture if I explain to the House the
current arrangements for dealing with property that a prison governor
or director has not authorised a prisoner to possess. When discovered,
an item will be confiscated unless it is noxious, in which case it will
be destroyed. If it is something such as an offensive weapon or a
controlled drug it will be passed to the police for them to deal with;
all other items may be confiscated but only temporarily. It is this
anomaly, which the noble Baroness picked up, of being able only
temporarily to confiscate an item and having to return it to a prisoner
on release that the Bill aims to
address.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000094">The
consequence of the current limited power of confiscation is that
confiscated property has to be stored either locally at the prison or
at the Prison Service’s central facility until the prisoner is
released from custody. If the prisoner asks for the item to be returned
to them on release, the prison must do so. This limitation on prison
governors’ and directors’ authority cannot be right. It
also places a considerable but unnecessary burden on the Prison Service
in that it has to find storage facilities and meet the cost of that
storage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000095">It is
extraordinary what lengths prisoners will go to to try to smuggle
illicit items into prison and the ingenuity that they show at times in
adapting ordinary, everyday items for an illicit purpose. An
illustration of that is the example highlighted by the National
Offender Management Service’s north west search team, which
reported the seizure of three weapons at Her Majesty’s Prison in
Wymott, near Preston. During the course of a search of prisoner
accommodation, three adapted 
<?notus-xml column=896?>slashing weapons, wrapped together in a strip of bed
sheeting, were found wedged behind copper piping in
a wing toilet. The weapons had been adapted from authorised items:
namely, a disposable razor, toothbrush handles, a strip of bed sheeting
and disposable razor
blades.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000096">The
intention behind the Bill, therefore, is to provide a lawful basis for
the disposal of all unauthorised property found in prisons or
authorised property which has been adapted for an unauthorised purpose.
It will give a discretionary power—that is important; it is a
discretionary power—to prison governors and directors which will
allow them to confiscate and then destroy, dispose of or sell property
that prisoners have in their possession that they should not
have.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000097">The
items that that includes are: those that would be illegal to possess in
the community, such as illicit drugs; those items which can threaten
prison security and good order, such as mobile phones, which the noble
Baroness and the noble Lord mentioned, which are unlawful to posses in
prison; authorised items that have been adapted to conceal illicit
items, as the example that I mentioned illustrates; and items that have
been smuggled into the prison or coerced from another prisoner. The
Bill will provide the required power to deal with items such as
these.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000098">The
power to destroy confiscated property is discretionary, and I assure
the House that this power will be exercised in a proportionate manner.
It is right that items that are illegal to possess per se should be
destroyed. However, prisoners may also be found in possession of items
which are not illegal to possess in themselves, but which they are
nevertheless not authorised to have in their possession. Those items of
property will, I believe, be dealt with differently in practice. I
expect that both governors and directors will normally confiscate the
unauthorised item and then, subject to concerns such as good order,
discipline or prison security, will consider other methods of dealing
with the property short of destruction or disposal. That may include
authorising the item in question, holding it in storage for return to
the prisoner on release, or requiring the prisoner to remove the item
from the prison. However, destruction of property will remain an option
for the governor should other disposal options be deemed inappropriate.
As is normal practice, guidance on the exercise of the powers conferred
by the Bill will be set out in a Prison Service instruction—a
point on which the noble Baroness sought
clarification.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000099">The
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, explained that the Bill will specifically
enable the destruction or other disposal of certain property which was
seized prior to commencement of the Bill and which remains unclaimed
six months after commencement. The retrospective nature of this power
obviously may cause some concern, but it is limited, and safeguards
have been built in that I believe should provide reassurance to the
House. However, in order for the power to be effective, a limited
retrospective power is, in our view, necessary. The power will apply
only to some unauthorised property found before the commencement of the
Bill, namely cameras, sound recording devises and electronic
communication devices; that is, as has been referred to previously,
mobile phones. Noble Lords will be aware that mobile phones are some of
the most unwanted 
<?notus-xml column=897?>items of property that we have in prisons. Again, as the noble Lord
illustrated, there are examples where they are used for a variety of
crimes within prisons. They can be linked to
serious crimes and have been used to organise crimes ranging from
murders to drug dealing in the community. The destruction of such
property will assist in our legitimate objectives of crime prevention
and public
safety.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000100">The
Bill contains a specific provision to give prisoners and others an
opportunity to claim back the property before destruction or disposal.
The period for claiming back the property is generous enough, I think,
at six months. I hope that the House will be reassured by
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000101">The

been acknowledged by both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, the
Bill is a common-sense measure. It strikes a fair balance between a
prisoner’s property interests and the public interest in
removing from prison and destroying property which may prejudice good
order and discipline or, most importantly, prison security. I am sure
that many ordinary people will be startled and surprised—as I
was—to learn how the law stands. Prisons can find items that
should not be on the premises but have no power to destroy them. The
Bill is an important step forward, and one that rectifies an
unacceptable anomaly. It will allow governors to run safe, secure
regimes, with rules that are meaningfully

tool for managing risks to safe navigation currently available to some

That many ports already possess the tools and use them successfully and
reasonably is a mark that the proposal in this Bill to make it easier
for other harbour authorities to obtain them is one grounded in both
logic and proven experience. However, the Bill recognises that
conferring the power on new ports should be subject to democratic
procedure. Any harbour authority wanting the power will need to apply
to be named in an order made by the Secretary of State, or Scottish or
Welsh Ministers, as appropriate. There would be a public consultation
on the proposal, which would give an opportunity for any objections to
a harbour authority being designated with this power to be heard and

5 would require an authority to consult before giving harbour

general direction, I see little need for creating an additional
bureaucratic system to deal with what remains, at the moment, only a
theoretical possibility. It seems to me that a non-legislative

estate and up to one mile from its boundary. Increasingly, both ports
and local police forces find this geographic limit to their powers very
unhelpful. The geographic limit on port constables’ powers is
clearly not sensible for the modern day. It is right that they should
remain focused on matters connected with the port, or suspected
criminals within the port estate, but there is no justification for

the most widely recognised mitigation measure for the navigational

MacKenzie of Culkein:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very pleased to
welcome this Bill and to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, for
taking it forward in this House. A number of matters are covered in
this Bill, and it will not be surprising to noble Lords, given my
background as a fourth generation lighthouse keeper, that I will

lighthouse
authorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000128">The
measures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:35:56"></hs_TimeCode> in this
Bill relating to the GLAs are long overdue. Representations about these
issues have been made for some considerable time, and it is good that
these are now at long last being taken forward. I was sorry that the
Marine Navigation Bill of 2008 did not get beyond the draft stage, and
I am delighted that both the Government and the Labour Opposition
supported this private Member’s Bill in another
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000129" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000129">First,
Clause 8 provides for the first time clarity on the area of
geographical responsibility of the lighthouse authorities. As is often
the case, legal experts do not agree on meanings of Acts of Parliament,
and it seemed never to be possible to get agreement on the meaning of
the expression “adjacent seas and islands”, as set out in
Merchant Shipping Act. Notwithstanding the lack of agreement on the
precise meaning of 
<?notus-xml column=902?>present legislation, the GLAs provide aids to navigation, including
marking hazards outside the 12 nautical mile limit, as well as lighting
internationally recognised sea lanes for the purpose of traffic
separation. Added to this is the need to light buoys or beacons on
potentially hazardous wrecks outside that limit. This Bill will give
legal certainty by making it clear that the responsibility of the GLAs
includes the area beyond the territorial seas and up to the outer limit
of the UK’s pollution control zone—in other
words, 200 nautical
miles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:37:53"></hs_TimeCode>. It is not
new that hazards are marked outside the territorial limit. The iconic
Bell Rock lighthouse was built, with parliamentary approval, some
200 years ago, and was outside of the then three nautical
mile
limit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000130">Over<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:38:08"></hs_TimeCode>
the years that I have spent in your Lordships’ House, I have
quite often taken part in debates where there was understandable
concern about the costs to shipowners of light dues and the need to
keep these as low as possible. I do not have an issue with that,
provided always that the safety of the mariner and the environment is
not compromised. So secondly, I welcome the measures in Clause 9, which
will provide for more opportunity for GLAs to generate more income for
the General Lighthouse Fund. The Merchant Shipping Act, as the noble
Baroness said, allows for any spare capacity to be utilised for
third-party commercial work, provided such work is not outside the
scope of the statutory responsibilities of the GLAs. In reality, the
GLAs are constrained in that they are limited to using ships or
property assets. One example of that is that the Oban base of the
Northern Lighthouse Board is now utilised by small cruise vessels for
berthing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:39:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000131" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000131">In
the period 2011-12, some £4 million was raised by the GLAs from
commercial activities. There is little doubt that the measures in this
Bill will allow for greater opportunity for commercial work by allowing
the purchase of ancillary assets and services which, while not
necessarily required for statutory duties, nevertheless can and indeed
must be used for exploiting spare
capacity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:39:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000132">These
past few months, the NLV “Pole Star” has carried out
quite a bit of interesting contract work, including recovery of
waverider buoys, their guard buoys and seabed frames. The
last-mentioned part of that work is extremely delicate due to the
fragile nature of the instruments on these seabed frames. No doubt that
was greatly assisted by the dynamic positioning capabilities of this
very versatile ship. The commercial work carried out by the
“Pole Star” included multibeam surveys, camera tows and
grab sampling of the seabed. Those are the sort of skills that are
available and can be brought to bear whenever there is spare capacity
available. That can now be enhanced by the purchase of assets to enable
that additional work to be
undertaken.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000133">There
are a lot of clever people in the employ of the general lighthouse

services which can provide a greater possibility of increasing

additional activities will prejudice the statutory role and
responsibility of the general lighthouse authorities. Purchase of
assets from the 
<?notus-xml column=903?>General Lighthouse Fund for contract work outside of

and finally, for the GLAs, I refer to Clause 11. This will
provide an extension of the ways in which the GLAs can mark a wreck
where there is a danger to navigation. The amendment proposed to the
Merchant Shipping Act would allow the wreck to be marked by a
non-physical device such as the relatively new automatic identification
system as well as the more traditional buoys or beacons. The beauty of
marking by electronic means such as AIS means that a hazard can be
quickly marked before it is possible for a lighthouse tender to get out
to a wreck to lay buoys, beacons or other physical markers. This must
enhance the safety of the mariner and provide better protection of the
marine
environment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:49:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000135" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000135">As
an aside, I hope that nautical colleges are teaching that the AIS is
used not just for tracking other vessels by the watchkeeper on the
bridge of ships or by coastal vessel traffic services stations, but is
used increasingly as an aid to navigation. I was on the bridge of a
ship recently and was talking to a deck officer cadet in his final year
who was adamant that it was dangerous to use AIS as an aid to
navigation. Clearly, he had never been taught about the concept of
virtual AIS, either at Warsash Maritime Academy or on board the ships

content of the Marine Navigation Bill itself. By the end of my speech

Nelson’s HMS “Victory” and in its heyday the
largest industrial complex in the world. There I spent my formative
years studying and training in a naval shipping environment. Noble
Lords who are familiar with the south of England will know that just
along the Solent lies the commercial port of Southampton, famous for
its ocean liners connecting the United Kingdom to North and South
America, Africa and the Far East. Cunard, P&amp;O, Union
Castle—all the great shipping lines sailed out of Southampton
and through the 
<?notus-xml column=904?>Solent with its two tides a day, mixing with the warships out of
Portsmouth, the submarines out of Gosport, the ferries to and from the

skills you learn during your formative years seem to embed themselves
more readily, and the grounding I gained in marine engineering from the
Admiralty—when we had an Admiralty, that is—together with
an awareness of the procedures of sailing, particularly small craft in

second reason for contributing to this debate is in recognition of my
forefathers who for generations earned their living as master mariners
on the west coast of England and beyond. The family business was
running a fleet of coasters under sail down the Bristol Channel and
beyond to Wales, Liverpool and Ireland. They sailed out of Watchet, an
historic port on the north Somerset coast. Along that coast the tide
rises and falls by more than 40 feet and bars were built across harbour
entrances to retain sufficient depth of water to keep ships afloat at
low tide. At other times harbour bars created a navigational hazard
which added to the constraints that needed local pilotage knowledge and
skilled deckhands to bring ships under sail safely into port. Coastal
ketches and sloops that my ancestors sailed generally had a crew of
four or five when under sail at sea. To sail them into or out of
Watchet harbour, however, needed extra hands provided by the local
community. They were known as hobblers. “Hobbling” is
defined in the <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I> as ad hoc unlicensed
pilotage. Some might say, “Those were the
days<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:46:47"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000141" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000141">Hobbling
was lucrative and thus became a competitive occupation. Hobbling
families vied with each other to glean advance information of shipping
movements ahead of their rivals and secure hobbling work. They would
race out to ships in the channel in their rowing boat, put a pilot
aboard if the skipper did not have local knowledge, and then sail the
ship into its moorings. Inevitably, violence broke out among the three
Watchet hobbling families until, in 1864, the landlord of the London
Inn, himself a master mariner—one George Chidgey—brought
them together and thrashed out agreements to share the work and
responsibilities in a sensible manner; thus was formed the Watchet
United Sailors Benefit Society and for the first time the long
established Watchet Hobblers’ pilotage was regularised as a
precursor to the pilotage system we are debating
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:47:24"></hs_TimeCode>. Some time
during this period, a family ketch, the “Florrie”, was
sunk in a storm off Land’s End with the loss of all hands, who
all came from several generations of Chidgeys, and thus effectively
brought to an end my family’s engagement in merchant
shipping<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:47:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000142" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000142">That
brings me to my third reason for speaking in the Second Reading of this
Bill. Alerted by the various depositions from organisations affected by
the Bill, I took the time to study what proved to be an excellent
briefing pack provided by the House of Lords Library. As noble Lords
will know, this is not a new Bill. It started under a previous
Administration and has been recycled as a Private Member’s Bill.
There is nothing 
<?notus-xml column=905?>wrong with that. However, reading through the briefing pack, I found
that issues being raised now in your Lordships’ House seem to
have been raised previously and, to a degree, debated in another place
in a previous Parliament. Therefore, I take it that the outcomes then,
which involved tweaking of elements of the Bill, particularly Clauses 2
and 5, as the noble Baroness has mentioned, have not entirely laid to
rest the concerns expressed. Therefore, I welcome the opportunity to
debate this further in this

refer specifically to concerns regarding pilot exemption certificates
being awarded to crew members other than masters or first officers, who
are, of course, also known as mates. For example, Alistair Singleton of
the Liverpool Pilotage Service Ltd, by his own reckoning an authorised
pilot with 36 years’ experience in the shipping industry, has
written to me about his concerns. He tells me that the proposed
amendments to the Pilotage Act 1987 give him a great deal of concern,
pointing out that pilotage in the UK is, first, a public service whose
development over time should be carefully weighed before making
changes. Mr Singleton says

impact assessment in the Bill, he argues that Clause 2 should be

heard from Mr Tim Nuttall, another Liverpool pilot, who has called into

pilots were dispensed with to be replaced with unqualified,
inexperienced mariners from around the globe—this is a serious

have a belief that sea is in the blood. I have the same problem as the
noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, pointed out in relation to his family: I am
the Scottish Mitchell-Thomson McEacharn—the Ben line, the
McEacharn line, the Scottish line. We could not earn very much money,
so we sailed the world. We set ourselves up in Australia; we were the
first harbourmasters in Otago in New Zealand and, for ever and a day,
we have a family rule that we must die at sea and have our latitude and
longitude on our lair or on our tombstone. Even if we do not, and if I
were to pass away today here, the rule would be that, on my lair in
Scotland, the latitude and longitude of this particular Bench would be

have an interest, obviously, because of my sea background. I think that
I began in the boating world at the age of five, punting a rather ropey
punt on my grandfather’s lake and being reminded that it was his
father who in the First World War, and not being able to continue in
the Army, had pressed into service his yacht “Venetia”,
which was then fitted with depth charges and was off Harwich to patrol
for submarines. However, it was unable sail to fast enough, so that,
when the first trial took place, the stern blew off and the vessel was
in port for the rest of the day. He received a remarkable letter from
the Admiralty, that is still in my family, thanking him for his
glorious service during the war and making him a commander in the RNVR,
in which capacity he had himself painted. Provided with this
certificate was a note stating that he had received 100 guineas
by way of a prize or a reward. This was framed in the downstairs loo,
as we would call it, and put on the wall with a note from him stating
that, when he was on his seat, he would forever remember the historic
meanness of the
Admiralty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:54:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:54:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000151" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000151">We
know that the public sector is inevitably mean and inevitably short of
money, but we do need the private individuals. I pay great tribute to
my noble friend who has introduced this Bill for what she has managed
to do down in Cornwall. It is quite remarkable in that area how she has
single-handedly almost transformed people’s attitude to the
whole of the inlet business. We have a coastline in the United Kingdom 
<?notus-xml column=907?>that is as long as India. It is full of ins and outs, which to some
extent means shellfish. When you go down there and visit the lobster
factories, as I call them, where she has persuaded fishermen to take
lobster eggs and grow lobsters that are then exported, you realise the
importance of

and outlets—maybe they are called havens or
harbours—are areas that need development and exploitation. I
shall speak today principally on the role of the private sector. After
punting across a lake, I then ended up trying to get a Seagull outboard
motor with a small aluminium exhaust to go down the depths of the
Arran. Over time, we ended up with small boats where we all trained at
young age. My son first drove a Dellquay Dory at the age of three,
sitting on your knees so that you could have health and safety. Over
the years, as I had sailing boat—all, I have to say, on borrowed
money—I would ask families where they had only children, and
parents were worried that they might lose their children during the
holidays if they had only one, if they would like me to take them. We
would have gangs, and we would deal in adventures. We had to go across
to France of course to invade France, but, on the way back, in order to
be sure that my navigation was okay, we would ring lighthouse keepers.
At a young age, they ring Niton Radio. My son would ring Niton Radio
and they would say, “Hello, Callum, how are you? Is it going all
right?”. You somehow felt secure if you had been in touch with a
lighthouse keeper. If you were going past Portland Bill and wanted to
take the inner route, and you were nervous about the tides, you would
ring the lighthouse
keeper<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:57:01"></hs_TimeCode>. I always
really wanted to be a lighthouse keeper or possibly to have my own

background that I have this deep affection for the sea, but also, I
would like to return to the leisure sector. One day, I received a
letter asking whether I would like to accept the appointment to be
chairman of the Greater London and South East Council for Sport and
Recreation, responsible for planning and development of sport and
recreation in Greater London, Surrey, Sussex and Kent, so help me God.
I think that they wanted a Lord, and I did not know that we had a
committee of 300, which included the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and
the Royal Parks. But that did not matter; the idea was to try to get
people to go out and play games and play sport. This became something
of a passion: how could you make something possible? Among the areas
that we looked at were inland waterways, the whole of the Thames and
the whole of Docklands, trying to encourage shallow-water diving. At
Greenwich, there was an old Henry VIII graving dock which the council
was going to fill in and get rid of. We managed to find the
enthusiastic diving brigade which said that this would be a perfect
place for training divers, and the other lot said that it would be a
perfect place for training canoeists, so we had the divers diving at
night. And then the local people wanted to fish, so we stocked it with
fish as well. There were also little holes in the ground where you
would put in a pole and an umbrella, and we brought things to
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T11:58:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000154" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000154">It
was then that I realised that we were responsible. In Greater London,
Surrey, Sussex and Kent, you had all the water areas, the inner lakes
and others—what 
<?notus-xml column=908?>could you do with them? Over time, in my boat or boats, I have visited
every single haven, harbour and creek right the way down to the end of
Cornwall. There are moments of great excitement when you decide,
“Let’s go into the Beaulieu River at night for the first
time”. When you wake up in the morning, when everyone else and
all the young ones are asleep, and you see a stag swim across that
river in front of you, that is emotion. What I am trying to point out
is that this private sector is absolutely critical to the whole of the
maritime world. It is also a considerable nuisance. The sorts of things
that we would encourage people to do would be to look at the history of
windsurfing, which was meant to have started in Hayling Island with
someone with a broomstick on a door. Before you knew it, once it was
mentioned, a whole lot of the young were out there on doors, causing
absolute havoc with the tide going the wrong way.</hs_para>

at these inland creeks and waterways, there is this need to make sure
that the private sector—if that is what it is
called—co-operates fully and is fully trained on all aspects of
navigation. One exercise we would do sometimes was to take a small Dory
and go from somewhere such as Birdham in Chichester harbour through the
little cut into Portsmouth harbour to review the fleet. You would
arrange for one of the ships there to stand up and wave. It was
creating the activity on the water that caused an enormous amount of
fun.</hs_para>

trying to point out that if we are to be involved in this area, we have
to bring together the private and public sectors and the training of
individuals. A bunch of children who have capsized in the way of a
tanker coming into a harbour can cause a lot of chaos. However, if you
explain to people at a young age what the rules and regulations are
during their training for sailing or for driving motorboats, you can
get a long way. I speak here today on behalf of the private sector but,
more importantly, for the young. Once you have got their enthusiasm the

people to use the water as possible, without getting in the way of
others. The problem here is that the pressures on ship owners and crews
to save money are nowadays immense: hence tiredness, cutting corners
and, often, language problems. Most of the time, it is all right and
nothing happens. There are sometimes small incidents and occasionally,
sadly, some things one might term disasters, be they oil spills, cruise
liners hitting rocks or whatever. We can all say that it will never
happen again but, sadly, it occasionally does. In considering this

pressure for this change is coming from. The Chamber of Shipping seems
to have confirmed my view that it is coming from a very small sector of
the shipping industry; basically, a dredging company in the Thames.
There, you have three people on the dredger: the master, the first mate
and a third person, who is perhaps the deck officer. Because of the
working time directive requirements, the master likes to dump the
aggregate on the quay while the first mate likes to do the dredging, so
somebody has to drive the ship in between and it obviously has to be
the deck officer. We can debate whether such a person has the right
training or experience. We will need to debate further whether it is
appropriate for such a definition to be applied to bigger shipping. I
have seen no substantive argument from the Chamber of Shipping or
others to support the claims that this change needs to take
place.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13011845000165" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000165">There
are two key issues here. One is that if the phrase “deck
officer” is to be applied properly, it has to have a proper
definition of how they are trained and what qualifications they have. I
suggest there is also an issue as to what managerial responsibility
they have in relation to the master. It is fine to say that he might be
the navigation officer. However, if he is also employed and the boss,
two levels up, is the master it might be a brave person who overruled
that master. While it is not overruling, because the master is in
charge, it is a different relationship from just providing the
navigation information. There is a lot more work to be done on this,
and I hope that we can discuss  this more with the noble

Lord, Lord Chidgey said, because I live just over the hill from Watchet
and I know it well. It is probably not realised that Watchet was a
commercial port until just a few years ago. There was a local shipping
line called the Willie line—I hasten to say that it was spelt
with an “ie”—that regularly ran a large vessel in
and out of Watchet. You never know what is going to come out of the

original right of the general lighthouse authorities to use vessels for

their statutory purposes, goes back to when the noble Viscount, Lord
Goschen, was Shipping Minister in this House. I was in a meeting with
him and he suddenly came up with this out of the blue, which delighted
me and indeed the general lighthouse authorities. That was in 1997, so
the GLAs have been able to do that for some time. This extends that
right and allows them to act as consultants and to use various moneys

part in marine safety. They are rightly proud of their profession. I

have to move with the times, as do we all. Today, shipping is very
different from what it was 15 or 20 years ago. Some
ships—for instance, ferries—now have three crews. They
are used 24 hours a day. It is not like the old situation where a ship
had a master and a first mate, and they stayed there, often for some
considerable time. Regrettably, I am afraid that manning standards have
also been a huge cause of concern. Ships are operating with fewer and
fewer people. This means that those officers who have pilotage
exemption certificates may have been on watch for God knows how many
hours, and they have, statutorily, to take rest from time to time, so
somebody else may be required when the ship is coming into

this first arose, there was a lot of hoo-hah and stories that cooks
could put themselves forward to get pilotage exemption. Of course, that
could never happen. It is up to the ports to issue these certificates
There is absolutely no way that a port is going to issue an exemption
certificate to someone who is not properly qualified. I remind your
Lordships that it has been common practice in the Merchant Navy for
years for younger officers to be overqualified for the actual job they
are doing on a ship. On some ships, you may have a third officer who
actually has a master’s—or certainly a
mate’s—ticket. They are also operating on ships which
come in and out of harbour regularly, so they know the waters of the
harbour. The pilots’ fear is perhaps slightly overstated on
this. It will not result in fewer jobs for pilots. They should be far
more concerned over something that is coming up in 2015 when, under new
EU regulations, the sulphur limits allowed in  fuel will be
reduced even further, to the point where,  
<?notus-xml column=914?>fuel being as expensive as it is—around 30%

very good job. Of course, the nature of pilotage has changed, as the

happened. I can understand the pilots’ concern, but it was
misplaced. I also think that it is misplaced on this occasion. As the

Lady Wilcox on this; the Bill has got it right on this occasion. I
would hate there to be any reduction in safety at sea. I was the
Minister in charge when the “Braer”, not the “Sea
Empress”, went down. That was not a matter of pilotage. We all
know what happened, and I will not comment further, but it is no joy at
all for there to be any shipping accident whatever in our waters, or
any other waters. Nevertheless, I still support the Bill as it

than is the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, about the noble Lord,

wants to get rid of Clause 2. He knows full well that the Bill will not
reach the statute book if that clause is removed. I listened earlier to
the noble Lord; he was waxing eloquently on the Scrap Metal Dealers

not reach the statute book”. Now he is happy to say,
“Let’s take Clause 2 out of this Bill and it will sail
through the House of Commons”. I am much more cynical about the

Rosser:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble Baroness,
Lady Wilcox, on her involvement in taking the Bill through your
Lordships’ House. It addresses a range of specific issues and
contains a number of the provisions of the 2008 draft Marine Navigation
Bill of the then Labour Government, many of which were introduced into
your Lordships’ House by my noble friend Lord Berkeley. For that
reason, we indicated support for the Bill in the Commons and for its

Bill contains provisions relating to: the power to remove harbour
authorities’ pilotage functions; the granting of pilotage
exemption certificates; the circumstances in which a harbour authority
can suspend or revoke a pilotage exemption certificate; the offence by
the master of a ship of not giving a pilotage notification; the giving
of harbour directions to ships within, entering or leaving the harbour
of a designated 
<?notus-xml column=916?>harbour authority; the power to make a closure order so that a harbour
authority can and will stop maintaining its harbour; the extension of
the geographic jurisdiction for the current six ports police forces in
England; issues relating to the area in which each general lighthouse

aspects of the Bill to which I shall refer. The first is Clause 5,
which deals with the designation of harbour authorities that can give
directions to ships, which effectively means craft of any size,
relating to their movements, their mooring or unmooring, their
equipment and their manning within that harbour authority area. As the
noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, and the Minister will know, concerns have
been expressed that the power to give directions may not always be used
in a proportionate or reasonable manner in relation to small craft in
particular. It would be helpful if the noble Baroness and the
Minister—if the Government are supporting the
Bill—indicated what safeguards will be place to minimise the
likelihood of this happening and, if it happens, what procedures will
be in place to enable decisions by a harbour authority to be
challenged, other than by pursuing the matter with the harbour
authority that has made that
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:35:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

concerns the issue that has been mentioned on a number of occasions,
the change in respect of pilot exemption certificates. The noble
Baroness, Lady Wilcox, and the Minister will be more than aware of the
concerns raised by the UK Maritime Pilots’ Association, which
clearly fears that the changes proposed have rather more to do with
cutting costs than they do with anything else, and are concerned about
the safety implications. The Bill amends the Pilotage Act 1987 so that
any bona fide deck officer, which includes the master or first mate of
a ship, may hold a pilotage exemption certificate, provided that the
harbour authority is satisfied that they are capable of piloting one or
more specified ships within its harbour. Currently, only the master or
first mate of a ship can hold such a
certificate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:36:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

can define what is meant by the term “deck officer”, and
say how junior an officer can be to be a deck officer if it is
envisaged that, when carrying out their pilotage role, they could
challenge the decision by the master of the ship. Again, it would be
helpful if the noble Baroness and, indeed, the Minister, if the
Government are supporting the Bill, can say: from what source pressure
for this change is coming; what the difficulty is with the
present arrangements that is so significant that it can be overcome
only through the proposed wording in the Bill—not through any
mean not involving legislation; over what period of time, how
frequently or consistently, and in what circumstances, the difficulty
has arisen; whether the change proposed in the Bill will be to the
financial advantage of any groups of individuals, organisations or
companies; and, likewise, whether the change set out in the Bill on
pilotage exemption certificates will be to the financial disadvantage
of any groups of individuals, organisations or companies. Perhaps the
noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, could also 
<?notus-xml column=917?>say what the assessment is, in view of the concerns that have been
raised, of the impact that the proposed changes in granting pilotage
exemption certificates will have on the current number of authorised
maritime pilots. Is the assessment that it will lead to an increase, a
decrease or no
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:38:20"></hs_TimeCode> as far as
their numbers are
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:38:23"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000197" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000197">The
proposed change in the Bill on pilotage exemption certificates could
potentially result in a number of deck officers on a ship having a
pilotage exemption certificate for a specific harbour. An increase in
the number of deck officers on a ship with the certificate presumably
means—but I may be corrected on this—that some or all of
the deck officers are going to be piloting the ship within the harbour
less frequently than would be the case under the current arrangements,
where it is only the master or the first mate of a ship who holds the
pilotage exemption certificate. Is there or will there be any
requirement that the holder of a pilotage exemption certificate has to
undertake the piloting of the specified ship within the harbour
concerned a certain minimum number of times over a laid-down period? If
that is not the case—and perhaps it is the case—will the
harbour authority be able to satisfy itself that no deck officers with
a pilotage exemption certificate for a specific ship, in respect of
that harbour, will have lost the skill, experience and local knowledge
required through lack of undertaking the pilotage
responsibility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:39:35"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000198" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000198">Furthermore,
will the harbour authority be able to put a limit on the number of bona
fide deck officers who can hold a pilotage exemption certificate for
their harbour in respect of a specific ship, or will it have to grant
one unless it can show that at the time the certificate was sought, the
individual did not have the skill, experience and local knowledge
required? I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, or the Minister,
will be able to respond to the points I have raised either today or
within a short period of time—certainly before the next stage in

to parliamentary counsel that the Prince of Wales’s consent was
not required for this Bill, so it was not sought. The Prince’s
consent was required for the previous Bill because it 
<?notus-xml column=918?>made provision about lighthouse authorities and therefore directly
affected the Duchy as the local lighthouse authority for the Isles of

is a profession that emerged in the earliest days of maritime trade, in
recognition of the need to provide valuable ships and their cargo with
safe passage into harbours or through dangerous waters. The Rolls of
Oleron—a code of sea laws first promulgated by Eleanor of
Aquitaine in the 12th Century and introduced in England during the
reign of King Richard I—exacted severe penalties on any pilot
who lost a ship in his care. He was to be beheaded. Whether this
draconian punishment served to improve standards of pilotage, I could
not possibly
say<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T12:42:47"></hs_TimeCode>. I can say,
however, that it forms no part of our current pilotage
legislation—the Pilotage Act 1987. Although this may be an
extreme example of an earlier legal provision now deemed redundant, it
is reflective of the tides of change and the need to modernise
legislation on occasion. This Bill contains such modernising

Stevenson of Coddenham:</Member></B> My Lords, just over a year ago
during the previous Session, I introduced the Second Reading of what
can accurately be described 
<?notus-xml column=922?>as a close sibling of this Bill. I said then that I
would be brief, partly because although there was no threat of snow, it
was taken even later on a Friday. Noble Lords will be pleased to hear
that I will be brief again for the reason that this Bill, while it is
very important to our society, is blisteringly simple. Its
straightforward purpose is to make inroads into one of the last of the
major discriminations in our society; namely, the discrimination
against people suffering from mental ill health.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13011845000227" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000227">I believe that as a
society we can be proud of having removed discriminations in law on
gender, disability, sexual orientation, age and ethnic origin. However,
it is quite remarkable that there remain blatant and, I would say,
disgusting discriminations against those suffering from mental ill
health. I am glad to report that since the Second Reading of my
previous Bill, the Department for Education has removed the
discriminations on school governors that were covered in that Bill. I
also draw to the attention of noble Lords the clause concerned with the
disqualification from jury service. That situation has been improved.
However, everything else remains the same. I will not reiterate the
details, not least because they have been extremely well summarised in
the Cabinet Office briefing which is available to us all. Suffice to
say that the Bill removes a number of clearly outdated and
dysfunctional discriminations against the following interesting groups
of people: MPs, company directors and, more widely, all potential
jurors.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13011845000228" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000228">This
comes at a time when we are beginning to see the first green shoots of
a change in public attitudes to mental ill health. For far too long it
has been stigmatised, as everyone will be aware, and let us make no
mistake that it is still heavily stigmatised. However, we can see the
start of greater public awareness that mental ill health is an illness
like any other, be it a frozen shoulder, a broken leg or the flu bug.
The fact that a Member of another place could stand up and describe
himself as a “practising fruitcake” and a week or so
later be elected as chairman of a very important Select Committee
speaks for itself as to the progress that has been made. A number of
so-called public figures have now, for some time, bravely paraded their
brushes with mental ill health and talk about it just as they would
talk about breaking a leg or getting a horrible illness, such as a
heart problem or whatever. Stephen Fry and Ruby Wax come to mind, who
have not jumped on any bandwagon but have been at it bravely when it
was not popular and was risky for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000229" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000229">However,

Ryder of Wensum:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord,
Lord Stevenson of Coddenham, on bringing forward this Bill. I believe
that I am the only former Member of the other place taking part in this
debate, so I am delighted about the support—often courageous
support—given to the Bill by honourable and right honourable
Members. It is generally held that about 18% of adults in the UK suffer
from at least one form of common mental disorder. This means that in
any one Parliament, over 100 MPs fall within 
<?notus-xml column=923?>that category. Although I understand that just one
Member of Parliament was removed for the reason of unsoundness of mind
in the 20th century, this Bill has obliged elected Members to be far
more conscious of the problems of mental health. Psychiatric disorders
take many forms: depression, anxiety, bereavement, bipolar disorder,
schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress syndrome, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, phobias and adult
ADHD.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000231" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000231">More
Members of Parliament recognise the human costs of these disorders as
well as the costs to the economy in terms of welfare, sickness,
absenteeism and the loss of productivity which sets the economy back by

that noble Lords do not need persuading of the value of the Bill, but
it is worth reminding ourselves, just for the record, of some of the
reasons why this is so important. I am sure that noble Lords are well
aware of the recent report by the London School of Economics’
Centre for Economic Performance, which found that mental illness is
widespread, growing and generally more debilitating than most chronic
physical conditions. For example, one-third of all families in Britain
have a family member with mental illness. Nearly half of ill-health in
those aged under 65 is due to mental illness, and only a quarter of
those needing treatment receive it. It is estimated that 6 million
adults have depression or anxiety and 700,000 children have a mental
health disorder. There is an economic effect as well: mental health
problems account for nearly half of absenteeism at work and a similar
proportion of people on incapacity benefit.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=924?><hs_para UID="13011845000235" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000235">We also know from the
excellent work undertaken recently by Mind, Rethink Mental Illness and
the Time to Change campaign that out of 2,700 people
surveyed, 80% said that they had experienced
discrimination, two-thirds were too scared to tell their employer about
their condition, 62% were too scared to tell their friends, and one
third were too scared to seek professional help. These are shocking
statistics and unworthy of a modern society, so everything we can do to
address the stigma of mental ill-health and demonstrate our commitment
to removing the discrimination that comes with that is
vital.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000236" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000236">That is
what this Bill starts to do. It is not going to change the world, at
least not overnight, but it is a significant step in sending a clear
and unambiguous message that mental illness should be treated on the
same basis as any illness. That is the key principle at stake here and
one that we recently affirmed in this House during the passage of the
Health and Social Care Bill, which confirmed that mental health should
be treated on a parity of esteem with physical
illness.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000237" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000237">Some
may think that this does not affect many people. Very few people
actually seek political office or become directors of corporations or
school governors and we are not all asked to serve on a
jury—although that might come in time—but that is not the
point. The Bill affects us all because it is about the kind of society
in which we want to live and work and ensuring that everyone has a fair
chance to achieve their ambitions without arbitrary
discrimination.</hs_para>

protecting people. As we have heard, there is a much greater risk that
people will not come forward about mental health problems if they fear
discrimination. This Bill will help ensure that if a Member of
Parliament, a school governor or a director of a company has a mental
health problem, they can be confident about seeking help, certain in
the knowledge that they will not lose their job as a
consequence.</hs_para>

someone who has had a bit to do with anti-discrimination and equality
legislation in my time, I am a bit embarrassed that it should be
necessary to bring a Private Member’s Bill to remedy the
injustices this Bill seeks to correct. I suppose any piece of generic,
comparatively unfocused legislation like the Disability Discrimination
Act, and now the Equality Act, is bound to miss a few specific
provisions—pockets of discrimination, which, to our shame,
remain hidden away in the interstices of the statute book. We should be
grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, for winkling them out and
bringing them to us today so that we can root out once and for all
these anomalies, which, inappropriately in the 21st century, continue
to disfigure our legislation and have unaccountably escaped the

we should not be altogether surprised that these anomalies should have
survived, because of course they reflect the particular stigma that
mental illness has traditionally attracted, and still
attracts—greater even that that attaching to physical
disability. For that very reason, we should warmly welcome this Bill as
sending a strong message that the outdated attitudes reflected in the
discriminatory provisions that the Bill sweeps away are no longer
regarded as appropriate in a civilised
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000243" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000243">Like
other noble Lords, I do not propose to say anything about the specific
provisions of the Bill, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson,
pointed out, are fully covered in the briefing which has been provided.
Rather, I will simply give the Bill a warm welcome, thank and commend
the noble Lord for bringing it before us today and express the hope

course, that will not be the end of the story. As the noble Lord said,
the Bill makes just an inroad in the problem of discrimination which
still attends those who suffer from mental illness. Mind, Rethink
Mental Illness and the Royal College of Psychiatrists point out that
there is still a good deal to do before parity of esteem between
physical and mental health is achieved. That means valuing those who
suffer from mental illness equally with those who suffer from physical
illnesses.</hs_para>

things need to be done to improve outcomes for those who suffer from
mental illness. The notion of parity needs to be embedded in the NHS
constitution. Mental health services should be funded to a level which
accords with the scale of mental illness. Currently, mental illness
accounts for 23% of all illness, but receives only 13% of the NHS
budget. Waiting times for mental health treatments need to be
comparable with those for physical illnesses. They recommend annual
health checks for people with mental health problems, and enhanced
training on co-morbidity to avoid people with severe and enduring
mental health problems dying 20 years younger than the general
population.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000246" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000246">The
Bill can be a springboard to end wider discrimination, which is still
endemic in the delivery of mental health services, and to move towards
the parity of esteem which the advocates for those who suffer from

end, we committed ourselves to working with our partner churches and

who have experienced mental health problems find continues to dog them
for the rest of their lives. That is particularly true for those who
have been sectioned, and that is further reinforced when they are
barred from participating with their fellow citizens in certain areas
of our common life. The reason for such barring seems to be predicated
on the view that recovery from mental ill-health is not possible; but
it most certainly
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000249" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0001.htm#13011845000249">I could
cite the case of a very good priest in my diocese who was once
sectioned, but who is now fully recovered with a most effective
ministry—perhaps even more so than it might have been, given his
empathy for others going through a similar experience which he can

a severe bout of postnatal depression, who is now debarred from jury
service under current regulations but who is, ironically, giving
excellent legal advice to others for whom no such bar

Stevenson on pursuing this concern so assiduously. I also would like to
take this opportunity to congratulate Members of Parliament who spoke
about their own experience of mental illness, which took considerable
courage. I hope that it signifies the beginning of the end of the
discrimination that people with mental illness experience not just in
their everyday lives but in some policies, such as the law that we are
seeking to change

passing of this Bill will be a crucial step in addressing
discrimination against people with mental health problems. Current
legislation enabling the removal of the seat of an MP following a
period of detention in a hospital is simply
outdated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:16:09"></hs_TimeCode>. The
idea that anyone suffering from a mental illness is incapable of
becoming well again is very much against the principles of mental
health recovery<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:16:27"></hs_TimeCode>.
I should draw the attention of noble Lords to my interests as a
psychiatrist, albeit no longer in clinical practice, and my previous
role as president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which I know 
<?notus-xml column=927?>has briefed many speaking in the debate today. With confidence, I can
say that mental health problems are treatable. The majority are highly
treatable, some having a better prognosis than physical

appropriate support and treatment people can return to previous levels
of functioning, just as people with physical illnesses do. In keeping
with the Government’s commitment to parity of esteem for mental
and physical ill health, as outlined in the mental health strategy, we
must treat those who experience mental illness in the same way as those
who have physical illnesses. It follows that, if someone who suffers
serious physical health problems such as cancer or cardiovascular
disease, no matter how debilitating, is able to retain their seat in
Parliament, so should those with mental health problems, even if they
require reasonable adjustments to be made to enable them to continue to
be present in the workplace. The Disability Discrimination Act requires
that of employers and workplaces. Parliament should be setting a
benchmark for standards in equality, not lagging behind. It should be
possible for Members of Parliament to seek help for and to be open
about their mental health problems without fear of
discrimination.</hs_para>

Sometimes that mental ill health comes about because of some quite
devastating life experience. Yesterday, I was fortunate to visit
Headley Court, where I saw members of the military services receiving
rehabilitation, and to visit in particular its mental health and
cognitive services department. I saw the very positive way in which
that rehabilitation service helps people suffering from post-traumatic
stress disorder, or having difficulty adjusting to life with the
injuries that they have acquired on the battlefield, return to their
previous lives and make whatever adjustments are required. I was very
impressed by the attitude and opportunities being offered to
servicemen. We need to see that very positive attitude to getting

parity of esteem. This important issue

I hope that noble Lords will permit me a couple of minutes to make two
points that have not been made so far in this debate. I, too, thank the

legislation that the Bill seeks to repeal was passed because, at the
time, Members of Parliament thought that they were protecting people
vulnerable because of mental illness and the organisations named in the
Bill. Since then, there have been two significant developments that
make this Bill appropriate. The first is that the Mental Health Act
2007 states that mental
disorder,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13011845000328" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0002.htm#13011845000328">“means
any disorder or disability of the

effect of that, which was intended by the then Labour Government, means
that today mental health legislation extends to a very wide range of
people, including those who have mild depression. People who would
never believe it until it happens to them can find themselves subject
to mental health legislation and being excluded from the duties set out
in the Bill. That should not be the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:22:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13011845000260" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0002.htm#13011845000260">Secondly,
the Mental Capacity Act 2005—a piece of legislation of which the
last Labour Government should be rightly proud—enshrines in law
the common understanding that we all have, that people with mental
health problems or learning disabilities can vary day to day. Their
condition can vary; it can sometimes be good and sometimes be bad.
Since the legislation was passed, it has become much more common for
people with mental health problems, such as those who are bipolar, to
state at a point when they are well that they know from past experience
that they may during a period of illness make unwise decisions. They
can make an advance statement that says, “Now that I am well, I
wish to say that if during my illness I make unwise decisions, I wish
those decisions to be ignored”. That makes episodes of mental
distress much more manageable than they ever were in the
past<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:23:25"></hs_TimeCode>. For those
two reasons, it is very important that we pass the Bill. For example,
with juries, there is no reason why a major trial should be
jeopardised, because people can recuse themselves; they can go to see
the judge and make sure that they are not holding things
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-18T13:23:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13011845000261" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130118-0002.htm#13011845000261">There
is one other reason why this provision is important, and I refer back
to the new organisation of the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, Insight:
Research for Mental Health. It is the objective of everyone who works
in mental health services to fund research that will one day find the
cause of mental distress, new treatments and ultimately, one day, a
cure. If we continue to debar people from aspects of public and
economic life, in particular from roles that give them meaning, we
delay the point at which we will be able to find those treatments and
cures that will enable people with mental health problems to do as they
do in many cases now—to continue to function day by day as
valued and valuable economic and social contributors to our

the issues that have affected them. No one can dispute that they are,
and have been, very effective MPs because they can often better
understand the issues affecting many of their constituents. Their
experience also shows that mental health can be an issue for anyone,
anywhere, from all walks of life, at any time. It does not necessarily
have to be permanent either. As with any chronic condition, it is how

However, what is worse is that they are symptomatic of the prejudicial
view that having had a mental illness makes you incapable of being a
citizen with all the rights and responsibilities that that implies.
They stigmatise this illness unlike any other. They put out the message

am dimly aware, partly because my son has just completed a PhD in

understanding of what is treatable, what is acceptable and how, as the
noble Baroness, Lady Hollins, said, particular traumatic events can
interact with one’s physical conditions to lead to temporary
conditions of the brain which affect our mental balance. There is a
great deal that we have to do in educating our public and putting money
into mental health services in those areas which overlap with this very

sadly, died last year before he could see the possibility of the Bill

Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) has prepared a
trust statement providing an account of the collection of revenues
which are due to be paid to HM Treasury. The statement includes the
value of fines and confiscation orders imposed by

welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (C&amp;AG) report
on the trust statement which recognises the improvements HMCTS has made
in its accounts. The statement shows that in 2011-12 HMCTS collected
more than £484 million from offenders. A record
£22.3 million in compensation has been paid to
victims of crime—funded by criminals’ cash and assets
recovered through confiscation orders. During 2011-12 the total value
of outstanding impositions decreased from £1.9

tackle this outstanding

five per cent of the orders imposed in 2011-12 have already been paid
in full. Of the balance outstanding, £1.2 billion is made up of
confiscation orders. Around one-third of this is money that can not be
collected—£141 million (12%) relates to individuals who
are deceased, deported or who cannot be located, £40 million
(3%) relates to orders which are being appealed and cannot be enforced
while under appeal, and £154 million (13%) relates to orders
where following the conclusion of financial forensic investigations the
assets have been assessed as hidden. Also, £278 million is
interest which has accrued on confiscation orders which are outside the
agreed payment

down on those who do not pay is an absolute priority. The agencies
involved in enforcement, including the Ministry of Justice, the Home
Office, the Serious Fraud Office and the Crown Prosecution Service,

earnings and by seizing and selling their property and goods. Those who
