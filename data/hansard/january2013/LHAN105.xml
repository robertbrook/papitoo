his Answer. I am sure he is therefore aware of the comments of the
CITES Secretary-General, John Scanlon, about the huge increase in
poaching of wildlife, especially in Africa, which he feels is going to
help fund the insurgencies there. Domestically, in Britain, does my
noble friend agree that poaching birds’ eggs, for example, is
stealing our children’s inheritance as much as stealing the
Crown jewels? What guidance will he give to the new police

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I am aware that John Scanlon
recognises the increasing involvement of organised crime in illegal
wildlife trade. He has welcomed  
<?notus-xml column=1638?>the UN Security Council’s call for an investigation into the
alleged involvement of the Lord’s Resistance Army in the
poaching of African elephants and the smuggling of ivory. Police and
crime commissioners will hold their chief constables to account for the
totality of their policing, which includes the chief constable working
in collaboration with other police forces and agencies to address
national issues that impact on their communities. As I have said, we
believe that there is often a link between organised wildlife crime and
other organised crimes, such as drugs and arms trafficking. We
therefore expect the police to take wildlife crime seriously where it
is a priority for their communities; co-operation with the NWCU will be
key to
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:09:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

interest as the chairman of a small charity which funds the training of
wildlife wardens in east Africa. Is not my noble friend right to say
that this is now an international issue? It has an impact on
corruption, particularly in east Africa, and perhaps in Kenya
especially. It has an impact on insurgency. The right way for us to
deal with it internationally is to begin to raise the human capacity of
those organisations in Africa which are taking the front line in
fighting what is an increasing tide of wildlife crime. Will my noble
friend recommend to DfID that it consider specific programmes targeted
at raising the human capacity of, for instance, wardens in east

published by Passenger Focus. It showed that, although the overall
picture is mixed, Great Britain compares favourably with other European

longer-distance tickets purchased in advance. The study compared some

Sevenoaks to London. Will he ensure, and also ask his right honourable

people can understand? The majority of people do not understand the way

Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, I agree that it must be difficult for
ordinary passengers to understand how ticket pricing works. The
increase in regulated fares is implemented by train operators as an
average across a basket of fares. This flexibility allows some fares to
be increased by up to 5%—although only 2% on
Southern—more than the average, while other fares must increase
by much less or even be held flat to comply with the regulated
average<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:16:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:17:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0001.htm#13013131000029"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Snape" PimsId="749" UID="13013131000458" xid="1696" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0001.htm#13013131000458">Lord

does the Minister agree with the figures that show that fares for
travelling by train have increased in real terms by about 20% over the

Davies of Oldham:</Member></B> My Lords, I am surprised that the
Minister takes a patronising attitude to what the public understand.
The public understand fare increases quite clearly. The National Audit
Office warned that if excessive fare increases occurred they would
merely be reflected in higher profits for the train operating
companies. The Prime Minister said that fares should not go up by more
than 1% above inflation—in other words, 4.2%. How does the
Minister justify fare increases of
9<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:18:51"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:18:57"></hs_TimeCode>%?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0001.htm#13013131000034"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Attlee" PimsId="3822" UID="13013131000463" xid="1061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0001.htm#13013131000463">Earl
Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, a fare increase of 9% can arise where
you have the RPI plus one, plus the flexibility that is necessary in
order that train operating companies can adjust their fares to suit
changing conditions. For instance, let us suppose there was a new
shopping centre in an adjacent town. It might be desirable to adjust
the pricing structure to reflect that. If there were no flexibility,
train operators would not be able to adjust their price structure but
would have to stick with an old
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0001.htm#13013131000035"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:19:05"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Roberts of Llandudno" PimsId="391" UID="13013131000464" xid="1697" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0001.htm#13013131000464">Lord
Roberts of Llandudno:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister realise

collections against the £480 million cut in council tax benefit

considering options and will make an announcement shortly. Earlier this

quality do not amount to affordability. We cannot expect, and the
Government cannot call on, women to take half the top jobs and half the
places in boardrooms without childcare help, because they are squeezed
out in mid-career by unaffordability. Childcare for a woman in
full-time work is just as worthy of tax relief as secretarial
assistance for the businessman, who receives the full allowance on
that. The difference in treatment of employees with workplace nurseries
and those without is unfair, and it is even worse for the
self-employed. Therefore, will the Minister please consider basic-rate
tax relief being available for the employed and self-employed alike who
wish to work full

free childcare from about 20,000—the number funded under the
previous Labour Government—to about 260,000. This is one of the
most tangible ways of focusing childcare support on people at the

of the proposals that were announced at the beginning of this week. We
have looked in particular across the EU, where childcare and nursery
care is in some cases thought to be better than in the UK and two
things have emerged: first, that we need to have better-qualified
people involved and, secondly, that the ratios that the noble Earl
spoke about are tighter in the UK than virtually anywhere else.
However, the two go together, and that is why in our plans for early
years teachers and educators we are putting a lot of emphasis on
improving the qualifications of people working in childcare, while
having more flexibility in the

McIntosh of Hudnall:</Member></B> My Lords, going back to the question
from the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, does the Minister agree that one of
the real problems in the provision of childcare is the very low rates
of pay that are awarded to people who are in fact qualified and have a
great deal to offer, but who are in the main only able to earn
extremely low wages? If the Government’s plan is to put more
burdens on those people by increasing the numbers of children that they
can look after, is it likely that that will do anything at all either
for the childcare or for the people delivering

at in terms of the number of children is why it is that those countries
that, by common consent, have the best childcare provision in the world
have higher ratios of children. The answer is partly that we need to
have a combination of things of which better training is one. The pay
is very low, but the Government will fund the additional free support

pre-emptive strikes breach international law and will undoubtedly
heighten tensions in the region; and, secondly, that while the benefit
to Israel’s security is likely to be short-lived, the likelihood
of pushing the beleaguered regime into even more ruthless actions
against its opponents is increased, and risks drawing chemical weapons
into the equation. In light of that, will my noble friend tell the

the arms embargo both in relation to the period of time that it

noble Lords, Lord Hannay and Lord Anderson, not have a point? The
shipping of weapons to Hezbollah, which already has thousands of
rockets, is an extremely dangerous and destabilising act in the Middle
East. Anything that furthers the position of Hezbollah, which is a
state within a state in Lebanon, and makes it more ready to be highly
provocative, as it has proved in the past, against Israel, will add to
the difficulties in the area. Does she appreciate that we need to watch

and, I am sure, others have 
<?notus-xml column=1652?>repeatedly put in Written Questions and elsewhere: what precisely in
terms of numbers is the coalition commitment to establishing the party
strengths in this House on the basis of the last general result? What
does that mean in terms of numbers for each of the three parties?
Although the Leader of the House dealt with the question put by the
noble Lord, Lord Pearson, very effectively in parliamentary terms, he
did not actually answer the question, which was a valid one. If the
Government are committed to their repeatedly stated objective of
reflecting the last election results, surely we are entitled to know
precisely in numbers, including the total number, what that would
occasion. If we do not know the numbers, it is very difficult to have
an informed debate.</hs_para>

true that that scheme is available for any Member of Your

at it to page 22 of the new <I>Companion</I>. In  the
conversations that I have had about retirement, the views expressed to
me in the Corridors and around  the place have tended to be
affected by the age of the noble Lord to whom I have been

imposing limits today which are severely testing the sense of humour of
Back-Benchers to a point of destruction? Does he not also recognise
that he is moving these time limits pretty close to the time limits
imposed in the European Parliament—not an example normally
thought good for emulating by this House? Finally, does he not
recognise that there could be occasions when the national
interest—and I think the two items on the Order Paper today are

reference has been made personally to me, on this rare occasion perhaps
I may assist the Leader of the House at the Dispatch Box. This is a
Conservative Party debate day and the House decided as a matter of
procedure that the time allocated would be five hours, as an envelope.
That time limit may, in exceptional circumstances and in consultation
with the Leader of the House, be extended to six hours. That has

it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T12:02:59"></hs_TimeCode>. However, as

your Lordships’ House to take note of the Prime
Minister’s speech on Europe. This was a bold speech about the
future of our relationship with the EU, and was well worth waiting for.
It may be too much to expect, but I hope that all noble Lords will

is a fact that the financial crisis has exposed the fault lines in the

The lesson from history was that monetary union would not survive
without deeper union on other fronts, and that is one of the many
reasons why the UK will never want to join the euro. The first steps
towards banking union have been taken with a single supervisory
arrangement, which your Lordships’ House debated last week, but
that is just the start of what will be needed to shore up the

the same time, countries outside the eurozone have to protect their own

am sure that those who are designing changes to the eurozone will move
heaven and earth to avoid treaty changes; not because they are afraid
of the UK, but because they will not want to risk testing popular
opinion within the eurozone countries. Therefore, we may not have the
opportunity of a treaty through which to negotiate a new way forward.
Even if that opportunity does not exist, I believe the Prime Minister

Prime Minister put forward five principles as the basis for a new

structure of membership, particularly for those who do not sign up to
ever closer union; powers must start to flow back to member states; we
need a bigger role for national parliaments; and any new arrangements
must be fair for all members, particularly those outside the eurozone.
I believe that all but the most ardent of federalists should support
these principles. Yesterday, in the other place, the Labour Front Bench
supported them and I hope that it will do so again today.</hs_para>

are not held in isolation. Other countries will remain outside the

institutions. I am sure that many more have concerns about the decline
in competitiveness in the EU, even if they do not yet share our view

achieved. I know that some of your Lordships do not like referenda and

do not share that view. I believe that the British people have to be
consulted on major issues, and the EU and our relationship with it

Benches opposite today in the hope that we will get some clarity on
their position. This is not just a debating point. I am not foolish

the eurozone states faced up to having to work together in a deeper

Leaving the EU is not my preferred outcome but I am not afraid of the
prospect if the deal on offer is substandard. An exit from the EU would
not be the end of the world. Three million jobs might well be connected
with the 40% or so of the UK’s exports that go to Europe but
they are at risk only if, as pointed out by the man who calculated that
figure, Professor Iain Begg, we stop trading with the EU. There is no
sign that we will, not least because we have a persistent trade deficit
with the EU. It is therefore rational for the EU to want to carry on
trading with us. It is also not clear that we have to accept the kind
of solutions to which Norway and Switzerland have signed up. There are

knows the nature of his gamble. The only logical explanation for this

second consequence is that we have a firm commitment accompanied by a
date. The Prime Minister might have done better both by his party and
the country to have left things more open. Nailing the date of 2017 to
a mast is perhaps unwise when he is not clear as to what exactly is to
be renegotiated, with whom and in what manner. We are delighted that he
has prioritised multilateral negotiations, working with other,
like-minded countries to bring about the kind of changes that we all
want in order to make the EU more competitive and fleeter of foot in
meeting global challenges. Reform of the EU is not simply a UK priority
but is shared across most of the Union. It may have been wiser to
accept that the process needed time—conceivably more time than
he has allowed
himself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000147" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0001.htm#13013131000147">Finally,
while we greatly welcome the Prime Minister’s robust rejection

confusion by not spelling out exactly what we would negotiate for. This

significant powers cannot be transferred to the EU by putting in place
the European Union Act 2011. This is surely the right way forward, both
for the UK and the European

concluding, I want to answer clearly the question from the noble

“in or out” referendum in the previous Parliament against
a backdrop of relative stability in both the eurozone and the European

dramatically since then. A new architecture for the eurozone, and

power must be able to flow back to member states. He wants an EU that
is competitive, flexible and fair—don’t we all? Of
course, we cannot set out our priorities in detail now because we have
to probe the opinions of other member states. In particular, we need to

notes that the British are not somehow un-European.
Even in the seventh century, Saint Wilfrid, Saint Benedict Biscop and

spoke of three challenges and, as we have heard, five principles. I
wonder what might be called the foundation of those principles. Here is
a starter for two. Catholic social teaching developed the concept of
subsidiarity, which became something of a motto of the European
movement. Decisions should be made at the most local level possible.
Somehow, the spirit behind that has been lost. Subsidiarity can
underpin fairness locally, flexibility and even an appropriate passing
of power back to member states—three of the Prime
Minister’s
principles.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000156" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0001.htm#13013131000156">Secondly,
there is the democratic deficit. There is a feeling that Europe is
ruled by the unelected, by bureaucrats. Such a characterisation has
been fuelled by Eurosceptics and ruthlessly pursued by the less

consensus, even at the most local

should be our hope for Europe? Economic prosperity, yes, but not at the

If I recall correctly, she said that this was not the moment, and she

question is not why the Liberal Democrats have changed their mind,
because we have held a consistent view throughout; it is why the Prime
Minister has changed his mind in a matter of months. That reveals the
lie to this whole affair. When a Prime Minister makes a speech, it
necessarily contains some politics, but it also has as a primary
purpose to contain what is in the best interests of this country. His
speech was about politics and nothing else. It was directed not to the
nation but to the Conservative Party. It aimed to put a sticking
plaster over the gaping and bloody wound that now runs deep into the
heart of the Conservative soul between those who see this
country’s future in Europe and those who do not. It was also
aimed at a second political purpose, which was to cut UKIP off at the

the way, I agree with my noble friend that it was a good speech.
Measured by those purposes, it was a good speech. It was effective and
well put together. It had effect in the short term, but there will be a
price to pay in the long term. That is for the simple reason that even
were the Prime Minister to return with his arms full of the bounty
about to be dished out to him by his European colleagues—I very
much doubt that that will be the case—they still would not like
it. This is because there is now a virulent Little Englander movement
running throughout the Conservative Party. They do not want to
renegotiate Europe; they want out altogether. It does not matter what
the Prime Minister brings back; they will reject
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0001.htm#13013131000169">However,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T12:39:55"></hs_TimeCode>he will not
bring back much because of this fact. My noble friend Lord Howell is
right. The European Union is always about negotiation. There is
constant negotiation. It goes on all the time and we should be involved

negotiating wanting to get out while the rest of them are negotiating
wanting to get further in. That is the fundamental
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. So
the Prime Minister will return with too little to satisfy the
Conservative Party. He will have held up our attachment to and
concentration on the issue of jobs and getting ourselves out of this
recession. He will have damaged investment into this country. He has
given huge stimulus to the Scottish National Party, arguing the case
for the break-up of the United Kingdom, 
<?notus-xml column=1665?>and he will have set Britain on a path, intentionally or not, when he

only way that Europe can function in the future on a long-term basis is
if there is full fiscal union and full monetary integration. These

countries to become part of it. We in Britain have fostered that
enthusiasm. As to the objectives and process, however, the Prime
Minister had very

democracy, suggesting perhaps that national Parliaments should have a
greater role. I question how 28 national Parliaments could decide for
themselves, without some more representative body, how to deal with the
working time directive, for example. Many of these national Parliaments
believe that the working time directive is an extremely important part
of the advance of social development in the Union. It is not all about
achieving prosperity at the cost of the life standards of those who
work. That seems to be the clear implication of those who are trying to

Lamont of Lerwick:</Member></B> My Lords, I believe that the Prime
Minister’s speech was brave and far reaching. He made it clear
that his view and his preference was that Britain should remain a full,
active member of the EU. I agree, but I emphasise the term
“preference” rather than the words
“predetermined” or “inevitable”. As the
<I>Financial Times</I> said, a whole confluence of trends has made a
referendum inevitable: the increasing scepticism of the British people,
the changing nature of the EU and the fact that we have not had a
referendum since 1975. Some people call this a gamble. But democracy is
sometimes a gamble: you do not know the outcome when you call an
election. One of the worst features of the EU has been that it only
welcomes referendums that produce the right result. My noble friend
Lord Ashdown asked why, if the Prime Minister rejects a referendum in
this Parliament, we should have one in the next? There is a slight
problem, however. We are in a coalition with him and they are not
likely to allow a referendum in this Parliament.</hs_para>

that the prize of future economic prosperity for Britain is bigger than

is crossed. If the Conservatives win the next election—and we on
this side will do all in our power to make that an impossible

will put, I believe, our whole economic future at grievous risk. Why?
Why would the Government want to have a lengthy period of uncertainty
hanging over the thousands of British businesses and their workforces

do just as well outside the EU, especially if we concentrate on trade
with the emerging BRIC countries instead? Yes, the BRIC countries are
strengthening, but the World Bank’s latest figures on GDP per
capita must give us some much-needed perspective. GDP per capita for
the UK is $39,000. For China, it is $5,000; for India, it is below
$2,000. In order to grow out of this recession the UK needs to find the
scale of export market that the BRIC countries at present cannot
provide and which the European Union can. The BRIC countries together
do not have the buying power of France and Germany alone.</hs_para>

Roper:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by thanking my noble friend Lady
Noakes for having obtained this extraordinarily topical debate. There
are three things in the speech on which I agree with the Prime
Minister. First, Britain should continue to be a member of the European
Union. Secondly, there are a number of areas in which the European
Union’s institutions and policies are in need of reform.
Thirdly, the relationship between this country and the eurozone will
have to be watched with great care as the eurozone develops. A good
deal to protect this country and therefore the City of London from the
impact of the banking union was achieved at last December’s
European Council, but there will be a need for continued
vigilance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000218" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0001.htm#13013131000218">Where

others he is saying that there would be a unilateral negotiation to
establish a new relationship for Britain. This approach has to be seen
in the light of the Prime Minister’s discussion of his principle
of flexibility. At first sight the concept of flexibility seems
desirable, as suggesting that the European Union should not be set in
concrete but should be allowed to develop as conditions develop.
However, if we examine the speech more closely, it suggests that
greater flexibility means greater freedom for member states

believe that there is an opportunity to make progress in reform if we
follow the multilateral route. My own experience meeting chairmen of
European 
<?notus-xml column=1673?>Union committees of other national parliaments suggests that there is
interest in a collective approach. There are obvious targets, but
other targets for reform may well result from the
progress in the next two years of the “balance of
competences” exercise which, as we know, is being paralleled in
the Netherlands. That may reveal areas where there is no clear European
value added—the converse of subsidiarity—and areas in
which policies should be modified or responsibility returned to member
states. The article by Guido Westerwelle in yesterday's <I>Times</I>
seems to suggest that this approach would be welcomed in Germany, while
the alternative of unilateral “cherry-picking” would be
rejected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000221" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0001.htm#13013131000221">There

I suggest that it should be the following. There is no need for an
intergovernmental conference but there will be a need for treaty change
to reform the eurozone. We in Britain will be helpful in that process.
Within the European Council we will contribute to unanimity where there
is to be an increase in integration for the eurozone countries. Such
treaty amendment would come under the significant clause in the very
sensible legislation passed in this Parliament in 2011 allowing for a
referendum where there is a transfer of sovereignty which affects this
country. However, these transfers of sovereignty will not affect this
country and therefore there does not have to be a referendum. That is a
practical new idea and a negotiating stance which should be put forward

to deal with this is not with British exceptionalism; it is to accept
that the single market needs to be restructured at the same time as
there is reform of the eurozone. The best and simplest way of doing
that would be to take one single initial step—to ensure that
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which are part of the EEA treaty,
which has already separated out the single market from all the other
aspects of the treaties, are invited in as full members. That would be
a logical development. It would be a recognition of the fact that there
are other European countries with interests and involvements in the
single market, and it would ensure that Britain was not necessarily
always alone because it was outside the eurozone. That is not an
exceptionalist position. I believe that it could be argued for and it
would be a sensible renegotiation—one which should not wait
until after a general election which the Conservative Party may or may
not win, but one which should happen now, in the present. That position

lines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T13:16:13"></hs_TimeCode>. If that

the need for some social standards when she agreed that health and
safety would be included in the Single Market Act—from which, by
the way, comes the much derided working time directive. I wish that
people would look at this in a bit more detail. Britain has an opt-out
from the 48-hour rule. Fourteen other countries have opt-outs from
specific parts of that directive. The one bit that really matters is
the entitlement to four weeks’ paid holiday, from which 6
million British workers benefit. Is the Prime Minister perhaps
proposing to take that back? I do not think that he will. You could go
on into Social Chapter territory on equality and equal pay. Should the
single market not have equal pay provisions for the new countries, and
so on? Should it not have a voice in European works councils and
through the information and consultation arrangements? Are we saying

I warn noble Lords: if the Government are successful in an adventure of

Minister's speech is a curate's egg—some good some bad. I
include among the bad elements, the commitment to a referendum on a
fixed timetable many years ahead on what may well turn out to be a
false premise; namely, that wholesale treaty reform will be called for
by others in a federating sense. That is not likely. They are more
likely to go for rather modest changes to meet the requirements of the
eurozone, so I regard that as

for Britain's national interest and are they, at the same time, good

addresses conferences overseas, many of the arguments on European
integration resonate very strongly with me. The European Union was
established as a way of preserving peace and stability between its

key aims to which the Prime Minister referred, and rightfully so. This

the union. Allowing member states the autonomy and liberty to do what

Anderson of Swansea:</Member></B> My Lords, I have three short minutes,
and I will make three brief reflections. The first is that I have an
overwhelming sense that this is where I came in. In 1960, I joined the
Foreign Office as a desk officer responsible for
Europe—political. At that time, after the failure to join the
Rome treaty in 1957, the Conservative Government realised the danger of
isolation and thrashed around trying to construct alternatives, hence
the EFTA cul-de-sac, trying to build a relationship with a new
Europe—for example by constructing an enhanced role for the
Western European Union. In time, the Government and the people
acknowledged that other alternatives were pipe dreams and that our
future lay with our European
partners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000278" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0001.htm#13013131000278">The
second is that Mrs Thatcher never threatened to leave the Community,
however hard she fought her corner. Now, her political children, egged
on by a nationalist press, seek to take events a stage further. They
see little or no good in the current European Union and seek vainly for
false alternatives. What is certain is that, outside the European
Union, we would be a lesser attraction for foreign investment. We would
have less clout in trade negotiations, and the best deals are possible
when we work with our partners inside the
Union<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T13:40:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Prime Minister’s speech on behalf of the Conservative part of
the coalition. I have some sympathy for him as he has the impossible
task of reconciling our partners and his party. He fails to recognise
that international relations are essentially human relations. Some
critics may well say that the Conservatives in opposition were too busy
with their outside interests to build valuable personal relations with
their natural partners: hence the Prime Minister’s absurd
decision to leave the EPP, the family of the centre right, which led
only to a mutual
misunderstanding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T13:41:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

we are unlikely to persuade sympathetic club members if we threaten to
leave. Suddenly and belatedly, the Conservative Party is beginning to
appreciate the need for friends, particularly Germany, where 74% of the
population supports the UK remaining within the EU. Thus, for the first
time, the Foreign Secretary will participate in the Königswinter
conference in May. However, let us look at the German 
<?notus-xml column=1682?>Chancellor’s response at Davos to the Prime Minister’s
speech. Yes, as government spin doctors tell us, she
emphasised her support for free trade and open,
competitive markets, but they ignore her warning on the referendum and
the insistaence that the Prime Minister will need to
compromise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T13:41:49"></hs_TimeCode>. His
dilemma is that, in so far as he compromises to win over our EU
partners, he will lose his party. So we are back with unrealistic
alternatives: hence my sense that this is where we came
in.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13013131000414" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0001.htm#13013131000414"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T13:42:00"></hs_TimeCode></I>1.42

Scotland. Policing and criminal justice are devolved powers, so it

important. It is what Brady describes as, “make your case

ago we had a conversation about Europe, and I told her that I was one

during the 1975 referendum to urge people to vote no. The noble
Baroness informed me that she, too, had taken the day off work to
campaign for a yes vote. We have both developed different points of
view from all those years ago—I because of the Social Chapter
possibilities, which gave workers rights and women opportunities during

that we were working hard at the European level on these Social Chapter

Eccles:</Member></B> My Lords, noble Lords have gone back a long time,
but I am going to go back even further. Some 63 years ago I was
fortunate enough to be in Strasbourg when the Council of Europe met. Of
course, the two world wars were on everyone’s mind. Winston
Churchill made what I think would now be called the keynote speech and
the Conservative Party delegation was led by Harold Macmillan. Since
then, whenever I use the word “Europe” I include in it
the United Kingdom; I do so again today. We have been on a very long
journey since, but the idea of giving up and leaving does not yet occur
to me<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T13:51:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Europe now? It is riven by uncertainty. It has two financial crises
that differ from each other. The reasons for the crises are not yet
fully understood, and as for putting to bed the question of the
responsibility for them, we are still a long way from that. The crisis
in the United Kingdom is the first one and the eurozone crisis is the
second. The outcome of both is entirely uncertain as we debate this
matter today. All we can do is analyse what we know. What we must agree
on is that there have been flaws in the direction of travel, otherwise
we would not be where we are. Can we just wait and see whether, having
lived beyond our means, things will in some way correct themselves and
we will be able to continue on the same path? That does not seem
credible. Things have changed very radically over the past 63 years.

experience I do not think I have come across a more absurd notion than
a referendum that will only take place some four, five or six years
after it is announced. But, of course, this is not a serious political
idea. It is, as we know, a short-term and cynical party-political ploy
designed simply to push the European issue beyond the horizon of the
next election and to keep the Eurosceptics off the Prime
Minister’s back until then. If there are costs in terms of
investment and jobs and other costs to our national interest, then to
hell with the national interest. That is what we are actually

we need further evidence of the superficiality of this exercise,
it is in the fact that the Prime Minister hardly
mentioned what the objectives of this negotiation or renegotiation are
going to be. In all that elaborate speech only one sentence deals with
them by mentioning three things: the environment, social affairs and
crime. We have only to look at those three in order to realise that
either we are faced with what is essentially a hypocritical exercise
that is not intended to be taken seriously or else something that would
be disastrous if pursued. Are we going to pull out of the European
environmental policy? Are we going to get rid of the commitment to
reduce emissions by 20% from their 1990 levels by 2020? Are we going to
try to do it unilaterally? Does the Prime Minister mean the non-climate
change aspects of environmental obligations such as water pollution?
Are British factories going to be allowed to release any kinds of
effluent into our rivers? If we believe in having environmental
controls, is it not in our interests to make sure that our competitors
on the continent of Europe bear the same level of costs? It is quite

home affairs? We are told that the Government are already intending to
opt out of the justice and home affairs chapter. In that case, what is

my worst anxiety is that our continental partners will say—they
may be far too diplomatic and astute to do so, but it is what more and
more of them will think—“For heaven’s sake, the
British are hopeless. They cannot make up their minds. They have been
humming and hawing and coming and going for 30 years. They

Hamilton of Epsom:</Member></B> My Lords, I do not terribly want to get
involved in a debate about what will happen when the referendum is
held. Rather, I will make two points. The first is that within the next
12 months, I suspect that the Labour Party will commit
itself to an “in or out” referendum, whether the noble
Lord, Lord Davies, likes it or not. It is completely unsustainable for
any party to stand at the next election saying that it is not going to
hold a referendum when a major party like the Conservatives is doing
so. I suspect that the Liberal Democrats will follow suit as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T13:58:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000304" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013131000304">Not
for the first time, I find that I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kerr.
He knows, as most noble Lords in this Chamber know, that the construct
of the EU has been a series of treaties which need unanimous support,
and that if you want to revise those treaties, it has to be done with
unanimity. I therefore suggest that the chances of Britain
renegotiating a position that entails treaty change is virtually
non-existent, and by the same token, it will not be possible for
Germany, Holland, Sweden and Finland to renegotiate to make the EU more
competitive. If something needs treaty change, it will not happen; that
is the reality of the position that we are
in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000305" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013131000305"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:03:08"></hs_TimeCode>I

come back with a minimal number of concessions. He will not be able to
pull off the same trick as Harold Wilson: namely, minimal renegotiation
and a vote for us to stay in the EU. He would have to win major
concessions—which I do not think he will get—and, of
course, at that stage he will be faced by a Conservative Opposition,
led, I suspect, by a different leader, who will campaign vigorously
against any move to keep us in the EU. Alternatively, if David Cameron
wins, he will have to go off to Europe and come back with very serious
concessions. I suspect that the best that he will be able to achieve
will be some hybrid solution for the United Kingdom that will leave us
more out of the EU than in. Either way, I do not see that we will do

noble friend’s Liberal Democrats, who already
have the somewhat suspect reputation of being the
people whom Conservative and Labour candidates least want to face in an

unreliable and untrustworthy when it comes to the coalition agreement
that was set up at the beginning of this Parliament. So I do not think
that an awful lot of people will want to go into a coalition with the
Liberal Democrats ever again. If the opinion polls are right, they will
probably get only 10 seats at the next election, so the question may

turnaround from a previous speech, this is it. The context of the Prime
Minister’s speech is, of course, the Conservatives’
frustration, because they have missed the boat. The eurozone is
recovering and the pound is falling against the euro. Therefore we no
longer hear the speech from the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, proclaiming
that the euro is dead. The problem now for the Conservative Party is
the dictum, “If you can’t beat them, you’d better

we heard—from the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, I believe—there
is no such thing as a retrospective opt-out. The Labour
Party—correctly—will have nothing to do with this
scenario, including the referendum hypothesis. Apart from anything
else, you do not expect the Labour Party to get heavily involved in
highly imaginary negotiations conducted by an equally highly imaginary

geography helped define the UK’s very singular attitude to the
EU. He identified where and why many are unenthusiastic about some EU
regulation. However, he also captured very well the benefits of the
EU—the economic advantage and influence that arise from being
part of the world’s biggest single market and political bloc.

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness and to some
extent, for reasons I should explain, the Prime Minister for getting us
to this debate. The Prime Minister has presented us and our European
partners with a false prospectus: a referendum in four or five
years’ time, on terms as yet unclear, and in economic and
political circumstances that are unknowable. In so far as his
negotiating position prior to that referendum is discernible from his
speech, it is self-contradictory. His main point is that he wants to
strengthen the single market, but he is looking to opt out of key
pillars of that single market. You cannot have a true single market
without common labour standards—the Social Chapter. You cannot
have a true single market without some degree of commonality on
financial regulations, which he resists to the benefit of and on behalf
of the City of London. You cannot have a true single market without
common environmental standards. That agenda is not one that can be
negotiated without European partners. He might have a bit more luck on
the justice side, but even there, although there may be some
prospective, minor, further derogations, there will be no retrospective
opt-outs, as the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, has
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000321" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013131000321">The PM
has created unnecessary irritation among our European partners and
damaging uncertainty for global investors. However, he may politically
have done us all a great favour, in that he has at last provoked the
pro-European elements in all parties to come out of their shell and
start arguing the pro-European 
<?notus-xml column=1690?>case. I have long been a pro-European, since before 1975, when it was
deeply unpopular in the Labour Party, particularly in the left wing of
the party, of which I was otherwise a member. I have often been
dismayed at the lack of effective engagement by British Governments
with Europe—my own as well as this one. I have often also been
dismayed at the occasional arrogance and ineptitude of European
institutions in relating to the real concerns of the people. However,
it remains the case for Britain that our prosperity, our influence in
the world and our prospects of reaching global agreements on climate
change, trade, and peace and development depend utterly on the UK being
a leading, constructive and authoritative partner within Europe. I ask
those who object to the whole concept of ever closer union what they
think are the consequences of the opposite dynamic. They need look no
further than the borders of the EU, at the former
Yugoslavia.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000322" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013131000322">Like

we might lose inward investment, free trade and jobs if we left the EU
and its customs union. The single market is a bad thing: it is what
imposes the thousands of regulations which weigh down all EU economies
in their trade with the markets of the future. Together with the euro,

for us, in the mean time, our free trade with clients and suppliers in
the EU will inevitably continue when we leave it. Articles 3, 8 and 50

our substantial trade deficit, we will hold the whip hand in agreeing
our own free trade agreement, which will be unique to us.</hs_para>

are certain principles that we all accept in this debate. Everyone in
this House, except for those who want to get out, believes that Europe
needs fundamental reform. We would go along with what the noble Lord,
Lord Howell, said about the need for a more dynamic and flexible
European Union than we have today. We would support, in general terms,
the unobjectionable principles that the Prime Minister set out in his
speech. We all recognise that there is a particular problem where we
have to seek safeguards—because of the closer integration of the
euro area, those of us outside it must have safeguards against
discrimination as a result of the euro area acting as a voting
bloc<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:18:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000330" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013131000330">Having
said that those are principles on which we all agree, there is a
fundamental disagreement about the Prime Minister’s strategy of
renegotiation and referendum. People ask what Labour’s position
is on a referendum. One might seriously ask how it is that the Prime
Minister thinks that, at this delicate stage in our economic
recovery—and that is putting it mildly when GDP is
falling—and in an era when business, since the financial crisis,
has become extremely risk-averse, a commitment to a referendum five
years hence will help our economic recovery. Is it not the case that
this is bound to add one way or another to the considerable 
<?notus-xml column=1692?>pall of investment uncertainty which hangs over our economy? If the
Prime Minister now believes, in January 2013, that a referendum is in
the national interest, why, in October 2011, did he impose a three-line
whip on his Members to vote against a referendum? Why, in his press
conference after the June 2012 summit, when asked about a referendum
did he dismiss it with a sweep of the hand and say what the British
people want is a government who stand up and fight for them in Europe?
It was only the uproar in the Conservative Party—let me remind
the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes—the day after that forced the
Prime Minister to write his famous article in the <I>Telegraph</I>
saying:</hs_para>

position is clear. We have always argued, as we did during the passage
of the EU Act 2011, that if there is a major transfer of powers or a
big treaty there should be a referendum. At the moment we do not know
whether there is going to be a treaty and we do not know anything about
its contents or timing. The Prime Minister’s policy represents a
unilateral demand to come up with something by 2017 that he can sell to
the British people or we will be
off.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000332" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013131000332">There are
many contradictions in this renegotiation policy. One is whether those
who favour it regard a treaty change as essential to its success.
Listening to the Benches opposite, particularly to the noble Baroness,
Lady Noakes, I have found all this very confusing. On the one hand, the
argument is made that we have to secure fundamental change if we are
going to be able to recommend the yes vote to the British people, yet
on the other, it is said that the treaty change may not be essential.
In my view, it is impossible to achieve fundamental change in the way
the EU works without treaty change. Of course we may be able to
negotiate changes in policies or protocols that protect our position in
various areas, but we will not get fundamental change without treaty
change. I would like this question to be clarified in the
Minister’s
reply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013131000333" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013131000333">There
is a lot of reference to the proposals of the Fresh Start Group as the
kind of sensible mainstream view of what needs to change. My noble

aspects of that. This is not acceptable to our partners. On financial
services, it cannot make sense to argue for the reintroduction of some
form of unanimity on this aspect of the single market when in the other
part of our mouths we are arguing that our partners should agree to
major extensions of the single market in other areas. That is a
completely contradictory stance, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes,

interesting that we had 40 speeches in this debate, with eight from
Conservatives broadly in favour of the Prime Minister’s speech,
but the question of where they will end up after the renegotiation is
unclear. If David Cameron remains Prime Minister after 2015, he is
going to face a harsh political choice: win a referendum yes and split
the Conservative Party, or bow the knee to his party’s last
ditchers, and, even more dangerous, fanciful renegotiators such as the
Fresh Start Group, and secure his place in history as the Prime
Minister who led Britain out of the European Union. He will have
overwhelming support on this 
<?notus-xml column=1693?>side of the House if he puts the country before his party. There were
passages in his well-phrased speech last week where I just about
managed to convince myself that that was what he might do. However, it

will start by briefly recalling the context in which we are having this
debate. Europe is facing a time of crisis. The Prime Minister
highlighted in his speech the three main challenges facing all of us in
Europe: the changes within the eurozone and the crisis that it brings;
the lack of competitiveness in the face of a transformed global
economy; and the democratic gap 
<?notus-xml column=1694?>between Europe and its people. Faced with these challenges the European
Union cannot stay still. For the eurozone to succeed, we accept that
the countries that are part of it need to change. How they co-operate
and the rules by which they work need to change. As Europe changes, our
relationship with Europe will, and should, change. As the Prime
Minister has said, we cannot bury our heads in the sand. We must face
up to these challenges and ensure that the relationship that we have
with the reformed EU at the end of this process is one that better
protects our national interests and the integrity of the single

a more competitive and flexible EU, to show that power can flow in both
directions and national parliaments to have a bigger role. The
Government have been clear that we believe that active membership of
the EU is in our national interest. The Prime Minister has said that
when there is a referendum, he will campaign “heart and
soul” for a vote to remain in a reformed EU.</hs_para>

why we are convinced that the best place for the United Kingdom is
inside the EU. On the economic side, the EU supports UK jobs,
prosperity and growth through increased trade, within the single market
and through free trade agreements with non-EU states. The EU represents
a market of 500 million people, with a combined GDP of around
£11 trillion. It is the largest single market in the world, with
a larger economy than those of the US and Russia combined. If Britain
was not a member of the single market, UK firms would face export
tariffs, reducing their competitiveness in Europe. The size of the EU
and its global importance as an export market give Britain much greater
influence with international trading partners than would be the case if
we acted
alone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000006">The
single market also helps the UK to attract inward investment from both
inside and outside Europe. The UK is the top destination in Europe for
inward investment, attracting one-fifth of all foreign direct
investment projects in Europe in 2011, for example. The single market
encourages competition and innovation across the EU, bringing tangible
benefits to people, as prices for consumers are driven down and
productivity levels increase. However, this does not mean that we think
the single market is complete. Indeed, further single market reform has
even more to offer the UK through simplifying regulation, liberalising
services, and developing a single digital market and a single market
for
energy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000007">Away
from the economy, our membership of the EU can help to advance our
national interests, influence and values internationally as part of a
27-strong—soon to be 28-strong—collective voice. I am not
just talking about collective negotiation of free trade agreements with
third countries, although these bring large economic benefits to member
states, including the UK, and are a useful way of encouraging market
opening in those third countries; I am thinking about the intelligent
use 
<?notus-xml column=1695?>of sanctions, which in the case of Burma have been attributed as one of
the most effective levers in encouraging the regime to implement
democratic change, and which the EU has implemented in response to the
situations in Iran and in Syria, for example. I am also thinking about
the common security and defence policy missions, which are a
fast-moving response to security issues of real interest to the UK,
such as piracy. Successes include training the Bosnian police force and
increasing stability in
Georgia.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000008">The

three basic points with which to start. I strongly support the
Government’s overall immigration policy. I entirely agree with
the steps take to deal with abuse and bogus applications in parts of
the private sector, the education sector and English language schools.
Today we are talking solely about universities. I welcome the helpful
steps that the Government have taken to alleviate some of the concerns
expressed not least by five Select Committees in both Houses, and in
particular the decision to disaggregate the student numbers in the
migration figures. That was a big step in the right direction but we
need to go
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000031">The
achievements of our universities are one of the major UK success
stories. Many are recognised world leaders, comparable to the best
anywhere, especially in the United States. Overall our university
sector has an internationally high reputation and the demand for places
from overseas is strong. Non-EU overseas students contribute over 10%
of total university fee income. The contribution to that reputation
from overseas undergraduates, postgraduates, research fellows and
professors working and studying here is great. The benefits 
<?notus-xml column=1699?>that our universities bring to local economies are substantial, not only
in their spending on local goods and services but also in their
contribution to key economic developments. The huge growth in the
science and research parks in Cambridge is just one outstanding
example. The universities are a major expert earner, accounting for
£8 billion now and with an expected to increase to £17
billion by 2025 on recent trends. They are the fifth biggest positive
contributor to the net balance of
payments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000032">The
vast majority of overseas students are not permanent immigrants. They
are migrants. The universities have excellent systems for tracking what
happens to them. Most eventually return to their own countries or
elsewhere. A 2010 Home Office study showed that of the individuals who
entered as students in 2004, only 3% had settled permanently by 2009.
They do not claim benefits. It is a condition of their visa that they
have no recourse to public funds. They are net contributors to the
economy and not a drain on public funds. They are unlikely to require
NHS care because of their age profile. They are totally unlike bogus
applicants and many other
immigrants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000033">There
are countless examples of them returning to their own or other
countries and becoming permanent ambassadors for the UK. They are our
best ambassadors when they leave our shores. They find prominent
positions in government, foreign services and defence, industry and
commerce, education and elsewhere. This is so-called soft power. In
short, these are absolutely not the sort of immigrants that the public
and the media have in mind when they call for tougher controls on
immigration. They are the opposite, real assets to us, and that needs
constantly and regularly to be made clear in the context of policy
decisions. In so far as there has been public concern about students,
this was related to bogus ones, and I hope that that problem has now
been dealt
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000034">Overall
figures of new entrants from non-EU countries are only slightly down in
2012, by 0.4%. Most overseas students are postgraduates and their
numbers are down by 1.9%. Not much, one might say, but I suspect that
this is only the start of a trend. First, in what is a hugely
competitive industry, as many in this House know, numbers in
most of our major competitor countries—America, Australia,
Canada and some EU countries, which are fast developing courses in the
English language —are

some universities have told me that they found that last September the
number of postgraduate applicants who had even paid deposits and then
declined to come had increased. Thirdly, the perceptions that the UK
was imposing tough new restrictions, being less welcome to new
applicants and spouses, and even closing for business, have grown
considerably since these figures were compiled. This goes particularly

countries, this perception has been especially evident as a result 
<?notus-xml column=1700?>of the London Metropolitan issue. I do not have time to go into that in
detail. Suffice it to say that the hostile publicity in India after
that matter focused on the students who either had to or could not find
other places—and it was huge. That, combined with individual
stories about visa difficulties with the UK Border Agency, has been
immensely
damaging.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000037">Fourthly—and
this is difficult to explain in a few words, certainly to people
outside this House—the claims sometimes made by Ministers that
there are no limits on non-EU applications are simply not believed.
This is due partly to the perceptions that I have already described,
partly to difficulties with the UK Border Agency—of which, more
in a moment—but perhaps most of all to the following point. In
order to meet the Government’s target of reducing net migration
to tens of thousands by 2015—and we are still a long way off
that—and since students are the largest category of migrant, a
further reduction in student numbers seems inevitable. The Migration
Advisory Committee’s report states that a reduction in non-EU
student numbers of 87,600 in the period 2012 to 2015 would be required
to meet that target. The Institute for Public Policy Research has an
estimate of 50,000 fewer non-EU students, translating to a loss to the
UK of £2 billion to £3 billion per
annum<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:51:06"></hs_TimeCode>. These
figures suggesting limits are becoming widely known and are fed by the
perception of the way in which the UK Border Agency is applying its
controls and rules to potential and already-in-place students from
non-EU
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:51:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000038">So
what is to be done? I will be as brief as possible to enable as many
speakers as possible to have a little bit more than the two minutes
allowed. I have two points to put to my noble friend. First, it is
clear that the UK Border Agency is overstretched, overbureaucratic and
underresourced. Universities are highly responsible and want to clamp
down on any bogus students and those who break the rules. I have talked
to various vice-chancellors, seen the Universities UK submission and
read the excellent article in the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> of 24 January
by Sue Cameron, which accurately sums up the impressions that I have
gained. The stories of unnecessary difficulties are legion. The UK
Border Agency seems to be making students feel as unwelcome as it can.
The amount of time, energy and costs that universities are having to
use up is high, and all this is now being used by competitors in other
countries to imply that the UK is closed for
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:52:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000039">I
have a list of complaints and suggested improvements from Universities
UK which I do not have time to repeat. Today, I shall mention just one
or two of them. It makes the following points: that the UK Border
Agency requirements of tier 4 sponsors have changed 16 times since
2009, making it incredibly difficult for sponsors to keep track of
requirements; that changes have been made to visa requirements in the
middle of the universities’ admission cycle, which has led to
individual institutions having to review by hand thousands of offers
already made to prospective students; that the UK Border Agency
helpline is often unable to answer questions about changes to the
rules; and—this is a particularly important point—that
universities frequently tell Universities UK that they have received no
feedback from the UK Border Agency following a tier 4 audit visit,
either to inform them that they are 
<?notus-xml column=1701?>compliant or to point out shortcomings or potential weaknesses. Many
universities are making this point to Universities UK, and I hope that
the Government will take it

and most important of all in the light of all that I have said, I
strongly support the recommendations of the five Lords and Commons
Select Committees, including the Public Accounts Committee. It must be
rare to have five committees from both Houses making the same points
time and again. I am not sure that I can recall that ever happening
before in my long period. It is important therefore that the Government
take heed of what they have all said and remove international students
from the net migration target. All five committees have powerfully
argued the case. I quote from just one, the House of Commons Business,
Innovation and Skills Committee, reporting in September 2012. It
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13013135000268" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000268">“Whilst

today to follow the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, as it was when he was
Secretary of State for Education and I was his Higher Education
Minister. Our vision then for higher education, as it remains now, is
of a UK universities system that is internationalist and open to ideas,
people and collaborations from across the world, with a diversified
student body and diversified sources of finance and less dependence on
the taxpayer. That remains the vision of Ministers at the Department
for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills, but it is apparently not the

to the 2011 figures, 566,000 people came through immigration into the

election, in 2015, to less than 100,000. In 2011, 174,000 non-EU
overseas students enrolled to study at UK higher education
institutions. We know from the Home Office research based on the 2004
cohort of students that only about 3% of these students actually remain
permanently in the UK in jobs after five years. Therefore, of those
174,000 students fewer than 10,000 will be added to the net immigration

it could cut the number of students by 50,000—from about 175,000

only a short-term gain, not a long-term one. If the figure is reduced

the damage that this policy is doing to our reputation and long-term
benefits, why are the Government not willing to remove international
students from their target to reduce net migration as recommended by
five Select Committees, including EU Sub-Committee F, of which I am a
member? If all the changes that the Government felt necessary have been
implemented to tackle abuse of the system, why will the Government not

benefits that will result from this change in policy are glaringly
obvious: it would enable universities, the British Council and
embassies to speak with one authentic voice in promoting the
UK’s welcoming image to overseas students and it would enable
UKBA to work collaboratively with universities to ensure visa
compliance. It would be a positive outcome for everyone. At present the

British Council is creating new partnerships and sustaining long-term
ones to encourage students and is building trust. The Government should
be capitalising on this work and taking advantage of the growing global
market for students. Competition is growing from countries such as
Australia and Canada. The best and most innovative research comes from
international collaboration; nearly half the UK’s research staff
and PhD students are non-UK nationals. We should be ensuring that all
policy initiatives support the objective of attracting international
students, treating them well while they are here and building long-term
good will in the national

the process for obtaining a student visa has become far more extended,
complex and confusing. The additional imposition from April of
face-to-face interviews for students is yet another example. It is an
obstacle race from start to end when the students are here. Why can the
government agencies not work collaboratively with universities to

has been crucial in supporting community cohesion in West Yorkshire,
where there are substantial Asian minorities. One of the keystones has
been the university’s work with overseas students. It has

established a remarkable reputation not only for tolerance but also for
offering education to overseas students. In earlier times, other rather
less welcoming nations might have been less ready to accept people such
as Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud to their shores. Any number of political

now to a different scenario. In the 1990s, while I was working at
Lambeth Palace, we established the St Andrew’s Trust. This has
brought students from Russia, Georgia and other countries to study
theology and pastoral care. Those students return to their countries to
occupy positions of significant influence. That initiative was
intentionally dovetailed with the Government’s Chevening
scholarships at the same time as the Government were developing the
Know How Fund, for the same objective of soft
power.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000065">In a

MacGregor, suggested, and treated as temporary migrants, so that both
they and we can benefit from their attendance at our universities.

about figures. Universities’ real fear is that the rate of

in international student applications, so why the anxiety? Those
figures give a very partial picture. UCAS figures represent only 20% of
the total intake to universities. They exclude postgraduate students
and are figures for applications only; many will not translate into
enrolment. A far more accurate picture can be gained by looking at
figures for actual enrolment. The statistics agency HESA has just
published the figures on the number of new entrants to universities in
2011-12. They show a decrease for both undergraduates and
postgraduates. Those figures are a warning of what might happen if we
do not change course. Does the Minister acknowledge that the latest,

Wentzel, Bernard Peters, Hans Bethe, James Franck, Charlotte

Oppenheimer’s team in the Manhattan project in Los Alamos. They
were recruited to that team by Oppenheimer and they were recruited

international. They worked together, driven by intellectual curiosity
and by enthusiasm for their subject and not limited by national
boundaries. They were willing, ready and able to move at a time of

the two-year rule whereby students could work in music two years after
they graduated. Some 29% of our masters students took advantage of that
route to the great benefit of our culture and their careers. That is
now vastly more difficult. First, you have to show that you can earn
£21,000 a year, and that is not easy for a student. Secondly,
you have to be able to cite an employer. If you are a musician, you
usually have a portfolio career as a freelancer and you do not have an
employer. This route is therefore barred to them. Many of them, as a

unsurprisingly, the AA school is even  less happy than
Universities UK with the current Government’s policy for

reality of UK universities is that postgraduate courses in all subjects

teaching assistants. It must be acknowledged that the widespread use of
postgraduate students to assist in the teaching of undergraduate
courses is having a deleterious effect on the quality of the education.
An inevitable consequence of the dearth of native postgraduate students
will be evident to anyone who visits a university department. There are
declining numbers of native British academics within the departments,

second most international university in the UK after the London School
of Economics. Forty per cent of our students come from outside the UK
and, in postgraduate studies, 46% come from outside the EU, so we know
a bit about the impact of the changes made in recent times. In a
country which is so proud of its internationalism, which has given the
world its language and which has a university sector that, as many have

called the confirmation of acceptance for studies

country, I assure you that those of us who studied here in the halcyon
days when we did not have to be measured by how much money we had took
home wonderful memories and remain committed to this country. I guess
that the 3% who stay now and those who, like me, returned, generally do
so for love rather than money. The goodwill that has been created so
painfully over so many years is being completely destroyed by the
Kafkaesque quagmire that is being created for the students who want to
come here and for those who want to extend their visas by three or six
months in order to complete their
theses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T15:48:56"></hs_TimeCode>, about

the case of a single student, but I know that it represents a large
number of others. This student had the necessary £10,000 in her
account for the necessary 28 days before and all the rest of it.
However, although she transferred the £10,000 from the deposit
account into her current account, the day that this was being measured
by the Home Office somehow it made a

problem is that there is no one person to go to. If there is a mistake
in your case, the only way to deal with it is to go to court. So the
student had to hire a lawyer and go to court. The first court decided
that she should leave. Then she had to appeal to a tribunal which
decided that the first court had erred but it did not give her any
money; it did not reimburse her. Nor did it give her any evidence of
its decision so that she could legally stay here. So the lawyer had to
start again, making phone calls, and it took the student six months to
assert her right to be in this country, by which time she was
£10,000 the poorer. How she is going to stay here, complete her
thesis and live is, for me, a problem. I do not see that students such
as this or stories such as this are going to generate good will towards
this country or bring back people who, like me, have remained committed

Lucas:</Member></B> My Lords, we are one country. I hope that we all
want some degree of immigration control and we all should want our
universities to flourish and bring us wealth now and influence in the
future. It is therefore extraordinary that we have ended up with 
<?notus-xml column=1717?>two bits of our country working so diametrically against each other.
Universities need the UKBA to be a partner in their
marketing, to help them in the recruitment of students and to work with
them. As we all know, we are seeing exactly the opposite. UKBA needs
universities to help it in controlling immigration. As my noble friend
Lord Phillips said, they are extremely unhelpful to the UKBA in doing
so. They grouse and some of them really do not do what they should at
all. The result has been a total breakdown in trust and in
relationships. It meant that, when London Metropolitan University erred
severely, the reaction of UKBA was completely irrational, except that
there was no trust and no relationship on which to base a better
reaction.</hs_para>

December but things have now gone silent. I am sure my noble friend on
the Front Bench knows what is happening. There is still lingering
resentment and anger within the UKBA which is preventing these
initiatives going forward. I very much hope that he will allow me a
meeting with him and with the Minister to see if we can do something
about that. Perhaps in many small ways we can build personal
relationships by making small changes and experiments and by taking
incentives. For universities like Imperial, that should be a gentle
move towards something like a most trusted status. We need some way of
removing the requirements of unnecessary immigration controls, just as
they have been removed for independent schools. You do not find
Imperial students wandering off to work as assistants in burger bars;

Bilimoria:</Member></B> My Lords, during my childhood in India there
was never any doubt that I would study here in Britain. My family has
been educated here for three generations and I was brought up to
believe that British education, along with that in the United States,
is the best in the world. The point that has not yet been made is that
foreign students enrich British universities and the experience of

Minister, I fought very hard in this House about the two-year
postgraduate work visa and we managed to get unanimous support for it
in this House. The Government listened; they changed their mind and it
made a huge difference. I do not think the Government realise that for
a foreign student, particularly one from India, in purchasing power
parity terms it is really expensive to study in this country. Those two
years help them to work and thus pay taxes, and save some money to pay
for their education and enrich their bridge-building with this country

potential foreign students around the world. The perception it created
has become a reality so far as Indian students are concerned. The UKBA
cannot even keep tabs on illegal immigration, but here it is going
around shutting universities and kicking out innocent students, giving
them 60 days to find another place. There is a presumption of guilt
rather than innocence. I thought that we had a sense of fairness in

Metropolitan university students did not have the appropriate leave to
remain on 29 August 2012, the day the licence was revoked? If the

actually reputational. The reputation of British universities is fading

your reputation is damaged, it is very hard to recover. People here
might not remember the example of Lancia cars, which used to rust to
bits after about two years. No one buys them any more in the UK and
they never got back in the UK. Once you have damaged your reputation,
it is so hard to recover it, and this is what the Government are

defend the right to say it all again in three minutes. We have debated
the issue many times, and the message has been loud and clear: we are
losing students to other countries and are at risk of losing millions
in revenue from an £8 billion industry. Education should not be
confused with immigration. That is the 
<?notus-xml column=1721?>view, as the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, said, of all the
relevant Commons and Lords committees. Today, with
a new and reasonable Minister, we look for a more positive answer. I

thing that has shocked me is that non-EU students in our colleges and
universities are now fair game for immigration investigators, who seem
to have permission to make random checks, search files and interrogate
young people at will, on suspicion that they are illegal immigrants and
potential criminals. It seems to me, as someone who has visited
detention centres for immigrants, to be a policy of deliberate
harassment and disruption, which has appalling consequences for all the
normal processes of
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000160" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000160">I
recognise, of course, that it has been essential to disqualify colleges
which cannot demonstrate the necessary standard and that regular
inspection is needed. However, this does not justify the level of
harassment which is currently suffered by some colleges; nor does it
mean, as has been said, that justice is turned upside down, so that all
colleges are guilty until they can be proved
innocent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000161" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000161">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T16:09:29"></hs_TimeCode>
is a related issue of great concern to private colleges, which is the
age-old right of students to work part-time during their course, which
is currently only given to students in the public sector. If a private
college is shown to have genuine students, why should it be treated any
differently from colleges in the public

problem is the way that colleges are being compromised and used as
agents of UKBA. Reporting illegal students is obviously a joint
responsibility of UKBA and the college, but too often this essential
partnership breaks down when the college is unwilling to pursue
students or the UKBA demands information. All this does a lot of harm
to the integrity and reputation of the college. I hope the Minister can

has long been, and must remain, an optimistic, outward-looking and

rejoice in the confident British diversity that occurs daily right
across the country, and which London showed off for us in Olympic year.
However, there is no doubt that the pace and scale of migration has
created pressure on resources and strains on the solidarity of
communities. The fact that the costs and benefits of recent migration
were not evenly shared, particularly as a result of low-skilled
migration, needs to be
recognised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000167">What
this country needs, and what my right honourable friend the leader of
the Opposition has called for recently, is a proper debate about the
different kinds of immigration we need and can sustain, and the
development of evidence-led policies which can get the necessary
controls and limits right. Such a debate would also identify the
policies which help growth in the UK while at the same time enhancing
our culture and society. This is where the Government are failing. As
we have heard, focusing on the chimera of cutting the level of net
migration leads to the sort of unfair and self-defeating policy
measures which we have seen since 2010. Why are they unfair and
self-defeating? Well, they are unfair and self-defeating because the
Government’s net migration target bizarrely makes it a sign of
success if more Brits move abroad. I ask the Minister: what sort of
success does that represent?</hs_para>

importantly, such an approach does not cope with questions about the
different kinds of immigration there are, or recognise their different
impacts both for the immigrant and for our country. Who would disagree
that we must continue to be a safe haven for people genuinely escaping
violence or tyranny? In fact, 70% of people in the British Social
Attitudes survey agree Britain should offer asylum for those fleeing
persecution. Who would disagree that we should recognise the
exceptional cases of those who have risked their lives to help British
interests and face continued threats now? Cases which come to mind
include Afghan interpreters who helped British troops and now face
threats from the Taliban as the troops pull out, and the
Gurkhas.</hs_para>

anything else going on here apart from a simple number-cutting
exercise. What is it exactly that the Government fear about
university-sponsored students attending courses here? There are so many
myths flying around that it is worth reminding ourselves that students
on HE courses are not likely to be a burden on public service as their
visa conditions specify that they should have no recourse to public
funds. They usually live on campus; they are generally healthy; and
most do not have

of the student visa route. I remind noble Lords of the problems that
the Government inherited with this particular visa provision. Under the
previous system, too many private colleges were selling visas and not
education. These arrangements failed to control immigration and protect
legitimate students from poor-quality sponsors. The National Audit
Office estimated that in 2009 up to 50,000 students may have come to
the UK to work, not to study. Student visa extensions were running at
more than 100,000 a year. Some serial students were renewing their
leave again and again without tangible progression in their studies. A
Home Office study in 2010 found that up to 26% of those studying at
private colleges may not have been complying with the terms of their
visas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000190" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0002.htm#13013135000190">It does

Government have overhauled the student visa regime to tackle bogus

student visas has come entirely from those sectors where abuse was most
prevalent. As a result of our tighter controls, almost 600 colleges

that they are making genuine academic progress. We have removed the

attracting too many students for the wrong reasons. The Government have
also introduced a new power to allow UK Border Agency officials to
refuse a visa when they are not satisfied that the applicant is a
genuine student. These measures 
<?notus-xml column=1727?>to tackle abuse have resulted in an overall fall in net migration, and

this—and this is the key point to make in response what I think
was the thrust of noble Lords’ arguments today—these
reforms have protected our world-class universities. We have designed
our system to favour our higher education institutions. Universities
have been given some flexibility in how they test language skills.
University students still have very generous working entitlements
during their studies—20 hours a week during term time
and full time, if they wish, during vacations. They can also undertake
work placements amounting to 50% of their course. Postgraduate students
at universities can bring dependants to the UK. There are also plenty
of opportunities to stay on and work in the UK after study, and we are
extending these further for the brightest and best—I hope to

the Government have reduced the number of student visas overall, the
latest Higher Education Statistics Agency figures show an increase of
1.5% in the number of international students at universities, at a time
when UK entrants have fallen. Listening to the debate today, some noble
Lords unfamiliar with the subject might have been left with the
impression that the number of overseas students wishing to come to our
universities was declining. In fact, the university sector now accounts
for three-quarters of student visas—up by about half in the year
to September 2011. I know the latest UCAS statistics are only partial,
but the statistics released yesterday show that this year new
applications to UK universities from non-EU nationals are up by nearly
10% compared with this time last year. We await the final numbers, but
I am sure that noble Lords will acknowledge that this refutes the

China there was a 17% increase and from the US a 5% increase. UCAS, as
I said, has received 10% more applications from Chinese students
compared with this time last year, and there is a 19% rise in
applications from Indian students. Therefore, nothing inherent in our
reforms is deterring international students. We need to consider
whether in certain countries there are particular factors in play. We
should be positive in our confidence that we have got this matter
right. Universities themselves—and, if I may say so,

share. That is surely what matters in business. Secondly, he has not

exists to provide patients with the highest levels of care and
compassion and it does so in a way that is more equitable than any
other country in the world: comprehensive care, free at the point of
need. But to be true to those values, different parts of the NHS need
to be financially sustainable. Financial problems left unaddressed
become clinical problems, not least because money used to fund deficits
cannot be used for patient
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000227" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000227">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T16:45:58"></hs_TimeCode>
South London Healthcare NHS Trust is the most financially challenged in
the country, with a deficit of £65 million per annum. It
currently spends some £60 million a year, or 16% of its annual
income, to service two PFI contracts signed in 1998. For this and other
reasons, repeated local attempts to resolve the financial crisis at the
trust have failed.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T16:46:28"></hs_TimeCode> a result, the
trust is losing more than £1 million every week. In
the three years since it was formed in 2009, it has generated a deficit
of £153 million, a figure that will rise to more than
£200 million by the end of this financial year—a huge
amount money that has to be diverted away from front-line patient
care.</hs_para>

trust, its commissioners and the London Strategic Health Authority, my
predecessor as Health Secretary, my right honourable friend the Leader

Kershaw had the extremely difficult task of finding a clinically and

received his recommendations on 7 January. Six of his seven
recommendations were as follows: first, that over the next three years,
all three hospitals within the trust—Queen Elizabeth Hospital in
Woolwich, Queen Mary’s in Sidcup and the Princess Royal in
Bromley—make the full £74.9 million of efficiencies he
has identified; secondly, that Queen Mary’s in Sidcup be
transferred to Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust and developed into a hub for
the provision of health and social care in Bexley; thirdly, that all
vacant or poorly utilised premises be vacated, and sold where possible;
fourthly, that the Department of Health pay the additional annual funds
to cover the excess costs of the PFI buildings at the Queen Elizabeth
and Princess Royal hospitals; and, fifthly, that the South London
Healthcare Trust be dissolved, with each of its hospitals taken over by
neighbouring NHS and foundation trusts. Sixthly, to aid implementation,
he further recommended that the Department of Health write off the
accumulated debt of the trust so as not to set the new trusts up to
fail; that the Department of Health provide additional funds to cover
the implementation of his recommendations; and that a programme board
be appointed under an independent chair, reporting to Sir David
Nicholson as chief executive of the NHS Commissioning Board, to ensure
the changes are effectively delivered. I have accepted each of these
recommendations in
full.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000231" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000231">As a
consequence, he also recommended that services be reconfigured beyond
the confines of South London NHS Trust, across all of south-east
London. This part of his recommendation included reducing the number of
A&amp;E departments across the area from five to four; replacing the
A&amp;E department at University Hospital Lewisham with a non-admitting
urgent care centre; reducing the number of obstetrician-led maternity
units from five to four; downgrading the current obstetrician-led
maternity unit at University Hospital Lewisham to a stand-alone
midwife-led birthing centre—each obstetrician-led maternity unit
would also have a midwife-led birthing centre; co-locating paediatric
emergency and inpatient services with the four A&amp;E units, with
paediatric urgent care provided at Lewisham, Guy’s and Queen
Mary’s hospitals; and finally, that University Hospital Lewisham
should become a centre 
<?notus-xml column=1733?>for non-complex elective procedures, such as hip and knee
replacements, to serve the entire population of
south-east
London.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000232" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000232">The
public campaign surrounding services at Lewisham Hospital has
highlighted just how important it is to the local community. I respect
and recognise the sense of unfairness that people feel because their
hospital has been caught up in the financial problems of its neighbour.
However, solving the financial crisis next door is also in the
interests of the people of Lewisham, because they, too, depend on the
services that are currently part of South London Healthcare Trust. None
the less, I understand their very real concerns about how any changes
could affect their access to vital health services. These concerns are
echoed by Lewisham CCG and many clinicians at Lewisham Hospital. I have
had in-depth discussions with the honourable Members representing those
affected, who have reflected those concerns to me. As a result, I asked
the NHS medical director, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, to review the
recommendations and to consider three things: first, whether there was
sufficient clinical input into the development of the recommendations;
secondly, whether there is a strong case that the recommendations will
lead to improved patient care in the local area; and, thirdly, whether
they are underpinned by a clear clinical evidence base, as set out in
the third of the four tests for
reconfigurations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000233" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000233">On
the matter of clinical input, a highly experienced clinical advisory
group, led by a local GP, Dr Jane Fryer, and including eight trust
medical directors, six clinically qualified CCG chairs, the London
Ambulance Service medical director, the local director for trauma and
three directors of nursing, supported the trust special
administrator.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000234" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000234">Further
scrutiny and challenge was provided by an external clinical panel,
which included representatives from the Royal Colleges of Midwives and
of Obstetricians and and Gynaecologists. The panel was chaired by
Professor Chris Welsh, SHA medical director for the Midlands and East
of England. Both groups included respected national and local
clinicians, built on years of previous work in this area and held a
series of clinical workshops in August and September of last year. Sir
Bruce was satisfied that there had, indeed, been sufficient clinical
input.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000235" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000235">On the
issue of better care and clinical evidence, the recommendations provide
for the adoption, for the first time in south-east London, of the 2012
pan-London standards for acute care. These are the standards that all
six local CCGs have said they want to commission for both emergency and
maternity care. These standards define the best available clinical
practice and set the bar higher than that provided by most other acute
providers in
England.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000236" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000236">Sir
Bruce agreed with the TSA that the adoption of these standards, which
mean improving the level of care available to the residents of
south-east London, could not be achieved without a reduction in the
number of sites delivering acute in-patient care. Such a reduction will
enable the necessary concentration of resources and senior clinical
staff. A similar approach has already led to significant improvements
in stroke, major trauma and cardiovascular disease services throughout
London, saving hundreds of lives.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1734?><hs_para UID="13013135000237" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000237">For both emergency and
maternity care, Sir Bruce found no evidence that patients would be put
at risk through increased journey times. The whole population of
south-east London will continue to be within 30 minutes of a blue light
transfer to an A&amp;E department, with the typical journey time being,
on average, only one minute longer. Accessing consultant-led maternity
services will increase journey times on average by two to three minutes
by private or public transport. Sir Bruce concluded, therefore, that
there should be no impact on the quality of care from the small
increase in travel
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000238" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000238">On the
issue of maternity services, the expert clinical panel advising the TSA
was not willing to support the increased risk to patients of having an
obstetrician-led unit at Lewisham without intensive care services. As
achieving the London-wide clinical standards will be possible only with
the consolidation of the number of sites with these facilities, Sir
Bruce supports the proposal for this unit to be replaced with a
free-standing midwife-led unit at Lewisham hospital. This will continue
to deal with at least 10% of existing activity and potentially up to
60%. Thirty-six million pounds of additional investment has been
earmarked to ensure that there is sufficient capacity at the other
sites.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000239" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000239">Turning
now to the emergency care proposals, Sir Bruce was concerned
that the recommendation for a non-admitting urgent care centre at
Lewisham may not lead, in all cases, to improved patient care. While
those with serious injury or illness would be better served by a
concentration of specialist A&amp;E services, this would not be the
case for those patients requiring short, relatively uncomplicated
treatments or a temporary period of supervision. To better serve these
patients, who would often be frail and elderly and arrive by non-blue
light ambulances, Sir Bruce recommends that Lewisham hospital should
retain a smaller A&amp;E service with 24/7 senior emergency medical
cover.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000240" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000240">With
these additional clinical safeguards, and the impact that this is
likely to have on patient and clinician behaviour, Sir Bruce estimates
that the new service could continue to see up to three-quarters of
those currently attending Lewisham
A&amp;E.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000241" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000241">Allowing
Lewisham to retain its A&amp;E would help to reduce the level of
increased demand at hospitals with larger A&amp;E services, while an
additional £37 million of investment will further
expand services at these hospitals for more serious conditions. Sir
Bruce advised that patients with those more serious conditions should
now be taken to King’s, Queen Elizabeth, Bromley or St
Thomas’s, not for financial reasons but to increase their
chances of
survival.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000242" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000242">On
the issue of paediatric care, Sir Bruce recognised the high-quality
paediatric services at Lewisham and that any replacement would have to
offer even better clinical outcomes and patient experience. His opinion
is that this is possible but dependent on very clear protocols for
primary ambulance conveyance, a walk-in paediatric urgent care service
at Lewisham and rapid transfer protocols for any sick children who
would be better treated elsewhere. He is clear that this will require
careful pathway planning and need to be a key focus of
implementation.</hs_para>

Bruce was content to assert that there is a strong case for saying that
the recommendations are likely to lead to improved care for the
residents of south-east London and that they are underpinned by clear
clinical evidence. He believes that overall these proposals, as
amended, could save up to 100 lives every year through higher clinical
standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000244" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000244">Yesterday,
30 January, as no viable alternative plan has been put forward, and in
the light of Sir Bruce’s opinion I decided to accept the
recommendations of the trust special administrator, subject to the
amendments suggested by Sir Bruce. It is important to be clear that my
acceptance of these recommendations is conditional on Monitor approving
the proposals relating to foundation trusts and on my department
negotiating an appropriate level of transitional funding with
organisations such as King’s
partners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000245" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000245">Due
to the size of the task, there is a significant level of risk
associated with achieving the identified savings. I recognise that the
additional clinical safeguards I have put in place will marginally
increase these financial risks but, on balance, I have made the
judgment that this is worth it if it means that local patients are
reassured they will gain from an additional better service, rather than
losing their
A&amp;E.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000246" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000246">I
believe the amended proposals meet the four tests required for local
reconfigurations. I am therefore content for the process to now proceed
to implementation and I expect the South London Healthcare NHS Trust to
be dissolved by no later than 1 October
2013.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013135000247" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013135000247">The
implementation of these recommendations will be challenging and
complex. It needs to be planned for carefully and will not happen
overnight. I call on all organisations, hospitals and commissioners to
offer their full support during the coming years to achieve the

us be clear about what the Secretary of State has announced today. He
has at last accepted recommendations that were agreed by the previous
Government but then delayed by his predecessor’s moratorium,
thereby deepening the financial problems of the South London Healthcare
NHS Trust. I am, of course, relieved that he has rejected an outrageous
proposal that Lewisham Hospital should lose its A&amp;E—a
proposal that should never have been made in the first place, but which
cost over £5 million of precious NHS cash on accountants in the
process. That is enough to give some of the 5,000 nurses they have
sacked their jobs

I deeply regret that he has accepted the principle that a successful
local hospital can have its services downgraded to pay for the failures
of another trust. It is simply not good enough for the Secretary of

local communities without evidence of how they can be done safely and

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Baroness’s comments echo
very closely those made in another place by her right honourable friend
the Shadow Secretary of State. I am disappointed that they do, because
she seems not to have taken account of anything that the Statement
contained.
First<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>, I heard
no recognition that there is a serious problem to be addressed in south
London. A deficit of £1 million a week is a serious matter in
any terms. The deficit means that resources, whether people or money
but mostly both, are being applied inefficiently. That plays into
concerns about equity, which is one of the fundamental principles of
the NHS. Not to acknowledge that we had a major problem there and that
funds were being diverted into servicing debt that should have been
applied to patient care was
regrettable<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013153000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000014">Secondly,
there was no acknowledgement that the process that we had adopted was
that laid down by the then Government—of whom she was a
distinguished member—in the 2009 Act that amended the 2006 Act.
That process is quite deliberately couched in a way designed to bring a
rapid conclusion to what, by definition, is bound to be a serious if
not intractable situation such as this—a curtailed process that
involves public consultation but not the kind of consultation that
flows from reconfiguration decisions, which are locally
led.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013153000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000015">In<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
this case, it was our judgment that only the unsustainable provider
regime was applicable, after repeated attempts by local clinicians,
both commissioners and providers, to find a way of resolving the
problem by looking at the difficulties faced by the
trust<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. In the
judgment of the TSA, it was a necessary and consequential part of the
solution to look more widely than the trust itself, and that is what we
did<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013153000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000016">I
heard a grudging recognition that the decision to retain an A&amp;E
department at Lewisham was welcome. I am glad that the noble Baroness
welcomed that. We took that decision, which was not one that the trust
special administrator recommended, because we listened to local opinion
and to Sir Bruce Keogh’s advice. 
<?notus-xml column=1738?>It was clear that, in some cases, it
would not serve the best interests of those presenting at A&amp;E to
have to be moved to another hospital. Therefore, we took the decision
that there should now be 24/7 cover in an A&amp;E department and the
capacity to admit patients from A&amp;E. Neither of those things was
recommended by the TSA, but this is what we now
propose<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013153000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000017">The
noble Baroness said that this decision clearly reflected that finance
took precedence over patient safety and care. I simply do
not agree<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.
Finance is, of course, a major consideration, but the fundamental thing
we wanted to assure ourselves of—and this is one of the four
tests that my right honourable friend Andrew Lansley put in
place—was that there should be clear evidence of clinical
benefit. Not only have we had two expert panels advising the
TSA about this, we have had reassurance from Sir Bruce Keogh as well. I
suggest to the noble Baroness that these are not people whom Ministers
have somehow nobbled or interfered with. We have stayed absolutely
separate from the process, as is right and proper. This has been an
independent process and the results are as I have
indicated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:10:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013153000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000018">The
clinical justification for these proposals is there. All four tests
that we put in place—the four tests for any change of
services—have been passed, not only in terms of local
consultation but also in terms of support from clinicians and of
patient choice. On one level, one could argue that any service change
that seeks to drive up clinical quality by consolidating clinical
skills on fewer sites diminishes choice. Nevertheless, choice is not
just about being able to choose a provider; it is about choosing the
right care in the right place. At the moment, the London-wide clinical
standard that was mentioned in the Statement is not being adhered to in
any of the hospitals in that part of the world, so one could argue that
the choice of provider is very limited when it comes to choosing the
right quality care. It is from the fact that commissioners want to
commission that higher standard that all the rest flows. To say that
this is being driven purely by finance is
incorrect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:05:28"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:12:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013153000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000019">By<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:05:28"></hs_TimeCode>

conscientiously—is to look at the best interests of the

recognition that Lewisham hospital is an excellent hospital. There is
no question about that and there has never been any question about it.
The hospital provides good care for local people and it is highly
valued. Only this afternoon I had one noble Lord from my own Benches

two specific questions. He quoted the Statement where at one point it
was made clear that a non-admitting urgent care unit at Lewisham would
not improve patient care. That is the precise reason why Sir Bruce
Keogh recommended something different; namely, an admitting A&amp;E
unit with 24/7 cover. He looked at the recommendation and was not
satisfied with it in terms of risks to patients. I hope that that is

backed up by Sir Bruce Keogh. But the noble Lord has a point because
the implementation of these recommendations is going to be key, and
that is why the TSA has recommended a programme board to oversee the
implementation of these recommendations over the next few years. It is
absolutely essential that commissioners and the providers in that area
buy in to these proposals. We believe that they will, but it is

critical cases which, by common clinical agreement, need more
specialist care where clinical resources can be concentrated. That is
increasingly the view of senior clinicians in the royal colleges around
London.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13013153000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000028">The
other point that the noble Lord may need to factor in is that many of
the services in an area of the country, whether it is London or
anywhere else, depend on networks. What we envisage for Lewisham and
Woolwich, taken together, is that they will be part of an active
network, with staff rotating between the two. There will be an
understanding of what each hospital is capable or incapable of doing,
and an understanding on the part of ambulance trusts as to where best
to take patients. We have already seen the results of that policy. This
is not idle speculation. There is proof positive from the decision to
decrease the number of acute stroke units in London from 32 to eight;
the mortality rate has more or less halved since that
decision was taken. So there is clear clinical
underpinning.</hs_para>

many have—in that my three children were all born in Lewisham
Hospital. Thus I share the emotional feeling of many that it seems
unfair that Lewisham should be penalised for the spendthrift ways of
other NHS trusts. However, my understanding is that Sir Bruce was asked
to look not at the financial implications but at the patient
implications of restructuring. He has done that and is satisfied with
the result. One thing he points out is that, in the future, not every
hospital would have the capacity to offer intensive care after
maternity care. One of my three children needed intensive care. If
Lewisham cannot provide the highest of high-tech intensive care, then
some hospitals in London will have to. The issue is that, given the
high technology that is now coming in to medicine, not every hospital
can be a centre of excellence. We have to spread the resource. That
means some hospitals will specialise. As somebody who benefited from
what was then the best of intensive care, I am very keen to see that
London, and in particular south-east London, should be able to offer
that. However, I accept that not every hospital that provides maternity
services will be able to. Can the Minister tell me whether he can
see—because I cannot—any reason why Sir Bruce would have
reached the conclusions that he had, in print, if he did not actually

that she has said. In making this very difficult decision, my right
honourable friend’s primary concern has been to protect outcomes
for local patients. Indeed, the logic behind these proposals comes from
the clinicians themselves, who came together from across
London—way before the TSA was appointed—to 
<?notus-xml column=1742?>develop a series of standards for certain
conditions. These are based on the simple principle that a critical
mass of highly qualified specialist consultants in one place, on a 24/7
basis, available to see patients within one hour and backed up by the
latest medical equipment, will give patients better outcomes. At
present, no south-east London hospital meets all the emergency or
maternity clinical quality standards. Achieving those standards will
mean accommodating acute in-patient care across fewer sites. The result
will be that people in south-east London will continue to have much
better access to A&amp;E and specialist maternity units than the
majority of the population in England, and the prediction is that up to
100 lives a year will be saved by this rearrangement of
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:26:37"></hs_TimeCode>. My

pertinent questions. Matthew Kershaw, the TSA, expects to start a new
job as chief executive of Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS
Trust in the spring. That will happen before South London Healthcare
NHS Trust is dissolved. As we move into the implementation phase, my
right honourable friend will use powers in the 2006 Act to appoint a
new TSA to provide the management role normally performed by the board
of directors. That takes care of the mechanics of management, and the
person appointed will of course have to have the necessary skills and
experience to lead the trust.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:29:31"></hs_TimeCode> TSA worked
closely with both foundation trusts and Lewisham Healthcare NHS Trust
to develop his proposals. The trusts are eager for the mergers to go

forward, the organisational changes will almost certainly not occur
until somewhere between June and October. Having said that, the trust
managers will immediately start making the necessary operational
efficiency improvements, as indeed I know they are keen to do. The
actual transfers of emergency maternity and paediatric services to
other sites is planned to happen in late 2015. That will not be

have to look at, as it is duty-bound to do, the effect of these
proposals on the foundation trusts concerned—namely, Kings and
Oxleas—and whether it is satisfied that all legal requirements
are met. The TSA was confident in that regard, but we cannot take it
for granted. As regards to the transitional funding, I mentioned that
all three trusts are now working towards having signed heads of terms
in place, and the principles of the transactions and the basis for the
final deal will include the financial aspects of the mergers. It is
important for the department to work to get the best deal for the
taxpayer in these transactions. Although an indicative some of money
has been quoted in the TSA’s report for this, it would be wrong,
I think, for the department to commit a precise sum of money at this
stage. It is important that as much money as possible is saved by the
trusts working through these proposals for themselves, before the
department steps in. However, we will step in to do what is necessary

smallest of the English regions but for those of us who have the

even a jewel in the crown. It is home to Northumberland, voted the most
tranquil county in England, and also to Newcastle, 
<?notus-xml column=1744?>the party capital of Europe. However, five years ago the tranquillity
and partying were brought to an abrupt end. First, Northern Rock
sustained the first run on a bank in 150 years, putting 3,000 jobs at
risk and shattering investor confidence. Then, Nissan announced 1,200
redundancies and the viability of the entire plant was under threat as
it went on to short-term working. Then, Teesside Cast Products
announced the closure of its blast furnace and the lights literally
went out on that part of Teesside with the loss of 2,000 jobs. Finally,
the promised multibillion-pound government investment in new agility
trains was
shelved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013153000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000050">The
region was on its knees but five years on it is a very different
picture. Virgin Money has acquired Northern Rock and safeguarded 2,000
jobs in the region, and over the past year it has added 1.2 million new

will soon become the first factory in the UK ever to produce 500,000
cars per year. The new £4.3 billion investment will take
employment at the plant to 6,000—a record level. The Government
have announced the go-ahead for a £4.5 billion
investment by Hitachi in Newton Aycliffe for a new generation of
agility trains, which will create 730 skilled jobs with a further 200
workers needed to build the test track and the plant itself. In

Sawyer:</Member></B> My Lords, I have the honour of being chancellor of
Teesside University in which I declare an interest. I am grateful to
the noble Lord, Lord Bates, for initiating this important debate. For a
long time he has played a serious role in the work of the north-east
and was an assiduous Member of Parliament for the old Langbaurgh
constituency. I do not know how he feels about catching his breath
after his contribution but I am having a job catching mine. He gave us
such a whirlwind tour and he is quite right in being optimistic.
However, I am sure the noble Lord will agree that within that general
picture of optimism there are still lots problems in the north-east.
There are high levels of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment,
in the old mining and shipyard areas, and we need to work hard to
address those
problems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013153000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000064">My
interest today is not to take a panicked view, as we have heard from
the noble Lord, Lord Bates, but to look at the Tees Valley subregion of
the north-east and the boroughs of Middlesbrough, Darlington,
Hartlepool, Stockton, and Redcar and Cleveland. This is the area for
which I am the chancellor and of which I am also a native, coming from
Darlington. It is a 
<?notus-xml column=1747?>subregion served exceptionally well by the Tees Valley local enterprise
partnership. It is a new partnership, chaired by a well known local
businessman, Mr Sandy Anderson, and it is known as Tees Valley
Unlimited.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013153000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000065">This
is a true private and public sector partnership, with members drawn
from companies such as SABIC, which produces chemicals and
fertiliser—a bit like the old ICI—and some of the old
industries, such as the port authority, which have developed into new
businesses. They have got together with Teesside University and
representatives of local government to form themselves into an
organisation to help to build this subregional
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013153000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000066">The
context is very challenging. There are 259,000 people in jobs but a
working-age population of 420,000, so we have a big gap there. Arising
from that is the highest level of unemployment of all the local
enterprise partnership areas, in particular high youth unemployment.
Major reductions in public expenditure are imposing real hardship and
distress on an area that has been one of the main contributors to the
economic performance of the UK in the past 50 years. I refer the
Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Bates, to comments made recently by
the elected mayor of Middlesbrough, Mr Ray Mallon, who
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13013153000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000157">“The
loss of such significant levels of funding over such a short period of

are others in the region who, like Mr Mallon, are concerned about the
direction of travel. We have to make sure that we listen to them and
try to come to terms with some of the issues that they
raise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:45:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13013153000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000067">Teesside
is an area where, as with the wider north-east, the decline in
traditional heavy industries has led to a big reduction in employment.
However, like the noble Lord, Lord Bates, I think that the general
attitude there is positive. The Teesside area was often seen to be less
positive than the Tyneside area when I lived there, but I think that
Teesside people have become far more positive in the past 10 years and
stopped depending on the state to solve their problems and started
solving them themselves. That is an important and welcome
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013153000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000068">We
have seen new companies replacing major employers such as ICI and
British Steel. We see great opportunity for growth, built on the legacy
of those major industries that transformed the world, in areas such as
the process sector, industrial biotechnology and biopharma, renewable

connection, I was very pleased to see the Government last month
announce as part of their life sciences strategy a  £38

have described. It is an aspiration and a direction of travel which I
wholly share. I commend to Ministers the Tees Valley 
<?notus-xml column=1748?>City Deal submission made by Tees Valley Unlimited in the past few
weeks. The vision for the Tees Valley City Deal is of an area with a
thriving and more balanced economy, with integrated supply chains
resilient to economic shocks. It will deliver more efficient and
effective use of government resources with enhanced inward investment,
grow existing global companies and their supply chains, increase
exports, and translate research and development into commercial
opportunities —all delivering, one hopes, wealth and
employment for the region. It is a good vision; it is a good deal; and
I hope that it will be carefully considered by the
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013153000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000070">In
order to achieve those ambitions, we must ensure that the skills
requirements of present and future employers can be met. The
observations of local enterprise partnerships are of particular
interest in this regard. They observe very real concerns about the
ageing workforce and the sufficiency of understanding among employers
about the systems in place to support skills development and they relay
a lack of clarity about apprenticeship opportunities. We have talked
about these issues in the House previously and we need to give
continuous attention to them. I hope that the Minister will keep on
talking to colleagues about the need to make sure that we have proper
apprenticeships and proper skills enhancement so that these new
industries and possibilities can be successful. Some of the skills that
I had when I was a young man are no longer the skills required. We need
new people and new skills and we have to make sure that the Government
play an appropriate role in helping to support that
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013153000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000071">As
a result of these concerns, we have to take our own initiatives and not
just rely on the Government to step in and do what needs to be done. We

and chemical processing. Tees Valley Unlimited skills portal has been

We were University of the Year in 2010. For Teesside to beat all the
Russell Group universities is something we all have to be very proud
about. It took some doing but we did it. The noble Lord was quite right
to mention it and underscore it because it means that

a very real effort. They are working hard and on many occasions putting

more localised case than that mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord
Bates—it is about Teesside rather than panregion—but I
paint a very optimistic scenario as well. The way forward in the
north-east of England is to be optimistic. It is to try to help
ourselves but at the same time to call on the Government not to put any
obstacles in our way and to recognise that public spending in the

fewer business start-ups, fewer people with level 4 qualifications, and
fewer people employed in the private sector than we would like. Indeed,

the investment is going to the region’s growth sectors. There
are indications that those growth sectors are now expanding. In the
latest quarter of employment trends published by the ONS, the
employment rate of 16 to 64 year-olds was 68.2%, compared with 71.4%
for the UK, so the north-east was three percentage points below the UK
average. The unemployment rate of 16 to 64 year-olds was 9.1%,
representing 119,000 individuals, which was the highest in the UK, and
much too high. However, crucially, the north-east also had the biggest
drop in unemployment in the most recent quarter, amounting to 0.8

Patten:</Member></B> My Lords, in bringing fraternal regional greetings
from the south-west to my Back-Bench colleagues on all sides in the
north-east, I would like to say that in listening to my noble
friend’s tip-top speech, and indeed the speech of the noble
Lord, Lord Sawyer, I would like to reflect that there is no silver
bullet of an infrastructure sort to help to solve the problems of the
north-east. I should say that there is no bullet train which could
individually solve the problems of the north-east. I do not believe
that if we had HS3 and it was powering into Newcastle tomorrow it would
of itself bring about a renaissance in the economy of the
north-east.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13013153000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000092">I
was greatly struck, when listening to some vox pop on the media when
HS2 was announced coming from what people in the north-east would
regard as their deep south—places like Nottingham and
Derby—that they regarded one of the benefits of HS2 as being
that they would get to London more quickly. Although I am in favour of
infrastructure projects, though worried about the environment and
capital cost, I believe that one of the effects of HS1 and HS2 will be
to increase the dominance of London in the English and Welsh
economies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013153000093" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000093">There
was a book back in the 1940s or 1950s by a French scholar called
Gravier, <I>Paris and the French Desert</I>. I do not think that
high-speed rail will bring about the economic desertification of the
UK, but it will do two things. First, it will increase the dominance of
London, which is already slipping its moorings as a great global city
and flying off into economic global space. Indeed, London would make a
good, punchy city state; that might be part of some plot which the
Mayor of London is thinking of bringing about. Secondly, having added
to London’s dominance, it will not in itself necessarily bring
any great blessings to the north-east. The north-east’s problems
are of themselves and have to be solved on their own
terms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T18:05:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Sawyer, talked about the litany of problems in the north-east. I was
refreshing my mind with the statistics. At first reading, they are
pretty grim: highest unemployment levels, still; lowest 
<?notus-xml column=1753?>employment levels; lowest household income; one in five children living
in workless families, sometimes through generations; and I could go on
with that. The other side of the story is that, extraordinarily enough,
this small region has, as my noble friend Lord Bates, pointed out, been
a great success in exporting, having the best ratio of goods to exports
in relation to the regional economy of any region in the United
Kingdom, measured by gross value added. There is obviously enormous
vitality.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Sawyer, with his own particular beat, what is
happening to the north-eastern economy. I suggest two areas in which we
should look at the region solving its problems intra-regionally. First,
there is connectivity, not to other dangerous places, like London, but
connectivity within the region—Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland,
Hartlepool, Middlesbrough and Durham—is in as great a state of
grace as can be produced. I am a strong believer in that. I understand

the north-east is the only region which has these problems. When I

conditions on the route from Exeter to London, a substantial part of
which is on one line. These problems are not unique to the north-east,
but I am absolutely convinced that better intra-regional transport
would get more results from infrastructural expenditure than, perhaps,
even connectivity to the motorway—although I recognise that that
is very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T18:08:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

friend Lord Bates put his finger on it when he mentioned the importance
of connectivity not through motorways and railways but
through high- speed broadband. I
genuinely welcome the contribution of £6 million to Newcastle,
to make it a super-connected city, but it is easy to spend a bit here
and a bit there. My judgment is that for probably £60 million,
and certainly much less than £600 million, if the north-east
offered itself as a Petri dish experiment, if there was that
super-connectivity between every part of the north-east, within a year
or so one would see the Korean effect. The spread of high-speed
broadband in South Korea a few years ago has had a radical effect on
productivity and has helped to transform the whole South Korean
economy.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13013153000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-0003.htm#13013153000098">I
greatly welcome the fact that the Minister is answering this debate. I
urge him to take the comments from the debate to my right honourable
friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It has been dominated by the
Tory Benches, there having been three speakers here—no, I am
sorry, four speakers. After the to-dos of last week, it is hard to say
“my noble friend” so I shall say “my noble
coalition partner”. Nevertheless, we feel strongly that more
should be done in the north-east on the installation of broadband. The
north-east does not have as strong a voice in the Palace of Westminster
as it should do. I will stand corrected, but I do not think that in
another place there is a coalition Government Minister who represents a
north-eastern 
<?notus-xml column=1754?>constituency; and I do not know of any Member of your Lordships’
House in the Government who lives in the north-east. So there is no
voice. I am not saying that we should have regional Ministers all round
the place, and a Minister for the south-west, or whatever. However, it

awards for its achievements. The company therefore makes a very
significant contribution to both the local and national economy.
Without doubt, this is a true story of commercial success. JBMI's
expertise lies, in general, in the field of metal re-cycling, but more
specifically in that of the manufacturing of alloys and the recovery of
those metals. Its product is exported to numerous countries and in the

sustainable products, manufactured from a wide range of waste materials

actively seek these products. The JBMI processes exemplify how British
industry can effectively and sustainably recycle in order to meet our

legal advice on this complex area, both from its solicitors, Semple

grossly unfair, inconsistent, discriminatory and anti-competitive. The
result to date is that JBMI has lost out on business that is likely to

JBMI’s lawyers currently have a number of similar cases of
oppressive and unnecessary “overregulation” by the agency
of conscientious British companies, for no obvious environmental

30 years ago at the height of the severe recession during the Thatcher
Government, and with the north-east suffering from the effective
collapse of the shipbuilding, heavy engineering and mining industries,
councils in the region came together at my suggestion, along with
Cumbria, to form what was then known as the Northern Regional Councils
Association and which now survives, shorn of Cumbria, as the
Association of North East Councils. At about the same time, local
government and the private sector, with support from the government
office in the region, formed the Northern Development Company—a
partnership dedicated to working jointly to tackle the region’s
economic and industrial problems. In many ways, this presaged the

inner London boroughs or coastal towns—and the rest of the

think that I have covered most of the areas that the noble Lords have
mentioned in their speeches. One that was mentioned in particular was
the regional development agency, which we have scrapped. However, four
different organisations—the regional growth fund, the Growing
Places Fund, City and Guilds and enterprise zones—have replaced
that one organisation. Perhaps the regional development agency did
particularly well in the north-east but, overall, we knew at the time
when we scrapped it that it was not value for money for taxpayers. Some
areas did not perform that well, while others did. I think we will come
with better schemes to encourage enterprise and inward investment and
to support businesses.</hs_para>

My Lords, in its 10th report of this parliamentary
Session, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
considered that the exercise of a number of the powers in these
provisions should be subject to the affirmative procedure, at least the
first time that they are exercised. The amendments in this group take
heed of this recommendation. I am pleased to say that, in fact, they go
further by requiring that not just the first use of the powers but all
uses be subject to the affirmative procedure. I trust that this

the Minister’s very welcome amendments in response to the 10th
report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. It is
very interesting. The committee demonstrated the value of a collective
memory, as it took us all back to the Digital Economy Act and the
comments that it made at the time; it has been entirely consistent. It
is good to see that the Government have responded. However, I wonder,
especially in light of the fact that the Minister has confirmed that
the affirmative process will be used for Clause 68, whether he will
also confirm that the affirmative process will be used when the
Hargreaves exceptions are introduced under the European Communities
Act. The Minister has clearly stated that the Government will not be
using Clause 66 when those exceptions are introduced; it will be purely
for penalties. We very much welcome the assurance that the Minister
gave on 
<?notus-xml column=542?>Monday. However, will he take the opportunity to confirm that the
scrutiny process will be by the affirmative procedure of both Houses

unrivalled depth of knowledge and a robust grasp of the
intricacies of this debate. I appreciate and respect the vigour with
which he has presented his position to the Committee. The Government
know that at the core of his work on the Bill is his determination to
see a stronger and fairer copyright framework in the UK. In answer to
his question concerning the affirmative procedure when the Hargreaves

affirmative procedure. This will, I hope, go some way towards answering

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I think we gave the issues a
pretty good airing on Monday, so I will not tax the patience of the
Committee for too long today. The Minister is well aware that there are
many who think that we should align ourselves to the EU directive and
that the extended collective licensing arrangements go well beyond
where we should be at present, given that the digital hub could solve
some of our
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:06:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to do is return the compliment to the Minister for the care and
attention that he has given in his capacity as the Minister for
Intellectual Property, and for listening to the arguments that have
been made. I thank him particularly for his clarification and
assurances and, latterly, for his letter which, although directed at
the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, seemed to encompass most of the
questions that I had asked, so I was pretty satisfied with that way of
dealing with things. In particular, I welcomed the assurances he gave
about the ECL on Monday: the Government are clear that an opt-out must
be as simple and as low-cost as possible for rights holders; and
further safeguards to be drafted in the regulations will require the
licensing body to set out the details of opt-out systems, why they are
appropriate to meet the needs of rights holders and how it plans to
publicise the scheme so that rights holders can opt out in
advance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:07:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
Moreover, the Secretary of State will be able to impose conditions on
an authorisation relating to the opt-out if necessary. I
found all that very
reassuring<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:07:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Minister recognises that many bodies and institutions—many
of them represented by FOCAL and BAPLA—are still very unhappy
about both ECL and orphan works. I hope he will continue to listen and
engage with all those organisations. I also mention Stop43 in that
context. There is certainly a very strong feeling that the impact
assessment—particularly for orphan works, which have a range of
9 million to 91 million—is hardly credible as a
business plan. I have made the point directly to officials that
genealogy or genealogical services are not a great basis on which to
work out a business plan. The Minister has answered many questions but
there will be others coming down the track, such as whether the
Copyright Tribunal is really suitable and exactly what a
“diligent search” consists of, especially when there are
several works by the same author. My wording might not have been as
good as it should have been, but we were trying to get at the fact that
care needs to be taken in respect of individual works and where there
are multiple rights
holders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:09:18"></hs_TimeCode>. What
copyright items will be included in the definition of orphan

EU directive does not include photographs, and for that very reason,
photographers and the whole of that sector have become very exercised
about the new provisions. Therefore, particular care needs to be taken
in respect of that sector, as we heard from the noble Lord, Lord
Greenway<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:09:35"></hs_TimeCode>. I
recognise that if the museums and universities and so on want to see
ECL, then they have to justify how it is used and its impact on rights
holders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:09:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_parafo UID="13013150000282" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000282">As
regards ECL, the impact assessment states that the UK’s existing
rights clearance system is complex, involving multiple users and rights
holders seeking and granting permissions. Hargreaves recommended that
it be simplified. Government intervention is required to introduce ECL
as a tool for simplification. Is that not precisely what the copyright
hub is designed to do? There is the concern very strongly held by
foreign rights holders—I mentioned the letter from the US
photographers to the Secretary of State—that they will have very
inadequate means of monitoring what is happening in the UK.</hs_parafo>

questions and I do not want to prolong the session today. There is the
whole question of what “substantial support” means for a
collecting society in what the Minister said on Monday? What sums of
money will be paid to copyright owners under ECL? What will be the
duration of licences? Will ECL societies have the right to license just
UK content or content from overseas? How will copyright owners know
which of their works have been licensed, and so on? Considerable
clarification is needed, not least that for the Association of
Authors’ Agents. When we were talking about that, the Minister
distinguished between certain warranties and other warranties. That was
perfectly fair, but nevertheless clarity will be all when dealing with
these

concern, and it might be helpful if we could have more thought prior to
Report about how the future viability of being a photographer in this
digital age could be addressed in the
Bill.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-31?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_31_PT_1/092180C1FB5FABB89D11B41872B5ACE803E7ADF5" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 31 January 2013">Thursday,

side of the Room support the introduction of the measures to do with
orphan works and believe that the extended collective licensing system
represents a good way forward, albeit, as has been pointed out by the
noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that it has to be done in conjunction
with the copyright hub, which provides the missing ingredient in a lot
of what we have been discussing recently.</hs_para>

have some reservations about how the Government intend to ensure high
standards of operation for collecting societies which are, after all,
effectively monopolies in many sectors, so we are keen to see, at a
very minimum, clarity on the standards to be set for collecting
societies and transparency over the way the powers that the Government
are taking will operate in practice. We also want to make sure that
everything that needs to be done is done to make the copyright hub work
well. The new regime and the copyright hub should ideally be brought
into existence contemporaneously.</hs_para>

confident that things are moving in the right direction, and we hope
that there will be opportunities for your Lordships’ House to be
regularly updated on matters such as this so that we can feed in our
continuing thoughts and support. I particularly refer to the point
about photography, which I absolutely endorse. There is an issue there
that we will need to keep an eye on. Assuming that everything is going

Clause 68 standing part of the Bill.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, the very limited extent to
which orphan works can be used is not just a cultural issue, but a real
economic issue. The clause will allow for commercial and non-commercial
use of orphan works in the UK. The Government estimate this could lead
to benefits of up to £220 million a year. Nine out of
10 respondents to the Government’s consultation were in favour
of commercial use of orphan works. The UK scheme has more safeguards
than the EU orphan works directive. It includes a requirement that any
diligent search is verified by an independent authorising body. The
authorising body will not be able to license itself.</hs_para>

provision for remuneration of rights holders at an appropriate rate for
the type of work and type of use. The directive is less restrictive
about this. Remuneration will be paid whenever a work is used. It is
yet to be determined how long such money should be kept on escrow for
the returning rights holder. However, after a certain period it is 
<?notus-xml column=546?>envisaged that unclaimed money will be redistributed. Where the money
has come from publicly funded institutions, such as archives, it may be
possible for that money to be returned to fund archiving, preservation
and digitisation costs.</hs_para>

pleased that the digital copyright hub is developing but have not yet
made any decisions about who will run the orphan works scheme. However,
regardless of its final decision, these powers are needed to enable the
chosen organisation legally to operate the
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000028">The
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones and
other noble Lords raised concerns about the potential impact of these
proposals on photographers. The Government continue to work with the
photography sectors. The working group on orphan works and extended
collective licensing contains significant representation from the world
of photography, including the Association of Photographers, the British
Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies and
Stop43.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000029">The
Government appreciate that the stripping of metadata is a real problem
for photographers. As noble Lords have noted, this is a current
problem, and the practice continues despite the existence of legal
instruments making it an offence. I am willing to meet noble Lords,
who, in the course of this Committee session, have raised concerns, to
discuss possible solutions to the problem of metadata stripping. This
is an issue that this is also being examined by the industry-led
digital copyright hub, following Richard Hooper’s July report.
However, the Government do not believe that the introduction of the
orphan works scheme will negatively affect photographers, because
historical photographs held in museums, archives and libraries, will
form the bulk of photographs licensed under the scheme. If anything,
the orphan works scheme will very likely improve matters, as it will
become more obvious if works are being used unlawfully. Officially
licensed orphan works, whether sourced from digital or analogue
sources, will carry a reference to the authorising body. Courts may
also take a dimmer view of infringement, if there is a legitimate and
legal means of using orphan
works<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:20:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000030">The
provisions on extended collective licensing are designed as a tool to
help streamline rights clearance, but only where the sector wants it.
We know that some collecting societies already operate extended
collective licensing-type schemes, which are unregulated and unlawful.
This means that rights holders are unprotected and could be missing out
on money owed to them. A statutory basis for such schemes would help
remedy this. The Government know that extended collective licensing
might not be appropriate for all types of works or rights, which is why
it can be initiated only by a representative collecting society acting
with the explicit support of its members. The Government would have no
power to impose extended collective licensing on a sector. Collecting
societies tend to be monopoly suppliers in their sectors, so members
and licensees cannot simply shop
elsewhere<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:21:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000031">The
clause and schedule introduce provision for the statutory regulation of
collecting societies, where self-regulation fails. Any collecting
society that fails to 
<?notus-xml column=547?>meet the Government’s minimum standards for self-regulation would
be required to adhere to a statutory code of practice. Collecting
societies would have to comply with specified criteria, including on
compliance and enforcement. The Government welcome the progress that
the industry has made on a self-regulatory framework. Self-regulation
remains the Government’s preferred approach. The safeguard of
enforceable minimum standards will help to ensure that collecting
societies operate in a manner that promotes open and efficient markets.

Lords have raised a number of questions. My noble friend Lord
Clement-Jones raised the issue of having to wait for the hub before
undertaking extended collective licensing, and pointed out that we need
extended collective licensing because we have the hub. Both schemes are
designed to facilitate legal and properly remunerative use of works;
they are two sides of the same coin. The fact that ECL-type schemes are
already in use in the UK demonstrates that there is a need. ECL cannot
be imposed on a sector; if rights holders prefer to use direct
licensing through digital copyright exchange, the hub or another method
entirely, that is their decision. The hub cannot act on orphan works
without the legislation in Clause 68 in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:23:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000033">My
noble friend Lord Clement-Jones raised an issue that the noble Lord,
Lord Stevenson, raised previously, on photographers suggesting that we
delay the implementation of the orphan works directive until the
October 2014 deadline, and then implement only to relieve any
restrictions that the copyright hub failed to address. I understand the
concerns behind this suggestion, but this is not an option because we
need to implement the orphan works directive in full, and we cannot go
outside the requirements of the directive without this clause. This
means that no one, including the copyright hub, would be able to
license orphan works without the power of this
clause<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:24:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000034">My
noble friend Lord Clement-Jones, in a further question, raised the
issue of foreign rights holders who would not be able to monitor what
is going on in the UK. The collecting society must produce evidence
with its application to show how it deals with those affected,
including foreign rights holders. I hope that that answers his
question. He also raised the question of and FOCAL and BAPLA, which
were unhappy with the ECL. Photographers do not have to have
ECL—it is voluntary and can be initiated by the collecting
society only with the consent of members, as I mentioned
earlier<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:24:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000035">I
believe that my noble friend Lady Buscombe stated that extended
collective licensing in Nordic countries is different and guarantees
remuneration for rights holders. However, collecting societies in the
UK must also show how they will find non-member rights holders and
distribute money that is collected to them. I hope that that goes a
little way to answering my noble friend’s question. I commend

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> Amendment 33 is inspired by the
Creators’ Rights Alliance which feels that the contractual
scales are very much weighted against it. I do not often make common
cause with Consumer Focus but I am delighted that it supports the
amendment. Its brief on the amendment puts the position rather well. It
states that the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 makes creators
the first owners of copyright, and that creators’ ability to
assign or license their copyright to others is central to the
overriding aim of copyright: that is, ensuring that creators benefit
financially from their works. However, in the UK, creators frequently
assign all their copyright for a one-off payment to intermediaries,
such as publishers or record companies. Individual creators are
frequently at a disadvantage when negotiating contracts with
intermediaries, and some creators complain that they are unfairly
pressured into assigning all their rights for a one-off
payment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000037">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:27:52"></hs_TimeCode>
2012 research of Consumer Focus found that 77% of British consumers
expect that a fair share of the money they pay for music, films and
e-books goes to the artists who created the work. The ability of the
copyright system to ensure that creators receive a fair remuneration is
central to public support for the principle of copyright. I agree with
Consumer Focus that removing the copyright exclusion from the Unfair
Contract Terms Act 1977 should be central to the Government’s
efforts to build a fairer copyright system that supports economic
growth and innovation. How about that, my Lords? Many
creators work as freelancers or microbusinesses. They are the bedrock
of the creative industries and deserve the protection provided by the
Unfair Contract Terms Act. I beg to

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, extended collective
licensing requires fair contracts. People who work in the creative
industries are already seeing intensified efforts by many publishers
and other intermediaries to coerce individuals who are sole traders
into signing away all rights to their work. Those who succumb to this
blandishment would be deprived of the income that the ECL provisions in
the Bill are supposed to offer. Therefore, the failure of the Bill to
include measures to level the playing field for negotiation of
contracts undermines the purposes of copyright in promoting fresh
creativity. These are not just matters of concern to professional
creators, vital though it is to the creative economy that the
possibility of making a living as a professional creator is defended.
Every citizen has an interest in enforceable creators’ rights
and fair contracts now that so many people are publishing and
broadcasting their own works through social
media.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000039">There
is a well known example of the problems that this can cause. In late
2012, the Instagram online photo-hosting service attempted to impose a
contract

photographs to advertisers. This was defeated only after alert users

issue of unfair contracts typically arises in two circumstances:
“take it or leave it” contracts presented by large

supporting entirely what my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones and the
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, have just said. This is a very
present problem in the way that the world is developing. We are getting
some very large corporations controlling a lot of the flow of copyright
material. The noble Lord mentioned the likes of Facebook but Amazon is
just as bad, given the rights you are left with as an author as it
moves into the publishing of e-books. If you put an e-book through to
Amazon, you have to sign over to Amazon the entire control over what
your work is sold for. The terms that it goes for are most astonishing.
Generally, we need to remember that copyright is about enabling people
to create and remunerating them properly for it, not enabling vast
corporations to reap the benefits that we intend for the creators. I

warrant considerable investigation and public consultation. For
example, contracts governing copyright are specifically excluded from
that Act. The Government would need to assess the potential
implications of amending the Unfair Contract Terms Act to insert
copyright within the scope of that Act. We believe that we understand
the intent behind this amendment, which is to address issues
surrounding contracts between individual creators and other businesses.
However, it is unclear whether the amendment achieves this, since some
parts of the Unfair Contract Terms Act would not apply to
business-to-business contracts. I would be very happy to have further

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> The government amendments in this group
are in response to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee’s 10th report of this parliamentary Session.
Government Amendments 33A, 46A and 46B are intended to put additional
safeguards into the Bill. In particular, Amendment 33A seeks to ensure
that when a code of practice is put in place for a licensing body, it
must comply with the criteria specified in the regulations. As the
regulations will have been through the affirmative procedure, this
gives parliamentary oversight of the code being put in place for a
licensing body.</hs_para>

clear that all the provisions under sub-paragraph (1) are included,
while Amendment 46B is intended to clarify that both the determination
that there has been a breach and any related sanctions are subject to
an appeal process. Amendment 46B, I should mention, gives
effect to the intention behind Amendment 47, tabled by my
noble friends Lady Buscombe and Lord Clement-Jones. Finally,
Amendment 50A removes the power to make regulations which impose
requirements on licensing bodies by reference to guidance.</hs_para>

additional safeguards will reassure the Committee and demonstrate that
the Government have listened to the recommendations of the Delegated
Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and have taken action. I will
not at this point speak to the amendments in this group that other
Peers have tabled. I will instead wait to hear what they say, but I beg

thank<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:34:18"></hs_TimeCode> the
Minister for bringing forward the series of amendments in this group
and for his explanation. Although the government changes to Schedule 21
are to be welcomed, I suggest 
<?notus-xml column=551?>that the Government could edge even closer towards improving the Bill
yet further. Briefly, I should like to respond to the government
amendments and then introduce those in my name; namely, Amendments 34
through to 51, excepting Amendment 49, which is in the next
group.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000049">Amendment
33A responds to the concerns of the 10th report from the Delegated
Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. Its concern, as we have already
heard, was that the Bill will allow the requirements of the default
code, enforced by penalties, to be imposed or revised without
parliamentary scrutiny, given that failure to comply may lead to
sanctions. Equally important as parliamentary scrutiny, in my view, is
the fact that it is indispensable that the code criteria should be
subject to consultation by interested, informed parties. That would be
the effect of my Amendments 43 and 51.</hs_para>

very much welcome the Minister adding his name to Amendment 46, which I
tabled. That will help to ensure that the regulations must now set out
the process for determining non-compliance, determining the type or
size of the sanction and for providing a right of appeal. I also
welcome Amendments 46A and 46B. As financial penalties will ultimately
be borne by the collecting society’s members, fines should be
imposed as a last resort. A right of appeal is essential. Also
Amendments 50A, 51A and 51B are welcome additions to the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000051">I turn
to the series of amendments that I have tabled. Although the government
amendments put forward are very welcome and a big step in the right
direction, my amendments address separate issues which, with respect,
still need to be considered. The purpose of these amendments is to
provide even greater clarity in the Bill for Schedule 21, which would
help to ensure that the Bill meets the stated aim of fostering
successful self-regulation. The effect of the changes would be to
reduce the considerable uncertainties surrounding future regulations
because the powers currently provided for by this legislation are
simply too vague, even with the Government’s latest
amendments.</hs_para>

societies have invested considerable time and money in adopting and
operating voluntary codes of conduct. PRS for Music introduced a
voluntary code of practice for licensees as far back as 2009 and then
one for its members in 2010. Many other collecting societies have
followed suit. The British Copyright Council’s

collecting society voluntary codes also have regard to the
Government’s recently published minimum standards for collecting
societies and, therefore, include an independent complaints review
ombudsman. Independent adjudication of a complaint is obviously an
important feature of any sensible self-regulatory system. Those BCC
principles also include provision for an independent code review
process. This first such review is intended to start in November 2013.
In short, 
<?notus-xml column=552?>the principles of good self-regulation are established and are generally
being operated successfully by collecting societies.</hs_para>

are<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:39:35"></hs_TimeCode> necessary to
the Bill to make the path from voluntary to statutory regulation much
clearer than is currently outlined in the legislation. It is only
reasonable, I suggest, to give businesses the certainty that they
deserve. After all, it is a big step to move from self-regulation to
underpinning with state regulation.</hs_para>

clarified that the majority of the powers in Schedule 21 are
exercisable only in a scenario where it has been adjudged through a
fair, robust and transparent process that there has been an unremedied
failure of self-regulation. The imposition of a statutory code, and/or
any statutory appointment of an ombudsman or code reviewer, will lead
to significant additional costs and potential exposure to penalties,
and should therefore be imposed only when it is clear that
self-regulation has failed. Collecting societies need to have
visibility of what triggers the imposition of statutory regulation so
that they are not left in the dark about whether they are close to or
far from crossing the
line.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000056">Equally,
given that collecting societies are already offering, or on the point
of offering, ombudsman dispute-resolution services and providing for a
code reviewer, the regulations should also make it plain under what
circumstances the Secretary of State would appoint a statutory
ombudsman or code reviewer. Amendments 34 and 50 serve to clarify the
processes and specific circumstances that would enable the Secretary of
State to impose such
regulation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000057">Improvements
to the Bill can also be made so that the penalties for non-compliance
much clearer and more proportionate. This is why I am proposing
Amendments 44, 45 and 48. The Bill provides for sanctions in case there
is failure to abide by a code. These sanctions include financial
penalties that may be imposed on directors and other personnel. The
highest fine stated in the legislation is £50,000. Under the
Companies Act 2006, penalties on individuals arise in relation to very
specific failures. Codes of conduct are typically of a general nature.
I therefore believe it is unacceptable to impose personal liability and
financial penalties for undefined offences that are less specific than
UK company
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000058">Let us
remember that all collecting society revenues are distributed to
members after management costs are deducted, and fines are therefore a
direct penalty on the membership itself. Any fines would be paid for by
the members of the collecting society. There is a strong argument that
fines on societies should be imposed only as a last resort. Instead, it
would be more sensible to provide appropriate help or assistance to a
society that has been deemed to have failed, as opposed to simply
punishment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000059">I
have also tabled Amendments 35 to 42, which are effectively
technical. Paragraph 3 refers to a licensing code ombudsman. Codes of
practice typically govern a collecting society’s relationship
with its members and its licensees. I propose that the phrase
“licensing code” should be deleted because it is not
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000060">Let
me conclude by saying that we should not forget that compliance with
regulation is costly; and, ultimately, the resources which are devoted
to regulation 
<?notus-xml column=553?>must in effect be paid for by the creator members themselves. It is
entirely reasonable that the penalties for non-compliance are clearly
set out and proportionate. This Government support the principle of
good self-regulation; they should therefore take this opportunity to do

Conservative principles, I can pray in aid of self-regulation good
Liberal principles. The essence of the issue is that these should be
backstop powers, and as she said, we should be fostering successful
self-regulation. It is important that there is as much transparency and
clarity about these rules as there is in UK company law. Some of the
sanctions could be just as high as those in UK company law and, of
course, they will ultimately be borne by the collecting
societies’ members, and a right of appeal is essential in those
circumstances. I thought that my noble friend argued eloquently for why
we should be aiming for that kind of

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> My Lords, these government
amendments, brought forward in response to the DPRRC recommendations,
put flesh on the points that we made in respect of the previous group.
As we said, we support the introduction of measures to deal with orphan
works and believe that extended collective licensing is the way
forward. We also want to see the copyright hub being developed, as we
have said. These amendments go some way towards ensuring greater
clarity over the standards to be set for collecting societies and
transparency in how the powers that the Government are taking will
operate in practice, and we are happy to support
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000063">The
amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, aim to put
more detail into the Bill on how the Government intend to supervise
collecting societies and on what might constitute the minimum
conditions and procedures that might be required, which would ensure
that the Government can step in and require a body to adapt the
Government’s standards for collecting societies. I shall listen
carefully to what the Minister says in response to the amendments
proposed by the noble Lord and the noble Baroness, but at present we
take the view that much of what is requested is more appropriate for
secondary
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000064">I

Amendments 34 and 50, there is already provision in the Bill for
consultation before the appointment of a code reviewer. We have
considered the proposals to 
<?notus-xml column=554?>put all processes for the appointment of an ombudsman and the
implementation of a statutory code on the face of the Bill. However,
the Government, together with stakeholders, need to learn how the
schemes work in practice and respond as they evolve. This will help us
quickly to remedy any unforeseen issues that result in problems or
injustices for rights holders. We have considered Amendments 35 to 42
carefully and believe that the term “licensing code
ombudsman” more accurately describes the functions of the role.
That role is to investigate and determine disputes about a collecting

Amendments 43 and 51, as I noted with regard to Amendments 34 and 50,
the Bill already makes provision for consultation when appointing a

have spent some time looking at Amendments 44 and 45 on the
power to impose sanctions on individual directors. Where it can be
demonstrated that a director is responsible for non-compliance with a

should not be to penalise collecting society members. The
Government agree with the intent behind Amendment 46, which
is consistent with the comments made by the Delegated Powers and

amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000069">On

turning to Amendment 48, the Government can confirm that these fees
will apply only to a licensing body being regulated. If a licensing
body adopts a code of practice which complies with the

shall respond to a number of questions raised by noble Lords. In her
general comments, my noble friend Lady Buscombe raised the code
criteria, which should be subject to consultation. Although I may well

general comments, my noble friend Lady Buscombe also raised the work
done by the collecting societies on self-regulation. The Government
welcome the work they have done and what they have achieved. I repeat
that self-regulation is the preferred option, but we need a back-stop
if it fails, a protection for licensees and members when dealing with
monopoly suppliers. My noble friend Lady Buscombe also said that fines
should be used only as a last resort. I entirely agree that they should
be a last resort. We do, however, need an ultimate sanction, and fines
would provide that.</hs_para>

mentioned collecting society revenues which are distributed to members,
who are affected by fines, instead of giving help to failing collective
societies. I agree with her; this is why, if a director is responsible,
he or she, rather than the collecting society members, should be held
accountable. Finally, my noble friend Lady Buscombe asked what triggers
statutory regulation. The provisions for an independent code reviewer,
who will independently assess the performance against the code, are the
trigger. I hope that I have answered all the questions raised by noble

Buscombe:</Member></B> My Lords, thank the Minister for his explanation
of the various amendments to which I have spoken today. Of course, I
want to think about what he has said, but the confirmation of an appeal
mechanism is very welcome. I am always concerned about leaving too much
to regulations. I remember that when we were in opposition the previous
Government too often left so much to regulation, and we always
complained about that. I find now that we are in a similar situation.
It all comes down to certainty and clarity, hence the main purpose
behind the amendments we have tabled. It is a huge step to go from pure
self-regulation to having a back-stop power. I think it is right to say
that the industry in large part does not oppose that back-stop power in
principle. It is asking for as much certainly and clarity as possible
and for the Government to recognise the work the industry has done and
is continuing to do to put and keep its house in good order, so that
creators and the works that they do are protected, and properly
so.</hs_para>

welcome the Minister’s support and understanding of the position
of creators and their concerns in this regard. For my part, I think
that the key to successful self-regulation is that all the parties
involved in it are positive and buy into the system. It works extremely
well as long as there is no uncertainty or a spectre of what they would
deem unfair or disproportionate state interference. So often, the
bottom line is that state interference leads to delay and cost. Just as
within any court of law, delay and cost never produce a happy outcome,
even for the person who comes out on top. It is not a happy resolution,
and that is why I also referred to dispute resolution. I am pleased
that the Minister has said that the Government want to be seen to be
helping the industry as opposed to coming in with something of a cosh
to deter those working in the industry doing the right thing or feeling
that what they are doing is worth while and is properly protecting
their
members.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000076">I

Buscombe:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 49 relates to the
jurisdiction of the Copyright Tribunal, which we feel needs attention.
The Copyright Tribunal is a creature of statute; its powers and
jurisdiction are defined in the Copyright, Designs and Patents
Act 1988. It has the power to rule on private rights, so we
believe that there should be full parliamentary scrutiny for changes to
its jurisdiction. Paragraph 7(2) says that regulations may change the
jurisdiction of the Copyright Tribunal, but it should be made clear
that this is only in relation to the powers in the schedule and not
more widely. I am proposing to tighten the drafting accordingly. I beg
to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000078"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Young of Norwood Green" PimsId="4703" UID="13013150000438" xid="1710" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000438">Lord

they may be right, but for what it is worth we support the noble

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 56A and 56B would require
the Government to ensure that regulations governing collecting
societies required them to have user representation on their governing
bodies if they wanted to grant extended collective licences. This is
born of frustration with the operation of some collecting societies,
which in effect already grant extended collective licences—the
CLA, for example.</hs_para>

the societies are in a monopoly position. Universities negotiate
licences with the CLA for the use of books, journals, magazines and so
on. They have no alternative. If they do not like the terms of the
licence that they are being offered, the only 
<?notus-xml column=557?>thing that they can do about it, once negotiation has been exhausted, is
to go to the Copyright Tribunal, a very expensive and time-consuming
process. If collecting societies are to get extensive new rights to
offer licences for works which have not been produced by their members,
they should also have new duties to act in the interests of their
stakeholders and users and ensure that the public interest is also
served.</hs_para>

is important to bear in mind that a large volume of the work we are
talking about here will never have been produced with financial returns
in mind. It would be wrong for collecting societies representing these
works to seek to maximise the commercial return on this kind of
material. They should balance the interests of their members, the
majority of whom will want financial return for their work with the
interests of the producers of the unrepresented work which may not be

56A and 56B, I can assure the Committee that the proposed schemes
already take account of the range of interested parties affected by
them. Let me explain how. First, on extended collective licensing, the
Government intend that the regulations will allow any affected party
the chance to comment on a collecting society’s application
before a final decision is reached. A collecting society authorised to
grant licences must take into account the interests of affected parties
including its members, its licensees and non-member rights holders.
These obligations are required to be in the collecting society’s
code of practice. An independent code reviewer will measure performance
against these obligations. Where there has been an alleged breach of a
code, rights holders and licensees will have recourse to an independent
ombudsman.</hs_para>

works, the orphan works authorising body is independent and will not be
able to license itself. I submit that this is a stronger safeguard than
that proposed by these amendments. The Government concur that
representative rights holders, wherever possible, should be on the
governing body. In practice, this will not always be possible with some
types of orphan works, for example, old diaries, correspondence and
other material never intended for publication or commercial
use.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000086">I would

take this away just to be sure that the advice I have received has

amendment deals with directors’ remuneration, a subject which
has had a lot of intense coverage in the media. Before we get to the
nuts and bolts of the various amendments to which I have added my name,
it might be useful if I set out some of the background to our thinking
on this issue. I should say at the outset that we are very encouraged
that shareholders, particularly pension funds and investment funds, are
taking a much more proactive position on this issue. I know it is
stating the blindingly obvious but it is the shareholders who own the
company and it is they who risk their investment when they buy into a
company, yet for too long they have been
ignored<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T15:08:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000091">I
have to recount a ghastly story about Goldman Sachs that I read some
time ago before the financial crash. The story goes that senior
management in that company in the United States would look at their
profits, decide how much reported profit they needed to keep Wall
Street and the shareholders happy, and then divvy up the balance
between themselves. I do not know whether that story is true but I am
sure that some people take that approach: that is, senior executives
act as if they own the company and believe that it is up to them to
decide how the pie is sliced, but that is not the way things should be
done. To its credit, this month Goldman Sachs responded to the outcry
when it agreed not to delay bonus payments in this country in order to
gain from the lowering of higher-rate income tax in April. I think that
was a good
result<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T15:09:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Sadly,
not all companies have followed the example set by Goldman Sachs. For
example, I am told that Tullett Prebon intends to delay bonuses until
April. It is on this company’s board that the BIS Minister,
Michael Fallon, used to sit. That is not a good example of best
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T15:09:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000092">As
some noble Lords will know, my background is in IT. For all the faults
of that industry, I think it is fair to say that instant gratification
by way of monster remuneration is not the norm. By and large, it is
about share ownership and share options. The late Steve Jobs was
famously known for receiving an annual salary of $1 a year. We have
spoken about Amazon today but the owner and founder of that company,
Jeff Bezos, also receives a basic salary of less than
$100,000—that is, less than a Member of Parliament. I know that
in those companies, both those entrepreneurs were already wealthy men
but for them it was never about raiding the kitty; it was about capital
growth and the long term. Does that not send a positive message to
their employees? Their priority is the customer, the product and the

that I see the very opposite in many other sectors of the business
spectrum. This very week, we read that RBS intends to divvy up
£250 million by way of bonuses, plus a likely fine of
£500 million to the US authorities—this is a separate
issue—for the bank’s manipulation of the LIBOR market.
This bank, where people have been lucky to 
<?notus-xml column=560?>avoid criminal prosecution for fixing markets, is one that we own and
what is going on is simply wrong. This very day, we read about the very
same actions being taken by Barclays, a bank whose record is less than
perfect. These executives grab all they can when their company’s
trading record is poor and where the shareholder value has remained at
rock bottom. Being paid to fail does not sound right to me. In even
more disturbing news this morning, the FSA has come out and criticised
the mis-selling of complex interest swaps, which particularly hit SMEs
that were, in many cases, ill equipped to evaluate their risk and were
relying on the good name of the banks that sold them the product. I am
not saying that what the FSA has done is disturbing; what it has done
is really good, but the practice that was going on is
disturbing.</hs_para>

somewhere else or to some company that will pay us”. You hear
that all the time. The <I>FT</I> hints that RBS executives are
threatening it. You can use any word you like to describe this kind of
behaviour; my word is blackmail. It is what Premier League footballers
do. My advice to anyone who is faced with this gun to their temple is
to call their bluff. My experience in business is that no one is
indispensable. Just below the great man—and now, increasingly,
the great woman—you can bet your boots that there is someone who

and balance. It is worth noting that if the minimum wage had been
increased to reflect the average remuneration of FTSE 100 CEOs, the
minimum wage would now be at £19 per hour. Instead we have this
growing disparity, especially in London where so many leading companies
are based and where, in 2011 alone, the top percentile received a 16.5%
greater increase than the bottom percentile. Put simply, too many are
being left behind and bringing this imbalance back into balance is
exactly what my party’s one-nation philosophy is all about. That
is the background but let me repeat: we have no problem with high pay.
However, we have a problem when this pay is set by a cohort of good old
boys who look after each other’s interests. The solution is to
make pay transparent and to ensure that remuneration policies are set
via the board, in consultation with independent experts and with the
shareholders’ explicit approval.</hs_para>

am addressing first, Amendment 58BA, deals with the top 10 and bottom
10 earners in a company. This amendment aims for greater transparency
on pay across the whole of the company, so that shareholders have more
information when they come to make decisions on pay. It requires that
the salaries of the top 10 highest earners in a company, outside the
boardroom, are disclosed in a similar fashion. No doubt companies would
choose to do this in an anonymous form, with lists of pay bands and the
numbers of employees who fall into each band. This would be entirely
acceptable and is good practice. Indeed, I have prepared such lists for
companies that I have been involved in, where I have been chairman of a
public company. It is also the practice in the United States. In some
sectors, particularly the banking sector, very high earners exist
outside the boardroom, which is why shareholders need these figures for
context<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:15:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

regard to the bottom 10, the same practice, with anonymous bands of pay
grades, would be similarly reported. That would provide shareholders
with the ability to make comparisons about the pay ratios between the
top and the bottom so that they can make their own minds up about where
they think the ideal ratio lies. These ratios have changed an enormous
amount in the past 30 years. For example, at the Lloyds Banking Group
and at Barclays, top pay in 2011 was 75 times that of the lowest paid
employee. At Barclays in 1979, it was 14.5 times. At BP in 2011, the
top pay was 63 times that of the lowest paid employee and in 1979, the
difference was only 16.5
times<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T15:15:42"></hs_TimeCode>. The point
of this amendment is, therefore, to achieve greater transparency, to
better inform shareholders and to give them the power to act as they

them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T15:15:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000098">I
now turn to Amendment 58BB on the subject  of consultants. This
is designed to probe the Government’s progress on this matter.
In a speech towards the beginning of last year, Vince Cable said that
the Government were going to take action on this and in Committee on
this Bill in the other place, it was suggested that action was indeed
being taken. That may well be the case and I would be grateful if the
Minister could update us. However, for clarity’s sake, I will go
over the reasons why this is an important area for us to
address.</hs_para>

is now a large body of academic work spanning several decades that
suggests that remuneration consultants have played a significant role
in forcing up pay. One reason for that is purely logical. By compiling
pay surveys for companies that list the amounts paid by competitors by
percentile, wages are forced up. That is for the simple reason that no
company wants to be paying less than its competitors. As a statement of
where they are as a company and of where they want to go, it is
unlikely that they will make an offer of remuneration towards the lower
end of the scale. As long ago as 1991, an academic study described that
as well meaning actions that would lead to unwarranted compensation
increases.</hs_para>

is little that can be done about that but of greater concern is the
potential practice of cross-selling. That is where firms that sell
remuneration advice to companies also sell other unrelated management
consultancy services to the same company. That provides a clear
conflict of interest and, in the past, major investors, such as the
Association of British Insurers, have asked for more transparency,
citing frustration with the role that consultants have played in the
upward ratcheting of executive remuneration. In the United States, the
SEC has moved to legislate for increased transparency in the role that
consultants play. The amendment here is in a similar vein, requiring
more transparency and more information to be made available to
shareholders. In that way they can see more of the process that goes
into the number in front of them when deciding how to vote. Finally,
and in keeping with my party’s policies, by adopting these
amendments we can start to create a one-nation approach that works for
everyone. I beg to

months ago, the Government initiated a broad, national debate on this
issue. This has encouraged shareholders to become more engaged as
owners of companies during the so-called shareholder spring. In 2012,

taking the initiative and engaging constructively in response. This is

that companies report on high and low pay outside the board. The issue

remuneration disclosure in banks and achieved progress on disclosure
below board level as part of Project Merlin. At the same time, Europe
has proposed bringing in its own disclosure rules. We await the outcome
of these negotiations before deciding on how to proceed with any
domestic proposals for disclosure below board level at banks. The
Government will argue strongly for the right outcome and remain
committed to ensuring that the UK has a transparent and comprehensive

in large banks are incentivised because their behaviour can have a
material impact on a firm’s risk profile. That is why we have
committed to extending pay disclosure in large banks to highly paid
non-board executives. This would mean that the UK had the most
transparent bank pay of any major financial centre, but we do not

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> My Lords, I listened carefully to
the previous debate because there is a link. I concur with the comments
made by my noble friend Lord Mitchell. He referred to investors
investing in the company. I shall preface my remarks by saying that so
do employees. For the most part, it is the whole of their livelihood,
so it is just as important an investment as that made by shareholders.
I submit that whether employees feel that they are committed and are
working as part of an organisation that values their contribution is
relevant to the success or failure of a company. There is also a
perception within the company that there is fairness in the
remuneration policies that apply.</hs_para>

sure that the Minister will not necessarily welcome this amendment, but
I would love to be proved wrong. What would an employee representative
bring to directors’ remuneration? What would their strategy and
policy be? They would bring a different, fresh perspective and one that

pointed out the huge rise in the ratio of top and bottom pay in
companies over the past 20 years or so. In some cases, one might argue
that there was a justification if they were rewarding success, but in
many cases we are seeing failure rewarded just as much as
success<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T15:30:49"></hs_TimeCode>. In my
experience of pay negotiations over a number of years, there was
nothing that contributed more to a feeling of resentment than
situations where the workers were told that the company could afford
only X% for them but, when it came to the pay of directors, they
somehow deserved double or treble. The argument is often made that they

the impact it is likely to have within the company as a whole. All the

Hutton’s review of fair pay in the public sector shows clear
academic evidence that large wage disparities within companies harm
productivity and company performance. For example, one study of 4,735
companies between 1991 and 2000 found that within-firm pay inequality
is significantly associated with lower firm performance. A second study

58BD, where we intend to change the word “ordinary” to
the word “special”, talks about the type of resolution
that would be necessary to get through any changes in the principle. We
feel that a special resolution, which would be 75% of the 
<?notus-xml column=567?>shareholders, gives it a greater importance as far as the company is
concerned and makes any changes to the principles of remuneration that
much harder to
make.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000129" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000129">The
current arrangements for backward-looking votes have given some power
to shareholders, but have not sufficiently empowered them. While we
welcome the changes, we feel that more could be done. In 2012, at the
height of what became known, as the Minister said, as the shareholder
spring, there were significant votes against directors’ pay,
such as those at Aviva, Barclays and William Hill. The most memorable
was the voting down of a 30% pay increase for Sir Martin Sorrell at
WPP.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000130">However,
from 2011 to 2012, there was an increase in executive pay to the tune
of 12%. By comparison, the rate at which pay increased for everyone
else averaged 2.8%. Only 12% of the country received a pay increase of
more than 4%. Needless to say, there was no rise in share price to
equate with that 12% jump in wages, and nor would one be expected. In
the past 10 years, FTSE 100 executive pay increased by 300%, while the
FTSE 100 index has increased by 48% and, more devastatingly, fallen by
8.1% in the past five years.</hs_para>

difficult for shareholders to organise today than it would have been in
the past, mainly because ownership is so global. Indeed the Kay review
into the effect of UK equity markets on the competitiveness of UK
business pointed out that the increase in foreign ownership has made it
much more difficult for a disparate group of shareholders to organise
and collaborate. In 1981, the percentage of shares in UK-listed
companies held outside the UK was 3.6%. Today the figure is
41.5%—a dramatic change. Shareholding is also often a much more
short-term affair than in the past. In 1998, the average holding in US
and UK banks was around three years. Ten years later it had reduced to
three months. It is probably even less
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000132">With
that in mind, shareholder protest should be reconsidered. If 40% of
shareholders in a company combine to oppose a remuneration report, it
is a hugely significant development showing a deep level of
dissatisfaction with company policy. Indeed the Government’s
consultation in March appeared to acknowledge precisely this problem.
Under the proposed rules, however, it would be possible for a company
to ignore the report. The amendment would rectify
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000133">I want
to address the question of an annual vote, which, of all the issues
that I am addressing, we feel very strongly about. Our amendment is
also about empowering shareholders. It proposes an annual binding vote
for shareholders on a company’s remuneration policy, as opposed
to a three-yearly binding vote. Having such a vote will ensure that
executive pay is a matter that directors have to engage with regularly
and will ensure that the issues around it are kept in mind. It would
not be a difficult requirement to comply with, and I do not imagine
that businesses will find much difficulty in doing so. This is because
there are already many reporting requirements on an annual basis.
Indeed the triennial approach, while a well thought-out idea, probably
loses sight of that fact. 
<?notus-xml column=568?>The idea of a binding annual vote on pay has broad support. Indeed, it
is again the case that the Government’s consultation in March
seemed to suggest that it was their preferred
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000134">In
this case, there was every indication that Vince Cable and the
Government initially supported an annual vote, but then performed a
U-turn once it became apparent that pressure had been applied to them
by large firms—yet another example of this Government talking
big and acting small. A <I>Financial Times</I> editorial piece on the
subject said of
directors:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13013150000308" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000308">“Annual

is not to be confused with my party advocating short-termism. We
believe that in many cases pay has been thought about with too
short-term an approach. The triennial vote actually reflects that to a
certain extent, as for many companies, three-year share options are
thought of as long-term. However, that is for companies themselves to
think about. What the annual binding vote would do is ensure that
whatever remuneration policy is chosen, shareholders have the power to
hold it to account. I beg to move.</hs_parafo>

this point, unlike some of my colleagues, but the point ought to be
made that while the noble Lord is of course right that the Secretary of
State’s initial position was to look at annual binding votes,
but one of the objectives of consultation on these issues is to try to
arrive at a consensus. It looks as though a consensus about the
triennial proposal has been found that gets both the TUC and the CBI on
side. That is a significant achievement, given that this is a tricky
issue. The initial position could have been significant hostility from
one side to the other, whatever the Secretary of State’s
recommendation had been. It should be noted that the compromise was
well negotiated between the two positions. It is not often that the

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 58BD, 58BF and
58BG would make the vote on remuneration policy a special resolution,
requiring companies to secure the support of 75% of shareholders to
pass. The level of support required for remuneration resolutions is a
matter that the Government have consulted on extensively. The vast
majority of investors agree that the vote on pay policy should remain
an ordinary resolution. They would be concerned if a minority of
shareholders could overturn the views of a majority. In cases where
voting turnout is low, it would take only a small number of activist
investors to reject the pay
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000138" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000138">Investors
have welcomed the Government’s decision to keep this as an
ordinary resolution. They have shown this year that a majority of
shareholders are often willing to vote against egregious pay policies.
In 
<?notus-xml column=569?>2012, we saw a succession of companies lose the vote on pay policy with
at least 50% opposition from shareholders, as the noble Lord, Lord
Mitchell, said. Special resolutions should be reserved for rare issues
that have a major impact on shareholder rights or company value, such
as recapitalisation or changing the articles of the company.</hs_para>

agree that companies should have to take action when a large minority
of shareholders reject a remuneration resolution, even if legally it
has been passed. Therefore, the Government welcome the Financial
Reporting Council’s commitment to look at whether companies
should formally respond when a significant number of shareholders vote
against a pay resolution and to consult on this being in the Corporate

58BE would remove the requirement for companies to put their
remuneration policy to a shareholder resolution at least every three
years—triennially—and instead require that this is done
annually. We considered that carefully when consulting with investors

which encourages companies to plan for the long term and discourages
them from making annual tweaks to pay packages. Investors agree that

however, built in a safety net. Shareholders will continue to have an
annual advisory vote on how the pay policy is being implemented. If
they are not satisfied, they can oppose the advisory vote and this will
trigger a requirement to have a binding vote on the pay policy at the
next AGM. Shareholders also have the existing right to force a

and businesses are increasingly working together to sort out pay
issues, but it will take more than one year to do so. The government
reforms will come into force in October this year and will give

think about it. As for the annual side, and the request that it stays
on a triennial basis, every single year at annual general meetings a
series of issues go through, such as the approval of auditors and
accounts. I do not see any reason at all why there should not be an
approval of directors’ remuneration principle and package; it
should slot in: one; two; three. I am sure that is the correct way for
it to be. It does not matter what companies want to do. It is what we

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 58BH, 58BJ and
58BK relate to the information that must be published by a company when
a person ceases to be a director. They seek to clarify the information
that must be disclosed and ensure complete transparency. Whenever a
person ceases to be a director, shareholders want to know the details
of their exit package. At present they may have to wait several months
before they find this out. We believe that requiring companies to
publish this information as soon as possible after a 
<?notus-xml column=571?>director departs will help to put pressure on companies to moderate such
payments. Clause 72 introduces this requirement and requires the
company to publish on its website details of payments for loss of
office. However, because of the complexity of directors’ pay,
some payments made after loss of office will technically be classed as
remuneration payments rather than loss of office payments, so, legally,
companies would not have to include details of them. Such payments can
represent a substantial part of an individual’s exit package and
so should form part of the disclosure on a company’s website.
These amendments address this gap, bringing within
scope,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13013150000386" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000386">“particulars

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, we announced at Second
Reading our intention to introduce into the Bill a new provision on
Midata. There are three elements to this new provision. The first
relates to the supply of customer data, the second relates to the
enforcement regime for the supply of customer data and the third is
supplemental and explains how regulations would be introduced. I will
explain each of these in more detail, but let me first say a little
about what we are seeking to achieve by these amendments.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13013150000155" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000155">Midata is currently a
voluntary programme led by an independent chair, Professor Nigel
Shadbolt. Its aim is to encourage suppliers of goods and services to
provide to their customers, upon request, their personal historic
transaction and/or consumption data in an electronic machine-readable
format. The provision we are seeking to introduce into this Bill is a
power to impose a duty on business to supply certain data upon request
from a consumer. Let me be clear that business already holds this
information electronically and is simply being asked to give it back to
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000156" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000156">Let
me reassure the Committee that the Government remain keen to see
businesses continue to engage with the voluntary programme so that
quick progress can be made without the need to resort to regulation.
What we want, however, is flexibility to give the Midata programme
legislative backing, if it is appropriate to do so, for the benefit of
consumers and business in this area of increasing economic potential
for the UK.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13013150000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000157">Midata gives consumers
more control and access to their personal and transaction data, and UK
businesses will be able to take advantage of new opportunities as
potential developments in the data market continue to emerge. There are
two main benefits from Midata. First, services which analyse and make
sense of consumers’ transaction data will emerge and will help
people to manage their spending much more effectively, putting them in
a stronger position and better able to deal with the increased cost of
living.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13013150000158" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000158">How
valuable could that be? The company, billmonitor, estimates that 74% of
UK mobile users with a contract spend an average of £171 more
each than they need to every year, equating to almost £6 billion
per year in unnecessary costs. A better alignment between consumer need
and purchasing will enhance competition and this in turn will reward
firms offering the best value products in particular markets, allowing
them to win more customers, make profits and better utilise
resources.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000159">Secondly,
Midata will act as a platform for innovation and will help to
strengthen the competitive digital economy in the UK. It will lead to
the creation of new businesses which will help people to manage,
interpret and interact with their consumption data in many innovative
ways. So what might people do? Services such as Money Dashboard or
lovemoney already provide people with an instant, true view of their
finances in one place, which helps individuals aggregate information
about their money from multiple different financial services providers
to gain a rounded picture of their financial affairs but are hampered
by constraints in 
<?notus-xml column=574?>accessing the data. At present, consumers cannot always receive this
information through existing mechanisms, or they may struggle to find
it in a format that can be easily reused.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13013150000160" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000160">Giving consumers the
right to obtain their own transaction and consumption data in portable
electronic format will make it easier for them to use tools such as
those I have described. They would simply be able to plug their past
transaction or consumption data in at the press of a button. Automating
the provision of data will also make such services cheaper to provide
while making it easier for companies to provide innovative new services
which can make use of the data. In this way, Midata can help turn a
niche market for sophisticated money management tools into a mass
market.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13013150000402" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000402">4

noble Lords another example. Green Button in the USA is providing
approximately 11 million households with secure access to
their energy data with an online green button, with 25 million more to
have access in the near future. The VELObill service helps consumers
set energy consumption targets and make the changes they need to their
properties or to their own behaviour to achieve these
targets.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13013150000162" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000162">By
linking this kind of service to money management services such as Money
Dashboard, consumers could make more informed decisions. This is where
Midata could be really powerful in providing consumers with genuinely
useful insights into their consumption and spending behaviour. The UK
needs to make sure that it is competing in services such as this. Big
brands are beginning to see the value of releasing data back to their
customers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000163">In
response to the Midata programme, all the big energy providers are also
making their data downloadable. Some of the bigger banks also provide
this facility already. The O2 mobile phone company will launch a
service later this year to allow its customers access to data about
their mobile phone usage. Tesco has recently announced Clubcard Play,
which will allow customers to view their shopping habits and make the
Clubcard scheme more
transparent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000164" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000164">On
Amendment 58C, consultation over the summer demonstrated widespread
support for the aims of Midata. Responses from individuals and consumer
groups were particularly positive about creating a new right to receive
data electronically. Turning to the detail, Subsection 2 of
the proposed new clause focuses on certain core sectors—energy,
mobile phones, current accounts and credit cards—expressly
identifying these sectors as being potentially subject to future
regulations. These sectors have been identified through the
consultation process as holding data of the most value to consumers.
For example, businesses in these sectors will often hold information
about a stream of ongoing transactions that will be particularly
valuable to consumers but for which price comparison is relatively
complex. The power would allow other sectors to be covered by the
regulations, if
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000165" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000165">I
reassure noble Lords that micro-businesses—that is, businesses
with fewer than 10 employees—will be exempted from any duty to
provide electronic data on request. There will also be flexibility to
allow less 
<?notus-xml column=575?>stringent compliance requirements for businesses and sectors that might
otherwise struggle to comply with a data request. This is in keeping
with the Government’s general approach to regulation. We do,
however, want to keep open the possibility that micro-businesses will
be given the right to request their transaction or consumption data in
a portable electronic format in addition to individual consumers having
this
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000166" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000166">Amendment
58D provides a power to introduce enforcement provisions, including on
designation of enforcers, sanctions for non-compliance and powers on
enforcers, such as information gathering powers, to enable them to
perform their functions effectively. The intention is that the
Information Commissioner would be designated as the lead enforcer,
given the commissioner’s role as guardian of data access issues
generally. Businesses and consumers are used to dealing with that
office on matters relating to personal data and this was the preferred
approach for most respondents to the consultation. However, there would
also be flexibility so that alternative arrangements could be made
where appropriate: for example, giving an enhanced role to sector
regulators. Regulations could also give consumers the right to go to
court
themselves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000167">Amendment
58E specifies that any regulations which cover only the energy, mobile
phones, current accounts and credit cards sectors will be subject to
the negative resolution procedure while any regulations which extend
beyond those sectors will be subject to the enhanced scrutiny of the
affirmative resolution procedure. I beg to move Amendment

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
introducing this new provision. We consider that the concept behind the
Midata initiative is very worthy. We note that when it was launched,
the heading of the BIS press release
was:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13013150000324" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000324">“New

welcome initiative and we applaud the Government’s role in
pushing for voluntary initiatives on giving consumers access to their
own purchasing and transactional
data.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13013150000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000169">We
also recognise that there is a need to put some of this on a statutory
basis so that all providers of goods and services can, in time, be
required to provide that access. But the act of putting this on a legal
basis forces us to consider, and provide for, the complications that
could arise. I am sure that the Minister will be aware of the very
strong objection of the British Retail Consortium to this initiative.
However, he may also want to note that the consumer organisation,
Consumer Focus, while admiring the supposed right, has some serious
anxieties about it. We risk the fact that what should be an improved
consumer service may actually have issues that have not been dealt with
fully on both security and privacy. Some of these arise already, both
with the way in which providers keep individual data for their own
purpose and in the voluntary schemes of provision to customers that are
being introduced without statutory
backing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000170">Once
those schemes are required by the Government, then surely the
Government and Parliament have a duty to ensure that consumer
protection is built into 
<?notus-xml column=576?>the process. The new service that will be required of providers by law
will involve issues of personal data transmission, data storage,
multiple combination and multiple access, which means that the process
must have built into it security and minimisation of risk to
consumers’ privacy and disclosure of identity. Such precautions
will also need to be accompanied by systems of identifying liability
and responsibility for redress and absolute clarity about how one goes
about seeking that
redress.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000171" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000171">At
the moment, data on the purchases and transactions are largely held by
the direct provider, although they are also often sold on or combined
with other data. Under Midata, consumers will also have access but
there will be greater potential for the selling on and combining of
data. Hence, liability, clarity on liability and redress systems are
essential. If the system works, the Midata providers must be required
to adhere to the highest security and data protection standards.
Consumers need to know that Midata providers meet those high standards;
so there must be easy identification of those who have been designated
as trustworthy providers. It is presumably the Government’s
contention that this will be done by secondary legislation, but unless
the principles are written clearly in primary legislation, it will be
difficult to judge whether those systems can
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000172" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000172">Amendment
58D deals with enforcement of the duty to disclose, but it includes no
provision for complaint, mediation, arbitration or redress should that
obligation be carried out in a way that endangers or threatens to
endanger privacy and security of data. We know that the Information
Commissioner is designated as enforcer, at least until the Government
decide otherwise, but there is no provision for an ombudsman or for ADR
coverage for this. On the Information Commissioner, I have great
admiration for the difficult job that both he and his predecessor have
done but I seek some confirmation that the Minister is confident that
that role is appropriate to fall to the Information Commissioner. He
does, of course, already have to make difficult judgments between
transparency and data protection, but there are particular dimensions
here. I am curious to know whether he even wants this job. Perhaps the
Government could also give us some assurance about what additional
resources will he get in order to carry it out. The Government
themselves seem a bit hesitant as to whether the Information
Commissioner is the best-placed person, as they have allowed scope for
designating some other body. I do not know whether the Government had
something else in mind, or whether it was just a fail-safe
provision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000173" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000173">Going
back to Amendment 58C, there is also the associated issue of what kind
of information and what kind of access is covered. There are many ways
in which we purchase goods and conduct our financial transactions. Does
this cover the web-based data and transaction services—social
media, free apps and online platforms that facilitate transactions
between parties? Obvious examples are eBay and Amazon—all
different, but all using and storing online consumer data. Because of
the conglomerate nature of many retail providers across many markets,
there is an issue of how this data is shared even within a company and
what the legitimate and non-legitimate boundaries are of such
sharing.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=577?><hs_para UID="13013150000174" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000174">In
the course of the Financial Services Bill, my noble friend Lord Whitty
raised the issue of whether consumer data collected by Tesco, and
recorded on their Club Cards, from its retail sales could be used by
Tesco’s banking arm to establish creditworthiness. Some Chinese
walls are already required within banks and financial institutions. The
new Financial Services Act, however, does not require that, in the case
of a bank owned by a non-financial institution, there must be such
Chinese walls—although the Government did write into the Bill,
now an Act, a reserve power to make that requirement. Tesco and
financial services are simply as a potential example of this. It has
not yet happened. More concretely, in America there have been issues
with Walmart and its banking
arm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000175" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000175">With
consumer data now required, or potentially required, under this Midata
clause, to be parcelled up neatly on an individual basis rather than
aggregated or earmarked for future marketing as is more usually the
case, the possibility for data sharing increases significantly. There
is also the issue of companies which are major traders in this country
but owned overseas, some in the four areas designated as priority by
the Government for this
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000176" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000176">Could
the Minister tell us how far privacy and data protection can be
guaranteed beyond UK boundaries? The sectors chosen—energy,
mobile phones and financial institutions—are dominated by major
companies and feature oligopolistic markets. However, there are small
providers, and there will be even more in other sectors to which these
provisions will be extended in due course. Provisions which are not
onerous for large retailers—banking and telecoms giants, for
example—could be very onerous for smaller retailers and even
smaller financial institutions. We understand that the legislation has
no exclusions for smaller companies. Again, perhaps the Minister could
confirm whether that is the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000177" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000177">We would
also like to ask the Government about their choice of sector
priorities. The amendment links together information on individuals
held by the provider and held on behalf of the consumer. At present
these are legally very different. Data, such as that held by Tesco on
its Club Cards, are the clear property of the providing company, as is
most data on purchases. However, transactional data held with banks on
savings or debt are the property of the consumer and subject to strict
privacy and disclosure requirements. As we see it, under Midata, the
distinction between those two is
blurred.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000178" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000178">There
are also issues about the kind of data disclosable and the format of
that disclosure. The intention, as the Minister outlined, is to provide
in electronic machine-readable form data requested by the customer. The
customer must be able to request all purchasing and transactional data
for a period of at least a year in order to be able to draw rational
conclusions and make rational decisions on, for example, changing the
pattern of purchase or switching suppliers, which has been suggested.
That needs to be
specified.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13013150000403" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000403">4.15

clear whether consumers can be charged, directly or indirectly, for the
data. Does the Minister intend to specify that in regulations? The
Midata 
<?notus-xml column=578?>initiative could lead to better consumer information and more rational
decisions. However, the format in which it is provided may itself be
limiting and, as a result, may benefit only those who already are the
best informed and most capable of making decisions on switching.
However, many more vulnerable and older consumers will have difficulty
in using only machine-readable information. Surely, it should be
possible for consumers to require disclosure in whatever is the most
convenient format for them. Indeed, information on alternatives in
order to provide an objective basis for switching between suppliers is
equally essential. We therefore argue that a broader strategy is
perhaps needed that prioritises data on more vulnerable consumers
rather than those already most
enabled.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000180" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000180">My
final point relates to the choice of priority sectors selected by the
Government to which the law should initially apply—energy,
mobile phones, current accounts and credit cards. The first two
categories, energy and mobile phones, are among the areas of highest
consumer complaint, and ones where the experience of switching does not
always bring the desired benefit. Both categories are idiosyncratic in
their methods of contracting and billing, but at least consumers are
used to seeing bills on paper or in electronic format. They therefore
have some historic but perhaps not always understandable data available
for comparison purposes. It seems sensible to prioritise those two
areas because there is a lot of consumer concern. However, current
accounts and credit cards may be rather different. Information on these
is for the most part already accessible via the internet or is
requestable on paper. There are more pressing areas where no
information is available to the customer, although a lot is available
to the provider. Retail sales in multiple supermarkets is one obvious
example of where weekly, if not daily, consumer decisions
are
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000181" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000181">The
other area that should be mentioned is the public sector. In many
cases, transactions are non-monetary—although some, such as
taxation and social security, are financial. Other transactions, such
as in the NHS or social services, are recorded but not available to us.
In America, the federal government sector is taking the lead in
disclosure on request of individual transactional information and
requiring the private sector to follow. Why is there no such government
lead here?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000182" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000182">The
Government may say that much of what I am asking will be dealt with in
regulations, but where in the Bill is the hook on which these new
regulations could be made? Can the Minister indicate the broad form he
intends them to take? I hope that he was not being a little
overoptimistic when he talked about a whole lot of new enterprises
being set up as a result. I hope that they will not be enterprises that
charge consumers and add an extra layer of cost, rather than put the
data directly into consumers’ hands, which is what I thought was
the
intention.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000183" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000183">There
are serious data protection issues in this, and some comfort from the
Minister would assist us.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the general support
given to Midata by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, in her initial
remarks. I listened carefully to the large number of points that she
raised. 
<?notus-xml column=579?>She has clearly put a lot of thought into the issue and I would like to
address as many of the concerns that she raised as possible. It may
well be that I do not cover them all, in which case, I will write to
her.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000185" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000185">The first
issue I want to address is the point that the noble Baroness, Lady
Hayter, raised concerning the British Retail Consortium and the
objections that they have expressed on Midata. To re-emphasise the
point—the focus of the power of this Bill are the four core
sectors of energy, mobile phones, current accounts and credit cards. We
cannot say that there will never be circumstances where Ministers
believe including supermarkets within the regulations is worthwhile.
But, before they do so, they will have to take account of the factors
set out in proposed subsection (7) in Amendment 58C. The relevant
legislation to effect such a change would be subject to enhanced
parliamentary scrutiny through the affirmative
procedure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000186" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000186">The
noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, asked whether it was true that consumer
bodies had been warning about the risk of this programme for some time.
It is true that the Government continue to work with consumer
representative groups and business to tackle any potential risks to
consumers—the point that she raised. A range of consumer bodies
endorsed the principles of Midata published by the Government in 2011,
such as Citizens Advice, Consumer Focus and the Office of Fair Trading.
Members of these consumer organisations also sit on the Midata strategy
board, which is responsible for driving the direction of the overall
programme. However, the Government are taking these concerns seriously
and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will continue to
work closely with consumer groups to ensure that consumer privacy is
protected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000187" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000187">The
noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, asked whether the Information Commissioner
actually wanted the role of enforcement. I can reassure her that
Ministers have discussed this with him directly and he was, indeed,
willing to take on the role. The noble Baroness also asked if this was
an appropriate role for the Information Commissioner and whether he had
enough resources to undertake this particular role. We have had
detailed discussions with the ICO on how the enforcement regime could
work for Midata. If regulations are brought forward in the future, we
are confident that the ICO’s existing expertise in data
protection will help it to effectively enforce the Midata right for
consumers. In addition, we did not want to place any additional cost
burden on business, but we have included provisions enabling other
bodies to be designated as enforcers, if that is later decided to be
more appropriate than the ICO. For example, if we were to regulate for
one sector only, it might be appropriate to designate a particular
sector regulator.</hs_para>

raised the issue of data protection. Existing consumer protections
would still apply under Midata. All organisations that process personal
data in the UK, including for the purposes of the Midata initiative,
must comply with the Data Protection Act’s eight data protection
principles. The DPA is enforced by the independent Information
Commissioner’s Office, which has powers of prosecution and can
issue monetary penalty notices requiring organisations to pay up to
£500,000 for serious breaches of the DPA.</hs_para>

noble Baroness also raised the issue of exclusions for smaller
companies. I mentioned earlier that she will remember the issue of
micro-businesses. The power allows flexibility for smaller companies to
be excluded at the regulation stage. I hope that reassures the noble
Baroness on that particular
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000190" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000190">The
noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, also raised the issue as to whether
consumers would be charged. The regulations could allow for consumers
to be charged if that is considered appropriate at that particular
stage. The new clause already limits such charges to the cost of
complying with the request for data.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13013150000191" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000191">There are two more
questions raised by the noble Baroness. First, she asked why there has
been no government lead on providing public sector data. These measures
will not apply to the public sector. However, in parallel, the
Government are looking at issues of public sector data. The Open Data
White Paper sets out the Government’s position and plans on
public sector data
release.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000192" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000192">The
noble Baroness also asked what form the regulations would take. The

this particular Midata programme. If regulations are subsequently
brought forward, they will be shaped by consultations with stakeholders
first.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000193" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000193">The
Government will continue to engage with business, consumer groups,
regulators and trade bodies involved in the voluntary programme to
accelerate progress as well as to broaden our engagement with other
sectors. In bringing forward these amendments, we are conscious that a

to businesses and wider benefits to the economy. This balance also

there being new intermediaries in this area that will obviously be
looking for a profit out of it for themselves and to use that data in
different ways. Would that restriction on charging apply to them? In a
sense, you have doubled the administrative time with a provider and an
organisation that is being subcontracted by that provider to deal with

Razzall:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a new point. Although the
amendment which stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lady
Brinton, on which I am grateful for the assistance of FairPensions, is
complicated, the issue is really quite straightforward. It is that
there has been significant concern in the financial markets for a
number of years that organisations that are described as fiduciaries in
the drafting of this amendment, which include trustees, pension funds
et cetera, are, as a matter of law, obliged when making an investment
to take into account only the financial advantage of their pensioners,
beneficiaries and clients.</hs_para>

amendment is to establish clearly a matter of law that has always been
in doubt, on whether, in making an investment decision, such as whether
to accept a bid for a company in which they are invested or any
decision regarding the investment money for which they are responsible,
fiduciaries are entitled to take into account the wider considerations
set out in subsection (1) of new Clause 58F without potentially being
attacked for not looking after the interests of the people whose money
they are managing. This is a serious issue because the law is unclear
on whether they are entitled to do so, and the purpose of these
amendments is to make clear that in those situations the fiduciaries,
as they are defined, may take into account other factors.</hs_para>

these proposed amendments is that they are mandatory. They are not
mandatory; there is nothing here to say that a trustee cannot simply
take the money and run. The purpose is to clarify that if trustees take
into account the wider interests as set out in subsection (1) of the
proposed new clause in Amendment 58F, they cannot be criticised as a
matter of law. That is the purpose of this amendment and FairPensions
has been campaigning for it for some time. We thought this was a Bill
where we could try to get it inserted. I beg to move.</hs_para>

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords, we very much welcome the
amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, and the noble
Baroness, particularly their intention to clarify investors’
fiduciary duty. The amendments, as have been suggested, would clarify
that institutional investors are not legally obliged to maximise
short-term profits at any cost but “may”—that word
was emphasised—take into account wider factors, such as the
long-term sustainability of returns. This is modelled on Section 172 of
the Companies Act 2006, which similarly clarified that company
directors may take account of longer-term and wider factors, such as
their impact on communities or the environment.</hs_para>

Bill in front of us is about enterprise and long-term growth. The
Government are giving shareholders additional rights, which we welcome,
but these must be balanced with duties to the underlying beneficiaries,
who may have wider interests than just immediate returns. These
amendments propose that there should be no legal barriers to
consideration of those beneficiaries’ interests. It does not
mandate anything but it clarifies the law. The amendments are, we would
say, permissive rather than prescriptive, and would ensure that the law
does not prevent trustees from taking a broader approach. The provision
does not mandate them to do so; in fact, it restores the primacy of
trustees’ discretion in deciding how best to serve their
beneficiaries, as opposed to assuming that the law restricts them to
taking a particular approach.</hs_para>

clear that the duty of fiduciary investors is solely to their
beneficiaries, and that the interests of beneficiaries must be the
basis for 
<?notus-xml column=585?>all decisions. They clarify that this need not always mean maximising
short-term profits: if trustees believe that their
beneficiaries’ interests will be better served by taking into
account wider factors, they will be empowered to do so. Indeed, where
trustees choose to take account of purely non-financial
factors—such as beneficiaries’ ethical views or
implications for their quality of life—the amendments specify
that this must not be to the detriment of beneficiaries’
long-term financial interests.</hs_para>

may give one example to show why this amendment is so needed. A large
pension fund, which I fear does not wish to be named in this debate,
received legal advice to the effect that its policy on shareholder
engagement and responsible investment might be unlawful. Its policy
stated that the fund would seek to exercise voting rights in listed
companies in which it held shares, and that it would take into account
environmental, social and governance issues with the potential to
affect the long-term value for the fund’s beneficiaries. This
position is firmly grounded in the financial interests of
beneficiaries, and is widely accepted as best practice within the
industry. The Government endorsed such an approach by promoting the
stewardship code, through its package of enhanced shareholder rights on
executive pay, and, in the Commons, where Pensions Minister Steve Webb
said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13013150000389" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000389">“the

this, the advice from a large and reputable law firm took an extremely
narrow view of beneficiaries’ best interests, and suggested that
the costs involved in exercising voting rights might render the policy
unlawful unless the firm could demonstrate that such stewardship
brought monetised benefits to the individual fund. The opinion cast
doubt on whether such benefits could be demonstrated. This illustrates
why the Government’s approach to responsible capitalism, which
has focused on giving shareholders more rights,  needs to be
complemented by measures to remove any perceived legal barriers to the
responsible exercise of these
rights.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13013150000208" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000208">For
long-term, sustainable growth and returns, we want responsible
shareholder engagement with listed companies. The Kay review

this. We would therefore ask Minister to confirm today that, if the Law

noble friend Lord Razzall, supported in name by my noble friend Lady
Brinton, for giving us the opportunity to debate the vital issue of
fiduciary standards in the investment industry. As noble Lords may be
aware, the duties of investment intermediaries were considered by
Professor John Kay in his 2012 independent review of equity markets and
long-term decision-making. The noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, mentioned
this in her speech. The Government have broadly accepted the
recommendations of the Kay report in this area. Specifically, they have
made clear their support for the view expressed by Professor Kay, and
echoed in Amendment 58F that institutional investors should not
automatically assume that maximising short-term returns is sufficient
to serve the interests of their clients or beneficiaries. Instead they
should take into account long-term factors relevant to their
clients’ interests over the time horizon of the investment.
However, the Kay report also found that there was no clear agreement on
what the law currently requires of those investing on others’
behalf, and recommended that the matter be referred to the Law
Commission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000211" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000211">The
Government have therefore asked the Law Commission to undertake a
review of the legal obligations arising from fiduciary duties that
dictate what considerations are appropriate for trustees and other
intermediaries acting in the best interests of their clients and
beneficiaries. The Government also support Professor Kay’s view
that there should be a common minimum standard of behaviour required of
all investment intermediaries. While I therefore have great sympathy
with the spirit of my noble friends’ intentions, I do not
believe that the approach taken in these amendments would achieve this.
The amendments attempt to enshrine aspects of the common-law concept of
fiduciary duties in statute, and to apply these to certain
institutional investors in all circumstances. This includes applying
them to certain FSA-authorised firms without due regard to the
FSA’s existing regulatory requirements. That this approach would
add to confusion and uncertainty about the meaning of the word
“fiduciary”, the circumstances in which a fiduciary

government response to the Kay report is very clear in setting out the
principle that all investment intermediaries should act in the best
interests of their clients or beneficiaries in line with generally
prevailing standards of decent behaviour. In order to embed this
principle effectively, the Government have asked the FSA, and its
successor organisation, the FCA, to consider to what extent current

determine what action might be desirable. This includes, if necessary,

Razzall:</Member></B> My Lords, I must say I am slightly disappointed
by the Government’s response to this. This amendment is not
about looking at the issues that the noble Viscount has suggested need
to be looked at. It has nothing to do with the FSA or European
regulations. Its entire purpose is to clarify the existing 
<?notus-xml column=587?>law. For example, it seeks to clarify that institutional shareholders
which had a shareholding in Cadbury’s were entitled to take the
view that they did not have to accept a very successful financial bid
if they were concerned about other characteristics. That is not an FSA
point or a European regulation point; it is a simple matter of
clarifying the law. That is all we are asking
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000215" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000215">I have
serious reservations and concerns about the matter being referred to
the Law Commission because I predict that we will be debating this in
five or 10 years’ time—those of us who are
still alive then—when the Law Commission eventually comes back
with a recommendation that will cover much wider areas than are dealt
with by the amendment, as the Minister has indicated. To my mind, that
is typical of the way in which Governments respond to things in that
you propose a relatively small amendment and they say, quite fairly,
that the whole area, which is huge, is being looked at, of which the
amendment is just a small part, and therefore they cannot do anything
about the small amendment until that huge area has been looked at. That
is the problem, and that is what I worry about. However, in the mean
time, I shall withdraw the

for institutional investors on their legal obligations. It would not be

reason why that is necessary is that recent evidence shows, as the
Minister will be aware that gender pay gap continues to persist. The
2012 annual survey of hours and earnings found that the mean pay gap
between men and women’s average hourly earnings, excluding
overtime, was 14.9% for full-time workers and 7.9% for part-time
workers. The Equality and Human Rights Commission’s 2010
triennial view found that pay gaps also affect disabled people and some
ethnic groups, and I am going to return to that in a moment. In its
response to the modern workplace consultation carried out by
Government, the EHRC noted that the power to impose pay audits needs to
be as robust as possible in order to have maximum
effect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000230" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0001.htm#13013150000230">It
seems to us that the tests for this legislation are, first: will it
help employers? Carrying out an equal pay audit should be viewed as a
positive means of enabling the employer concerned to eliminate pay
inequality and minimise the likelihood of facing future equal pay
tribunal court claims, rather than as a penalty. Secondly, will it
avoid the possibility that, if equal pay audits are seen as a penalty,
there is a risk that employers will settle equal pay cases outside
court to avoid that penalty? This could be particularly true of those
firms that can afford to settle and are anxious to avoid negative
publicity.</hs_para>

acknowledge that conducting an equal pay audit will not in itself
eliminate a gender pay gap? It will, however, bring to light and enable
employers to address any equal pay issues that are uncovered. Employers
will still need to draft an action plan to rectify any unjustifiable
pay gaps they find, implement changes and regularly monitor the
outcomes. It seems to us that implementing and monitoring the necessary
changes are the most important aspect of any equal pay audit. Employers
will need to be made aware that there will be an expectation on them to
do this. Will the Minister assure the Committee that this is indeed the
case? Employers will also need to be made aware of the time limits that
will be placed on them to conduct and action their equal pay audits and
of what sanctions will be taken if they are breached.</hs_para>

laws that already exist. If there were enough time, and perhaps on
another occasion, I might recount some of the stories that my mother

should be encouraged to make progress on complying with these important
laws. Where it is not necessary, we should avoid a statutory approach
in terms of making them comply. I recognise the point that the noble
Baroness was making about progress in this area. There has been
progress, but clearly more needs to be done. That is why this
Government have introduced some measures to increase transparency on
how pay is reflected in organisations. There seems to be quite a
positive response to those voluntary
measures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000236" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000236">We
think that equal pay is so important, so we also believe that it is

have failed to comply with the law. When the law has been broken, they
need to be forced to address that. That is why we believe that this is
the right approach to take.</hs_para>

Baroness raised some questions for me to respond to. She asked why
equal pay audits are not available as an automatic right. We believe
that carrying out a systematic pay audit of staff can be burdensome,
and we do not want to place unnecessary burdens on employers who have
done nothing wrong. We also feel that some employers are already
carrying out these equal pay audits on a periodic basis and are
using  
<?notus-xml column=591?>them in a constructive and good way. We do not want them to feel that
they are being unnecessarily penalised when they are already doing the
right thing.</hs_para>

asked whether we thought that, once this measure is in force, the equal
pay audits will simply push employers to settle equal pay claims. Our
view on that is that if any employer were facing a continuing claim
against it on equal pay grounds, it would soon find that it would not
be cost effective to keep settling those claims. I do not accept that
that would be a consequence of this.</hs_para>

asked why the equal pay audit would not cover other protected
characteristics. As she and I have acknowledged, equal pay legislation
for men and women has been in place for some 40 years. We think it is
right to focus the audit on sex-based pay differentials alone as only
there is there a specific right to equal pay, and the appropriate route
of redress for discrimination due to any protected characteristic other
than sex in matters relating to pay, is through the discrimination
provisions in the Equality Act.</hs_para>

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, one of the key aims of

growth. Key to this is promoting the rescue of potentially viable
companies that are facing short-term financial
difficulties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000245" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000245">Suppliers
are a company’s lifeblood. Companies cannot continue to operate
without them yet, under existing legislation, suppliers can currently
take a number of unreasonable actions when they hear a business is in
trouble. Struggling companies can often be faced with extortionate
payments, being moved onto more expensive tariffs or with certain key
suppliers withdrawing their services altogether. This behaviour
frequently leads to the unnecessary liquidation of potentially viable
businesses, which is bad news not only for creditors but also for jobs
and the economy. The company R3 has estimated that a change in the law
could result in approximately 2,300 additional business rescues a year
and increased returns to
creditors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000246" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000246">It
is true that Section 233 of the Insolvency Act 1986 currently prohibits
utilities suppliers from withdrawing supply but it does not stop any
other supplier, no matter how crucial, withdrawing supply or imposing a
higher tariff or payment before agreeing to continue to supply. It also
fails to prevent any supplier from raising its tariff once a business
enters insolvency. These actions can prevent any chance of business
rescue, damn the business to closure, and reduce dividends for
creditors. We suggest that this legislation should be updated in the
following ways to help rescue more businesses and save
jobs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000247" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000247">Certain
suppliers often use the advent of insolvency to extract “ransom
payments” before they continue to supply the company.
Furthermore, while utilities suppliers 
<?notus-xml column=593?>listed under Section 233 cannot withhold supply, there is nothing to
prevent them moving an insolvent company onto a much higher tariff. We
suggest that Section 233 should include a provision to prevent the
exercise of contractual termination provisions on the grounds of
insolvency alone, and should prevent suppliers of essential services
from using their position to extract so-called ransom payments as a
condition for continued supply, provided that the company continued to
pay under existing contractual
terms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000248" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000248">While
original sellers of utilities services are prevented by the Insolvency
Act from terminating their contracts on insolvency, on-sellers of
telecoms services and equipment are not covered by the legislation,
even though they are every bit as important to the business
community—increasingly, these days. In addition, other services,
such as IT and software suppliers, which are vital to business survival
in the 21st century, are freely able to stop supplying a company on the
ground of insolvency. Section 233 sets out the suppliers to which these
provisions apply—currently, gas, electricity, water and
communications. We suggest including in this list certain additional
suppliers deemed essential for the continued operation of the business,
particularly IT suppliers and on-sellers of utilities that are not
covered by the original definition. A precedent for this change was set
by Regulation 14 of the Investment Bank Special Administration
Regulations 2011, which prevents suppliers of essential services such
as financial data, computer hardware and data processing from
withholding supply in the event of
administration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000249" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000249">Finally,
it is important to note that these changes expose suppliers to minimal
risk, because they are paid as a priority, ahead of all other creditors
during the insolvency. This is not about special treatment for
insolvent businesses, but about preventing suppliers taking advantage
of an insolvency and leapfrogging other creditors, at the expense of
the business’s
survival.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000250" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000250">I
turn to Amendment 58HZA in the group. The Finance Act 2009 established
a duty on HMRC to produce a report each year on its adherence to its
charter, which sets out the rights and obligations of taxpayers. Our
amendment asks for HMRC’s annual report to consider a particular
issue, consumer debt, and to relate that to the objectives in its
annual business plan. One of the recurrent themes raised during the
debates we held recently in your Lordships’ House on the
Financial Services Bill was the need for the new regulatory structures
to have the consumer at the centre of their thinking and practice. We
have had not dissimilar debates on earlier sections of this Bill in
relation to the new Competition and Markets Authority, to which we will
return on Report.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13013150000251" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000251">This amendment is in
the same vein, although the target is the HMRC, and is relatively
uncontroversial and not particularly burdensome because it simply
requests the HMRC to report additionally about what it is finding about
levels of personal debt in the UK. This will be useful data for all
those interested in this area, and might over time help to sensitise
HMRC to what impact it is having on those struggling with unmanageable
personal debts. I declare my interest as chair of StepChange, the
leading debt charity. Its figures show that its median client owes more
than 
<?notus-xml column=594?>£20,000 to five different creditors, with the bulk in credit
cards and personal loans, and other consumer credit products. They also
include mortgage arrears, rent arrears and, increasingly, fuel and
utility debts, income tax and council tax. Nearly half the people who
StepChange help report that unemployment or a reduced income was the
main reason for their debt problems. However, people also say that life
events such as illness and separation can quickly overwhelm family
finances and cause or contribute to mounting debts. What StepChange
finds, in fact, is that debt is rarely a problem in
isolation—there are nearly always other factors that need to be
addressed, including a particular concern of ours, which is the link
between problem debt and depression. Nearly a half of
StepChange’s clients say they had been worrying about their
debts for a year or more before seeking help from a debt service
provider. Around a third told the charity that their debt problems had
weakened their relationships or led to a break-up. Nearly half said
that debt had shattered their self-confidence to support themselves and
their
family.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000252" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000252">Things
changed in the personal debt world in about 2006-07, but the pre-crash
boom in consumer credit also remains a key part of the UK debt
narrative. Even after several years of near-zero lending, the total of
outstanding secured and unsecured debt is still some 91% higher than it
was 10 years ago. It is a pretty bad picture. Recent research by the
Financial Inclusion Centre concluded that some 6.2 million households
are currently either already in financial difficulties or at risk of
getting there. And it is going to get worse. The IFS estimates that
real median household incomes will fall by 7.1% between 2009-10 and
2013-14 as a result of low growth and fiscal tightening—the
largest decline since the 1974 to 1977 fall of 7.5%. Recent research
published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation predicts an increase in
both relative and absolute poverty between 2009 and 2020. Unemployment
remains at a stubbornly high 8.3%, or 2.65 million people, and more
than one in five young workers are without a job. That is particularly
worrying as we know that time spent not in employment, education or
training as a young adult can have a scarring effect as well as
reducing lifetime
earnings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000253" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000253">At
the same time, we are experiencing an extended period where households
are facing rising costs for essential goods and services. Food, fuel
and transport costs are rising sharply, and we will sooner or later
face a rise in interest rates, which are unnaturally low at present.
Figures from the Financial Inclusion Centre show that, if living costs
rise by more than £50 per week, it would double the percentage
of households, currently 30%, who have no spare cash at the end of the
month. That is the rather grim background to our amendment. I apologise
for taking the Committee’s time, but it is important to get the
context so that we can focus more closely on the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000254" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000254">We
need to know more about personal debt—how it arises, and how
people cope with it. HMRC is a major player in this area, and it is
important that it participates in the research that is needed and
contributes to finding solutions to the problems that currently exist.
Reporting on the situation that it finds each year would be a great
step forward. I beg to move.</hs_para>

Razzall:</Member></B> My Lords, I have considerable sympathy with the
amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Hayter. These issues are always extremely tricky in that
it is a matter of getting the balance right between the wish of
companies or individuals to carry on trading following an insolvency
action and that of creditors to protect their interests. There is a
slightly wider issue of pre-pack administrations and sale of businesses
where the major losers are the unsecured creditors. That is something
that your Lordships have looked at from time to time to see whether any
change needs to take place. This is a relatively small amendment to
marginally shift the balance in relation to organisations which,
although insolvent in one form or another, are carrying on trading. We
have had a lot of evidence—obviously on the Labour side as well
as on our side—that there are quite significant occasions when
the suppliers of these services, rather than cutting off the service,
say that they will carry on the service but charge a significant extra
amount. That seems not to be conducive and, in this case, shifts the
balance far too far away from the creditors’ interests.
Therefore, I think that this amendment is very appropriate and the
Government should consider it
seriously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000256" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000256"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Mitchell" PimsId="1929" UID="13013150000489" xid="1349" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000489">Lord
Mitchell:</Member></B> My Lords, I had not intended to talk about what
I am talking about now, but it is pertinent, particularly as the noble
Lord, Lord Razzall, mentioned pre-pack administration. I would like to
say a little more about
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013150000257" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000257">Some pretty
awful stuff is going on out there. Pre-pack administration is a
situation in which a company is in trouble, particularly with its
creditors, and is just about hanging on, when at the very same time
some influential shareholders get together with a friendly
administrator and say that they will put the company into
administration. They suggest that the moment that it is put into
administration there will be just a short period of time in which to
sell it, then they will come in with company mark 2, which will buy the
assets and business from the administrator and start up again, often
with a very similar name. The effect of doing that is that the small
creditors, which is the area that I care about because they are
generally SMEs, and the small shareholders, get absolutely stuffed,
because the company ceases to exist—and it then in its revised
form continues with a different name and some of the same shareholders.
They have an agreement with their banker. They have dumped all the
toxic stuff into the river and moved on and started the company again.
This does goes on; I have seen lots of examples of it happening. In
fact, I am a minority shareholder in a company and there was a time
when the majority shareholder was threatening to put the company into
pre-pack, which would have meant me losing my shareholding. This was
several years ago but I have experienced the threat of it. In effect,
it never happened but it is one of the weapons that a company can use
to dump shareholders and creditors. I put this down as something that I
might come back to. I am not expecting the Minister necessarily to come
back on any key points but I just want to make that
point.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-31?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_31_PT_1/548842B5976456F3A448CC844A12BF0619EDE3A7" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 31 January 2013">Thursday,

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment seeks to amend
the Insolvency Act 1986 to prevent suppliers withdrawing their services
from a company after it enters formal insolvency. The amendment also
seeks to address concerns about whether all utility providers are bound
by an existing provision to prevent them demanding so-called ransom
payments as a condition of continuing supply, which is an issue that
the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, highlighted in his speech. In addition,
it seeks to extend that provision to IT suppliers.</hs_para>

recognise the concerns that have been raised here and are looking very
closely at these issues. My noble friend Lord Razzall recognised the
difficulty in creating a balance here. We are committed to exploring
any option which might help to rescue viable businesses and jobs, or
which would improve the outcome for creditors of insolvent companies.
The UK’s insolvency regime is very well regarded
internationally. The regime continues to rank highly in World Bank
reports for its ability to deliver quick and effective business rescue
mechanisms. We want to maintain that standing and, indeed, build upon
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13013150000260" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000260">However,
I am sure noble Lords will recognise that this is a complex issue and
that proper consideration must be given to the consequences that might
result from such a change. For example, forcing suppliers to continue
to supply an insolvent business might interfere with commercial
behaviours and contractual rights. Freedom of contract is an important
tenet in English law. Restricting a supplier’s right to
terminate might also lead to knock-on insolvencies and could affect the
pricing of contracts. While we recognise the advantages that such an
amendment might bring, in the light of the important issues it raises,
the Government wish to understand more clearly the consequences before
deciding whether, and if so how, to change the law. In that way, we can
satisfy ourselves that the right balance is being struck between the
competing interests. I thank noble Lords for tabling this amendment and
I assure them that the Government will consider this important issue
very carefully.</hs_para>

to repay their debts. The charter sets out HMRC’s role and the
standards of behaviour and values to which the department aspires when
dealing with everyone. The charter contains nine rights and three
obligations. Examples include: the right to help and support; honest
and even-handed treatment; professional behaviour; and acting with
integrity. HMRC has six strategic objectives. These include improving
the customer experience and maximising revenue to close the tax gap.
The standards and values set out in the charter cover all aspects of
HMRC’s work to meet these objectives, as well as its
interactions with individuals and businesses.</hs_para>

the “Time to Pay” scheme, HMRC already takes a long-term
view to collecting debts in this respect. “Time to Pay”
arrangements have always formed part of HMRC’s approach to
collecting tax. Such arrangements are agreed with businesses and
individuals to enable HMRC to collect the tax over an agreed period.
This approach provides a better return for the Exchequer than forcing a
viable business into insolvency or an individual into bankruptcy. I
thought it would be helpful to bring this into the debate given the

Lord Razzall and Lord Mitchell, for participating in this debate. We
have ranged a little further than the original terms but it was useful
to have that exchange on pre-packs. I think that the main focus of the
comments from the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, was more on the interests
of shareholders than creditors but it still comes back to the same

two amendments in reverse order. As regards the points in the second
amendment about the role of the Inland Revenue, I heard what the
Minister said. However, I think that the problem is exactly as he
stated it but in reverse. If your primary concern—it is not a
wrong concern—is that the purpose of the Inland Revenue is to
maximise revenue to ensure that government services and so on may be
maintained, you may have to regard vulnerable consumers and others who
have difficulties as a slightly lower priority. It is true that there
are nine rights and three obligations in the wonderful Inland Revenue
charter but none of them mentions either of those issues in any great
detail.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13013150000268" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-gc0002.htm#13013150000268">It is
more a question of tone and approach. It is true that we have done less
badly in this recession than in many other recessions, largely because
the banks and other private institutions have been extraordinarily
generous in terms of forbearance. That was achieved in dialogue with
the Government of the day and has been continued by the current
Government. However, without that there would have been a huge hole in
the public fabric and services which it would have been impossible to
tolerate. There are ways in which we can reach out to the vulnerable
consumers that we are talking about; we have those at the heart of my
charity. What I was trying to get across in the amendment was that
perhaps we could have a broader discussion involving Treasury Ministers
to take account of some of these issues.</hs_para>

for this but, as regards much of the insolvency and the other areas
with which we are dealing; it seems we are gradually finding
20th-century solutions to 19th and 18th-century problems. The idea,
which I think I have mentioned in other places, that somehow there is
an unimpeachable line of integrity between the creditor and the debtor
is at variance with the reality of what happens when vulnerable
consumers get themselves into difficulty. It is time for us to have a
mature discussion about people who are facing the possibility of going
bankrupt.</hs_para>

its huge pleasures, is a wonderful approach, but is totally without a
statutory framework. Does that need to be considered? Even when
forbearance is operating and we are talking about keeping people in a
family home which they would otherwise have to have left, is
forbearance right if, as a result, they can neither heat that home nor
feed themselves there? These are issues that we do not get quite right;
there is a black-and-white approach to them. This amendment tries to
say, “Perhaps we can begin by gathering the figures and thinking
again about how these things operate”. Using the rights and
privileges that the Revenue has above and against all other creditors
is obviously important in terms of making sure that we maximise
revenue, but that is not necessarily right in terms of societal norms
and values. I am sorry to have taken so long but it is important to get

amendments to Clause 79 have two effects. The first is to commence all
powers to make subordinate legislation by statutory instrument on Royal
Assent. This is to assist with the orderly commencement of the
Bill’s provisions. I should make it clear that these amendments
should not be seen as suggesting that all the powers in the Bill will
be exercised straight after Royal Assent, or indeed at all. Some are
reserve powers which will only be needed if certain circumstances
apply—for example, Clause 45 on the powers of sector regulators.

Assent without the need for a commencement order. I beg to move

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, it is probably totally inappropriate for
me—as I am probably the person who has been here least in recent
days—but I would like to join the Minister in thanking the
clerks, the support staff and everybody who has participated on all
sides during these debates. I also thank the various Chairs, including
our current Chair. I extend that to the Minister and his colleagues and

he is going to get away after that, I have a couple of questions on
this virtually final clause. As he says, the powers do not necessarily
come in at the first date that is stipulated here in terms of
implementation, but the Secretary of State will be able to implement
them. In Amendment 60AB, he has already referred to proposed new
paragraph (b), which relates to concurrent powers in Clause 45. The
Minister 
<?notus-xml column=601?>may recall that during the debate on this there was considerable concern
expressed about how the balance between the sector regulator and the
new CMA would work. My understanding is that there will be different
times in practice when each of the concurrent powers cease or are
otherwise redefined; does that mean that, as it stands, Clause 45 would
come in all at once on whatever date the Secretary of State determined
after the first date? In fact, there may be a different date for Ofcom
and the CMA or Ofgem and the CMA or the other sector regulators. It
would be heavy work for the Government if they were all to come in at
the same time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:28:10"></hs_TimeCode>,
because there are different considerations in each of the sectors and
there will be some inquiries which are still ongoing and some which
need to be
completed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:28:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:28:26"></hs_TimeCode>.
In any case, we will probably have to return to the substantive issue
on Report to get further clarification—if not to move further
amendments—but it would seem that if all of Clause 45 were
brought in applying to all sectors at the same time, it would be a
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:28:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about proposed new paragraph (f) in Amendment 60AB. This effectively
says that anything that does not happen to be listed here can
nevertheless come into play on the first day after Royal Assent. It
seems, since Her Majesty will be signing them off, that this is getting
fairly close to his late Majesty, King Henry VIII, in that if you do
not specify the date in which various sections come into operation,
then bringing any Section forward to an immediate date—even
though it is not specified in this commencement clause—could
seriously disturb the arrangements of the particular bodies that apply.
For example, if there is a commencement of a particular power to either

important that the Bill specifies that rather than have a catch-all
ability for the Secretary of State, or some future Secretary of State,
to bring any clause into play on the first day. If the noble Viscount
tells me that this is normal, of course I shall withdraw it, but it is
not something that I see in many pieces of legislation. Perhaps he

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, in
the sunset of this Bill, for bringing up these issues, which I regard
as quite technical in terms of the timing. I appreciate what he has
asked and it is obviously my business to get back to him with some
answers. It may help him to know that it is the powers only that will
be commenced on Royal Assent; the substantive provision will come in
separately later. It might help to facilitate the commencement of the 
<?notus-xml column=602?>Bill. That is the reason for it. It should reduce the number of
commencement orders and the commencement dates. It is important for me
to re-emphasise exactly why we are bringing in this issue. However, I
might not have addressed his concerns entirely but I would be more than
happy to take up this matter later and give him a proper response in
writing, with a copy placed in the Library.</hs_para>

resources for the coroners for Wiltshire and Swindon and for
Oxfordshire. This is to prevent a backlog of inquests and to help the
coroners conduct the inquests of fallen service personnel who have been
repatriated to airbases in their districts. RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire
was the airbase for repatriations from 1 April 2007 to 31 August 2011,

above, Budget 2012 introduced a capital gains tax charge on

apply to gains on disposals on or after 6 April 2013. Increases in the

agree with the panel that there is scope for expanding England’s
woodland cover significantly to achieve greater economic, social and
environmental benefits. To deliver this objective, we are working with
partners from across the sector to find new ways of encouraging
landowners to plant more trees where it best suits them and their local
conditions; developing further the voluntary woodland carbon market and
other sources of investment that reflect forestry’s low carbon
credentials; and piloting an initiative to reduce burdens on landowners
who want to plant woodland by clarifying where a full environmental
statement is unlikely to be
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13013130000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131-wms0001.htm#13013130000064">We

we want strong and resilient delivery arrangements that achieve better
quality outcomes for the economy, people and nature. This includes
simplifying our current structures and stepping back from any
unnecessary day-to-day involvement. In addition to establishing the
new, operationally-independent body to hold the public forest estate in
trust for the nation and manage its resources effectively, we will be
reviewing the Government’s wider forestry functions alongside
the triennial review of the Environment Agency and Natural England. We

should not do this alone. Today’s policy statement is the result
of substantial joint work between Defra, the Forestry Commission and
wider government. It draws on numerous positive and productive meetings
we have held with forestry experts, landowners, businesses, civil
society bodies and community groups since July as well as the many
helpful and constructive comments we have received from members of the
public. This underlines the importance of maintaining the spirit of
partnership forged by the panel and the statement concludes by inviting
everyone from across the forestry and woodland sector to commit to

summary, Mr Brown recommended that the Government should look to
continue the existing competitions for Essex Thameside and for the
combined Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise. But in the
light of his wider advice about franchising policy, he also recommended
that the current proposition for the Great Western franchise was not
the right one. I accept those recommendations, and
accordingly:</hs_para><hs_WAIndent>the competition for the Essex
Thameside franchise will be resumed, with a revised
invitation to tender being issued to the existing short-listed bidders
over the summer. This will allow the Government to address important
issues raised by Mr Brown, for example about capital requirements and
the bid evaluation process, while avoiding unnecessary delay. The new
franchise will have a contract term of 15 years, as
announced at the start of the current competition;</hs_WAIndent>
<hs_WAIndent>the competition for the Thameslink, Southern and
Great Northern franchise will also be resumed, with
an invitation to tender being issued to the existing short-listed
bidders. This will be for a seven-year contract term, again as
previously announced. Consistent with Mr Brown’s recommendation,
I expect this to be more of a management-style contract. This different
approach will require more time to develop and test the proposition
with the market, and I will set out the timetable for this competition
in the spring; and</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>having
considered the options for the Great Western franchise very carefully,
and taken account of Mr Brown’s advice, I have

House of Lords administration uses a franking machine that incurs
slightly lower postal costs than using a postage stamp. Since July
2010, House of Lords staff have been encouraged to use 2nd-class
franking wherever possible, whilst recognising the urgency of items
such as parliamentary papers. Since then, there has been an increase in
the use of 2nd-class franking and a decrease in 1st-class franking.
However, it is not possible to estimate how much of a saving this has
produced for two reasons. While the number of items posted is recorded,
the size and weight of individual packages is not, and those factors
would have a significant bearing on the cost. There have also been
increases in postal prices in each of the years listed above, with a
significant rise in April 2012. This makes it difficult to ascertain
how much of a saving has been realised from the increased use of
2nd-class
postage.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13013136000329" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130131w0001.htm#13013136000329">House
