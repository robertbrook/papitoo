Manchester, Sheffield and Bradford have shown the way. They are willing
to do that, which is why we recognise that there will be at least

Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Greg Clark):</Member></B> The
Government have today laid before the House the Financial Services
(Banking Reform) Bill and their response to the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards report, which was published on 21
December 2012 following the commission’s pre-legislative
scrutiny of a draft
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000212">I
thank and pay tribute to the members of both the Independent
Commission on Banking and the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards. The two commissions, whose membership comprises some of the
most distinguished policy makers and formidable intellects in the
world, have between them shaped a set of reforms to British banking
that will lead the world and set an example to other countries in the
seriousness, radicalism and meticulousness of the changes that are
proposed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000213">The
Bill published today reflects their painstaking work and the Government
have accepted almost all their recommendations. The reforms address
what the Chancellor has called the British dilemma—how Britain
can be a leading global financial centre with more than its fair share
of international trade in financial services while at the same time not
exposing ordinary working people in this country to the catastrophic
risks of banks
failing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000214">The
reforms were and are necessary because the previous regime was tested
and failed. UK taxpayers had to bail out the banks with £65
billion of the hard-earned money of ordinary working people, while
those who had taken a one-way bet with that money slunk away, losing
nothing more than their jobs, and sometimes not even that. The anger
that the country feels about what happened must be channelled into
change to reset Britain’s banking system. The objective of the
Bill—proposed by Vickers and endorsed by the
commission—is that any failure of any bank in future should not
impose a cost on the taxpayer and not interrupt for a second vital
banking services. That is a high ambition, but one that is appropriate
for a country with the reputation for financial stability and
confidence, which has for centuries been one of Britain’s chief
assets in the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000215">As
is well known, the Bill will erect a ring fence around the
core operations of banks headquartered and regulated in the UK. Within
that ring fence, banks must be completely insulated from activities
such as using depositors’ funds to speculate for the
banks’ own benefit in capital
markets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000216">As
a result of the commission’s recommendations, the Government are
making a number of further changes to the Bill. First, in the acute
phrase of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie), which
will permanently enter the lexicon of banking, the ring fence will be
“electrified”. The regulator will be given the power to
order the full separation of any bank that attempts to undermine the
ring fence. Directors of the 
<?notus-xml column=24?>banks will be personally responsible for ensuring that their banks
comply with the ring-fencing rules, and the Prudential Regulatory
Authority will conduct an annual review of the operation and adequacy
of the ring-fence
rules.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000217">Secondly,
there are explicit provisions on the face of the Bill for the
principal aspects of ring-fencing, including that there should be
separate boards of directors, remuneration arrangements, treasury
management operations, balance sheet management and human resource
management of ring-fenced
banks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000218">Thirdly,
the Bill gives us an opportunity to make an historic change in the
competitive environment in UK banking. Competition is essential to
ensure that customers benefit from innovation and from demanding
customer service and efficiency from their banks. That has not always
been customers’ experience in the past. As well as bringing in a
seven-day automatic account switching service from September this year,
the Government will take steps to tackle the cosy arrangement whereby
the banks determine how payment systems will be run. Why should it be
necessary in 2013 for a cheque to take six days to clear, with the
banks and not the customers scooping up the interest on the balances
during the delay? Why should a new bank have to beg an incumbent bank
for permission to use their payment system? We will therefore require
access to payment services that are fair, reasonable and transparent.
The commission has rightly emphasised the importance of competition,
and I am grateful to it for propelling that drive further, as I
am to my hon. Friend the Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea
Leadsom) for what she has done on greater competition in banking, which
has been a personal crusade of
hers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000219">The
fourth and final change is that more parliamentary scrutiny will be
built into the secondary legislation that implements what is a
high-level Bill. Drafts of the principal statutory instruments to be
made will be made available to the House before Second Reading, and the
Government accept the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee on the type of scrutiny each should
receive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000220">These
are historic reforms, but it is appropriate that, in our
country—directly and indirectly, 2 million people work in the
industry, it is our biggest export earner, and contributes £1 in
every £8 of our tax revenue—we take the steps necessary
to restore confidence in, and to, an industry that has fallen so far.

the weeks and months

in a week when all this 
<?notus-xml column=25?>suggests we should be getting serious about real reform, what has the
Chancellor said in his seaside speech today? He has fudged the tough
stance recommended by the Vickers report, and has stopped short on
backstop powers and legislation for the leverage ratio envisaged by the
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, a commission that the
Chancellor himself agreed to set up last summer.</hs_Para>

have to ask the Minister: why then does it feel as though the
Chancellor has to be dragged kicking and screaming towards serious
reform? Is it because, despite all the rhetoric and feigned concern,
the Government know they face certain defeat in the House of Lords on
the sensible recommendations of the parliamentary commission, and so
think it best to try and salvage something from what is in reality a
strategic retreat? Why will the Minister not legislate for a full
reserve power for total separation of retail and investment banking if
ring-fencing does not work, something that we called for last year and
the commission specifically recommended? Surely it would be sensible to
legislate now, not just if one or two individual banks misbehave, but
in case ring-fencing fails the sector as a whole. He may think he has
found a cunning ploy, but stopping short with only half the backstop
powers just means that they are unlikely to be used. Corporate lawyers
across the City will be rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect
of taking on the regulator on a case-by-case basis. Worse still, why is
he ducking the main conclusion of the Vickers report? Specifically, why
is he refusing to adopt the commission’s recommendations on the
leverage ratio and rein in the over-exposure of banks whose excessive
risk-taking caused the problems in the first place?</hs_Para>

there not be a clause in the Bill so that regulators can restrain such
hazardous behaviour? Does the Minister agree that the implementation of
the Bill needs a full parliamentary review on a regular basis, with
genuine scrutiny of detailed secondary legislation on exactly how
ring-fencing will work in practice? If the commission recommends a
tougher code of conduct for bankers, proper professional qualifications
and a fiduciary duty of care for customers, together with stronger
controls on bonuses and remuneration, will he accept its judgment in
the Bill?</hs_Para>

Gentleman, with whom I am happy to work on the details, will be able to
make some more substantial reflections than those he has offered the

brass neck to table an urgent question on banking reform is almost
unbelievable. At no point in 13 years of power did they show a
scintilla of urgency in facing up to, never mind solving, the
catastrophic absence of banking reform that led to the financial 
<?notus-xml column=26?>crisis being particularly damaging to this country. The failure of the
botched regulatory system they introduced in 1997 has played a large
part in the burden that the ordinary working people of this country are
still having to shoulder today to bail out the banks. They were in
office after the crisis, too. Even then they did nothing urgent apart
from hurriedly plunge their heads in the sand to hope that the
nightmare would pass.</hs_Para>

Bank of England the power to split up the whole banking system. One of

the power to break up any individual bank is a very strong
one, and quite rightly, as the commission recommended, it would make
the ring fence more impenetrable. Nevertheless, to provide for a
reserve power in this Bill that would change the whole system would, in
effect, be a different policy. I understand the reasons for wanting to
do that, as many distinguished members of the commission do, but
changing the whole policy would deserve the scrutiny of a Bill of its

were relieved that the FSA proposals of last week will result in
compensation for the affected businesses within a rapid time frame.
What happened is totally unacceptable, and is another feature of the
scandalous decline in reputation that the banks have suffered. Small
businesses in particular have a right to regard their bank manager as
someone who acts in their interests, rather than someone who flogs them
dodgy products that they do not need in the first place. That is a

Secretary of State for International Development (Justine
Greening):</Member></B> With your permission, Mr Speaker, I would like
to update the House on the United Kingdom’s response to the
humanitarian crisis in the Syrian region. On 30 January, I attended the
UN high level humanitarian pledging conference on Syria in Kuwait. The
conference was co-hosted by the Emir of Kuwait and the United Nations
Secretary-General, and had two objectives. The first was to raise the
international profile of the deepening humanitarian crisis unfolding
across the Syrian region. The second was to secure $1.5 billion of
urgently needed funding requested by the UN to meet the humanitarian
needs it has seen until June 2013—that represents the largest
ever short-term appeal by the
UN.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000286">The
pledging conference took place at a critical point in the Syria crisis.
The humanitarian needs across the region are immense and show no signs
of decreasing while the fighting continues. I would like to set out
some of the numbers for the House, which illustrate the severity of the
situation: 743,000—nearly three quarters of a million—is
the number of Syrians who have had to seek refuge outside their
country; 4 million is the number of people still in need in Syria; 2
million is the number of people displaced in Syria; 60,000 is the
number of Syrians killed in the conflict so far; and 26 is the number
of aid workers who have been killed in Syria while helping those in
desperate
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000287">During
my visit to Jordan just over a week ago, I was able to meet some of the
people affected by the crisis. Walking through the Za’atari
refugee camp and meeting families who had welcomed refugees into their
homes, I was heartened by the scope of the humanitarian response, and
by the resilience of mind and spirit shown by the people I met. The
people of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and now Egypt are showing
tremendous generosity, supporting the hundreds of thousands of people
who have fled the violence. It is essential that the Governments of
those countries receive adequate support for their efforts from the
international
community.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000288" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000288">I
also commend the UN for its strong leadership of the
international humanitarian response and the partnerships it has built.
Its efforts have kept thousands of people sheltered and fed every month
in contested, Government and opposition-held areas in Syria, and more
than a million children protected against life-threatening diseases
such as measles and polio. Those achievements are a reminder of the
UN’s capacity and reach, if given adequate political and
financial support, and demonstrate that the UK’s confidence in
the multilateral aid system has not been
misplaced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000289" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000289">At
the Kuwait conference, I announced another £50
million of new UK aid towards the UN appeals. That was in addition to
the £21 million that I announced on 26 January during my visit
to Jordan—£10 million of which was specifically for
Jordan— and brings the UK’s total humanitarian support
for the response to the Syria crisis to £139.5 million. I am
very pleased to report the successful outcome of the conference. As
well as the UK, more than 60 countries participated in the pledging
conference and raised over $1.5 billion, exceeding the UN’s
target. I welcome the generosity that was shown by donors, particularly
those from the Gulf region; Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab 
<?notus-xml column=36?>Emirates together pledged $900 million. I should
take this opportunity to again thank the Emir of Kuwait for hosting
such an important
conference.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000290" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000290">I
also commend my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary for the support
provided by his Department in lobbying donor countries to attend and
pledge funds at the Kuwait conference. The next priority for my
Department is to see that those pledges are turned into tangible
commitments so that the humanitarian agencies can scale up their
activities and provide the food, shelter, health and medical care that
are so urgently needed by the millions of men, women and children
affected by the crisis. However, although the Kuwait
conference was a success, we must be realistic. The more
than $1.5 billion raised, although a great sum, will support
the humanitarian response only until June. The Syrian people will
still need help long after that, and the shocking level of
human suffering inside and outside Syria will keep rising while the
conflict
continues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:15:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000291" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000291">A
political settlement is sorely needed. The UK remains steadfast in our
support for the joint UN and Arab League special representative,
Lakhdar Brahimi, in his work towards a political settlement and
transition process. It is also vital that the UN-led humanitarian
response be given agreement for increased access to all areas of the
country, including the ability to reach people in need across conflict
lines and from neighbouring countries if necessary. Until this happens,
pockets of need will persist despite the UN’s best efforts. The
dire humanitarian situation deserves the continued attention and
support of this Government, and I commit my Department to that effort.

electricity. The harsh winter has compounded their suffering and many
are living in shelters lacking adequate insulation with no
winter clothes and no blankets. Even those who still have homes are

of fuel and electricity. With the UN estimating that the number of

clarify where she expects those additional resources to be focused? As
she has acknowledged, aid to Syria is a question of not only funding
but humanitarian access and respect for international humanitarian law.
Donors have repeatedly raised concerns about support reaching all areas
of the country. There is limited capacity and expertise in both
Government-held and opposition-held areas, with the conflict’s

reaches people across Syria, including agreed cross-line and

are also being asked about a strategic response to refugees.
As the right hon. Lady has acknowledged, thousands of Syrians are
arriving in neighbouring countries every day, yet the humanitarian
system does not have the capacity to keep up with the growing demands
on registration, co-ordination or shelter. The UN estimates that only
20% of Syrian refugees are in camps. What steps is the Department
taking to develop a strategic plan with the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees that ensures that the needs of all refugees

has taken a brutal toll on Syrians, more than 60,000 of whom have been
killed. Those who have fled report stories of ongoing violence and
human rights violations, including sexual abuse, arbitrary detention
and indiscriminate shelling. A report by the International Rescue
Committee identifies rape and sexual violence as primary factors in the
decision of many Syrians to flee. Given that disturbing revelation,
will the Secretary of State assure the House that UK aid will focus on
the protection of women against sexual violence?

Greening:</Member></B> I very much appreciate the way in which the
shadow Secretary of State approached his response. There was a huge
effort across the international community to make sure that the donor
conference was a success, and the UK certainly did as much as it could
to try to make sure that that was the case.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Gentleman asked how the funds would be spent. The £50 million
that we donated at the conference will sit 
<?notus-xml column=38?>alongside the UN co-ordinated response to the
humanitarian crisis. Of the requested $1.5 billion, about $1 billion
goes to helping refugees outside Syria, and about £0.5 billion
of that is planned to help people still suffering inside Syria. In
relation to how we can make sure that we reach the many parts of Syria
that are difficult to get to, we have to take the opportunities, and we
work through humanitarian partners all the time. They are neutral and
impartial but never the less have the ability to go into parts of Syria
that are often contested. Some of them are Government-controlled, some
opposition-controlled, but others are still contested, and as I said in
my statement, they are dangerous places. We therefore support those
humanitarian agencies. When I talk to the people who head up the World
Food Programme, for example, they are clear that they have to take
opportunities when they arise. They often find a contact whom they
believe is trustworthy, and through them can gain access to a new area,
and they will take that opportunity. They have to be prepared to act
very quickly and flexibly. We support them in doing so, and the main
concern for them in recent weeks has been funding, which is why the
donor conference was so important.</hs_Para>

for what the UK has done directly in Syria, we have provided medical
support. We have trained—I think I am right in saying—250
health workers, and we have helped open about 130 mobile medical units
that provide care. We are also providing food and shelter wherever we
can. The UN Security Council has called for the Syrian authorities to
provide full, immediate and unimpeded access to all areas of Syria so
that humanitarian support can get through. That is absolutely vital,
and we urge the opposition forces to allow unimpeded access for
humanitarian actors. It is critical, if we are to be able to use that
$1.5 billion effectively, that we make sure that we have the routes to
get through to the people who need our support.</hs_Para>

different from many others with which the Department deals. Often we
are dealing with a natural disaster, and people act to tackle the
aftermath. This is a humanitarian crisis that has unfolded over many
months and seems likely to continue to unfold over a prolonged period.
It may be that we have not seen the worst of the humanitarian crisis in
relation to Syria, which is why it is vital that Assad goes, and goes
now, so that the work to rebuild Syria can

are talking with the UNHCR and other humanitarian bodies about how we
can make sure that we are set up to deal with a crisis that could
become significantly worse in the coming months if the violence
continues. As I said in my statement, there are 2 million internally
displaced people within Syria. Many of the refugees with whom I spoke a
couple of weekends ago had tried their best to stay in Syria. They had
moved from Homs to a different place, to a different place again and so
on, but were finally left with no choice but to leave Syria. If just a
fraction of the 2 million internally displaced people end up having to
leave Syria and become refugees, we will see a dramatic increase in the
humanitarian problems outside Syria. That is why the donor

can assure the hon. Gentleman that we are looking at how we can make
sure that we are positioned to take care of those people. For
neighbouring countries such 
<?notus-xml column=39?>as Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey, the strain and the pressure put on
them are immense. We should always bear that in mind when we are
looking at the support that we provide. As he rightly pointed out, most
of the refugees in Jordan, for example, are not in camps but in host
communities. When I was in Jordan I was told that the local education
system has had to absorb 22,000 children who arrived with
refugee families. There are significant challenges ahead, which is why

We have been particularly concerned to make sure that we have supported
children. One in five of the people turning up at the Za’atari
refugee camp that I visited was a child aged four or under. Nearly 60%
of the refugees who have turned up at that camp were 30 or under.
Alongside others, we are providing clinical care and
counselling to women and we are helping to provide education to
children. We are also providing specific support to about 1,800 women
we believe are at risk of possibly being coerced into marriage. We are
therefore providing support to them to ensure, wherever possible, that
that does not happen. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that my right

no Assad as part of it. I therefore come back to my earlier comments

making sure that target was met by Gulf nations. Not only did Kuwait
generously host the conference but key Gulf nations such as the United

contribution at the donor conference. The most important thing that we
would like to achieve with Russia and China is a breakthrough that
would enable us to have a UN Security Council resolution, which would
be similar to the approach taken in Mali, where it was possible to take
action as a result of a consensus across the international spectrum.
That UN Security Council resolution cannot be passed at the moment,
which, critically, makes it much more complex for us to be able to
reach people inside Syria with humanitarian aid. It also makes it much
more complex to start the political and diplomatic dialogue needed to
reach a long-term settlement. That is what is needed and I am

saying that it supported humanitarian aid getting into Syria. However,
we have been clear, as has the international community, that the Syrian
authorities and opposition should ensure that humanitarian workers have
totally unimpeded access to help the 4 million people who are still in
Syria. Many of those people are in areas that are still contested. It
has been very challenging to ensure that there is coverage across the
entire country. There are times when the humanitarian agencies have
made progress and then, owing to the conflict, have had to pull back.
The situation is challenging, and we need the international community

hope that the Home Secretary would come to the House and give an

fact that the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill will not be committed to

miles from you—that, although I can table a motion to commit the
Bill to the whole House, as I have done, it cannot be debated. Even if
Her Majesty’s Opposition or a majority of Members table such a
motion, the only people who can commit a Bill to the whole House are
the Government. Is that not a democratic lacuna? Is there not something
wrong with our procedures? We are faced with an important Bill and
constitutional issues concerning the established Church, but nobody

once the Government have tabled a motion on the matter he has in mind,
another motion cannot be considered before or alongside it. The matter
in question is catered for—albeit very unsatisfactorily in the

decision of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, about the European

commissioners would be reduced to a number corresponding to two thirds
of the member states. However, a concession was made to assuage Irish
sentiments during the Irish referendum on the Lisbon treaty. The
concession was that each member state would continue to have one
commissioner. To enable that commitment to come into effect, it is

three draft decisions are the first such decisions to be brought before
this House under the European Union Act 2011. I would like to make a
few remarks about that legislation. We welcome the fact that the
agreement of Parliament is being sought on these decisions. Although we
had reservations during the passage of the 2011 Act about the
possibility of referendums being held on a multiplicity of relatively
small issues, we strongly supported referendums being held on issues of
constitutional significance. We also strongly supported a bigger role
for Parliament, both in scrutinising European legislation and actual
decision making. That is why we did not oppose the European Union Bill
or divide the House on it.</hs_Para>

a constitutional sense, the decisions before us are important because
two of the three were made at European level under article 352 of the
treaty on the functioning of the European Union—the so-called
flexibility clause—which allows the EU to act on a subject for
which there is no specific treaty base. The clause has understandably
been a cause for concern among parliamentarians across the political
spectrum, not only in this country. Indeed, I recall that, when I was a
member of the European Scrutiny Committee, a great deal of time was
spent deliberating on the issue, and a good report was produced on
it.</hs_Para>

European decisions satisfied the exemption requirements of the 2011 EU

that after the European Scrutiny Committee and its indomitable

shall comment briefly on each of the draft decisions covered by the
Bill. The first decision relates to the Official Journal of the
European Union. The EU has produced the OJ in printed form since 1958,
and it has been available in its electronic format since 1998. The
journal is made up of two series and one supplement. It contains
information about the treaties and about the judgments of the European
Court of Justice. Crucially, its “S series” supplement
also provides invitations to tender for contracts and is therefore an
important part of the mechanism that enables the single market to
function and develop. As we all know, the single market is vital to the
British economy.</hs_Para>

also need to take into account a relatively recent court ruling to
ensure that online electronic versions of the Official Journal of the
European Union have parity with the paper versions. I refer Members to
case C-161/06, which involved a company called Skoma-Lux in the Czech
Republic. After being fined for infringing customs legislation, the
company, which operated in the fine wine import sector, brought an
action for the cancellation of the fine before the regional court in
Ostrava. I am sure that Members will be fascinated to hear that the
claimant was an importer of the red dessert wine, Kagor VK, into the
Czech Republic. The wine was made from grape juice, with added sugar
and corn spirit —<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> You have

that there is time to do so.</hs_Para>

the deliberations in the regional court, the matter was referred to the
European Court of Justice, particularly in relation to the
interpretation of article 58 of the 2003 Act of Accession, regarding
whether that provision allowed the enforcement of a Community
regulation that had not been published in the Official Journal of the
European Union<I> </I>in the language of a 
<?notus-xml column=54?>member state. The Court went on to state that publication on the
internet did not equate to proper publication. That is why we need
clarification of that point today. In case there is concern about
digitalisation, I am assured that it will be covered under heading 5 of
a multi-annual financial framework budget allocation and that, as the
Minister said, there will be no extra cost.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020412000398" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0002.htm#13020412000398"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T17:19:33"></hs_TimeCode>The
second draft decision relates to the Fundamental Rights Agency. The
previous multi-annual framework for the FRA expired at the end of last
year. After consultation, the European Council proposed extending and
developing the FRA’s work in a number of thematic areas. In May
last year, the Justice and Home Affairs Council reached political
agreement for there to be nine areas of work. These included access to
justice, victims of crime and compensation for crime victims,
children’s rights, racism, xenophobia and related intolerance.
Opposition Members believe that the agency is extremely useful in
assessing the impact of legislation not only in current EU member
states, but in applicant countries. We therefore support the draft
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T17:20:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020412000399" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0002.htm#13020412000399">The
third decision relates to the number of EU commissioners. This is
perhaps the most significant of the proposals in the Bill. As I
indicated a few moments ago, this draft decision maintains the number
of commissioners at one per member state. I of course welcome the fact
that the people of Ireland voted yes in 2009, and I am pleased that
they felt able to do so. This change will, it has to be said, ensure
that all member states will feel that they are fully represented in all
the EU’s principal institutions, which can only be a good
thing.</hs_Para>

would be wrong to give the impression, however, that there is no need
to change the way in which the Commission functions. There is a need
and a case for examining whether there should be a degree of seniority
within the college of commissioners, and a case can be made for
examining the allocation of portfolios within the Commission. As the
shadow Foreign Secretary has argued, there needs to be a commissioner
with the specific responsibility for stimulating growth and job
creation.</hs_Para>

in recent debates on the European Union, Members have referred to the
need for national Parliaments to have a stronger voice and a stronger
involvement. Despite its shortcomings, the European Union
Act 2011 does to some extent address this issue, but let us
not forget that one of the most positive aspects of the Lisbon treaty,
which Labour secured, was the introduction of a so-called yellow card
procedure. This needs to be strengthened so that this Parliament, along
with other national Parliaments, really does fulfil a central role in
EU decision making. Subsidiarity means that decisions ought to be taken
at the most appropriate level—as close to the people as
possible. That is a sound democratic principle, and it ought to be the
cornerstone of how we approach the European Union. To make that vision
a reality, it will be necessary to ensure that national
Parliaments—and this Parliament in particular—play a
central role in determining what should be decided and at what level of
government.</hs_Para>

thought it might be wise to explain why it is important to discuss
these matters. Because the European Union Act 2011 has brought
today’s debate forward on the basis that Parliament is required
to pass an Act to approve the relatively low-level EU decisions in
clause 1, it might make it look as though those decisions
are of no consequence and do not need to be talked about. As both the
Minister and the shadow Minister said, however, these are quite
important matters, and some other member states find them amazingly
important.</hs_Para>

the Lisbon treaty when Germany was seeking to ratify the treaty.
Specifically, it considered the question of whether the article, which

used in these cases, the proposed decisions must be approved by an Act
of Parliament. That is what we are doing today. Although certain
proposals based on the EU flexibility clause are exempt from the
requirement for an approving Act of Parliament, those exemptions do not
apply in these cases. I will happily go into the details if Members

down the number of languages they use, and they do so purely to keep

I have been provoked into speaking by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris), with whom I frequently agree on
European matters, but on this one I disagree. It is very important
indeed to retain one member of the Commission for every
member state, and I see a parallel in the American Senate,
where states, however large or small, have two senators. If
New York, California and Texas began to get together to say,
“Well, Delaware and Rhode Island will no longer have
senators,” there would be all sorts of problems. I am sure that
there are other ways of overcoming the problems of
inefficiency—perhaps with departmental arrangements for more
than one commissioner in Departments that are particularly big, as we
do in our own Government: we have more than one Minister per
Department.</hs_Para>

exists with qualified majority voting, and on many voting issues,
different countries have different weights. It is important that, at
the highest level, every individual country has their say, just as in
the American constitution, every state, however small, has a say at the
top table. It is important, too, to have the occasional bit of grit in
the oyster. Small states, as well as large states, can occasionally
become disagreeable, and I think that being disagreeable is part of the
essence of democracy. Having a machine dominated by bureaucracy and
officials who just go along with it is not healthy for democracy. I
have many criticisms of the European Union, and I have been very
critical of the secrecy with which the Commission operates. I hope we
will always preserve a single member per state as the method of
composition of the Commission, even if we make some different
arrangements for how it
works<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020434000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0002.htm#13020434000012">Another
factor in all this is who the commissioners are. I like to think that
from time to time we as the British people might appoint a commissioner
whose first loyalty is to the interests of British people, and who
reflects their views as well as their interests. Their views may
sometimes be awkward and may certainly be grit in the European oyster.
That would be right.</hs_Para>

to time conclaves of Commission officials get together to allocate
dodgy 
<?notus-xml column=61?>portfolios, in particular the portfolio of
Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, to weaker
members. I know that there is always the worry that a commissioner
might turn out to be a bit of a trade unionist, a bit of a leftist.
That would be very dangerous. We must have someone who knows that the
market and employers come first. Above all, we must make
sure that profits come first, not the interests of working
people<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020434000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0002.htm#13020434000014">Who
is appointed as a commissioner for each member state and which
portfolio they are given are very important matters. I hope we will see
to it that at least Britain has commissioners for the foreseeable

interests of the British people as they see them. I hope also that we
get appropriate portfolios, and that the small countries that might be

substance of the Bill relates to three measures, two of which are
completely uncontentious—the e-publication of the Journal and
the business plan, effectively, of the Fundamental Rights Agency. Other
hon. Members are right that the third measure is worth 
<?notus-xml column=62?>more substantial debate, as it adjusts a mechanism that was supposed to
limit the size and endless growth of the Commission. There are a number
of issues that that growth has raised. It was not simply the
practicality of having an ever-increasing number of commissioners.
Without being unkind to some of the smaller member states, we know that
there is a bit of a capacity issue in terms of their ability to produce
candidates of sufficient calibre for a portfolio that affects the
entire continent. Moreover, in terms of public perception, it slightly
muddies the whole idea of the Commission. The Commission should be, in
essence, the equivalent of our civil service. It should be the servant
of the Council of Ministers, the various European ministerial councils
and the European Parliament, and not pretend to be a representative

is a major political issue to which people attach a great deal of

accountability and scrutiny to European legislation in this place, and

agreement between the Conservative and Liberal Democrat wings of the

point. On the first part, I disagree with him. The form in which
instructions are sent out is important, and it is right that people
should know about it. It is a long-standing principle of our law that
ignorance of the law is no excuse. If that is fair, it is also
fair that knowledge of the law should be made available to people in a
timely and efficient way, because it is something that might affect
their lives, and that when a change to the method of notification takes
place, that should be debated in this Chamber and passed into law.

the change from article 308 of the previous treaty to article 352 of

wish briefly to discuss the number of commissioners. I do not have the
confidence that some hon. Members have in our commissioners, and I do
not feel happy that we have one representing us. Commissioners take an
oath that they will act in the best interests of the European Union.
Some have argued that that is directly contrary to the oath that they
have taken as Privy Counsellors, and we should be concerned about that.
They are there, by design, to represent the interests of Europe, not of
the United Kingdom. Perhaps because of our history and our civic
traditions, our commissioners tend to take that very seriously, whereas
commissioners from some other countries may simply represent
the nation state that has sent them. I do not have great
confidence that the person representing the United Kingdom is waving
the Union Jack; they could just as well be waving that awful European

want to address the question of Ireland and the specifics of what it
was given to persuade it—bully it, perhaps—to ratify the
Lisbon treaty. That shows—I think that this strengthens the
Prime Minister’s renegotiation position—that countries
can renegotiate with the EU for things that they feel they need when
discussions are being held in the European Councils. That is an
important point. We have often heard people say, “The Prime
Minister can go off to Europe, but they will not give him anything.
It’s too bad: you’ve just got to like it or lump
it.” Actually, the European Union, for all its many faults, is a
fundamentally pragmatic body in how it gets agreement among member
states. It does a lot of horse trading, one way or another, to get
agreements. I do not know whether the

crucial issues, such as the future number of European commissioners and

We have heard much about  the 2011 Act. I opposed it during
many of its stages, because I believed that although it had a so-called
referendum lock, in practice it would not deal with the kinds of things
we are now besieged with, particularly those measures that are being
introduced into the political 
<?notus-xml column=66?>core of Europe—the eurozone—that affect the United Kingdom
but that, because they do not refer to the United Kingdom, do not
require a referendum, however significant their impact on the United
Kingdom. In fact, the European Scrutiny Committee, which I have the
honour to chair, produced a report on that very question and we remain
extremely concerned about the effect of allowing legislation to go
through without a referendum on the specious grounds that a transfer of
powers is not taking place. This is not just about a transfer of

the European Commission, helped to make the legislation better. We
helped to guarantee that there would be primary legislation and that,

vote against it, that would raise the very question that was embedded
in the White Paper of 1971, which led to the passing of the 1972 Act.
Under section 2 of that Act, we must implement all decisions that have
been decided in the Council of Ministers, irrespective of any other
factors. Under section 3, we must agree to all decisions of the

the context of the Prime Minister’s speech— I
welcome his comments on the referendum, although I think it

which I endorse. However, could Parliament veto the provisions that it
covers if we did not want them to go through? We should be allowed to
do so, and that will be part of the inquiry that the European Scrutiny
Committee is now conducting. It is difficult to justify to the British
people the fact that if they vote in a general election to have certain
legislation implemented, they can then find that it is all decided in
the Council of Ministers, where 
<?notus-xml column=70?>91.7% of votes go in favour of European proposals. That brings up the

expanded them, and I tabled an amendment at the time suggesting,
“Nothing in this Act shall derogate from the sovereignty of the
United Kingdom Parliament”. I was then advised by the

18 months ago when I chaired the committee on migration, refugees and
displaced persons at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of
Europe, I was lucky enough to be invited by the Fundamental Rights
Agency to address a conference in the centre of Warsaw. To my
incredulity, I found that a whole 40-storey hotel in the centre of
Warsaw was taken up with guests of the Fundamental Rights Agency who,
on inquiry, had all had their expenses paid by that agency and had come
from all over Europe, and beyond, to discuss issues relating to
fundamental rights.

out from Afghanistan—he is an Afghan national—and that he
had paid smugglers $8,000 to get across Iran and Turkey. He wanted to
go from Turkey across the Aegean sea and on to the Italian eastern
seaboard so that he could make his way to the United Kingdom. I
inquired about that and asked why he wanted 
<?notus-xml column=74?>to go to London. He replied that it was because he had been there for
five years until a few months ago, and that he had lots of friends in
London who had paid the $8,000 for his return trip. He had been
deported from the United Kingdom after playing our system for about
five years, and within a few weeks of getting back to Afghanistan this

for that man, the boat from Turkey foundered—I suppose it is
fortunate that the Greek coastguard rescued him and he was not
drowned—and he found himself in the detention centre, but the
Greek authorities had no way of returning him back to Afghanistan,
because Afghanistan does not accept anyone in Greece who emanated from
Afghanistan. If he is detained in Greece for the maximum of 18 months,
he will be released and will join all those other people in
Greece—this also happens in Italy—who do not belong or do
not necessarily wish to stay there, which contributes to feelings of

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T18:48:35"></hs_TimeCode> Minister for

draft decision to give legally binding effect to the online version of

necessity to ensure that arrangements are in place for an electronic

well into the 21st century—even if some hon. Members might wish
to dispute this, or wish to go back in time—and given that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T18:49:40"></hs_TimeCode> Minister for
Policing and Criminal Justice reminded us, with a little help, that
there are 27 member states of the EU and 23 official languages
published on a daily basis, the proposal for an online legal version
might have been made earlier. We welcome the decision and support the
Government in signing up to it. We are sure that it will facilitate a
more efficient and economical legal publication and communication of
legislation, other adopted Acts, information and notices, European
Court of Justice judgments and invitations to tender for contracts.
Given the climate change legislation we passed in government and the EU
targets we have signed up to, I hope that printing fewer paper versions
of the Official Journal will go some way to contributing to reaching
those targets.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T18:53:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stone that this issue has been debated over and over again, not
least during the most recent treaty change. It is an issue of great
sensitivity for both small and large member states. The Lisbon treaty
provided that from 2014—in other words, from the next European
Commission—the number of European Commissioners should be
two-thirds the number of member states. That was the position we came
to at the end of the negotiations on the Lisbon treaty. However, as we
know, Ireland asked for a change to this provision, and a guarantee
that each member state would keep its commissioner in the years to
come.</hs_Para>

hon. Members have said, there are two sides to this argument. Some
argue that it is too cumbersome, unwieldy and inefficient to have one
commissioner per member state, especially given that the EU is now
composed of 27 member states—soon to be 28 later this year.
Arguments have been put forward, particularly powerfully by smaller
member states, that having one commissioner for each member state is
the only way to secure equality. That is the Republic of
Ireland’s position.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T18:55:05"></hs_TimeCode> the Minister
for Policing and Criminal Justice said in his opening speech, there is
a case for looking at the possibility of introducing some degree of
seniority in the college of commissioners. We have also advocated the
creation of a growth commissioner in the Commission.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T18:49:22"></hs_TimeCode> the
explanatory notes set out—this relates to the intervention made
by the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T18:55:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for The Cotswolds (Geoffrey Clifton-Brown)—the draft
decision will not apply beyond 2019, and will cease to apply if the EU
reaches 30 or more member states, whichever comes earlier. My best
guess is the former.</hs_Para>

certainly still live, sensitive and controversial. I am sure it will be
the subject of ongoing debate in years to come, so I do not think
today’s debate in this House is the end of the matter. We will
have to see which direction the debate takes. There are two sides of 
<?notus-xml column=78?>the argument and we want to respect the
sensitivities of smaller member states. That being said, I met the
Danish ambassador earlier. She reminded me that Denmark’s
position during the Lisbon treaty negotiations was that although it
preferred to have its own commissioner, it was willing to give that
up—not permanently, but on a rotating basis—if
that meant that the European Commission and its college of
commissioners could operate in a more efficient manner. I therefore
think that this will be considered before we get to the 30th
member state or beyond, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned.</hs_Para>

I am grateful to all hon. Members who have spoken and contributed to

hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood). I am grateful
to him for his support for the Bill. When he started speaking, I
wondered where he was going on the lack of necessity for scrutiny of
these important aspects emanating from the EU, but I think he came full
circle and, in the end, supported scrutiny. He will no doubt intervene
if I have misinterpreted his remarks. I was also slightly perplexed by
his comments about the capacity of smaller EU countries to manage a
commissioner. Many small EU countries’ commissioners
have made a significant contribution to the EU, and I am sure they will
do so in the next period.</hs_Para>

absolutely right, yet again, to highlight the importance of scrutiny, 
<?notus-xml column=80?>to recognise the vital role of the European Scrutiny
Committee—a theme to which I shall return in a moment

any powers brought forward must be agreed unanimously by the Council

and therefore for the required unanimity to be secured, the UK
Parliament must first give its approval.

two facts in order to add to the debate that he will clearly have in

agree to a plan without which we would have much less
control over its work. His example of wasting EU taxpayers’
money in the way he alluded to is sadly not the only example he could
have given. This is not a new agency, and the funds flow from the EU
budget, which, as he will know, is under intense scrutiny and pressure
from my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in order to ensure that UK
taxpayers’ money is spent wisely and for the purposes for which
it was intended—an ethos that I know he supports very

ensures that Parliament has a key role in agreeing three decisions

negotiations on the work plan for the EU’s Fundamental Rights
Agency. The electronic version of the Official Journal is faster and
more economical than the current, print version. Agreeing to this
decision backs the Government’s calls for a more efficient
European Union. Agreeing to maintain the number of EU Commissioners
will mean that the UK will be guaranteed a commissioner when the next

reason at all why we cannot have the normal arrangements, whereby three
hours is allocated to private business between 4 o’clock and 7

past, they have sometimes resulted in the private business continuing
beyond 7 o’clock and the people promoting and speaking to that
business being criticised by the Whips and colleagues for keeping the
House late. The private business should be taken between 4
o’clock and 7 o’clock, and if the business managers so
arrange things that they cannot deal with the other business before 4
o’clock and the private business has to continue after 7
o’clock, so be it. Obviously I am not going to divide the House
on this matter this evening, but I put people on notice that
if on Wednesday the private business continues beyond 7
o’clock and people start bellyaching about it, I hope they will

asks us all each year to be aware that genocidal persecution on
religious and ethnic grounds is not simply an appalling past event but
an ever-present danger that we have to be aware of. The persecution of
the Hazara community, in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan, is
undoubtedly persecution for religious and ethnic reasons—it
bears those strong hallmarks—and that is the issue I want to

do not want to pretend that I have long been aware of the history and
plight of Hazaras; the truth is that I was not. Beyond some references
to the community in novels such as “The Kite Runner” and
an awareness of the small—about 150—but distinctive
community in Southampton, of whom I had met a few, I had relatively
little knowledge of the Hazara community.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T19:18:52"></hs_TimeCode>As a group, the
Hazaras are physically quite distinctive, with somewhat Mongolian
looks, and that distinctive appearance has helped to contribute to
their vulnerability in
Pakistan.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020434000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0003.htm#13020434000179">I
did not <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T19:19:12"></hs_TimeCode>know a
great deal about the history and the plight of the Hazara community
until a group of my constituents came to see me earlier this year. The
story they told me truly appalled me. Theirs is a long history, and I
will not attempt to rehearse it here tonight. Suffice it to say that
the community originated in central Asia, in the Afghan central
highlands. The Hazaras converted to Shi’a Islam in the 13th
century, and while the majority remain Shi’a, there are now
Sunnis, Ismailis and secular members of the
community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T19:19:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020434000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0003.htm#13020434000180">Persecution
of the Hazara community by Afghan rulers started, I am afraid, under
the British Empire, and it has been a consistent problem in
Afghanistan ever since. Many Hazaras have left Afghanistan,
and over 100 years ago many settled in and around Quetta, which in due
course became part of Pakistan. We are all familiar with the recent
waves of refugees from Afghanistan to Pakistan, some of whom have
eventually made their way here, where they have sought and
been granted asylum.</hs_Para>

the Hazaras that I am talking about today are part of that much
longer-established community in Quetta who are not refugees but
Pakistani citizens. For a long time, they lived free from persecution
in Quetta, thriving educationally and economically. As citizens, they
are entitled to full support from the Pakistani state. Since the late
1990s, however, their situation has changed dramatically. The killings
started in 1999. Since then, more than 1,000 Hazaras have been killed
in Quetta, 3,000 or more have been injured, and 55,000 or so have been
forced to flee to Europe or Australia. All of those came from a
population of between 500,000 and
600,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T19:21:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020434000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0003.htm#13020434000182">The
perpetrators are a banned Sunni militant al-Qaeda-affiliated group
called Lashkar-e-Jhangvi—the LEJ. The Taliban and the LEJ have
both issued fatwas against the Hazaras. After the recent violence, an
LEJ spokesman was reported as saying that the Hazaras had been warned
in 2012 that they should leave Balochistan, the province in which
Quetta sits, and that as many had not done so, the LEJ will not allow
Shi’as to leave alive in
2013<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T19:21:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020434000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0003.htm#13020434000183">That
is the background to the dreadful bombing in Quetta on 10 January this
year. The death toll was well above 100, and more than 120 people were
injured. One of my reasons for seeking this debate is that although
that incident was widely reported on television and radio and in the
press, the reporting rarely gave any context to the violence, which was
generally reported as simply another bomb attack in Pakistan. Some
reports alluded to a generalised struggle between Sunni and
Shi’a Muslims. The few that even mentioned the Hazaras did not
explain their history, the background to their situation or the agency
of their persecution. One of the reasons for having this debate is to
put on public record at least some of that background, and to challenge
some of the
myths<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T19:22:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020434000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0003.htm#13020434000184">One
such myth is that the persecution is a manifestation of some
generalised Sunni-Shi’a conflict that has manifested itself from
time to time in regional tensions in other parts of the middle east. I
do not believe that that is the case. It is clear from the targets of
the violence and from the death toll that the violence is directed at
just one distinctive community within the wider Shi’a community.
I understand that the Hazaras of Quetta are 33 times more likely to be
killed by political violence than members of the wider Shi’a
community in Pakistan. That constitutes a focus on a particular
religious and ethnic
group<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T19:23:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Andy Slaughter</B> (Hammersmith) (Lab):</Member> My right hon. Friend
is making a powerful case. As he has said, this constitutes not only
religious but ethnic cleansing, and the figures that he has given the
House are stark. Is he aware that, despite the 1,000 deaths, the local
government in Pakistan—which, fortunately, has now been
disbarred by the Pakistani Government—has not brought a single
charge against anyone for the offences, and that not one member of that

Denham:</Member></B> One of the most serious problems is that there has
been no acceptance of responsibility by the Pakistani authorities of
the kind that we would expect in a serious situation such as this. I

authorities on this matter.</hs_Para>

problem with the ill-informed, shallow or sweeping reporting that we
have seen is that it tends to obscure the real causes of the violence
and to obscure the responsibilities. It allows the incidents to be
shrugged off as though that is “just the way things are”.
Since 1990, the violence has included ride-by and drive-by shootings,
personal attacks, suicide bombings, rocket attacks and car bombs, as
well as the ambushing of buses and taxis and the subsequent selection
of Hazara passengers for
execution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T19:25:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020434000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0003.htm#13020434000188">This
is not the first time that my constituents have alerted me to what has
happened to their relatives. Under the last Government, I took
constituents who had family in the Swat valley in Pakistan to meet Lord
Malloch-Brown, then a Foreign Office Minister, to alert him to the
violence being carried out by the Pakistan Taliban. My constituents had
come to me with stark examples of what had happened to members of their
families in the recent past. I shall not give the House details of
names, as family members might suffer as a result, but I have received
clear documentation of constituents who had seen family
members—male breadwinners—singled out for murder in three
separate incidents over the past three years. The effects of that are
devastating for the entire family. In a country with little in the way
of a social security system, the loss of a male breadwinner has an
impact on every member of the extended family.</hs_Para>

are wider consequences too. The Hazaras in Quetta have to live in
isolation from other Pakistani citizens, not least because those other
citizens fear being caught up in the violence. They suffer travel
restrictions, and virtually all the Hazara students in Quetta have
dropped out of university, following attacks on student transport.
Hazara people have also faced difficulty in accessing civil service
jobs. As has already been pointed out, however, not a single terrorist
has yet been prosecuted. On the rare occasions when individuals have
been arrested, they have been released. The provincial governor has
been replaced, but little action seems to have been
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T19:27:20"></hs_TimeCode> as

failure of the Pakistan authorities to safeguard the Hazara community
is surely beyond doubt, but concerns remain about a much more sinister
involvement. It is alleged that the intelligence services, the
Inter-Services Intelligence, sections of which have a history of
involvement with extremist forces, have links in some ways to the LEJ.
I want to put it on record that I do not know whether such links are
documented or what the strength of the evidence is, but the concerns
about those potential connections are widely shared among those I have
spoken to.</hs_Para>

points I wish to put to the Minister are these. First, will he tell us
whether the position of the Hazaras been raised with either the

these issues last raised by Ministers from Her Majesty’s

there are, of course, huge issues in this region that are currently
under discussion—not least today between our own Prime Minister
and the Presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Does the Minister agree
that while these supra-regional questions are being settled, the
position of those such as the Hazaras must not be overlooked, left on
one side or seen as too small, too trivial or too local to be taken
into account? Will the Minister give me an assurance about the
Government’s efforts to ensure that the Hazara

the truth that a range of minority groups have suffered and do suffer
oppression and discrimination in Pakistan. In part, though, the
Pakistan Government have tended to respond on the Hazara
issue by questioning why a single group should be highlighted for
attention. Does the Minister agree that although a number of
groups face oppression, that is no good reason to lump them all
together as part of a generalised concern for human rights, but makes
it all the more essential to understand the history, the
particularities and the nature of the oppressors in each case and to

the Member for Milton Keynes North (Mark Lancaster) and I have spent a
considerable amount of time meeting members of that community and
working with them. Last year, we had the great honour of attending
their annual school prize-giving day—a warm and jolly occasion

us a list. The impact of the killings and of the injuries sustained
among the community as a whole has been absolutely shocking. Let me
provide a few other examples. A decade ago, there were 300
students at the main university in Quetta. After all the death threats
and the persecutions, there are not any today. About 80% of Hazara
businesses have either had to be sold or closed down. There are 3,000
orphans or children living in poverty because the main breadwinner has
been killed. As we have heard, there is no semblance of a social
security system there. Then there are the thousands killed or
maimed—yet not one arrest of the perpetrators. Those figures are
shocking, but it is only when we hear personal examples that the true

was the main breadwinner of the family; the rest of the family depended
on him, yet he was killed in a suicide attack. The family is now living
in squalor, with no real way of supporting themselves. The family then
suffered again, when the father-in-law received a death threat and not
long afterwards suffered a fatal heart attack—yet another
tragedy for the family. That is just one of many similar examples that

weekend, I attended a couple of plays in one of Milton Keynes’s
theatres by a group called “voices of the holocaust”. The
very powerful plays depicted the escalation of persecution in Nazi
Germany in the 1930s. It was an historical reminder  of what
went on and of the fact that that same kind of persecution happens
today, which places on us a great duty to stand up and speak out
against it. I have done a lot of work with the community across the

God—there have been no more atrocities; but no one believes that
the security situation has been resolved. Military rule is not the
solution in the longer term. The Hazaras do not want that any more than
anyone else. They simply want to live in peace in their own country,
with their neighbours, as they did for so many decades. That is an
obligation for the Pakistani Government, and it is an obligation that I
hope the Minister will address in his response to my right hon.
Friend’s points. I hope the Minister will tell us how the
British Government can help the Hazara population—the diaspora

Baluchistan; across Pakistan, Sunni and Shi’a alike have

for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) relating to the chief justice and the
possibility of a judicial inquiry, and I will draw Baroness
Warsi’s attention to that as a potential idea. At the end of his
remarks, the right hon. Gentleman raised a point about recognising the
importance of dealing with all groups that suffer persecution in
Pakistan and elsewhere in a generic manner. That does not, however,
mean that their individual histories or problems are not recognised as
singular issues in the overall context of the importance of the rule of
law being enforced everywhere, which is the best way of protecting
everyone. Even within that, we should recognise that particular
circumstances should be prominent and I will return to that important

we have been generously gifted a little more time by the time fairies
of the Commons doing their work earlier today—I could name my
hon. Friends, but I shall not on this occasion—let me
say a bit about the position 
<?notus-xml column=94?>of Hazaras in Afghanistan. The UK Government are very aware of the
challenging circumstances faced by the Hazaras in Afghanistan. Article
22 of the Afghan constitution makes clear provision for the equal
rights of all Afghan citizens, and we will continue to remind the
Afghan Government of the need to ensure those rights. We have also made
it clear that a political settlement should be inclusive and should
address the needs of all Afghan citizens.</hs_Para>

2001, the situation has improved for Hazaras  in Afghanistan,
with Hazaras now in senior Afghan Government positions. They include
the second vice-President, the acting higher education Minister and the
governor of Bamiyan province—the first female provincial
governor—Habiba Sarabi, whom I have met. We welcome that
progress and we will continue to remind the Afghan Government of the
need to ensure the equal rights of all citizens. In the regional
context, any settlement in Afghanistan that makes sense will have to
include proper attention being given to human rights. That was a key
part of what the international community stressed in the agreements
signed last year and it will be a key part of what happens post-2014.
As we all know, the need for the closest relationship possible between
Afghanistan and Pakistan in a future settlement is emphasised by the
trilateral meetings taking place today. Again, I assure the right hon.
Gentleman and the House that although the specific position of the
Hazaras is unlikely to constitute a specific part of those
conversations, there is a recognition that the future of both
Afghanistan and Pakistan cannot be assured unless serious attention is
paid to the rule of law and ensuring the enforcement of human rights
protection right across both states. Without that, neither state will
have security and stability, which is going to be of prime
importance.</hs_Para>

right hon. Gentleman asked whether I would ensure that the plight of
the Hazaras will be explicitly raised when the conditions of aid to
Pakistan are discussed. Taking advice from the Department for
International Development, I would say that all UK aid to any country
is based on three shared commitments with partner Governments: poverty
reduction and meeting the millennium development goals; respecting
human rights and other international obligations; and strengthening
financial management and accountability. We do not use those conditions
to impose specific policy choices on countries. In Pakistan, our aid
will support the Pakistan authorities in making progress in the
relevant areas, including through concrete measures to improve the
economy, reform education and devote proper attention to human rights.
So although these things are an important part of the bargain made with
any particular country, we do not make our aid conditional on specific

difficulty with making aid conditional is that the determination to
withdraw aid is aimed at a Government, but there are many occasions
when atrocities take place and the Government may not be totally in
charge of a situation—equally, there are circumstances where
Governments appear to be all too certain to be implicated. The process
is difficult, but until now the situation has clearly been
straightforward and aid has not been conditional. Despite that, it is
important that countries receiving aid adhere to human
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Denham:</Member></B> Having worked in development before I
entered this House, I, too, have some sympathy with the idea that
imposing crude conditionality is not a good use of aid. The question
really is: when the discussions take place between DFID Ministers and
officials, and the Pakistan Government, is the second of the three
challenges that the Minister set out—human rights—raised
in a general way? Alternatively, as a way of illustrating what needs to
change, is the position of the Hazaras, for example, specifically
raised as the sort of test of, and the sort of thing that we would have
in mind in deciding, whether human rights were being properly
protected? Part of the challenge is simply to make sure that in wanting
to include all the issues in a general way we do not lose the ability
to say, “This is one of the ways in which we measure
progress.”<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020434000237" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0003.htm#13020434000237"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T19:59:05"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Alistair Burt" PimsId="2385" UID="13020434000377" xid="85" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0003.htm#13020434000377">Alistair

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local

House the “Local Government Finance Report (England) 2013-14 (HC
948)”. This report establishes the starting point for each local
authority in England in the new business rates retention scheme and
sets out individual start-up funding assessments, baseline funding
levels, business rates baselines, tariffs and tops-ups, and the basis
of their distributions. A draft of this report was issued for
consultation on 19 December 2012.</hs_Para>

received almost 200 written responses from local authorities, fire and

considered the views of all those who have commented on the provisional

minor technical changes following representations made during
consultation.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1302042000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/wmstext/130204m0001.htm#1302042000014">From
1 April councils will directly retain nearly £11
billion of business rates instead of returning it to the Government.
The business rates retention incentive that this settlement introduces
is a watershed in council financing, setting local authorities free to
grow their income by building up new business rates revenue through
supporting new firms and jobs. This could deliver around an extra
£10 billion to the wider economy by
2020.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1302042000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/wmstext/130204m0001.htm#1302042000015">Councils
account for around a quarter of all public expenditure. Last year
budgeted to spend £114 billion—a bigger budget than the

the deficit left us by the last Labour

settlement implements the autumn statement commitment that local

of the internet to encourage vulnerable people to take their own lives
is rightly to be condemned absolutely. The internet, though, provides
an opportunity to reach out to vulnerable individuals who may otherwise
be reluctant to seek information, help or support from other agencies.
It can develop and expand the availability of sources of support to
vulnerable people online and can also encourage major organisations
that provide content in the most popular parts of the internet (such as
social networking sites and search engine providers) to develop
responsible practices which reduce the availability of harmful content

Government intervention has to be light touch, very fast, proportionate

section 2(1) of the 1961 Act (as amended by section 59 of the Coroners

act capable of encouraging or assisting the suicide or attempted
suicide of another person with the intention to so encourage or assist.
(There are equivalent provisions in section 13 of the Criminal Justice
Act (Northern Ireland) 1966 which was amended by section 60 of the
Coroners and Justice Act 2009 in the same terms as the Suicide Act 1961
was amended by section 59.) The person committing the offence need not
know the other person or even be able to identify them which, in the
context of the internet, is an important point. He may be prosecuted
whether or not a suicide or attempted suicide takes place. Similarly,
any person making a posting to an online chat room or a social
networking site which intentionally encourages another person to commit
or attempt to commit suicide may be guilty of an
offence.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13020414000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/petntext/130204p0001.htm#13020414000015">Prosecution

illegal, they are free to restrict access to harmful or inappropriate
material in accordance with their “acceptable use”
policies and procedures. Search engines produce the Samaritans helpline
number as the

most offending sites are based overseas and so outside the control of

Authority's Annual Report and Accounts dated 2011-12 is £3.84

will be met by the Government to discharge its existing liabilities
relating to nuclear waste. This estimate does not include the costs of
the disposal of any wastes that might be produced by new nuclear power
stations. The Government's policy is that operators of new nuclear
power stations should meet their full share of the costs of managing
and disposing of the waste they will produce. The price that operators
will be charged for the disposal of their waste will include a

it is in the UK's interests to continue our participation in the Dublin
System which encourages asylum seekers to claim asylum in the first
safe country and ensures that we can tackle ‘asylum
shopping’ across the EU. Since 2004 the Dublin system has
enabled the UK to remove over 10,000 asylum applicants.</hs_Para>

firmly in the UK's interests that other EU member states have well
functioning border and asylum systems. We believe that this is best
achieved through practical assistance to help member states build
capacity; improve the quality of their asylum systems and by sharing
best practice. The Government supports the European Asylum Support
Office (EASO) which is leading this work, focusing in particular on
assistance to Greece and the development of an 'early warning' system

in England. That is one reason why this Government is scaling back

schools.</hs_Para>

changes will take place so that volunteers will benefit from a new
updating service where they present a single criminal records check to
any number of organisations, who simply verify online that it remains
up-to-date. This will avoid the need to apply for multiple checks to
work with different organisations. In addition, schools will not do
barred list checks on supervised volunteers. The Disclosure and Barring
Service does not charge a fee for criminal records checks for
volunteers, and will not charge a fee for the updating service for
volunteers. These moves will cut red- tape and reduce the burden on
those who give up their time to volunteer with children.</hs_Para>

vehicles is carried out in a proportionate way focusing on those seen
as hardened evaders. It is for the keeper of the vehicle to prove that
the vehicle has been in the UK for less than six months. Abuse of the
system is considered to be low but this position is kept under review.
To have foreign registered vehicles staying in the UK for more than six
months has implications for both road safety and tax revenue, and so I
am keen that we continue enforcing this.</hs_Para>

improving physical accessibility, providing better information for the

disabled passengers. Some of the specific measures in the Plan, aimed
at older and disabled people, include reducing conflict in shared space
areas on buses by improving signage, ensuring buses and trains comply

Business Services Ltd, for the delivery of Army recruiting in
partnership with the Army. This is known as the Recruit Partnering

the Army has continually developed the laydown of the recruiting
offices across the UK to meet the business requirement and the changing
demands of the recruiting environment. Research indicates that today's
target audience is twice as likely to look online for career guidance
and advice, and we are therefore introducing a wide selection of
contact channels, including improved digital access, to meet the
individual preference. As a result the number of recruiting offices is
being reduced across the whole of the UK. Some 73 recruiting offices
will be retained and will be known as Army career centres, based on a
footprint which lies within a reasonable travelling distance of over
90% of the target population.</hs_Para>

April 2013, commissioning hospital and community health services that
are used by victims of domestic violence will become the responsibility
of clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) while the NHS Commissioning

in looking at the Health and Wellbeing Strategy to assess the needs of
victims and ensuring these are reflected in their commissioning plans.
With the Health and Wellbeing Board, they will help to ensure that
local care pathways are developed and promoted, so that women and

will be considered in the review by the Medicines and Healthcare

agency is responsible. That review will be closely linked to the

the respective roles of medicines legislation and statutory independent

and their organisations on the development of the PIP assessment,
including with Parkinson's UK. We have made a number of changes to the
assessment as a result of the feedback we received. I believe we now
have a set of criteria which will accurately and consistently take
account of all types of disabilities, including physical, sensory,
mental, intellectual, cognitive and neurological impairments.
Entitlement is not based on having a particular health condition or
impairment; rather the assessment considers the claimant's individual

into account where their ability to carry out activities is affected on

of British copyright legislation since 1911. It allows people to use
copyright works for specific purposes such as private study and news
reporting as long as the use is fair. Whether a specific use is fair
will be considered by a court on a case-by-case basis. The court will
consider how a fair-minded and honest person would deal with the work,
taking into account factors such as the amount of the work copied and
whether or not it competes with commercial exploitation. “Fair
dealing” exists in many other common law countries, such as
Canada and Australia, and is in line with international copyright
standards such as the Berne “three-step

to secure access to careers guidance, which subsequently came into
force in September. The Departments work together to deliver the
strategy.</hs_Para>
