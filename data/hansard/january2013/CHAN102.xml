Derry/Londonderry as the UK city of culture, the G8 is coming to
Northern Ireland, and the World Police and Fire Games, one of the
biggest sporting events in the world, are to be held there as well. All
that demonstrates the existence of a modern, forward-looking Northern

to take difficult decisions about defence spending in our country.
However, let me make this point. At £33 billion a year, we have
the fourth largest defence budget anywhere in the world, and it is
important that we make sure that we have the right scale and shape of
armed forces, and that they have the right capabilities. That is why,
in the defence review, we are investing in drones, and investing more
in special forces and in key intelligence capabilities, making sure
that we have the aircraft we need to ensure that we have highly mobile
armed forces. I am incredibly proud of what our armed forces do, and

But those decisions were made in 2010. The security risk facing this

are changing. We still face the biggest risk from the

Government inherited a system in which students start A-levels in
September and immediately start preparing for exams in January. Pupils
spend too much time thinking about exams and resits of exams, which
encourages a “learn and forget” approach to studying. We

advanced skills such as extended writing and mathematical problem
solving. We want questions that encourage students to think and prepare

subject knowledge and greater intellectual maturity over two years of
study. Ofqual, the exams regulator, has already announced its decision
to remove the January exams from September 2013. The AS-level
qualification will remain but will be redesigned as a stand-alone
qualification. It will be as demanding as an A-level, but cover half

UK’s leading universities—has agreed to lead that
process. The group has welcomed the opportunity to be involved and is
considering how best to provide advice to Ofqual on both the content
and the assessment of A-levels. The group will focus on those A-level

that students are constantly examined, rather than having the

We want to see the development of high-quality AS-levels that students
can study over one or two years. They will have the same content level
as A-levels, but half the breadth. We are also developing 
<?notus-xml column=321?>new qualifications—we are asking other people to look at
those—such as a mid-level maths qualification, which will enable
students who do not want to do a full maths A-level to go on to do that
instead. In addition, we are encouraging extended project
qualifications, so that students in sciences and arts can demonstrate
extended writing as well. It is part of our intention to encourage
greater breadth, particularly so that students doing sciences get more

things about moving up to A-level is that it is a new level and an
opportunity for students to study independently and be able to think. I
remember from when I studied for my A-levels that it sometimes takes
time for the penny to drop in more challenging subjects such as physics
and maths. Constantly measuring students during that process has put
them off. In my view, one of the failings of Curriculum 2000 was that
many students dropped out of subjects such as maths after a year

modularisation has encouraged a “learn and forget”
culture, in which students study something, do the exam and then forget
about it, moving on to the next chunk. Many of the subjects that
students study at school build on previous elements, so it is an
important discipline to be able to understand everything about the
subject at the end of the course, rather than forget about something
learned earlier. The other issue is the amount of time involved: we are

that is what appears, one presumes, in the Energy Act 2011, along with
a new right, to be provided by 2016, for tenants to request energy
improvements in their homes to be carried out by their landlords,
perhaps through the new green deal arguments. It is a welcome step for
tenants: action to deal with landlords who let cold homes, the prospect
of a saving of as much as £400 a year on energy bills
by comparison with the worst-rated properties, and, if tenants opt for
it, an earlier right to ensure that the energy efficiency of their
homes is improved. However, although welcome, that is only partly
true.</hs_Para>

2011 Act states that only tenants of whole houses are eligible to
request landlords to improve their homes, and that only landlords of
houses in which there is only one tenancy will have a duty to improve
properties before letting them. As Members representing constituencies
in many parts of the country will recognise, that means that rather a
lot of tenants will be left out. They are tenants of houses in multiple
occupation—those with homes in properties containing several
lettings. Although the number of HMOs varies across the United Kingdom,
that potentially applies to some 300,000 of the 3.4 million
or so rented homes in the UK. Not all multiply occupied homes are
excluded. Houses—student properties, where, typically, unrelated
people live under one tenancy—will be covered by the
legislation, but hundreds of thousands of other properties will not.
Southampton has at least 7,000 houses in multiple occupation, perhaps
half of which will be multiply let and therefore excluded from the
ambition of getting tough on landlords with draughty homes, as set out
under the Energy Act 2011. We will have the same landlords and the same
draughty homes, with the new rights and requirements completely passing
those tenants by.</hs_Para>

do not think that is right, not just because tenants in HMOs are more
likely than most to be in fuel poverty yet will be paying more in bills
than anyone else on this basis after 2018 or because much needed
improvements in our housing stock will completely miss an important and
known energy-inefficient housing sector, but because the new rights
should be in place for all tenants, regardless of the exact nature of
their tenancies. My Bill simply seeks to put those rights in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T13:20:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

to amend the 2011 Act in a straightforward way so that its detailed and
welcome provisions extend to all tenancies and to all properties that
are tenanted. It will mean that a tenant occupying part of a house with
have the same right as one occupying a whole house to request those
energy improvements. After 2018, the prospective tenant will have the
same expectation of a reasonably warm and liveable property when they
sign up to rent a floor of a house as when they sign up to rent the
whole of a house.
<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>The Bill does
not put a particular onus on landlords, who should be improving their
homes in any case. They will still have available to them the
landlord’s energy saving allowance, which is generally
unrecognised—I hope it will be taken up more in the
future—and which allows them to improve their
properties.</hs_Para>

also do not think the Government should resist the Bill, because it is
clear from the record of the proceedings of the Bill that became the

Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker) is in his place again
today—clearly believed that the legislation would cover all
landlords and all rented properties. It would therefore be relatively
easy to put my Bill on the statute books simply by not objecting to it
as it proceeds and putting right a serious omission from the 2011 Act.
I would have cause to thank the Government were that to happen, but,
most important, so would the hundreds of thousands of tenants who would

House notes that in 2009 the Information Commissioner’s Office
raided the Consultation Association which revealed a blacklist and
files on more than 3,000 individuals which had been used by more than
40 construction companies to vet individuals and deny people employment
for reasons including being a member of a trade union or having raised
health and safety concerns and that extensive personal information on
individuals and their families was held; recognises that the majority
of individuals have still not been informed that they were on the
blacklist nor given the opportunity to seek redress, despite recent
confirmation that blacklisting checks took place on Olympic
construction sites and allegations that the practice took place on
public projects including Ministry of Defence sites, Portcullis House
and Crossrail; further notes that at recent Scottish Affairs Select
Committee hearings on blacklisting the Information Commissioner
Investigations Manager raised concerns that there may have been
collusion by police officers and security services in the compilation
of blacklists; and in addition that it was also alleged at the hearings
that a blacklist of environmental activists was compiled; and calls on
the Government to immediately begin an investigation into the extent to
which blacklisting took place and may be taking place, including on
public sector projects, and to ensure that appropriate and effective
sanctions are in place to tackle and prevent
blacklisting.</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13012356000303" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0001.htm#13012356000303"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T13:23:17"></hs_TimeCode>The
motion relates to a secretive, insidious and shady practice that has
brought shame on our construction industry. Those who were responsible
for it have yet to be properly held to account for their actions, which
is why we have brought this matter to the House today. After seeing
huge construction projects successfully delivered safely, on budget and
on time by our construction sector—such projects include the
Olympic park venues and Heathrow terminal 5—it gives me no
pleasure to raise this matter, but debate this matter we must. It would
be a dereliction of duty for us not to do so, given what has come to
pass. I heard the comments that the Prime Minister made earlier in
response to a question about blacklisting that was put to him in Prime
Minister’s questions, and I should say that the manner in which
he approached the issue is entirely inappropriate. That is because this
is not a party political issue, which is why I provided the Secretary
of State with an advance copy of my speech in an effort to build
consensus; it is an issue of justice.</hs_Para>

They are our nation’s construction workers. Construction work
may be hazardous and not terribly well paid relative to other
occupations, but it provides an income to those who do it. It puts food
on the plate; it provides a livelihood. But for a long time many of our
construction workers have suspected that they were being systematically
denied work—work

Economic League was wound up in 1993 and its construction company
members wanted to continue its activities in their sector, so the
Consulting Association was set up. It spun off out of the league in
1993 and a former regional organiser of the league, Mr Ian Kerr, became
its chief officer until it was wound up in 2009. Mr Kerr, through the
association, ran a large-scale secret operation on behalf of the
construction companies, which were all leading companies in the sector.
Many of the construction companies have since sought to distance
themselves from the association’s activities by claiming, for
example, that its services were used by subsidiaries they did not own
at the time. Some have simply maintained that none of their managers
knew the practice was going on, despite strong evidence to the
contrary. Let me be clear: these well-known construction companies were
involved in some way, shape or form with the association and therefore
with its practices and no amount of carefully worded legal statements,
denials or excuses can hide that

members of the Committee for the fantastic work they have done on this
issue. I was going to come  
<?notus-xml column=334?>to that exact point, as the fine that was paid was essentially, in some
respects, hush money. That is how I would describe it. According to the
Information Commissioner, 44 construction companies made up the hall of
shame that was the membership of the Consulting Association at the time
of the 2009 raid I mentioned, including: five companies in the AMEC
group; Amey Construction Ltd; six Balfour Beatty companies; BAM
Construction Ltd; Carillion plc; Kier Ltd; Laing O’Rourke
Services Ltd; Morgan Est and Morgan Ashurst, which are now known as
Morgan Sindall; Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, which I have already
mentioned; Skanska UK plc; Taylor Woodrow Construction; and Vinci plc.
Those are just a few of the companies listed. In fact, half of the 20
largest construction companies today and/or their subsidiaries were
involved with the Consulting Association in 2009. They were charged a
£3,000 annual fee for membership and then had to pay
£2.20 for each blacklist check on a construction worker, which
would be a drop in the ocean for them but would have severe
consequences for the workers

in the past few months we have learned that blacklisting checks were
carried out on workers who were to be engaged on publicly funded

Committee in which he stated that member companies used the

work on major public sector contracts. He said that the projects ranged
from airport runways to buildings such as Portcullis House on the
parliamentary estate, the Ministry of Defence in Whitehall, GCHQ, the
Jubilee line, the millennium dome, private finance initiative projects,
hospitals, schools, Olympic sites, roads, rail contracts and so on.
That is corroborated by an admission last month by Balfour Beatty in a
letter to the Olympic Delivery Authority. Without the knowledge of the
ODA, Balfour Beatty admitted that it had used the services of the
association in 2008 to check 12 prospective Olympic workers
who, thankfully, went on to be employed. It was also corroborated
yesterday by Cullum McAlpine, who is a director of Sir Robert McAlpine
Enterprises Ltd, and was the chair of the association from 1993 to

projects, David Clancy, the Information Commissioner’s
investigations manager, who carried out the raid in 2009 on the
association, has made very, very serious allegations in relation to the
police and security services. Giving evidence to the Select Committee,
Mr Clancy, a former police officer, said he believed that some of the

security services, based on the nature of the information held. For
example, an in-depth analysis of an individual’s home

it is likely that some of the information given to the league by the
police made its way on to the files held by the association. Having
seen examples of some of the records myself, it is clear that they
contained information based on the surveillance of individuals,
including periods away from construction sites. It seems improbable
that such information came exclusively from

about legal protections for construction workers and the system of

unlawful to refuse employment on the grounds of trade union membership
alone, at the time of the Information Commissioner’s raid on the
Consultancy Association in 2009, there was no specific general
prohibition on blacklisting. It was therefore left to the commissioner
to prosecute Mr Kerr for failing to comply with the Data Protection Act
1998. As I said, he was fined just £5,000 as a result, which
seems a shockingly small amount, given the devastation caused over the
years. We have heard the evidence in the House this afternoon.
Following the raid and the emergence of the blacklist, the Labour
Government consulted on the issue of increasing the maximum monetary
fine that could be imposed for serious breaches of data protection
principles from £5,000 to £500,000.

shocking still is the fact that those firms that set up the association
and became members—which supplied information to and accessed
the blacklist—were neither charged with any offence like Mr Kerr

any other law. To date, as I said, not one director of those companies
has been brought to book for what happened. We also introduced the
Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010 a few
months after the raid. They provide for victims of blacklists to seek
redress from employment tribunals and civil courts only. They do not
contain criminal sanctions, but they make it unlawful to compile,
supply, sell or use a “prohibited list”'. To be
prohibited, the list must contain details of current or former trade
union members, or details of people who are taking part, or who have in
the past taken part, in trade union activities. Non-trade union members
on a list that includes trade union members qualify for protection too.

claims can be brought in the employment tribunal or the county court.
Though the cap on compensation in the tribunal is £72,300 and
there is no cap in the county court, people often prefer—I know
this from my previous practice as an employment lawyer—to claim
in the employment tribunal because it can be less laborious for
claimants and the cost consequences of losing a case are less severe.
However, claims brought in the tribunal must be brought within three
months of the alleged unlawful act. Claims brought after that time can
be allowed only at the discretion of the tribunal. Again, that needs to
be looked at, because so many of the people affected are not even aware
that these unlawful acts took place.</hs_Para>

upshot of all this is that often the only legal remedy for a
significant number of victims of blacklisting is through a complaint to
the European Court of Human Rights in respect of a breach of their
convention rights—article 8 on privacy and article 11 on freedom
of information. That, of course, can take a long time and a great deal
of resource. There are a number of cases going through the courts at
present, which I will not refer to now as I do not wish to prejudice
those trials, but we must be realistic about asking individual workers,
many of whom have lost their livelihoods and so do not have huge
resources, to enforce their rights against those very well resourced
companies.</hs_Para>

might be tightened up and protections and sanctions strengthened, and
for him to report back to the House on his findings. I have
deliberately not set out detail in respect of legal changes that may be
needed to address these technical issues. That is something on which we
can work together to achieve consensus. However, just as we correctly
argue for robust legislation to protect whistleblowers, we must ensure
that a climate of fear is not allowed to continue around the issue of
blacklisting.</hs_Para>

I welcome the fact that the Information Commissioner has taken steps to
work alongside trade unions by sending a list of names and dates of

proactive process, as I said earlier, so that those who have been

conclusion, what happened is nothing short of a national scandal. The
sadness is that we cannot say with confidence that these practices are
not still continuing. That is why action is needed. This action may
take some weeks or months, but the time for denials and hiding their
heads in the sand by the construction companies involved is over, not
least because unless they apologise and accept responsibility, the
reputation of the entire industry will be tarnished. That is not at all
fair to those companies in the sector who have not engaged in those
practices<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000379" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012356000379">With
that in mind, I end by asking the construction companies involved to
consider setting up a fund into which they could all pay and which
could immediately begin to compensate those workers who were
blacklisted for the immense loss they have suffered. That, in addition
to a full apology, would be a good place to start in righting the
wrongs which have been done to our construction workers over the years.

on the construction industry. We all know that that industry is not

reason that the hon. Gentleman has brought the debate is to seek an

involvement in blacklisting. There is a qualitative difference now that

Cable:</Member></B> I should like to go through the issues that have
been raised step by step. Most of them relate to the past. I want to
start by describing factually the matters covered by the 2008-09
Information Commissioner’s investigation. He used his powers
under the Data Protection Act 1998 to launch an investigation, based on
a story in <I>The Guardian</I> newspaper that an intelligence system
had been used to vet workers for employment in the UK construction
industry. As a result of that, a search warrant was issued in 2008,
leading to a search of the premises of the Consulting Association in
February 2009. The investigation resulted in the successful prosecution
of the Consulting Association for breaching data protection law and it
was closed down. The owner, Mr Kerr—now, I think,
deceased—was fined £5,000, which was the maximum fine at
the time. The levels of fines have now been radically changed. Fifteen
enforcement notices were issued against the Consulting Association and
some of its user construction companies to stop them collecting and
using personal data for vetting
purposes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T14:18:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000416" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012356000416">The
investigation looked further, but came to the conclusion that there was
no evidence that blacklisting existed in other industries, or that the
number of construction workers blacklisted went beyond those in the
files secured by the Information Commissioner. In other words, it
addressed the question that Members are now trying to raise in their
interventions. It is 
<?notus-xml column=346?>important to reflect that that wholly independent body asked the
questions that are now being asked, and that it came to that very clear
conclusion.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_23_PT_1/C61669B522F7E3F46EE411F7123C276A1BE08622" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="23 January 2013">Wednesday

seemed to get a little lost earlier—the ICO is a fully

brought forward anything new, but perhaps the Select Committee has.

look at that, but we have not yet seen
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012368000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012368000010">Then
there <hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T14:24:25"></hs_TimeCode>is the
question of the existing legislative framework, to which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T14:24:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T14:24:31"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Streatham drew attention.
Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T14:29:32"></hs_TimeCode> me just go
over the legislative framework. The Data Protection Act 1998 was the
basis on which the investigation took place, and the Information
Commissioner used the maximum legal powers available at the time, which
have since been increased, hence the ability to use civil penalties of
£500,000. There is also the Trade Union and Labour Relations
(Consolidation) Act 1992, which makes it unlawful to employ a person
because they are a member—or, indeed, not a member—of a
trade union or because they refuse to join or leave a trade union. It
is equally unlawful for an agency to refuse employment services on
those grounds. As we have heard, an individual can bring an employment
tribunal complaint within three months of an offence taking place, or
longer if it was not reasonably practical to bring the claim in time.
That is what many workers have done in this case.
Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T14:29:32"></hs_TimeCode>, there
is the legislation that the previous Government introduced, the
Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010, under
which it became unlawful to use, compile, sell or supply blacklists of
trade union members or activities for discriminatory purposes such as
employment vetting.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Gosport (Caroline Dinenage), have asked why action was
not taken more quickly. Let me go through the history of that decade.
The Employment Relations Act 1999 introduced the power for
the Secretary of State to make regulations to outlaw the creation, use,
sale or supply of blacklists, but no regulations were introduced in
1999. Four years later, in 2003, the Government carried out a public
review of the effect of the Act and concluded that there was no
evidence of blacklisting, but they did publish draft blacklisting
regulations and said that they would introduce them swiftly if the need
arose. The ICO then investigated the Consulting Association, after
which the Government introduced the regulations that had been published
in draft.</hs_Para>

there was a very long process of consultation. Preparatory legislation
was produced in case there was evidence that something had taken place,
and indeed there was and the Government acted. My approach is exactly
the same. If companies have found a way around the regulations and
abuses are still taking place, we of course need to look at taking
fresh steps, but I am waiting to hear that

think related to events four or five years ago; I am happy to be
corrected, but that is my understanding. Let me say what I think
happened in that case. We knew that Balfour Beatty wrote to the Olympic
Delivery Authority admitting that one company in its group made checks
on 12 potential employees prior to February 2009. That was in response
to a letter from the ODA, one of a number sent to high-profile
contractors. The firm insists that all 12 people were given jobs and
that there was no wider or further use of pre-employment checks. The
ODA has taken a very clear and unambiguous stand condemning
blacklisting in the operation of the Olympics. There is no question but
that the practice was taking place well back during the last
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012368000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012368000019">I

unite in condemning blacklisting as an assault on the legitimate rights
of trade unionists. My second reason for welcoming the debate is that I

we embarked on the construction of the Olympic park, there was a
determination by the then Government that every public pound should
work harder for a social purpose. A number of months were spent

so insidious is the practice of blacklisting that, as has been

other progressive initiatives supported the central objective of

establishment of a community and trade union learning centre that had a
permanent presence in the park and gave hundreds of learners who were
working there the opportunity to improve their English and maths skills
and to master basic IT, and the promotion of opportunities for women
and disabled people to find a place in the construction industry. The
bigger mission was to change the face of the construction industry from
being predominantly older and male to something much more diverse and

achievements.</hs_Para>

that, having gone through the history of blacklisting as best I could
with the information provided to me. In 2003, as he detailed, the
former Labour Government consulted on introducing regulations against
blacklisting but announced that they would not bring any into force
because the evidence suggested that blacklisting had been eradicated in
the 1990s. Six years later, in 2009, they announced that they had plans
to implement regulations to outlaw the blacklisting of trade unionists.
I was quite surprised to find that Labour chose not to make
compensation or penalties retrospective. If

evidence that would be required was not available back in 2009 when the

decisions, why is it so relevant to secure it now? As the Secretary of

retrospective action has lots of unforeseen consequences and is

clandestine and secret, and unless we have an investigation and inquiry
into the practice, we cannot know how widespread it is. It must be
rooted out, and my hon. Friend makes a very fair point.</hs_Para>

TUC report from 2011 looks at the productivity gains of trade union
membership—I want to emphasise the positives of trade unions to
the economy. The 
<?notus-xml column=356?>productivity gain to the UK economy as a result of trade union reps in
the workplace was estimated at between £4 billion and £12
billion—absolutely staggering figures—and savings of
between £82 million and £143 million in legal
and recruitment costs. When looking at blacklisting we need to focus on
the bad side of attacking the perfectly legal and important activity of
someone being in a trade union and ensuring that people feel confident
enough to report any health and safety risks at work, especially in a
dangerous industry such as construction.</hs_Para>

We can go back to 1906, before “The Ragged-Trousered
Philanthropists”, when my great-grandfather was called to
Monksbridge ironworks by his Liberal employer and told, “You can
be a trade unionist, but if you join the Labour
party,”—the new Leeds Labour party had been
formed—“you will not work again.” For quite some
time he did not, which created huge
poverty.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012368000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012368000083">In
1924, the Zinoviev letter was part-leaked by the new Economic League,
which was formed by a Tory MP using parliamentary facilities. The
Economic League continued—I came across it by accident in the
1980s when I applied for a job at Ciba-Geigy in Manchester. I went for
an interview and was given the job. It was confirmed, and I was pleased
because I wanted to move back north and it was good money, but a week
later I get a phone call. A very embarrassed human resources
person—I believe that is what they called them in those
days—rings me up and says, “I’m very sorry, but
you’re on a blacklist.” I said, “What do you mean
I’m on a 
<?notus-xml column=358?>blacklist?” She said, “You’re on an economic
blacklist and it’s our policy. There’s nothing I can
do.” She was very embarrassed about it, but said, “You

up on that blacklist. It could well have happened because my in-laws
were members of that dreaded organisation the Communist
party—they were well to the right of me and anyone in the Labour
party. My mother-in-law was the president of the Sussex Communist
party, and must therefore have been a known agitator—as a
midwife. Alternatively and more seriously, I was almost certainly on
the blacklist because—I have read up on this—I was
involved organising the national anti-apartheid demonstrations. I
organised a number of the students who went and was part of the team
who pulled together the national demonstrations with Oliver Tambo and
Jesse Jackson. Lots of hon. Members from different parties were no

me tell the House about the nerds—I exposed one of them. This is
an interesting story. When I was an official for the engineering union,
we had a researcher. He was a strange lad because he came to see me
every day with Trotskyist newspapers. I thought I knew about Trotskyist
newspapers but he had ones I had never heard of. Hon. Members know that
Trotskyists were like those in “The Life of
Brian”—there were many factions and groupings and every
one had to have a newspaper. Obviously, people were publishing their
own newspapers. No one had ever heard of them but the lad had copies
and would say, “Do you know this or that person?” I just
thought he was a bit of a loony. He was. We caught him dealing Nazi
memorabilia at Waterloo train station, which is odd for a researcher in
a union. We challenged him and he left the next week, but there was a
problem with his pension and we had to ring him about it two months
later. We rang his number, which 
<?notus-xml column=359?>was a strange number, and a bloke answers it and says, “Economic
League blacklist.” The lad had been using his position to
infiltrate the union. He was sticking all sorts of random names on the
list—no doubt there was payment by results. He was building up a
list of people who would then not get work as a
result.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012368000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012368000088">That
is the problem, and it exists not just in construction. I shall reveal
another example from the Prison Service and Ranby prison—the
Secretary of State wants information; he can have some. If the senior
prison management do not like a person, they say they are a security
risk. If a person is a security risk, they are not allowed a tribunal
by definition. Rebecca Knighton, for example, was a lecturer at Ranby
prison. She was drummed out on false premises that were without
question made up, as confirmed by my own investigation, because her
face did not fit. She cannot work throughout the Prison Service again
because she is on a list as being a security
threat.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012368000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012368000089">A
whole stack of prison officers, who have slightly more rights—I
will not name them because we are currently fighting some of their
cases—have their names on the list, which means they will not
work in any prison anywhere in the country. A similar type of blacklist
is created. It is invidious, unfair and anti-democratic. It is quite
clear that Ms Knighton and the other prison officers at Ranby whom I
have dealt with in my constituency have done nothing wrong—not
even on the margins. They have done nothing, but have been stitched up
for totally arbitrary reasons by individuals with access to management.
I have privately called for a full investigation, but the example shows

work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012368000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012368000090">I
was at the rally of the independent construction workers in Newark to
argue about local jobs at the various power stations in Nottinghamshire

is why the law needs to be improved. The Secretary of State was correct
to say that the previous did Government did not get the law right, but
that is not an excuse for this Parliament not putting it right. People
should not unfairly and unknowingly lose their employment prospects
because of prejudice or bias, or because of an argument they have had.
In reality, that is how people get their names on the list. They are
not political activists, and normally they are not trade union
activists. The vast majority are on the list because they have had some
fall-out with one of the gaffers. That is how they get on the
list—entirely arbitrarily—and they do not have a clue why
they cannot get jobs. That is why something needs to be

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:17:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bassetlaw (John Mann), who made a passionate speech. I have been
contacted by several constituents regarding the practice of
blacklisting and welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I
condemn those companies and individuals who have carried out such
practices and note that the law now protects employees from
blacklisting. Individuals can 
<?notus-xml column=360?>bring civil cases and take their case to employment tribunals if they
suspect that they have been denied employment or that they have been
unfairly dismissed as a result of illegal
blacklisting.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012368000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012368000093">I
also note that, since the Information Commissioner’s
investigation and the introduction of the blacklisting regulations in
2010, no evidence has been brought forward. Hon. Members have commented
on cases today, and I look forward to hearing the evidence—the
Secretary of State has said that he, too, looks forward to receiving
it. I must therefore ask myself why we are having this debate. As a
working-class bloke who has worked on building sites, I look to my
bourgeois new Labour friends in the Opposition and conclude that the
debate must be some form of guilt trip, because in 13 years of
government, they introduced a regulation only 60 days before they
left—it was in place for longer than the 50p tax hike
that Labour introduced and claimed was a saving for the nation. The
Labour Government let down a lot of people. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:19:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bassetlaw said, that is not an excuse for this Parliament not to
address the problem, but the Labour Government

are we having this debate today? I believe the trade unions have put an
enormous amount of pressure on the Labour party—they are the
Labour party’s paymasters. The Opposition have been obliged to
introduce the debate. It is not so much a “Cash for

we have heard, Labour Members are appalled, shocked and ashamed,
but—I am sorry—they need to look in the mirror, because
that is where a lot of the drama is as far as the blacklisting problem
is

the Labour Government failed to address this issue, and then 60 days
before the election they pop up and introduce a piece of legislation
that somehow justifies their failure to look after working-class
people. It is important that we have confidence in the Information
Commissioner’s Office, that it has the laws available to pursue
individuals and companies who are breaking the law, that there is a
constant appraisal of the intelligence offered by different parties and
that it acts on any relevant information, and that any victims of such
acts have a clear route to redress. I am also pleased that we have a
maximum penalty of £500,000, which is an important deterrent to
individuals who may carry out such practices.</hs_Para>

the Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna), the shadow Business Secretary. I
share his desire to end the obscene scandal of blacklisting. At Prime
Minister’s questions, an issue was raised about the secrecy of
the secret services and the police being involved in trade unions,
blacklisting and other things. I was in a meeting this morning with
representatives of the Shrewsbury pickets, who were on strike in 1972.
Some were jailed and some died as a consequence, and they are still
looking for justice. They have just received a letter from a Minister
saying that even though it happened nearly 40 years ago, the papers
relating to the case will not be released because it is a matter of
national security. The individual concerned was Jim Royle—Mr
Tomlinson—whose reaction to that was, “My arse!”
That is a quotation from him, not from me—it is the way he
is.</hs_Para>

merely highlight the point that there are interventions and happenings
by the security services and the police with ordinary working people
every day of the year. For the Secretary of State to suggest that we do
not have any evidence, or that it might not be happening at this point
in time, is pure poppycock. Of course it is happening. The reason why
people are not rushing forward with evidence is because the evidence is
not at hand. There might be people here who have been, and are still
are, on a blacklist, but they are not sure, so how can they come
forward? The difference now is that recently, in the Scottish Affairs
inquiry, a whole number of people have given evidence agreeing that not
only have they been involved in blacklisting, but they have been
operating blacklisting for a cost, to the detriment of thousands and
thousands of people.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) said that blacklisting
goes back to the beginning of the 20th<Sup> </Sup>century. A little bit
of research showed that, according to the “Henry Holt
Encyclopaedia of Word and Phrase Origins”, the word
“blacklist” originated with a list that England’s
King Charles II made of 58 judges and court officers who
sentenced his father to death. When Charles II was restored to the
throne in 1660, some 13 of those executioners were put to death and 25
sentenced to life imprisonment. The others escaped. Times have changed,
of course, which is not to say that some Government Members, perhaps
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:27:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

future. I am not suggesting that that is the case, however, and I will

debate for the Secretary of State to make some 
<?notus-xml column=363?>decisions on an inquiry. Some 3,600 files were seized by the Information
Commissioner’s Office—files on politicians, academics,
journalists, trade unionists and people who might just say,
“Boo!” to their employers, who might not like it. There
are many, many files. The Consulting Association’s blacklist,
however, contained around 3,213 individuals and was used by more than
40 contractors, including most major UK construction firms, which vet
individuals for employment.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:30:30"></hs_TimeCode>mass of
information was left behind because it was not covered by any warrant.
The information seized revealed that 40 of the biggest construction
companies in Britain were drawn to paying money to find out who they
should not employ. They included household names such as Taylor
Woodrow, McAlpine, Balfour Beatty, Skandia and Carillion. To pick up
the point my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:30:58"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns) made, on its own
admission, Carillion has had £2.5 billion per annum from public
contracts, at the same time as placing ordinary citizens on blacklists
and stopping them working. It cannot be allowed and it must be stopped
as soon as practicably possible. From July to September 2008, McAlpine
spent £12,839 making 5,836 blacklist checks—a total of 63
a day. That corresponded with McAlpine’s building of the Olympic
stadium. How disgraceful can you get? A major company such as McAlpine
penalising people for whatever, at the same time as having
multi-million-pound Government contracts, is, as many people have said,
absolutely insidious.</hs_Para>

believe we should perhaps go a little further than we have discussed
today. I am obviously willing for more debate and discussion; indeed,
if the Secretary of State is furnished with enough information, we
should have a public inquiry into blacklisting on a par with Leveson.
We need to call for those guilty of blacklisting not to be given any
more public contracts until they apologise and compensate people and
their families for blacklisting them. We definitely need a change in
the law to make blacklisting a criminal offence punishable by
imprisonment and unlimited fines. That would be a deterrent for
blacklisting—that is something that we should be looking at and
it should be in legislation. Carillion has been named. It is important
that other organisations come clean, come to the fore, step up to the
plate, erase the past, look to the future and stop blacklisting people,
causing mayhem and financial distress to many, many people.</hs_Para>

the support of 68 Members from six political parties. It should be
pointed out, however, that not a single Conservative and only one

me also declare an interest. Before coming to this place, I spent the
best part of three decades working in the construction sector in one

now happen.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:36:50"></hs_TimeCode>First, I
absolutely want to see all forms of blacklisting made illegal;
secondly, I want to see criminal sanctions brought to bear against any
individual or organisation that supplied, solicited or used
blacklisting material; and finally, I want to see the introduction
through primary legislation of a blacklisted worker’s right to
compensation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000436" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012356000436">March
2009 proved to be a landmark moment for the construction industry. As
we have heard, the ICO uncovered evidence against 44
companies—44 of some of the biggest companies in the
industry—clearly showing that they were corrupt to the very
core. They had purchased blacklists and used them to deny construction
workers their legitimate right of employment. What made these
revelations all the more devastating was that the companies that used
blacklists were the same companies profiteering from millions of pounds
of taxpayers’ money through public sector
contracts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000437" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012356000437">How
do we begin to end this scandal? It has to start by making
blacklisting illegal. Looking specifically at the
legislation that governs the rights of trade union members,
we can clearly see that it does not offer adequate
protection. First, section 137 of  
<?notus-xml column=365?>the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 makes it
unlawful for an employer to refuse to employ someone because of his or
her membership or non-membership of a trade union. The Act does not
make blacklisting
illegal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000439" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012356000439">Secondly,
there is the Data Protection Act 1998—the Act eventually used to
prosecute Ian Kerr, the man who ran the Consulting Association. It is
unclear with this Act whether or not a person’s trade union
activity qualifies as data in the same way as details of a
person’s trade union membership number qualifies as data. The
gap in legislation needs to be addressed, because until we amend the
law explicitly to state that blacklisting is illegal, the Act will not
adequately protect workers.</hs_Para>

third piece of legislation is the Employment Relations Act 1999, which
empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations prohibiting the use
or sale of blacklists. The last Labour Government did many things
well—we improved the health and safety of construction workers,
and their employment rights, more than any other Government in
history—but, in my opinion, we missed the chance to end this
scandal once and for all. I hope that the Secretary of State will learn
from previous
mistakes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000441" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012356000441">I

me tell the House about my history in relation to blacklisting. The
most important person I know of who was blacklisted was someone whom I
never met: my own grandfather. My grandfather was a local official in
the Durham Miners Association during the 1926 strike. At the end of the
strike, after he had been out of work for six months, he was
told—like my good friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr
Hamilton)—“You are not coming back to work.” He
was told by the manager, when he went to his house, “Gus, I want
you back at work, but if I took you back, the owners would send me down
the road.” The owners just happened to be the Bowes Lyon family,
who, as we knew, ran this country and ruled this country for many
years. That was the attitude that they took nearly a century
ago.</hs_Para>

years of poverty followed. My grandfather died in abject poverty, which
meant that my 14-year-old father became the family breadwinner. He was
sent down the mines—against his wishes and the wishes of his
mother, but there was no alternative.</hs_Para>

recent history, there were disputes in the mines in the 1970s and
1980s. There was clearly state intervention in all three of those
disputes, but that was particularly the case in 1984-85. Nobody
seriously doubts that within that dispute there was infiltration of the
National Union of Mineworkers at the highest level; there was
infiltration by MI5 in the general secretary’s office, and there
were agent provocateurs on the ground. State employees were directing
people in the back to work movement, and we saw the use of the military
on the picket line and the very clear politicisation of the police. It
is good news that the Independent Police Complaints Commission is now
investigating the possibility that evidence was tampered with at
Orgreave—we may at last get the truth from
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:45:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000455" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012356000455">Despite
that history—despite the fact that 11,000 people were arrested
during the miners’ strike, hundreds were jailed and more than
1,000 people were sacked—there is a qualitative difference

that dispute most people had an inkling of what they were being accused
of. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:45:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon.

was accused of doing certain things, but at least he knew that that was
happening 
<?notus-xml column=367?>to him. He lost his job because of what was said about him,
but people do not have a clue that this blacklisting is happening to
them—that is the really invidious thing. It is simply unfair for
people to be facing that. The people facing the blacklisting are on

a word with him. I know that it is an independent organisation, but it
acts on behalf of this House and of the people we represent.

morning, we heard the Shrewsbury pickets give a moving description of
what happened to them. The really desperate thing behind what happened
to them is the fact that the state was involved. Even today, 40 years
later, the state is refusing to put documentation into the
public domain for reasons of “national security”.
I do not accept that. I think that what is being done in the
name of “national security” is clear: people are hiding
behind “national security” to protect the
guilty, to protect the men and women in the
shadows—the Security Service, the police and, going back to
1972, the politicians. They were clearly directing what was
going on, in order to undermine the people involved and make sure that
they faced a charge of conspiracy, which could have led to them doing
life imprisonment. That is not something that is going to happen to the
building organisations, who were using force against these people;
there is no criminal sanction for them. We have the chance
to do something seriously good here today, and I hope that the Minister
will give us some hope that she is actually going to do something about
this.</hs_Para>

not only to Crossrail but to some Ministry of Defence sites and to the
Olympic venue, other than in respect of Balfour Beatty. The real point
is this: it is disingenuous to ask for evidence in an industry where
there is a tight curtain of secrecy. If we really want the evidence, we
actually have to look for it. The only way of getting this evidence is
by setting up an inquiry, either a Department for Business, Innovation
and Skills inquiry or a judicial inquiry, and put the relevant
companies on oath to tell the truth. That is what the House is
demanding of the Government today.</hs_Para>

are several issues surrounding the raid on the Consulting
Association’s Droitwich offices in 2009, on which this whole
debate hangs. Since it was widely suspected that blacklisting continued
after the Economic League was wound up in 1993, why did it take 16
years for the authorities to act? Why was Ian Kerr, the retired special
branch officer running the Consulting Association, given only a paltry
£5,000 fine despite running an illegal database over 15 years
that wrecked the lives of thousands of workers? Above all, why did the
companies that sustained his business, and in some cases supplied the
data, get off scot-free. Why did the ICO fail to take the full and
necessary action that it could and should have taken?</hs_Para>

the Data Protection Act 1998, the ICO may only issue an enforcement
notice, which effectively says, “Stop doing that, and only if
you don’t will it be a criminal offence.” In that case,
why were enforcement notices issued against only 14 of the 44 companies
involved? Not only is that a small part of the total, but the list does
not include some of the heaviest users—McAlpine and
Skanska—for reasons that have not been revealed, despite each of
those companies making some 12,000 to 13,000 inquiries in a single
year. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:51:29"></hs_TimeCode>That all

there is the question of the adequacy of the existing legal framework.
It is currently a criminal offence to compile and maintain a blacklist
but not to supply information to a blacklister, to solicit information
from the controller of a blacklist or to use one. It is also unlawful
to be excluded or dismissed from employment because of trade union
membership, but there is no right not to be blacklisted unless that
leads to adverse employment consequences. These are two yawning gaps in
the law, and as a result of this debate the Government must take steps
to fill both those gaps if this awful malpractice is finally to be
stopped.</hs_Para>

are many lessons to be learned from this, both for the Government and
for Opposition Members as we go into government. I welcomed the
Employment Relations Act 1999, which was the first stage in trying to
outlaw blacklisting, but in 2003 I and other Members were asking:
“Where are the regulations? Why aren’t we enacting
them?” We were told that there was no evidence, and that was
because there was almost a vow of silence in the industry. That went

breakthrough came with the ICO raid. Members have criticised the ICO,
and I have done so publicly, too, but I met the officers who carried
out the raid and thanked them, at least for the breakthrough. In 2009,
Mick Clapham, then Member for Barnsley West and Penistone, held a
debate in the House at which a number of Members were present. I
intervened, as did other hon. Members. The Government then brought
forward the regulations. I convened a meeting in the House of the
Blacklist Support Group, and we came together. To be frank, we thought
that the regulations were too weak. The lesson we learned is that when
we bring forward legislation, we need to ensure that it is

round regulations and avoid legislation. I pay tribute to all of them.

Employment Rights, John Hendy, QC, Professor Keith Ewing, and Carolyn

I thank Dave Smith—I have his file here, if anyone wants to have

Friend the Member for Glasgow South West (Mr Davidson) and the Scottish
Affairs Committee, because if it were not for them, we would not have
known about the involvement of the police and security services. I was
angry and upset by the Prime Minister’s reaction when I raised
the issue over a year ago, when the Leveson inquiry was set up. This is
more important than any knockabout. The allegation that the police and
intelligence services were involved means that we have to investigate.
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham West and Royton

from the Prime Minister and in correspondence, that the issue would be
referred back to the police means that it was not being taken
seriously.</hs_Para>

want the inquiry to look at what has happened. I want full exposure of
everything that went on, because when that happens, other industries
will come forward. Other trade unionists will say, “It happened
to us.” I want to know the consequences, too. Like many Members
here, I have met some of these people, and what happened ruined their
lives—it destroyed them. They could not afford to keep a roof
over their heads. Families split up. They were the consequences. I want

us not say that the issue is historical. This is happening at the
moment. I have been on the cleaners’ picket line across the
city—at Schroders, John Lewis and elsewhere. People employed as
cleaners join a trade union and become the trade union representative.
They are then victimised—and yes, in some instances, physically
assaulted; we have evidence of that. Eventually, they are sacked or
have to leave. All of a sudden, coincidentally, they cannot find
employment anywhere else. There are cleaners who have had to change
their name to get another job; then the employer brings in the UK
Border Agency, and some of them have been arrested as a result. Let us
consider the Alberto Durango case: a cleaner became a trade union rep,
was victimised and is now blacklisted throughout the sector. This does
go
on.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000477" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0002.htm#13012356000477">There
are also internal forms of blacklisting, whereby companies refuse to
promote people or give them the jobs that they deserve. It happens in
the civil service. I ask Members to look at the case of Finola Kelly, a
member of the Public and Commercial Services Union who worked for the
Equality and Human Rights Commission. She took a post on a short-term
basis, and then wanted to return to her existing post, but her request
was refused because of her trade union activities. We know that because
the court has just ruled, and she 
<?notus-xml column=371?>has been awarded £25,000 in compensation. This goes on today just
because someone is a trade unionist or because they stand up on health
and safety issues, or simply because they want to ensure justice and

making themselves vulnerable to victimisation. As other Members have
said, I want blacklisting to be a criminal offence. I want people to go
down for what they have done to working-class people in this country. I
want legislation to be retrospective, and I want the burden of
investigation to be placed not on the blacklisted worker but on an

me summarise the debate and ask three things, which I hope the Minister
will respond to more positively than the Secretary of State did
earlier. First, there is an urgent need for investigation into
blacklisting on public sector projects. The Secretary of State
challenges this, but the Scottish Affairs Committee has presented
powerful new evidence that merits an investigation into the past which,
if done properly, will, I think, produce evidence for the present and
the future. Secondly, there is a 
<?notus-xml column=374?>desperate need for a more proactive approach by the Information
Commissioner’s Office. It is vital that the ICO puts in place
immediately an effective process for trying to inform individual
victims of blacklisting so that they can seek redress. If the
blacklisting files for hon. Members are available, they should be
produced. There is no excuse for the Information Commissioner to say
that they cannot be identified or the ICO does not know where they are.
Thirdly, we need a review of current legal protections, of which there
are many, and hon. Members have mentioned
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:09:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000501" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0003.htm#13012356000501">Finally,
we are calling for a compensation fund to be set up by the construction

redress and justice through the fund. Blacklisting, as

final point is that, if the Secretary of State is going to support the
motion, and not divide the House, he will be supporting a motion that
asks for an immediate investigation into the issues that we have been
discussing today. If he declines to hold such an investigation, he will
be going against the will of the House. I commend the motion to the

absolutely share that frustration and that sense of injustice, but that

fine seems paltry, given the impact of the activities on so many
thousands of people, but it was the maximum that could be imposed at

received compensation of £5,000 or more each, and a fine of up

have moved and when using an old card file is not easy. However, I
understand that positive and constructive work is
going on with the unions, including GMB and others, to try to ensure

She outlined the positive impact the construction projects have had,
and indeed the excellent record on safety. She was absolutely right to
highlight that it was totally and utterly morally wrong for the
construction companies to think that it would be in any way acceptable
to check whether employees were on a blacklist. Balfour Beatty has
admitted that behaviour, which I think speaks for itself. It might not
have been a crime at the time, but there is no moral justification for
it whatever. It is absolutely aware that such behaviour is unacceptable

Investigations Manager raised concerns that there may have been
collusion by police officers and security services in the compilation
of blacklists; and in addition that it was also alleged at the hearings
that a blacklist of environmental activists was compiled; and calls on
the Government to immediately begin an investigation into the extent to
which blacklisting took place and may be taking place, including on
public sector projects, and to ensure that appropriate and effective

including more than one million families with children, now renting
privately; recognises there are major implications of the growth in
this tenure for families and communities in Britain today; notes with
concern the lack of protection afforded to tenants and landlords by the
unregulated lettings market and the confusing, inconsistent fees and
charges charged by letting and management agents; further notes the
lack of stability, security and affordability for families and other
renters; further notes the increasing number of complaints about rogue
landlords and the poor standards in the sector compared with other
tenures; calls on the Government to regulate residential lettings and
management agents and to end the confusing, inconsistent charges
regime, making fees easily understandable, upfront and comparable
across agents; further calls on the Government to promote longer term
tenancies where tenants want them; and finally calls on the Government

question for debate today is simple: how do we ensure that the private
rented sector provides enough homes that are sufficiently stable and
secure, affordable and of a decent standard? Nearly 8.5 million people,
including more than 1 million families with children, now rent
privately. Labour believes that the private rented sector has an
important role to play in meeting housing need. As a result of the
biggest housing crisis in a generation, more and more people are being
locked out of home ownership and are looking to find their homes in the
private rented
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000529" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0003.htm#13012356000529">The

raise the rent by any amount with two months’ notice. We

housing has wider costs, including to the taxpayer. The annual cost of
poor housing to our national health service is up to £2.5
billion. Labour wants a strong private rented sector—vibrant and
diverse, helping to meet the nation’s housing need—but
the nation does not need a sector in which landlords and tenants are
hit with rip-off fees and charges by unscrupulous letting agents. The
nation does not need a sector in which families do not have access to
longer-term tenancies and predictable rents, leaving them feeling
insecure and unable to plan their lives. The nation does not need a
sector in which there are rogue landlords preying on vulnerable tenants
and, in the worst cases, risking their lives. We cannot have two
nations, divided between those who own their own homes and those who
rent.</hs_Para>

Government to end the confusing, inconsistent and opaque fees and
charges imposed by letting agents and ensure transparency and
comparability. We call on the Government to introduce a light-touch
national register of landlords and to grant local authorities greater
powers to root out and strike off rogue landlords who are found to have
broken the rules, in particular by way of criminal behaviour, so
assisting more councils, including leading Labour local authorities

housing market, whether it be owner occupied or rented, for 15 or 20
years. Indeed, we saw the rate of house building drop substantially
under the last Administration. This is something that has crossed
Governments of both political persuasions; it then shows itself when
some people are unable to transfer from one part of the market to the
other. I take the point, but we need to recognise that this is a

said we wanted this to be a bigger sector, but we also want
it to be a better sector, providing tenants with a good
choice of decent, reasonably priced accommodation. It is true that the
majority of privately rented homes fit that bill today, but it is not
true of all of them. As constituency Members of Parliament, I am sure
that we will all have come across individual, sometimes appalling,
cases involving unfair charges, poor quality accommodation or, frankly,
just shoddy service. I think we can agree on the need to improve the
sector; the question is

a Government, we believe that many of the current problems are a
consequence of years of under-supply. Over the last 15 years, that gap

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:58:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Easington (Grahame M. Morris), rates will have risen because there
are not enough homes to meet the demand. The quality of accommodation,
let alone the service, will have suffered when landlords who face
little competition rent out their properties. Expanding the supply of
rented homes lies at the heart of our strategy. That is why we have
taken the radical step of establishing a debt guarantee scheme of up to
£10 billion specifically to encourage institutional investment
in the sector. Alongside that, we are putting in place a £200
million build to rent fund to kick-start innovative
projects<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:58:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

new investment will not only boost supply but bring a different type of
institutional landlord into the marketplace. This will bring much
greater choice for tenants with regard to the type of property and
facilities and indeed the terms of the tenancy. These institutional
landlords will also bring a longer-term perspective, often of 25 or 30
years. That brings the opportunity for greater stability for tenants,
and it also means that we as policy makers need to ensure that what we
set is clear and consistent over that time
frame.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000620" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0003.htm#13012356000620"><Member ContinuationText="Graham Jones" PimsId="5600" UID="13012356001272" xid="1089" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0003.htm#13012356001272"><B>Graham

well-balanced regulation to ensure that homes are safe to live in,
tenants’ deposits are protected, and tenants are not misled when

<?notus-xml column=390?>In many instances, landlords are in cahoots with appalling tenants, and
use the antisocial behaviour of those tenants to drive other people out

details of an individual case, I will double-check, but I am fairly

behaviour. I shall not be referring to it specifically in my speech,

have mentioned the need for regulation, but it must be said that much
of it is already in place. Let me give some examples. The Consumer
Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 give tenants specific
protection from letting agents who mislead or engage in aggressive
business practices. Tower Hamlets took advantage of those regulations
recently. The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999
protect tenants from unfair conditions, such as unfair restrictions on
ways in which they can use a property. If a landlord unfairly withholds
a tenant’s deposit, the tenant can already seek redress through
a Government-sponsored tenancy deposit protection scheme which covers
about 2.5 million tenancies. The worst abuses—harassment and
illegal evictions—are already criminal offences.</hs_Para>

have seen that trading standards can and will prosecute letting agents.
There is a good example in West Bromwich, where a letting agent, Mr
Dhuga, was taken to court by Sandwell council’s trading
standards team, He had been falsely claiming that his business was a
member of the Property Ombudsman scheme, and a member of this and that.
Sandwell won, and as a result Mr Dhuga will have to pay more than
£6,000 in fines and costs. I congratulate Sandwell on bringing
the prosecution and on publicising the case in order to deter
others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000633" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0003.htm#13012356000633">However,
more can be done. Last year, for example, we became aware of a number
of landlords in parts of London with tenants in outbuildings, or
“beds in sheds”. The hon. Member for Birmingham,
Erdington gave an example in Newham. These are complex situations.
Often, alongside the housing issue are illegal immigration, tax evasion
and other criminal activities. We recognised that to root out those
rogue landlords, the enforcement agencies needed to work differently
and much more closely together. My predecessor developed a new,
collaborative approach that can tackle complex problems on the ground.
We then provided an additional £1.8 million to help
local teams, particularly those in nine areas; even on one of the early
raids 39 people were found to be in appalling conditions, and that has
put a stop to it. Of course, the “beds in sheds” case is
slightly unusual, but it has shown that we can, and should, make much
better use of existing law to tackle the minority of rogue agents and
landlords.</hs_Para>

the hon. Gentleman has said that he wants the introduction of a

Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn), who registered his interest for
this debate—would mean that those who are doing the right thing
and are already accredited will have a new, additional burden placed on
them. When Labour, in office, last proposed a register it said that the
register would cost £300 million, and that was without the extra
powers that the hon. Gentleman seems to allude to. We must also bear in
mind the fact that higher costs for landlords mean higher rents for
tenants. In addition, many of the worst landlords—the rogues he
rightly highlights—would continue to operate, under the radar.
If they do not sign on, what guarantee is there that local authorities
would be able to take action?

important issue. Week after week in my
constituency surgeries, and in my postbag, housing has been the No. 1
issue that constituents bring to me. That is why, last October, I
launched a campaign aimed at improving the availability of affordable

the last month, housing has been displaced as the No. 1 issue, and I am
sure hon. Members will be interested to know why. Is it because the
Government have succeeded in building more houses, or in encouraging
the private sector to do so? No. It is because of their unprecedented
attack on the most vulnerable in society, and those working the hardest
to improve their lot—the disabled, those on the minimum wage,
and those dependent on tax credits. The Government have changed my
casework load so that benefits are now the No. 1 issue that
constituents bring to me. It is not that housing is less important; it
is just that the Government are so busy undermining the resources of so
many people that many more are forced to raise the benefits issue with
me.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000664" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0003.htm#13012356000664">Everyone

the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey) has described the

for housing. In the first six months of last year, 500 landlords
started the process of removing tenants from their home. In that year,
only 377 new homes were built. If we want to know why, we must look to
the Government’s 60% cut to the budget for new and affordable
homes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000665" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0003.htm#13012356000665">Newcastle

for some families but had a devastating impact on the availability of
social housing in my constituency and in constituencies up and down the

believe that private sector landlords perform a useful and desirable
service, and we propose to introduce legislation to support them. As
the proportion of families in private rented homes increases we should
examine the behaviour of private rented landlords and the service that
they offer. For example, in Newcastle, the average weekly rent for
council housing is £67, and for housing association housing, it
is £79. However, for private rented housing, it is £120.
In Newcastle, private rented homes are to be found in some of the most
deprived wards. Newcastle has 14,000 private rented
households—12.7% of the housing market—but 37% of them
fail the decent homes standards, and 13.1% do not have central heating,

sector to remain vibrant and to become the tenure of choice for many

That is why I commend the Government’s £200 million build
to rent fund, which will change the face of landlords and see us 
<?notus-xml column=397?>move much more towards institutional investors who are interested in
longer-term settlements, rather than the accidental landlord who in

cost of vacancies is huge. Holding a vacant property is not what
professional landlords want to do, so as Jones Lang LaSalle pointed out
in their recent report, landlords can benefit from a longer tenure, as
well as tenants benefiting. If it is good for tenants and for
landlords, why is it not happening? My personal view of the solution to
the problems of the assured shorthold tenancy failing families is that
we should look towards a six-year term with rent reviews, which would
give landlords certainty of funding and would give tenants certainty.
It would fit quite well with the number of years that young people

going to increase and they could factor that into the rent when they
granted the lease. Also, tenants would be able to look forward to rent
increases and budget for them now, rather than the landlord putting the
rent up after a year to some unrealistic fee, forcing them to move. In
addition, those longer-term leases would require realistic break
clauses. The great benefit of the assured shorthold tenancy in its
current form is that it does not trap tenants in properties. It also
does not trap landlords into letting properties for longer than they
want to. Any new longer-term tenancy would need realistic rolling break

behalf of landlords, will often have a preclusion from granting a
tenancy over a year or two years. This is the exact opposite of the
commercial property sector, where banks will consent to longer leases

following measures: the regulation of letting agents and managing
agents, which has already been discussed; the establishment of a
national register of landlords, with local authorities including
Manchester city council given the powers to improve standards; the
reduction of barriers to residents getting the right to manage their
own blocks; and giving organisations such as leasehold valuation
tribunals—known as LVTs—real teeth, so that their
decisions cannot simply be ignored.</hs_Para>

will explain more about those points in a moment, but first I would
like to give the House my own view on why I think the private rented
sector needs further regulation. I believe that a huge market
distortion is costing the taxpayer a great deal of money. We have all
come across examples of letting agents charging fees and of people
having to pay onerous deposits, which they rarely get back. Less
publicised is the recent practice of asking potential tenants to
provide a guarantor. That involves a legally binding arrangement
whereby if someone fails to pay their rent, somebody else has to pay it
for them. In addition, potential tenants have to go through credit
checks, and we are now seeing a two-tier system in the rental market,
in which people who do not pass the credit check and cannot provide a
guarantor are consigned to living in very poor properties and paying
hugely inflated rents. Those rents could buy a luxury home in a more
desirable part of town, if those people were able to arrange that. I do
not believe that those rents accurately reflect the risk involved to
the landlords.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T17:32:25"></hs_TimeCode>Many of those
tenants are also in receipt of housing benefit, so those extortionate
rents are often being funded by the taxpayer. That is why the situation
needs to be looked at urgently.</hs_Para>

subject of managing agents is a big issue in my constituency, and it
will become a growing issue in many city centres as more and more
people start to live in managed blocks. The stories surrounding some,
but not all, of the managing agents operating in my constituency are
truly shocking. Time and again, I have come across the following
problems: high charges, along with poor service and maintenance;
charges being put up erroneously without warning; retrospective payment
demands for work or services that were not agreed to or were poorly
carried out; and long-term service contracts being awarded to associate
companies of the managing agents.</hs_Para>

example of that involves residents living in a riverside block in
Hulme, whose management fee has doubled since 2006 and is due to go up
a further 10% in April. They are powerless to prevent that. When
residents and owners try to come together to exercise their right to
manage, they often face high barriers. In some of the bigger blocks, it
is not always possible to find and mobilise the required ratio of
owners, because of the high number of absentee landlords.
Even<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T17:33:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T17:34:10"></hs_TimeCode>
when the majority of owners can be mobilised, and the right to manage
has been won, the legal barriers are considerable. When the residents
and owners of No. 1 Deansgate in the city centre won the right to
manage last year, the managing agent and freeholder were told that they
had 
<?notus-xml column=399?>no right of appeal, yet, with the help of the legal firm that they
hired, they were able to get an appeal agreed by the higher tribunal.
The residents and owners will continue to fight for their right to
manage, but the legal process has already cost them thousands of pounds
and is likely to cost them £10,000 more.</hs_Para>

challenges do not end when the right to manage has been won. Owners in
the Little Alex block in Moss Side manage their block, but the
freeholder takes out the buildings insurance with an associated
company, in what can only be described as a dubious arrangement. The
insurance includes a number of elements that the owners do not want.
The leasehold valuation tribunal has determined in favour of the
residents, yet the freeholder is continuing to charge them, and it
seems the LVT has no teeth whatever. That is why we need further
regulation—</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000691" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0003.htm#13012356000691"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="3965" UID="13012356001305" xid="43" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0003.htm#13012356001305">Mr

Hollingbery</B> (Meon Valley) (Con):</Member> In the interests of
allowing as many colleagues as possible to contribute to the debate, I
hope to keep my remarks very brief—five minutes is simply not
long enough to develop a substantial argument. We know that the private
letting market is extremely important in this country. Indeed, it is of
rising importance. The Communities and Local Government Committee
published in May 2012 our report “Financing of new housing
supply”, for which we took a great deal of evidence on the
barriers to investment in the private letting market, particularly from
institutional investors. That evidence was very important.</hs_Para>

regulation, and certainly uncertainty about it, can lead to
difficulties in encouraging meaningful institutional investment in new
supply. That is particularly important, because I believe firmly, as I
think do shadow Front Benchers and Government Front Benchers, that
large institutional investment in private rented housing is a really
interesting way forward for providing better and higher-standard
accommodation with long lets to more people across the country. We
should therefore do whatever we can to try to make that
happen.</hs_Para>

and the threat of more regulation put off investors. This is generally
due to the costs of compliance. Rogues ignore rules, so it has to be
demonstrated that the total costs of compliance by all landlords are
outweighed by improvement in the quality offer by the few. The paradox
may arise where regulations deter good quality investors and the
resultant accommodation shortages generate substantial financial
incentives for those prepared to flout the
rules.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13012356000695" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0003.htm#13012356000695">We
need to be careful to understand that a well-meaning regulation can
easily put off potential institutional investors, because their

if we need to provide more purpose-built private housing for rent, what
we need, ironically, is less regulation, not more. That will produce
housing owned by large-scale investors who will have a vested interest
in the long-term viability of their property portfolios and who are
much more likely to operate in an ethical and transparent way. I refer
hon. Members to Grainger in my constituency, which is putting together
exactly that sort of investment and development. I believe that is the
way forward. I believe that well-meaning regulation could be dangerous
in that regard. I absolutely understand the desire to regulate letting
agents more. That is essential, makes good sense and we should do more
of it, but we need to be very careful when we impose regulation on the
wider
marketplace.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13012356000883" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0003.htm#13012356000883">5.38

Collins</B> (Folkestone and Hythe) (Con):</Member> In the short time
available to me, I want to focus on an area of the private rented
sector that gives me particular cause for concern. As we have heard,
many people’s experience of the private rented sector will be
positive. They will have good landlords with an interest in maintaining
good properties because they want to supply the market and to have
competitive rents and full properties. That is what a lot of people,
institutions and organisations entering the sector will want. As we all
know, however, the poorer people on lower incomes or in receipt of
housing benefit, who are at the bottom end of the private rented
sector, tend to get the worst deal. Those are the sorts of people we
see in our surgeries, and Members across the House will be familiar
with the situation.</hs_Para>

am particularly angered by the behaviour of some landlords maintaining
properties in areas where they know there is a shortage of social
housing and a high demand for capacity. They will own a lot of cheap,
older properties that need a lot of work done on them, and they are
guaranteed an almost constant flow of tenants. Some will be enjoying
payments of rent and housing benefit directly from the local authority,
giving them a controlled and largely guaranteed income. They will know
that in most cases tenants cannot afford to 
<?notus-xml column=403?>move. If the tenants are unhappy, even though they are renting in the
private sector, they do not have the freedom that people with more
means have in deciding to end the agreement and move somewhere else.
People trapped in that situation will not have the means to move and
are stuck there.</hs_Para>

as I said earlier, local authorities have the power to take action
against landlords who are maintaining properties at a low level that is
causing risk of harm to their tenants, those landlords know that by the
time the property is inspected by the local authority and a request for
change is made, to which the landlord may be resistant, months can go
by before anything is done, if it is done at all. The tenants are stuck
and the landlords can largely do what they want.

not making those checks or enforcing measures against the private

serious issues face the private rented sector, including an appropriate
concern about rogue landlords—the House has heard accounts of
tenants living in substandard accommodation. There are various claims
about the extent of rogue landlords, and I hope that when the
Communities and Local Government Committee takes evidence it will be
able to identify the true extent of the problem. Tenants should feel
confident when they enter into an agreement that their landlord will
stick to his responsibilities. The question before the House is whether
regulation is the best route to deal with rogue landlords, and indeed
rogue letting agents.

shall give examples. One of the first pieces of casework I took up back
in 2005 concerned some pretty basic housing repairs. I visited my
constituent in Denton. He lived in an ex-council semi-detached property
built in the 1940s. The home next door was still in the public sector
and had just undergone a complete re-fit—new roof, new windows,
new doors, bathroom, kitchen and central heating—under the
Labour Government’s decent homes standard. Sadly, the house I
was looking at was not a complete mirror image. It had the original
1940s metal window frames. It was damp. It had a 1960s
kitchen that was falling to pieces. There was mould and the house was
cold and draughty. Worse, the landlord was based in the Irish Republic
and did not want to do any repairs. To add salt to the wound, the rent
on the property was almost £100 a month more than the rent on
the property next door. I thought then, and I believe now, that if it
is right to have the decent homes standard in the public sector, it is
right to have a decent homes standard for all homes.</hs_Para>

securing this important debate, and for the measured way their
Front-Bench team have introduced

consists of a shortage of the right sort of decent, affordable
property, with rogue landlords exploiting the situation, and an
insecurity of tenure existing in places where it should not. I used the
phrase “old problem” advisedly, because if anybody knows
anything about the Communities and Local Government Select Committee in
the previous Parliament, they will know that, under Phyllis Starkey,
who was then the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, it concentrated
fervently on housing issues. The Committee was not uncritical of
Government policy and initiatives, whether talking about decent homes,
empty homes, HMO regulation or pathfinders. It was rarely the case that
initiatives were judged by the Committee to be an unqualified
success.</hs_Para>

stimulate, and fear to regulate. In fact, I think there is a rule that
before introducing one regulation, they have to get rid of two. That is
a nice slogan, but ultimately a slightly mad policy. If the Government
do not stop regulating and the rule is applied consistently over time,
the logical consequence will be that there will be only one regulation

legitimate fear that in doing so we might create something that is more

afraid, many rogue landlords all around the country, but housing

regulating letting agents and management agents, we will be able to
protect tenants, reputable landlords and the reputations of trustworthy

it is a national scandal that public money is going into the pockets of

Government might disagree, I ask them to reconsider, given that
regulation of the private rented sector is a two-way stream, with
safeguards for landlords and tenants, bringing the support of the law

sometimes be, frankly, murky legal territory.</hs_Para>

the same thing is happening in many others. There are many things in

Dobson</B> (Holborn and St Pancras) (Lab):</Member> I believe that we
have a shortage of housing and that rents are too high. Being a simple
soul, it seems to me that the answers to those problems are fairly
clear: we need to build more housing, and we need to reduce rents. Let
me say to any Government Members who think we do not need to reduce
rents that in my constituency that the average weekly rent of a
two-bedroom flat in the private sector is £440 and the average
household income is £635 a week, and let me tell those who are
unable to do the calculation that the rent paid by such households
constitutes 70% of their income. We cannot 
<?notus-xml column=413?>allow that to go on, especially as rents are continuing to rise. One of
the benefits of introducing the regulation and reduction of exorbitant
rents is that it would save a lot of money for the taxpayer, who is
currently finding £9 billion for private sector landlords to
pocket. People who receive housing benefit do not keep the money in
their handbags and wallets; it goes to the landlords.</hs_Para>

also need to build more housing. People ask where the money will come
from. Well, the money saved on housing benefit for private landlords
could be used to build more homes, but my own view is that, because the
ridiculous process of pouring quantitative easing into the banks has
benefited no one except the banks themselves and has not stimulated the
economy, the money ought to be invested in housing. I am told that the
Bank of England and other banks around the world would find it
unacceptable if it did not go to a bank, and it therefore seems to me
that the obvious answer is to establish a housing bank to finance
housing. I hope that our Front Benchers will seriously consider that

about how to support and encourage the further expansion of the private
rented sector while raising standards and tackling poor conditions; how
to safeguard tenants from excessively high rents and exploitation; how
to avoid private rented housing being forced into inappropriate roles
that it is not well placed to fulfil; and the case for regulating

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T18:25:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey), but there is no
time for me to comment on them and so I shall focus on just two issues,
which have been touched on in the debate and which merit a little
further consideration.</hs_Para>

first issue is the case for longer-term tenancies, which has been
articulated by hon. Members on both sides of the House. Such tenancies
are entirely compatible with the growing confidence in the private
rented sector. I well understand how in the 1990s landlords who were
nervous about the prospect of regulation favoured the idea of shorthold
tenancies as the preferred option. In fact—this is an important
message—when the Housing Act 1988 was passed the shorthold
tenancy was not the default tenancy; the assured tenancy was the
default. That was changed in the 1990s by the then Government. One
measure that could send a clear message about our interest, across the
House, in encouraging more longer-term tenancies without imposing an
unreasonable regulation would be to return to the 1988 Act formulation,
making the assured tenancy the default and leaving the shorthold
tenancy as an option. I can see no objection to that. I tried to
intervene when the Minister was discussing this issue, and I hope that
now he has heard the case put to him in more detail than I could have
in an intervention he will give it serious consideration, because this
message could command support across the House. It would make a real
change and would encourage more longer-term tenancies.</hs_Para>

second issue I wish to touch on is the case for more institutional
investment. Again, we all agree on that, but I would like to add a
caveat. The studies undertaken by the academics who have done the best
work in this field—I think in particular of Christine Whitehead
at Cambridge university and Kathleen Scanlon at the London School of
Economics—show that in European countries with well-developed
private rented sectors institutional landlords are not the majority. In
Germany, which is often cited as the best example, 60% of
private landlords are small landlords. In France, 95% of private
lettings are done by one or two people only, and not by institutions.
So although it is sensible to encourage more institutional investment,
we should not be blind to the fact that the norm across Europe is that
the small landlord plays a rather important role, and we should not put
all our eggs into the basket of institutional investment. There is a
real merit in institutional investment—there is the natural
common interest of the landlord having a long-term view and welcoming
longer-term tenancies because that guarantees rent continuity. Those
are all good reasons for encouraging institutional investment, but we
should not treat it as the panacea. We must have a more diverse private
rented sector which continues to attract investment by smaller
landlords.</hs_Para>

the decades after the second world war, my father was able to arrive in
this country and get a mortgage for £6,000 on a house in Dongola
road in Tottenham, whereas my aunt got a brand new flat in a new
housing development called the Broadwater Farm estate. By the 1980s,
the explosion of cheap credit meant mortgages were affordable and many
now had the opportunity to buy their house for the first time. That was
not perfection by any means, but at least there was a choice. For those
who wanted affordable accommodation with a lengthy and secure tenure,
council houses were available; for those who wanted their own home,
mortgages were available and house prices were reasonable; and for
those who wanted the flexibility, there was an affordable private

situation did not last. Right to buy was not accompanied by funds to
replace and the Housing Act 1988 created assured shorthold
tenancies that allowed landlords the power to raise rent by however
much they wanted or evict tenants with only two months’ notice.
People were crowded out of renting socially and they have now been
priced out of home ownership. In place of those options, the private
rented sector has boomed. From a low of just 1.7 million at the start
of the 1990s, the number of households in the private rented sector has
more than doubled, but most are there through circumstance, not choice.
They enter the sector holding none of the cards. The result is that
people are conned, exploited and, frankly, ripped
off.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012356000806" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0004.htm#13012356000806">As
the sector booms, it is time to talk about how tenants can share in the
proceeds of that growth rather than being the victims of it. Right now
the system is rigged against the very people it is supposed to serve.
Every new tenant enters a sector where demand soars but supply remains
stagnant. The consequence is an explosion in rents, even during a
recession. Ten years ago, private rents averaged a fifth of weekly
earnings; today they are creeping towards a third. Those living in the
capital are finding that rent alone claims more than half of their pay,
and that is taking its toll. As Shelter has pointed out, 7.8 million
people are struggling to pay their rent each month.</hs_Para>

a compulsory register of landlords, such as that being pioneered in
Newham, which would at least create the minimum means by which the
worst landlords would no longer be able to operate. That is why we need
a new statutory code of practice for letting agents that ends the
practice of extortionate fees. There need to be tax incentives for
responsible landlords and we need to encourage longer tenancies with

the decent homes standard and was £100 a week. The
tenancy was secure, the family was happy—so was
everybody—and the children were doing well. The flat next door
was £440 a week and repairs were not done. The ex-council tenant
lives in Southend or wherever else and can apparently live comfortably
off the income from one flat bought under right to buy. What is going

afford to remain living in the area where their children go to school,
or where they work, and they cannot afford to stay there if members of
their family are unemployed but have caring duties relating to the

quite rare. On most occasions, the council is forced to house people in
the private sector, wherever it can find homes. Very few people are

houses in multiple occupation and uses the housing health and safety

in private rented accommodation that they can ill afford.</hs_Para>

dysfunctional mortgage market is making matters worse. Home ownership
is now beyond large numbers of people who would previously have aspired
to own their own home. This is contributing to the surge in the number
of private tenancies, which is the highest it has been for 50 years or
more. Most of those people are paying considerably more than they would
if they were buying their accommodation with a mortgage. It is not
surprising, therefore, that private rented sector rents have risen
twice as fast as wages in the past 10 years. That explains that
phenomenon.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012377000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0004.htm#13012377000013"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T18:47:36"></hs_TimeCode>Many

millions of our fellow citizens subject to insecurity and exploitation,
and a one nation housing strategy that tackles the unscrupulous
landlords who make so many people’s lives a misery. Of course
many landlords are perfectly reputable, but there are a significant
minority of rogue landlords who should be driven out of the market. The
motion before the House tonight would go some way to achieving that

37% of the private rented sector falling below the decent homes
standard, the time for action is now. With 4,000 unregulated lettings
agencies up and down the country, a laissez-faire approach is
unacceptable. A citizens advice bureau survey found that 73% of tenants
are dissatisfied with their lettings agency. I therefore do not agree
with the Housing Minister when he suggested that self-regulation was
the way forward. Meanwhile, rent levels in the private rented sector
are soaring and the housing benefit bill is ballooning. Recent research
by the House of Commons Library has shown that more than £9
billion or 40% of the £22.7 billion spent on housing benefit
each year goes to private landlords. Council housing accounts for
£5.6 billion and housing associations £7.9
billion.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Southport (John Pugh) talked about red tape
fetishism and, becoming rather distracted by planning to write his new
book, “Fifty Shades of Red”, ran out of time, but his
concern about regulation reminds us that not all regulation is bad. It
was therefore wrong for the Opposition’s motion to describe the
lettings sector as “unregulated”. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T18:55:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Calder Valley (Craig Whittaker) pointed out, there is a
large amount of regulation in this area. Surely the key should be to
find ways to make better use of existing powers and regulation before
seeking to introduce new regulation, a point that was drawn to our

rented

I have said, there are areas of concern, such as rogue landlords, which
many right hon. and hon. Members mentioned. I remind the House that
local authorities have a large number of wide-ranging powers that can
be used to bring tough and effective enforcement against bad landlords.
We reminded councils of those powers recently in our publication,
“Dealing with rogue landlords”. Some councils are doing
exemplary work, with enforcement teams, proactive inspections, the
development of clear and proper compliant reporting procedures and
landlord accreditation schemes, such as the excellent one in
Portsmouth. Of course, under the Housing Act 2004, in certain
circumstances councils can also introduce their own licensing schemes,
as has been mentioned. Really good examples include Sunderland, Leeds,
Hartlepool, Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley, Sedgefield and many
others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012377000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0004.htm#13012377000028">Another
thing that has not been mentioned so far in the debate is the need to
send a clear signal to rogue landlords that poor practice will not be
tolerated. That is why the caps on the level of fines for offences
under the 2004 Act will shortly be lifted. We believe that the
Opposition’s proposal for a national register of landlords, in
the way they have described it, would be too prescriptive, expensive
and over-centralised. It is worth reminding ourselves that
Labour’s own impact assessment stated that a full licensing
scheme would be onerous, difficult to enforce and would cost
£300 million. Surely we should be looking at local solutions to
local problems and developing the regulations that already
exist.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012377000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0004.htm#13012377000029"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T18:58:16"></hs_TimeCode>Concerns

of my
constituent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T19:25:14"></hs_TimeCode>,
Mr Damien Shannon, who has been refused a place at St
Hugh’s college, Oxford as he is unable to meet its financial
requirements. It will also allow me to make some more general points
about the growing importance of postgraduate education for individuals,
the economy and social
mobility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T19:25:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012377001079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0004.htm#13012377001079">Mr
Shannon lives in Salford. He is an intelligent and thoughtful young
man. He has sought to pursue his education in the past few
years despite his difficult financial circumstances. Damien obtained a
good degree in history and politics through the Open university, and
then wished to undertake a one-year MSc course. He applied to St
Hugh’s college, Oxford, and was absolutely delighted when he was
offered a place for October 2012. However, that place was contingent on
him being able to fulfil the financial requirements of the college, as
well as meeting its standards, and this was where the difficulties
began.</hs_Para>

has no financial support from his family. The fees for the one-year
taught MSc course were £10,000, and he managed to secure a
career development loan from the Co-operative bank to meet that
requirement. As the Minister knows, there is no student loan scheme for
post-graduate education, a subject I will return to later when I have
specific questions for
him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T19:26:35"></hs_TimeCode> to
answer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012377001081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0004.htm#13012377001081">Damien
had passed the academic test and had raised the funds to pay for his
fees. Then came the fatal blow. The college required a guarantee that
Damien had immediate access to £13,000, which the college deemed
necessary to meet his living costs during his period of study. First,
it said his rent would be £516.66 a month, which it claimed was
the cost of renting a reasonable sized room in shared accommodation at
market rates in the private rental market. That figure bears no
correlation to Oxford city council’s local housing allowance
figure, which is currently £342.98 for a room in shared
accommodation. However, the £516.66 figure is enforced
regardless of the rent an applicant actually has to pay.</hs_Para>

the college stipulated that an applicant should have £56.73 a
week for food. That is almost the entire sum that someone under 25 on
jobseeker’s allowance receives per week to meet all their
non-rental living costs. The college figure is based on the requirement
to eat a certain number of meals in college. Now, Damien has told me
that he is perfectly confident that he could cater for less, and indeed
does so now, but he was never given the chance to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T19:28:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012377001083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0004.htm#13012377001083"><Member ContinuationText="Mr David Lammy" PimsId="1400" UID="13012377002174" xid="346" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0004.htm#13012377002174"><B>Mr

Friend on bringing this matter to the House. Does she not agree that
the basis of our democracy must be that it is for students to determine
how much they have got to survive on once they get on to the course? It
is not for the university to determine that. If the university is
concerned, it should be reaching out to help students from poorer
backgrounds, not putting them off and hindering them in this
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T19:28:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Blears:</Member></B> I agree
entirely<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T19:28:28"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
the responsibility of students to be aware of their own personal
affairs. In this case, we are talking about postgraduate
students—some of the most intelligent people in the country. If
they are not capable of sorting out what they need to pay for their
rent and their food, I do not see that it is the place of a college to
interfere to that degree in private life. I also believe that it is for
universities to support people in these circumstances. I have made
inquiries at Oxford and at other universities. Of all the scholarships
that are available, none are means-tested, so they are not available or
targeted at people from poorer backgrounds. That needs to change. I had
a conversation with Oxford university this afternoon and there might be
a bit of progress, which I will tell the Minister about in
due
course.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T19:29:15"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

third issue—if hon. Members thought it could not get any worse,
it does—is that the college requires £1,050 per annum for
utilities and £2,700 for clothes, books and socialising. Oxford
university has one of three copyright libraries in the UK—it
contains a copy of every book that has ever been published—so I
am not sure why there is a need for money to buy books. As for clothes
and socialising—this relates to the point
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T19:29:41"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy) raised—how is it
right for the college to dictate such matters to postgraduate students,
who are some of the brightest people in the country?</hs_Para>

does concern me—the college refuses to allow income from
part-time earnings to fill the gap. It says that postgraduate study at
Oxford is too demanding, yet it employs its own graduates as junior
deans, junior welfare officers and teaching assistants. How can it be
that other part-time work—perhaps a couple of hours in a pub in
the evening or a Saturday morning job—would detract from someone
concentrating on their studies, while formal work as a teaching
assistant, junior dean or welfare officer does not? I do not believe
that doing a couple of hours’ part-time work would be
devastating to the demanding programme of study at Oxford.</hs_Para>

spoke yesterday to Universities UK, which told me that other
universities allow part-time work, as many students would otherwise
find it impossible to pursue postgraduate studies. I understand that
Oxford’s own figures, in its most recent report analysing
postgraduate studies, show that some 47% of applicants who were offered
places on academic merit have been unable to take up those offers
because of their inability to raise the necessary funds. Therefore,
nearly half of all those students are unable to take the next steps in
their education simply because they do not have enough money in the
bank.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13012377001088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0004.htm#13012377001088"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T19:31:10"></hs_TimeCode>I
contacted Oxford and St Hugh’s college to listen to their views
before this debate. I have not received a written response, despite
sending a lengthy letter, but this afternoon I had a rather
disappointing conversation with the pro-vice-chancellor for education
at Oxford. In seeking to justify the financial guarantee that is
required, she told me that other universities have a greater drop-out
rate, as students discover that they are unable to manage financially.
To some extent, by requiring a guarantee that nearly half the
applicants are unable to meet, Oxford effectively reduces its exposure
to risk. Its retention figures are bound to be better because half the
students, recognising that they are unable to meet the financial
requirements, do not take up their courses and are therefore not at
risk of dropping
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T19:31:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Blears:</Member></B> The case that my constituent has brought to my
attention relates to his application to St Hugh’s college, but
this afternoon I talked generally to the pro-vice-chancellor for
education, who talked to me about the whole of the Oxford system, so as
far as I am aware the problem applies across the piece.</hs_Para>

pro-vice-chancellor also explained to me that poorer students who could
not raise the funds could go off to work for a couple of
years—she gave me an example—and save up the money for
their courses. So, those with £21,000 up front can come straight
away and get on their postgraduate courses—and possibly have
access to better jobs and the wage premium that is available—but
those who do not have £21,000 have to go away to work and save
up. That seems to be unfair and discriminatory on the grounds of
income.</hs_Para>

pro-vice-chancellor also told me that Oxford had raised £30
million in order to be able to support graduate students. I am
absolutely delighted about that, but again, so far none of that money
has been directed towards students from poorer backgrounds, which is
absolutely essential. She obviously wants a national system of
postgraduate student loans, but I have said clearly that, in the
absence of a national system, it is not good enough for universities
simply to wait for that to happen. If the university has £30
million, it is vital that some of it should be targeted towards people
in circumstances such as those faced by my constituent Mr Shannon. I am
therefore pleased that the pro-vice-chancellor has said that the
university will look at what it can do with the significant sums that
it has been able to raise.</hs_Para>

to it to ask whether such a requirement is in breach of the public
benefit requirements contained in the Charities Act 2011. More
generally, will he explain why there is no student loan scheme in place

they provide a gateway to better-paid jobs and are therefore a crucial
element in promoting social

Shannon walked into my constituency surgery just 10 days ago. Until
that moment, I had no idea that Oxford university, and possibly others,
was operating a system of selection of postgraduate students based not
on academic merit alone, but on wealth and having immediate access to
cash funds for rent, food, dining in college, clothes and for
socialising. By its own admission, almost half the students who have
the academic ability to pursue their studies are unable to take up
their places because they simply do not have the money required. In my
view, that is simply wrong. Not only does it crush the hopes and
ambitions of these students who cannot afford to study at some of our
best universities, it deprives our country and our economy of some of
the brightest and best minds we could have. It is unfair and

Minister for Universities and Science (Mr David Willetts):</Member></B>
I congratulate the right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles (Hazel
Blears) on raising this issue. Let me immediately agree with her that
it involves some very important wider issues, to which I shall turn
shortly. I hope she will appreciate, however, that although she has
spoken about her constituent Damien Shannon in conditions of
parliamentary privilege—and I have read about him in the
newspapers as well—a legal case is pending as a result of a
dispute between him and the Oxford college concerned. It would be
difficult for me to take up some of the specifics to which she
referred, not just because there is to be a court hearing but because
of a wider issue, namely the autonomy of our universities. That
autonomy was most recently embodied in legislation passed by the last
Government, which made clear that it was not for Parliament—or
Government—to instruct universities on their admission policies.
It is therefore hard for me to discuss the specific case of this
individual and this
university.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012377001106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0004.htm#13012377001106">I
do, however, completely understand the wider issues raised by the right
hon. Lady. Let me begin by making it clear that post-graduate education
is becoming far more important. There is an increasing range of jobs
for which a postgraduate qualification is expected, and Alan Milburn
was right to describe that as a growing challenge in the area of social
mobility and the spreading of opportunity.</hs_Para>

career as a civil servant, entering the Treasury as a former
undergraduate with a single degree, but most people who join the
Treasury now probably have a postgraduate qualification. I am not sure
that it has made the conduct of economic policy any better, but that is
beside the point. The qualification levels among people entering those
jobs and, indeed, many of the professions has changed in a generation,
and that is the background to the wider debate about postgraduate
qualifications.</hs_Para>

followed the arguments about these matters very closely. In fact, in
the past two and a half years we have hardly changed Government funding
for postgraduate study. Notwithstanding all the controversy about our
changes to undergraduate finance and despite the wider need for public
expenditure control, we have been able—along with the Higher
Education Funding Council—to sustain, broadly, past levels of
funding for postgraduate education. HEFCE’s allocation for
taught postgraduate provision is being maintained at about £135
million and it will provide about £235 million for postgraduate
research degree supervision support, while the research councils will
spend about £340 million on postgraduate research
provision.</hs_Para>

occasionally read about reductions in support for postgraduate
provision. In tough times we have been able to maintain that support,
but because postgraduate qualifications are becoming increasingly
important, the salience and significance of the debate about access to
them becomes ever greater. That is why the right hon. Lady has raised
the issue this evening, and, as I have said, I accept her
point—and Alan Milburn’s point—that we must not
erect a new barrier to the spread of
opportunity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012377001110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0004.htm#13012377001110"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T19:44:19"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Hazel Blears" PimsId="4035" UID="13012377002179" xid="51" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/debtext/130123-0004.htm#13012377002179">Hazel

ability to benefit from education at any level were not able to take
that opportunity. I have just heard the figure that the right hon. Lady
cites, having not previously been aware of it. Successive Governments
have not been able to extend a general financial support to
postgraduate students. I do not want to get into discussing cases of
individual universities, but Oxford university argues that it
understands the need for more scholarship support so that people are
not debarred from postgraduate study at Oxford by financial pressures.
My understanding is that in only the most recent few months it has
raised £30 million in extra support. I heard, as I am sure hat
the administration governing bodies at Oxford will have done, the right
hon. Lady’s points about the case for scholarships linked to
need and financial circumstances. However, successive Governments have
so far not been able to offer a general Exchequer support for
postgraduate students. No Government have even been able to offer a
means-tested maintenance grant for these students. It is very hard for
any Government to go straight into

me take the right hon. Lady through some of the wider arguments. First,
like her, I have read the report by the Higher Education
Commission—I have read several recent reports. I do not think I
am breaking any confidence by saying that I recall being shadow
Secretary of State, discussing this issue with the then Secretary of
State, Lord Mandelson, as he now is, and urging that the terms of
reference for the Browne review be drawn so broadly as to include
postgraduate provision—I remember proposing that to him. The
terms of reference for Browne would have made it possible for Browne to
make proposals for postgraduate provision, but Browne 
<?notus-xml column=437?>rather ducked the issue. He focused on these very old proposals on
undergraduate provision, and all he said on postgraduates was that the
situation needed to be monitored. We of course came into government and
received the conclusions from the report, which the previous Government
had commissioned. By and large—not perfectly—we acted on
those provisions, including by asking Adrian Smith, who was then a
senior official in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
and is now at HEFCE, to monitor what is happening to postgraduate
education. This matter was covered by the terms of reference for the
inquiry that Labour set up and we have complied with the proposals from
that report on monitoring the situation, but Browne was not able to

Lammy:</Member></B> Does the Minister recognise the urgency of the
issue, given the changing nature of our economy? Students now need
postgraduate education far more than previously and are also unlikely
to have the money. At the same time, the sector has become truly
global. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles
(Hazel Blears) has shown,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T19:49:33"></hs_TimeCode> feeling is
that institutions such as Oxford are more keen to take overseas
students with the cash than local British students. The figures show
that British students are losing out in these circumstances. That is

focused on the wider social mobility issue and neither has tried to
claim that the changes to undergraduate finance are the problem. Of
course, the monthly and annual repayments of student loans for

the right hon. Lady was calling for. There are risks as well as
attractions in that approach, and the biggest single risk is that as
soon as we had a general public expenditure programme or loans scheme,
the Treasury would immediately become interested in how many people

respond<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T09:30:21"></hs_TimeCode>? I am
pleased to introduce this debate on such an important subject. A number
of people have worked hard on this issue for a long time, and I am glad
that their work has now come to fruition in this debate. The debate is
on access to medicine for people with terminal illness, which is a

that people with a terminal illness have access to medicine should
concern us all. Unfortunately, such illnesses will affect many people,

no drugs are available to help them to overcome their
condition.</hs_Para>

hope that it is an area of common ground that we need to speed up the

cumbersome and expensive. The Minister and I would agree on that,

it.</hs_Para>

added to the time taken for a new drug to go from the development stage
through to phase 3 and beyond. It is also very expensive, incurring
costs of more than £1 billion, and it can take more

is an example of a rare disease for which there is no cure. It is a
horrible disease, involving—over a period—all the organs
of the body shutting down, leading inevitably to death. About 5,000
people in the UK suffer from MND; one in every 100,000 or so people
will be diagnosed with it each year. The condition affects twice as
many men as women.</hs_Para>

outlook for people with MND is very poor. People with limb-onset MND
will live for three to five years, and people with bulbar-onset and
respiratory-onset MND will live for even less time—probably two
to three years—but slightly more fortunately, people with other
less common types of MND can live for much longer and some people have
lived with MND for decades; for example, the physicist Stephen Hawking,
who was diagnosed with MND more than 40 years
ago<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T09:34:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000017">One
medication, called riluzole, can extend the lifespan of some people
with MND, but it has a very limited effect; on average, it only extends
life expectancy by about three to six months. The drug was developed
more than 20 years ago, and in the subsequent years, no new drug for
MND has been developed or approved. So the real purpose of the debate
is to highlight the lack of new drug development for people with rare
and life-threatening
diseases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T09:34:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T09:35:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000018">Having
applied his statistical approach to the problem and having talked to
leading experts from around the world, Les has concluded that it is
very probable that it will require more than one drug to treat MND
effectively. The problem is that clinical drug trials normally only
test a single drug, which ignores the possibility that, as with the
treatment of HIV, a cocktail of more than one drug is
required<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T09:35:27"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T09:35:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
That is the key. Reform of how we develop, test and approve drugs is
therefore crucial. Les sums it up in his own
words<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T09:30:42"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T09:30:42"></hs_TimeCode>:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13012337000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000154">“Imagine
a world where MND patients worldwide have access to drugs at this stage
of testing— they are proven safe for humans, and possibly known
to be efficacious in other neurological diseases, just not for MND
specifically. Patients are given the freedom to choose which drugs they
think might help them; the process is monitored, and patients and
doctors alike con report on their effects. Data is stored centrally,
and thus can be analysed to determine the effects of individual drugs
and of drug combinations. Ideally this requires some way of objectively
measuring the progress of the disease—something which has not
been possible in the case of MND in the
past.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13012337000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000155"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T09:36:25"></hs_TimeCode>However,
huge strides have been made recently in determining biomarkers for
MND— measurable characteristics that reflect the progress of the

rare diseases that would benefit from this approach. Once a volume of
data has been collected from thousands of patients worldwide, this can
then be analysed and used to inform future research into these
diseases, and influence investment from pharmaceutical

a recent article for <I>QJM: An International Journal of Medicine</I>,
Professor Lachmann sets out his argument in more detail, and I warn
Members that this bit of my speech is slightly legalistic. He focuses
on the change in legislation in the 1980s, when the Consumer Safety Act
1978 was supplanted by the Consumer Protection Act 1987, which
introduced the European product liability directive into UK law. In
Professor Lachmann’s view, under the Consumer Safety Act, if a
patient agreed to take a medicine that they knew had not been fully
tested and thereby assumed the risk themselves, that prohibited any
claim by them if some harm later materialised. Unfortunately, the
Consumer Protection Act changed that, by introducing a system of strict
liability, under which a person or company is legally responsible for
the damage or loss caused by their acts or omissions, regardless of
culpability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T09:42:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Lachmann rightly concluded that it is often the fear of litigation that
drives a great deal of the regulation of medicines and, therefore, a
significant amount of the cost behind drug development. Let us not
forget that the cost of new drugs is also preventing small and
medium-sized enterprises in the life sciences sector—many of
them in our constituencies—from developing in the way that they
should.</hs_Para>

Lachmann sets out four solutions, and I should be grateful to the
Minister if she considered them carefully. First, we should abolish
strict liability in this area and replace it with liability based on
negligence. Secondly, we should revise the definition of negligence, so
that in deciding whether it was negligent to seek to develop a new
drug, account is taken of the consequences of doing nothing, as well as
the consequences of trying to do something. Thirdly, we should change
the law on waivers, so that any patient who is prepared to try a new
medicine, with the risk that it may have unknown side effects, is at

turn now to the report by the Select Committee on Health on NICE. The
report, published on 16 January, touched on issues that are highly
relevant to the debate. The Committee was highly critical of the delay
in setting out precisely what a value-based pricing system for drugs
entails. I share its concern, yet the section of the report focusing on
research data and access to clinical trial data troubled me most. It is
deeply concerning that drug companies have been allowed to withhold
information about drug trials. Members should think about that for a
minute. If a drug is developed, but it has unwarranted side effects and
does not do the job it is supposed to, no one will know about research.
Other drug companies will come along, do exactly the same research all
over again and will have exactly the same problems. Surely, therefore,
it is in everyone’s interests that the information is
published.</hs_Para>

many times have we heard of patients with no hope suddenly going into
remission? An example concerning a child with cancer recently came to
my attention. The doctor advised no more treatment, but the sister of
the little boy was not ready to say goodbye, and for her sake the
family asked for one more course of chemo to prolong the time left and
prepare the other child for the expected death. The little boy
responded to the chemo that was given in the hope of allowing a few
more weeks of life; but that time has turned into six months. Who knows
what the future holds? The point I am making is that there are probably
many examples from across the United Kingdom where a wee bit of 
<?notus-xml column=81?>extra effort can be made and where it may not be necessary to prepare
for the inevitability of death, if there is also a possibility of life
through drug treatment. Imagine if that family had not been allowed to
ask for, or the doctor had had the power simply to refuse, the last
bout of chemotherapy. That is not an everyday occurrence, but it does
happen and it should give us reason to pause and think before making
drastic

2008 the Labour Government announced a range of proposals aimed at
improving the care available to patients with life-threatening

change to the way the National Institute for Health and Clinical

affect only small numbers of people. The hon. Member for The Cotswolds

Gentleman for making those extremely good points. The point he makes
about cystic fibrosis crystallises the health service’s dilemma.
A small drug company came to me the other day, and told me that it has
developed an absolute cure for a certain type of cystic fibrosis if it
is caught very early in life. The problem is that the drug will have to
be administered for life, and the life cost of the drug for the very
small number of people whom the drug will absolutely cure, and whose
quality of life it will improve, is £180,000. That is why his
remarks on the need to drive down the cost of developing drugs in this

will now illustrate the need for drugs for three categories of people.
The first category is those with dementia. There has been debate in the
House and in the papers over the past week on dementia treatment. In
Northern Ireland, we do not have the highest diagnosis rate for
dementia in the United Kingdom, but at 63% the diagnosis rate is high.
The support services are perhaps not as equal to that as they should
be, which we will take up with the Minister to see how we can
improve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000066">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T10:02:59"></hs_TimeCode>
facts are that some 370,000 people have not yet been diagnosed for
dementia treatment—first it is diagnosis, and then it is
drugs—so there is a combination of how the health system works
best. People are given drugs including Aricept, which reduces symptoms
and slows progression. The drugs might not always cure the ailment or
disease, but they certainly can improve life and make it a wee bit more
amenable<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000067">The
second category is cancer, and there will not be a family in the whole
country that has not been touched in some way by cancer. The Government
have set up what they refer to as a “fast track” for
cancer patients. There is some indication that the fast track is
perhaps not working in the way that it should, but the Government have
a £750 million cancer strategy, which plays a key
role<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. As with
dementia, the strategy is diagnosis, early intervention and prevention

category is breast cancer. A new breast cancer drug has had some
coverage in the press over the past few weeks. The Minister has been
tremendous in her response to our points, and perhaps she could give us
some indication of how that drug will be made available to those with
breast cancer. The drug has the potential to prolong life. The papers
have said that, for some people, the drug can prolong life for 20
years. Such drugs must be available if that is the case. I am keen to

once had the opportunity to attend a session with the National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence when it was investigating
a particular drug for a complaint called ankylosing
spondylitis—I have not written that in my notes, so
<I>Hansard</I> is on its own. The session was robustly and impressively
chaired, and the drug and issues concerning it were thoroughly
examined. During my period in Parliament, NICE has come up again and
again, and various complaints have been raised by Members of
Parliament, the pharmaceutical industry and patient
groups<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T10:07:50"></hs_TimeCode>. One
complaint is about the inordinate time it often takes to develop a
drug, which certainly appears to be the case; the other complaint, made
by big pharma, is the cost that NICE adds to the development of
drugs.</hs_Para>

example of India has been cited, but I am not sure that that is a good
parallel. I have been to India and spoken to pharmaceutical companies
out there, and they seem to specialise not in developing the more
esoteric lines of drugs but in developing and marketing lines of
generic drugs or taking up drugs that are out of patent and producing
them at less cost than their western
counterparts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000076">NICE<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T10:09:41"></hs_TimeCode>
would genuinely acknowledge that it adds to the cost of development,
but there is also a question about its rigorous but circumscribed
methodology. There were many debates in this place a few years ago
about Alzheimer’s drugs, and the issue appeared to be not that
the drugs do not work, but that they do not work for everyone in a
sufficiently predictable way for NICE to approve them; although I have
met constituents who can genuinely testify to the benefit of a drug
that NICE is not prepared to go
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T10:09:06"></hs_TimeCode>. Of course,
there are similar cases in which people genuinely disagree with
NICE’s decisions. Most Members of Parliament will, at some time
during their career, write a letter on behalf of a constituent who
simply cannot get a drug because  a primary care trust is
sheltering behind the mantra that NICE does not approve. All that set
aside, NICE represents a model that has been emulated worldwide,
because with NICE we end up with cost-effective, efficacious and safe
drugs.</hs_Para>

the case I witnessed in NICE headquarters many years ago, I was
surprised that sufferers with that particular complaint were in the
room and thoroughly involved in the process. As the process went on,
however, I discovered that one of the people—the reference
point, as it were, for the piece of research—had died during the
project. That, perforce, will happen many times if one enlists people
already diagnosed with a terminal illness; some people’s needs
are more urgent, some have less to lose and in the case of terminally
ill people, some are not classified in that way unless there is no
available
cure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000078">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T10:16:09"></hs_TimeCode>
reasonable case can be made for relaxing the rules, to have more trials
and to get more innovation in such circumstances; patients, science,
medicine and future patients would all benefit, provided, of course,
that the patient was genuinely a volunteer and properly advised of the
risks. Another proviso I have just thought of, as India was mentioned,
is that the volunteer was afflicted with the particular complaint,
because in no way would we be happy with a world where people were
trialling drugs for reasons other than their own
benefit<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000079">The
question is, should we have a more flexible system than the orthodox
one that we have put in place through NICE? I was at a breakfast this
morning about NHS research, and I was pleased to learn that over the
past decade or so, the number of NHS patients featuring in research has
increased appreciably. Apparently, a decade or so ago, only about 2% of
cancer patients featured in a clinical trial or piece of research,
whereas now the figure is some 20%, which is a significant improvement,
so we must not kid ourselves that even in the orthodox setting of the
NHS valuable pieces of research are not being
conducted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000080">As
I see it, there are still arguments against what Les is suggesting, and
he must be acutely aware of the force of some of those arguments. The
Minister is a lawyer 
<?notus-xml column=86?>and, even with a disclaimer in advance, it is difficult to avoid the
spectre of litigation if a drug that has not been thoroughly
stress-tested is in use; it is hard to assure oneself that it is not at
least a possibility. Cost might still be an issue, if the drug is very
expensive, and the NHS has to consider carefully whether to spend a lot
of money, perhaps to no effect. There is always the possibility of an
unsafe medicine or of one that has not been thoroughly tested having
catastrophic effects and worsening someone’s decline. That can
happen even when the drug is tested; everyone can recall that
thalidomide was tested, quite thoroughly in some respects, but not to
the nth degree, with disastrous
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T10:12:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000081">Such
entirely valid considerations are not a case against a different regime
in principle, they are a case against what might be regarded as a

said, all medicines have side effects. The worst thing someone can do
when prescribed a medicine is to take out of its box the long sheet
listing all the possible side effects; if they read it, they simply
would not take the medicine, regarding themselves as safer by not
taking it. Where a drug has no known side effects and there are genuine
grounds for belief in its potential benefits, some sort of pre-approval
system is genuinely arguable for terminally ill patients, rather than
having to wait for full NICE approval—the full works.
Flexibility is not a non-legitimate demand in any context. We have to
bear in mind that although there are general rules, there will always
have to be sensible provisos, exceptions and caveats about an
application<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T10:14:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000082">I
am reminded of the forthcoming ban on the use of opiates when driving.
I am obviously keen that people under the influence of methadone or
heroin do not take those drugs and then get in a car. Some people,
however, have long-term, chronic conditions and are taking an opiate,
but they are well used to the symptoms provoked and could or should be
safely allowed to drive a car. I am sure that they would drive the car
with no difficulty at all. Whatever rules we have need to be flexible
for such cases. Likewise, whatever rules we have about the safety of
medicines need to recognise that for some people, the environment in
which they are taking the medicines, their circumstances and the risks
they face are quite
different<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T10:15:05"></hs_TimeCode>. We

I agree with the hon. Gentleman on another extremely important
issue—I did not expect him to raise it, but he did. If we are
looking at a more innovative, research-based NHS, it would help
enormously if pharmaceutical companies signposted the dead ends they
have been down, indicating where things had not worked. That would save
enormous sums of money, possibly for their competitors but certainly
for the health of the nation and the NHS. I congratulate the hon.

constituents who have suffered from such debilitating illnesses and

individuals—individuals can make a difference. We must look at
what we can do to improve access to medicines and we must continue to
explore ways and methods to encourage the synthesis of new drugs and to
make those available to patients as soon as possible, while also
maintaining the fundamental focus on patient safety, as has been said.
That is a fine balance to strike and I look forward to learning how the

it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T10:18:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000088">Making
new, safe and effective treatments available to all patients who
require them must be the end goal, but it cannot be an isolated goal.
We must look at ways to increase the availability of already licensed
drugs and we must look at non-drug-based treatments as well, which can
vastly improve the quality of life for patients in need. A number of
charities have expressed a view that a move to adaptive licensing of
drugs could benefit patients. The European Medicines Agency

Licensing seeks to maximise the positive impact of new drugs on public

must be recognised that adaptive licensing would bring a number of
benefits, such as encouraging pharmaceutical industries to develop new
drugs and to bring them into service quickly. It is suggested that new
drugs could be available after phase 2 testing, the main focus of which
is safety rather than
efficacy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T10:19:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000090">There
are, however, a number of issues with that approach. After phase 2
testing, drugs might be expected to be safe for human consumption, but
the efficacy of any drug would still not be proven. Going on to prove
efficacy at stage 3 could raise some ethical and personal difficulties.
At present, a phase 3 trial is needed to demonstrate that any drug is
effective. Under adaptive licensing, would those with early access be
classified as 
<?notus-xml column=88?>part of a conventional phase 3 trial? If early access formed part of a
conventional phase 3 trial, would existing trial guidelines be
maintained for the use of data received on early access recipients?
Clearly, ethical and personal issues would arise from both
questions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000091">First,
how can the efficacy of one drug be compared with that of another,
existing drug, or with a placebo? Using blind tests in which one drug
is administered to one group, and another drug or placebo is
administered to another group would raise ethical issues. Doctors might
knowingly deny access to a drug that has been proven to be effective
because of the chance that a new drug could also be effective.
Secondly, on a personal level, how could we be sure that patients are
fully comfortable with and aware of the risks of taking medicines
before they are fully approved under the current system? I acknowledge
the point made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T10:20:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for The Cotswolds about the patient being in charge of the choices with
which they are presented, and more fundamentally in charge of their own

must be careful not to suggest that adaptive licensing is risk-free and
the only logical solution to a problem. Patients participating in early
adoption of medicines might have better access, but there would be
clear and obvious risks. That is not to say that we should discourage
the synthesis of drugs that are less effective than those that already
exist. The development of drugs is clearly a highly precise science,
but the application and treatment of medicines sometimes resembles an
art form. For some patients, the most effective available drugs are
useless and, for want of a better phrase, less effective drugs could be
invaluable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000093">I
raise these issues not because we should oppose the introduction of
adaptive licensing, but because we must fully explore the ramifications
of introducing a change on this scale, and I look forward to hearing
how the Minister plans to tackle these delicate and fine issues. We
must also understand what it would mean for our life sciences and our
research and development capability in the UK, but first and foremost,
and fundamentally, what it would mean for patients and patient
choice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000094">In
the spirit of this debate, we should look at ways to improve care and
provision of other types of available treatment, such as care
facilities in communities, and assistance for patients at home. The
care a patient receives does not depend solely on the medicines they
receive, although clearly that is hugely important, and we should
continue to explore ways in which that can be widened.</hs_Para>

noted that, as other hon. Members have said, very few drug options are
available to people with terminal illnesses such as multiple sclerosis
and motor neurone disease. As well as doing everything we can to speed
up the development of new drugs while protecting patients’
well-being, we should explore other methods of treatment for those with
terminal illnesses. We must all acknowledge that the NHS is always
changing as society changes. The art of drug and medicine application
demands a more bespoke and tailored patient experience and more
wide-ranging treatments.</hs_Para>

behind adaptive licensing is commendable, and one that anyone would
find difficult to oppose. It would ensure better access to drugs, but
it would not necessarily alter things that much. As has been said,
pharmacology recycling bins are filled with trials for 
<?notus-xml column=89?>promising new medicines that ultimately proved to be ineffective or even
dangerous. Loosening access to trial drugs requires greater peer
reviewing of early data and methodology to ensure patient
safety.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000097">There
is a strong argument for allowing more off-label prescribing of drugs
that have already passed safety tests. They could be an option open to
doctors and patients if they are believed to be effective in treating a
condition they were not originally intended for, and I would be
extremely interested in hearing what the Minister has to say about
that. Even if adaptive licensing was adopted now with a robust system
of safeguards in place to protect the well-being of patients, those
with terminal illnesses would not start to see improved access for a
number of years. We are all aware that drug manufacturing does not
happen overnight.</hs_Para>

harsh realities of debates such as this is that changing regulations
today will not benefit patients tomorrow or the day after. What we need
right now is improved care for those with terminal illnesses, and
support for their carers. Improved facilities offering specialised care
would go some way to improving patients’ quality of life, as
would earlier, faster diagnosis of terminal conditions. All Members of
Parliament have heard of cases of suffering that could have been
prevented, and diagnosis that could have been earlier, resulting in a
better experience for patients and their
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000099">Access
to drugs may vary throughout the country and that cannot be tackled by
a fractured system. That is a huge concern as we move towards April and
beyond. I hope the Minister will explain how she can guarantee that a
clinical commissioning group in Cornwall meets the same standard in
access to medicine as a group in Cumbria. Adaptive licensing would
improve access to drugs, but not without risks, and I hope the Minister
will be able to outline a safe and secure framework that could be put
to the House for greater scrutiny. At this stage, not enough research
has been done to guarantee that access to drugs can be expanded through
adaptive licensing without exposing patients to ineffective and
potentially dangerous drugs. I hope that much more work will be done to
show that a patient’s well-being and quality of life can be
protected while ensuring that more drugs are made

been contacting Members of Parliament, urging them to make all the

to NICE, once effective new drugs are brought to market, it is
important, as we all know, that they are made available to the patients
who will benefit most from them on terms that represent value to the
NHS—that means, of course, value to the taxpayer. NICE has
played an important role in that by providing robust, evidence-based
guidance to the NHS on drugs and treatments. In the great majority of
cases, NICE now publishes draft or final guidance on significant new
drugs within a few months of their launch. In 2011, for drugs appraised
using its single technology appraisal methodology—the
methodology used for the great majority of new drugs—NICE issued
draft or final guidance an average of four months after the date of
market authorisation. The end-of-life flexibilities introduced into
NICE’s appraisal process from 2009 have allowed a number of
important drugs for terminal illnesses affecting a small number of
patients to be made available on the
NHS.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000121">The
NHS constitution sets out patients’ rights to medicines
positively appraised by NICE, underpinned by a statutory funding
direction. In December 2011, the NHS chief executive’s report,
entitled “Innovation, Health and Wealth”, introduced a
NICE compliance regime to help to ensure that medicines approved by
NICE are made available on the NHS quickly and consistently.
Furthermore, since the cancer drugs fund started operating in October
2010, more than 25,000 patients have received cancer drugs that they
would previously have been denied. Our priority is to give NHS patients
better access to effective and innovative medicines. That is why we

intended to eliminate all risk, but could there not be  a
system whereby, for people with a terminal illness, a drug might be
given a provisional licence on a fully informed patient basis so that
it could be trialled by those people, perhaps for the benefit of others
coming along afterwards? Secondly, could she comment on the issue of

That is a very difficult issue. It is the subject of almost endless
debate in this place, or at least it should be. For what it is worth,
my personal view is that often these matters should be the subject of
discussion between a patient and their GP. Although it was many years
ago that my father faced a terminal illness, he spoke at length, before
the final stages of his illness, with our then general practitioner,
who was utterly brilliant, about his death and how that death could be
in some way planned for, if it is ever possible to do such a thing.
Sometimes that can be done. There is sometimes a certain amount of
flexibility to be able to plan a death and to say what one does and
does not want.
These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T10:43:30"></hs_TimeCode> are
intensely personal matters. I sometimes think that there is a danger of
over-regulation and almost too much transparency, if there can ever be

other thing to say is that families, too, often feel excluded from many
of these decisions. It is important that families are involved as much
as possible, especially when the person is quite elderly. We all know
the sorts of case that exist. Perhaps this is an old-fashioned view,
but I think that the unique and very special relationship between a

incredibly important, and there should almost be an acceptance that it

system. I know that there is a great deal of research, which is being
led by the desire of doctors  to improve clinical outcomes. The
doctors often go to great research institutions and say, “How
can you help us to develop this?” or “How can we solve

have contacted the two councils in my constituency to ask them how they
intend to allocate the additional funding. Stafford borough council has
been working with housing associations to identify tenants affected by
the new legislation. It will be concentrating its extra funding, which
I estimate to be some £75,000, on disabled people whose property
has been adapted and on foster carers; the support will be for 12
months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T11:03:22"></hs_TimeCode>. South
Staffordshire district council, which has an additional £64,000
funding, will give short-term support, one to three months, to disabled
people with property adaptations. The support is short term, because
the council wishes to assess the situation before it commits to the
longer
term.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T11:03:36"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

have been proactive in arranging mutual exchanges of properties between
those who have spare rooms and those who are overcrowded—they
have been doing exactly what the Government wish to encourage. However,
both councils face serious shortages of one-bedroom properties for
couples or singles, as much of the housing in the area has two
bedrooms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T11:03:59"></hs_TimeCode>. That
raises two questions for the Minister. First, can councils be sure that
they will continue to receive at least the level of additional funding
each year for discretionary housing payments that has been granted in
2013-14? Given that much of the funding will be for disabled claimants
in adapted properties in which they are likely to live for many years,
the need for DHPs will
continue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T11:04:16"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondly, is the guidance for the assessment of the number of rooms
required by disabled people being set out in the terms that the
Minister used to me in the House last year? In addition to the case I
mentioned, there are instances where disabled people live on their own
or as a couple in a two-bedroom property with little or no storage
space, and they tend to use the second room, which is often small, to
store equipment that they need—perhaps a wheelchair or a
mobility scooter.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T11:04:47"></hs_TimeCode> understanding
of the Minister’s comments in the House last year is that the

He is right: in the two cases that I have outlined of Stafford borough
council and South Staffordshire district council, we can already see
some differences. Those differences have arisen not for ideological
reasons, but because each council takes a slightly different approach.
I am all in favour of local councils making their own decisions, but if
we end up with a situation wherein some councils’ conditions for
DHPs are drastically different from those of other councils, there will
be serious problems.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T11:06:26"></hs_TimeCode>Of course, there

continue discussing space, the size of the rooms also needs to be
considered, but the rules specifically rule that out. A typical tenancy
agreement may describe the bedrooms as “two plus one plus
one”—in other words, one double bedroom and two single
bedrooms. The single bedrooms are described as single for a
reason—they are often very, very small, as I have seen for
myself. Yet a family comprising, for example, a couple and two boys
under 16 would be considered as under-occupying that type of
property<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T11:07:08"></hs_TimeCode>. The
rules encourage that family to move to a two-bedroom property, which
may itself be described as “two plus one” and where they
would effectively be in breach of the tenancy. Surely, size of rooms
needs to be taken into account when determining whether there is
under-occupancy. I ask the Minister to reconsider the
rules.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000143">Of
course, the family that I have just spoken about might not be able to

and it is probably the most significant reason why disabled people are
by far the most likely to be affected by the changes to the housing
benefit rules, given that, as the impact assessment stated, disabled
people will tend to be in smaller households. There is nothing that
disabled people, or indeed anyone else who is affected, can do about

understand the Government’s need to get to grips with the
housing benefit bill, and I will come on to that issue in a moment. I
know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions considers these matters extremely carefully, and I have had
personal discussions with him about them. I agree that there is a need
to try to free up the larger housing stock for those people who are

the Minister say whether, in allocating DHPs between councils, any
allowance has been made for those areas in which there is short supply
of the one-bedroom housing that is most suited to disabled people who
are living on their own or as couples without the need for a carer? If
no such allowance has been made, that needs to be taken into
consideration, at least for while, until councils or housing

properties.</hs_Para>

of the reasons for introducing the rules are to
encourage greater mobility within the social rented

important reasons at a time when families are struggling in overcrowded
accommodation—a situation I am sure that all Members know of
from their
surgeries.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T11:09:49"></hs_TimeCode> The
problem is in the application for existing tenants who are affected by
the changes, two thirds of whom, as we have seen, are disabled. It is
difficult to see the purpose in encouraging a family with, say, two
girls, one of whom will be 16 in a year or two, to move
away—even if they can find a smaller property—only for
them to need to move back into a larger property when the
under-occupancy deduction no longer applies.</hs_Para>

family incomes were such that an additional £12 or so a week was
affordable, there would be no cause for concern, but for families in
which one person is disabled, income is more than likely to be limited,
and the need for a discretionary housing payment therefore grows.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T11:10:34"></hs_TimeCode> is to deal
with such cases that I encourage the Minister to increase the
additional funding for discretionary housing payments. If £25
million is set aside to offset the reduction in housing benefit for
disabled people whose homes have been adapted—that sum may in
itself be insufficient—there will be little left for other
difficult situations.</hs_Para>

another matter, a constituent visited me two weekends ago to put the
case of fathers who live apart from the mother of their children but
look after the children for, say, three nights a week. The bedroom they
have kept for their children is considered spare, and hence subject to
the reduction in housing benefit. I do not believe that a bedroom that
is occupied by one’s children for almost half the week can be
described as spare. The fathers therefore face a choice between paying
the weekly amount while trying to live on jobseeker’s allowance
or employment and support allowance, and going into debt—those
are their own words—or not having their children to stay. They
all say they will do the former—go into debt—rather than
not have the children to stay.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T11:11:50"></hs_TimeCode> do not believe
it was the original intention of the changes to force them into such a
choice. We must not put obstacles in the way of fathers remaining in
touch with their children. I ask the Minister to look again at the rule
that does not count a bedroom used by children for two or three nights
a week as part of the occupancy of the
home<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T11:11:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012337000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012337000150">The
housing benefit bill rose from £11 billion in 2000-01 to
£21 billion in 2010-11. Even in real terms, that is an increase

on this, but ultimately it is growth in the economy, improving incomes
and a massive programme of building social and affordable homes, which
I hope all Members will support, that will bring that bill down.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T11:12:51"></hs_TimeCode> the meantime,
I ask the Minister seriously to consider changing the rules as I have
proposed in respect of children of parents living apart, and the

reforming the welfare system that will result in housing benefit for

example, a range of disability premiums, earnings disregards and
permitted-work rules. With universal credit, we are simplifying the

Friend is right to point out that the cost of housing benefit has
increased by about 50% in real terms over the past decade, with
expenditure totalling £23 billion in 2011-12. That is simply
unaffordable in the current economic climate. To begin to address it,
the emergency Budget in June 2010 introduced a series of reforms to
housing benefit paid to claimants in both the private and social rented
sectors. Starting in April 2011, and finishing last month, we set up a
series of reforms to local housing allowance, which is the basis for
housing benefit awards made to people renting in the private sector.
Those changes are intended to exert downward pressure on rents and
introduce fairness into the system—for example, by setting caps
on the benefit that is paid to ensure that the benefit system is not
funding accommodation that many hard-working families could not
afford.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012339000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012339000005">Disabled
people are not exempt from the reforms, but steps have been taken to
provide some additional support to minimise potential adverse impacts
on them. My hon. Friend mentioned the number of people affected by the
social sector size criteria who are disabled. It is important to

people living in social sector housing overall. In answer to his
question, I can confirm to my hon. Friend that the criteria allow for
an extra room where a household has an overnight carer.</hs_Para>

options may be open to people, including those that they arrive at

people can do—and are already
doing—include moving somewhere smaller, finding the extra money
required, or taking in a lodger. We are now waiving the income tax on
that up to £4,250 a year. No tax would be payable on that sum.
It is important to note that the private sector may have a supply of
different sized properties and that people could move out of the social

heart of the matter is that we do not want children to suffer. Children

non-residential children, housing benefit may already pay for a room
for the child or children in the place where they usually reside.

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T14:30:22"></hs_TimeCode>I wanted to
select the rules on the under-occupancy of social housing and housing
benefit entitlement, which start this April, for this debate today
because the Government’s proposal is divisive legislation. In
fact, it is not only divisive but arbitrary, spiteful and deeply
cynical. It has been devised either by those who have no understanding,
knowledge or experience of social housing and do not care, or by those
who have understanding, knowledge and experience of social housing and
should know better.</hs_Para>

under-occupancy rules say all that anyone needs to know about this
Government—tax cuts for the rich and a bedroom tax for the poor.
The bedroom tax is being created by a mindset that believes only those
who own their own homes can live in a community and those who rent with
Government support, even though many of them are in work, are deemed to
be a burden on that community and not entitled to, or deserving of a
home and that they should be moved at the behest of others and not
themselves.</hs_Para>

do the under-occupancy rules mean for social housing and council
tenants? If a household rents from a social landlord and is in receipt
of housing benefit, and it is deemed to have one spare bedroom, the
property is seen to be under-occupied. The tenant’s housing
benefit is reduced by 14% for one bedroom and by 25% for two bedrooms.
It has been estimated that about 660,000 tenants will lose an average
of £728 a year, starting from April.</hs_Para>

policy, more than any other, except perhaps direct payment, will have a
major impact on local housing associations and social housing
providers. Wigan and Leigh Housing manages 22,600 properties, and 68%
of our tenants are on housing benefit. Of those properties, 4,571 are
under-occupied and in receipt of housing benefit. Nearly £3
million in housing benefit payments will be lost to that social housing
provider, and our shortfall is in one-bedroom and two-bedroom
accommodation. For example, our one-bedroom stock is 5,591. In 2011-12,
852 properties were void, and demand for those properties was 2,089
people. We simply cannot re-house people in one-bedroom

as predicted by the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research

not offer any savings. In fact, more will be paid for a two-bedroom

What will be the courts’ opinion? If such people are evicted,
based on an average eviction cost of £6,852 per person, my local
social housing provider will lose £13.1 million. That

repaying debt or improving stock for

has done some modelling and made some assumptions about what 
will happen if the under-occupancy tax goes through as planned, and the
change will cost the Department for Work and Pensions £229,000
per annum and, as I said, the authority a possible £30 million
in eviction costs. There is no saving for the Department—it is
not a policy aimed to save
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012345000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012345000049">Moreover,

the Member for Sedgefield mentioned, the reassurances about the
discretionary housing payments will certainly not meet people’s
shortfall. The total budget for Wigan is £456,000, which will
assist with only 15% of the charge. If the amendment proposed by Lord
Best was agreed—a penalty only for under-occupation by two
bedrooms or more—the situation in Wigan would be mitigated
somewhat and the DWP savings would be delivered. In Wigan, if one
bedroom could be under-occupied, the savings to the DWP would be
£371,000 and the scheme would reduce the number of tenants
affected to about 1,000, potential bad debt to £249,000 and
eviction costs to close to £3 million. That is not a great
policy, and it would pass central savings to the local budget, but it
would be more manageable in areas such as
Wigan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T14:51:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012345000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012345000050">What
modelling has been made for areas such as Wigan of that amendment and
the increased savings for the DWP? Has all the modelling been

probably tell, Mr Bayley, but I was so upset and incensed by the
proposals that I am doing my best to speak on behalf of the 4,000 Wigan
households that will be affected from April. Collectively, those
households will have to find nearly £55,000 a week in extra
rent. I am clear that the vast majority will not be able to manage, so
they will have to downsize. As we have just heard, however, we have a
problem: we do not have one and two-bedroom properties available. The
demand for them already far outstrips demand for other properties; for
example, 62 households are waiting for four-bedroom homes and 2,000 for
one-bedroom
flats.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012345000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012345000053">Put<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T14:53:13"></hs_TimeCode>
simply, downsizing is not an option, so tenants will be forced into the
private sector, where rents are between £20 and £40 a
month higher. If only half of 
<?notus-xml column=112?>tenants make that move and claim the local housing allowance, the
Department for Work and Pensions will not save a single penny, but
those families will have had their lives disrupted, leaving the homes

have little doubt that Ministers are aware of such implications of the
policy. Last year, I wrote to the then Minister to ask whether a
constituent would be expected to move in April—his mother had
recently died from cancer, leaving him under-occupying, and he is now
suffering from terminal cancer himself. The Minister did not give me a
commitment that my constituent, a man with only up to two years to
live, would not have to move. The policy, to use the words of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T14:53:51"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Sedgefield (Phil Wilson), is one of the most spiteful

Wigan, it is not clear whether people will be able to find homes in the
private sector, because larger properties make up 75% of the stock. It
will take 33 years, at current building rates, for private and social
housing collectively to meet needs. The situation is unclear, but if
those people simply cannot afford to live in their properties, they may
well have grounds for being re-housed as unintentionally homeless. Can
the Minister tell me where he expects a housing authority such as mine,
without access to smaller properties, to put those people? How on earth
can creating this unnecessary, callous revolving door of homelessness,
destroying people’s lives in the process, possibly be a moral
policy to

I want to make a specific point about foster children, to which my hon.
Friend alluded. It is absolutely scandalous and a damning indictment of
the Government’s lack of commitment to the most vulnerable
children that, apparently, no thought at all was given to foster
children when the policy was devised. Foster children simply do not
count—they are invisible—for the purposes of the policy
and the purposes of a spare room. The money that has since been made
available through a discretionary fund, as my hon. Friend said, is not
widely known about among foster carers or local authorities.
Furthermore, that pot amounts to only £100 per child, which is
woefully inadequate for the foster children already in the system, let
alone for the many more whom the Minister’s colleagues in the
Department for Education are rightly seeking to
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012345000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012345000057">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T14:55:58"></hs_TimeCode>
have a huge shortage of foster carers in this country, and the
situation for children waiting in the care system must be urgently
rectified. Where is the thought given to those children, or the
commitment from their Government? Why did the Government overlook those
children in the first place? Why do those children simply not count?
Why has so little money been made available? Despite
concerns<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T14:56:05"></hs_TimeCode>
expressed by the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T14:56:05"></hs_TimeCode>
Under-Secretary of State for Education, the hon. Member for Crewe and
Nantwich (Mr Timpson), why has the policy not been reversed? Why was
the money for such children not ring-fenced? It might not even be used
to help their situation. Can the Minister, if he will not reverse such
appalling regulations, at least commit to amending them, so that they
do not make the situation worse for some of the most disadvantaged
children in this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T14:56:26"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

constituent and her young family will go from being homeless to facing
extra financial burdens. In the long term, that means increasing her
debt, so she faces possible eviction by the very people who gave her

social landlords and councils do not have the range of housing stock to

me turn to the second family who came to see me, just before Christmas.
The husband is a paraplegic. They have lived in their property for 15
years. The council has spent £18,500 adapting it. It has three
bedrooms, one of which is used to accommodate a lift. The other two
bedrooms are used by each of the individuals in the home. They have
been visited by Rochdale Boroughwide Housing, and they have been told
that they will have to pay £22 a week extra or they will have to
move out. The family described that as the last straw. They have been
through so much in their lives. The lady was crying in my surgery on
the eve of Christmas, because of the Government’s
policy.</hs_Para>

explained to the family the possibility of receiving temporary
discretionary housing payments, but they are not enough. The Government

They  
<?notus-xml column=115?>have housing providers such as RBH running around

problem with the way in which the Government have sought to frame the
debate on changes to the occupancy rules is that it fails to
acknowledge that that debate takes place against the backdrop of
changing population demographics and underlying problems in the supply
of affordable housing. It is also being implemented against the
backdrop of a labour market in which jobseekers far outnumber
vacancies, and increasing numbers of jobs are seasonal, temporary or
based on zero-hours contracts. All this talk about subsidised spare
bedrooms is yet another attempt to vilify people on low incomes in a
vain effort to justify their having to pay the price for the financial
crisis and the double-dip
recession<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:06:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012345000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012345000075">To
debate this issue properly, we need to acknowledge that there is a
fundamental mismatch between the social housing stock available and the
needs of tenants and prospective tenants. Most of our social housing
stock was built at a time when families were much larger and
the population was less mobile. Across Scotland, about 44% of social
tenants require a one-bedroom home, but only 24% of the homes available
are that size. In other words, many tenants have no choice but to live
in a home that is larger than they need. An estimated
69,000 tenants in Scotland cannot currently
be accommodated in a suitably sized house in the social
rented
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:07:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012345000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012345000076">In
Aberdeenshire—my own patch—we have a growing population
and a depleted stock of public sector housing, and
there is a chronic shortage of affordable property to rent. There are
more than 7,000 people on the waiting list. Many of them have little
prospect of being offered a house any time soon. Although Aberdeenshire
has a much higher percentage of one-bedroom properties than most local
authorities, it still does not meet demand. People desperate for a
house will take any house offered, whether or not it is the appropriate
size<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:07:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012345000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012345000078">The
main issue I want to talk about is the unintended consequences of the
bedroom tax on individuals, social landlords and the wider economy. It
is hard to predict how tenants in receipt of housing benefit will
respond 
<?notus-xml column=116?>to the cuts, bearing in mind that the real-terms cut in working-age
benefits will also put the finances of most of them under considerable
strain. We can probably assume that some of those who can move, will
move. Some might seek to absorb the cuts within their existing
finances, while some might take out loans to cover the gap between
their rent and their income, which is a risky short-term strategy. It
is highly unlikely that housing association tenants will mitigate the
impact by taking in lodgers, because many are explicitly prevented from
doing so by the terms of their tenancy agreements. We have to face the
fact that some tenants will fall into arrears. When we consider the
bedroom tax in tandem with the move away from direct payments to
landlords and other benefit cuts, we have a recipe for significant
problems with rent arrears, and a possible rise in evictions in the
social and private rented
sectors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:08:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012345000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0001.htm#13012345000079">Housing
associations fear that financial instability and cash-flow problems
could affect their credit ratings, and I echo the point made by the
Chair of the Select Committee on Work and Pensions,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:08:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg). Social landlords need to be able
to borrow to invest in new properties and maintain their existing
properties. If lenders start to see them as a higher risk, their
borrowing costs will rise, which will inevitably put inflationary
pressures on the rents of existing tenants and thwart the investment
that is so badly needed.</hs_Para>

bedroom tax threatens to undermine the progress that has been made in
Scotland over recent years in introducing new, affordable social
housing to deal with rising demand.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:09:24"></hs_TimeCode> is a mean and
miserable measure that will cause real financial hardship to people on
low incomes. It will drive people into rent arrears and into debts they
will struggle to repay. It will also drive people from their homes and
uproot them from their communities. Too many of the people affected by
the measure are moving in and out of low-paid, insecure, temporary
short-term work. Because of the bedroom tax, not only will they have no
job security; they will lose housing stability as well. Coming hard on
the heels of real-terms cuts in financial support for low-income
households, the changes will exacerbate our existing economic malaise,
by taking money out of the very communities that need it most. They
will make it more difficult for non-governmental actors to invest in
quality, affordable housing.</hs_Para>

policy is the way it is being implemented, and 
<?notus-xml column=117?>the lack of local flexibility for the families and  individuals

he had an overnight carer staying in his flat he would be exempt. I am
sure that the Minister would agree with me that it is very disruptive
for someone who has a long-term illness to move home, and possibly
area. I do not think that the Government intended the policy to have
such an adverse effect on seriously ill and vulnerable individuals.
However, part of the problem is the lack of flexibility given to
organisations such as Stockport Homes to respond in a way that gives
them discretion in those very difficult cases.</hs_Para>

properties a year. Where are people expected to go? The alternative, of
course, is the private rented sector, but recently there has been an
increase in private rented sector repossessions in Stockport, and
landlords are not keen on taking people in receipt of housing benefit.
Also, we have a smaller private rented sector than elsewhere. That
means that people will inevitably have to move out of the

areas have had different local housing policies. For example, under
previous housing policies, families in Stockport have been offered a
three-bedroom flat or house if they have a boy and a girl both over
five years old. However, the new policy means that if they receive
housing benefit they can have a three-bedroom flat only if they have a
boy and a girl over 10, so families currently living in three-bedroom
flats or houses in my constituency will be hit by the rule. Moving out
will be very disruptive for children, who will have to change schools.
They will lose their friends and their parents will lose family and
community links. Often, those are the very families that other agencies
are concerned to support in a settled environment.</hs_Para>

does not make sense to me that the policy of one Department can so
adversely affect the policy of another. Localism, and local
partnerships working together to support families, should mean that
some flexibility is given to local social landlords about the
implementation of the policy. That would mitigate some of the
disruptive impact on families who, through no fault of their own, were

it is difficult for Stockport Homes to let two-bedroom flats, and that

where they have family and community links to make way for people to
come in, from outside, to an area where they have no such links. That
is another unintended but serious consequence of the proposals. My plea

discretion so that the worst of the consequences to vulnerable
individuals and families, who we all agree should not be affected, can

of the justifications for the changes is that they will bring about a
better use of currently available housing stock and that somehow
penalties for under-occupancy will force tenants to leave their
homes—I stress they are homes, not houses—releasing
two-bedroom properties and thereby alleviating overcrowding. The theory
might get off the ground if there was evidence that such exchanges were
possible and practical; but the evidence is that whereas 180,000 social
tenants are allegedly under-occupying, just under 68,000 single-bedroom
properties became available last year. We have heard today that it
would take an age to achieve what is intended. There simply are not the
properties to go round. That analysis does not even begin to
take  into consideration new entrants to the market. The

Middlesbrough the policy will have an impact on 2,410 claimants. The
reduction in benefits across the piece will be something short of
£1.5 million. Of course in the areas of my constituency where
people are already struggling, and finding things hard, the additional
burden will be the final straw for some. There will be untold misery. I
heard from Citizens Advice recently about my constituent David
Holdsworth, who lives in a three-bedroom property with his wife and
severely disabled 33-year-old daughter. He is paralysed from the waist
down and has continence issues. His wife is his full-time carer and

for her to stay with him. They have been informed that the bedroom tax
will affect him, because they have a spare room. He cannot afford the

he and his daughter should move into a home and his wife should move

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:21:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Sedgefield (Phil Wilson) for this debate. We could be
here for much longer, as is increasingly the case with our debates on
these so-called reforms. I hope that when the Minister replies, he will
not waste time pretending that the aim of the measure is to re-allocate
social housing. There are other ways of doing that, and building more
houses is one of the more important ones. However, the measure does not
do that. If every local authority successfully reshuffled people in
houses, almost certainly the same proportion would be on housing
benefit, so there would be no saving. The Government have the saving in
their budget, so it is  not about that and they should not
bother to pretend that it
is.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000004">A
constituent who is in her 50s lives in a two-bedroom housing
association house near the city centre, and has been there for six
years. She has received a letter suggesting that she could take in a
lodger. Her second bedroom is very much a single bedroom and very
small. I do not know whether most people who support the measure ever
go into the sort of houses that are being built. The kitchen is off the
living room, which is fine for a family, but how does that work with a
lodger who may be a  
<?notus-xml column=120?>stranger? Not only would she be sharing a bathroom, perhaps with a
younger person whom she had never previously met, she would be sharing
a kitchen off the living room. That is not even semi-practical, and my
constituent was outraged at the prospect, but £50 from her
benefit is very
steep.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000005">Many
local authorities will do their best to help people, as will housing
associations. They will look at the allocation policy to see whether
they can make things easier, although they will merely be moving the
deck chairs on the Titanic. They may manage to move some people, but
the majority of homeless applicants are single people who will have to
be housed in one-bedroom houses if they need housing benefit. Local
authorities will be juggling one group of people with another. Even if
some tenants in two-bedroom houses are moved into one-bedroom houses,
homeless people who are waiting for one-bedroom houses but cannot be
moved into those two-bedroom houses will wait even
longer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000006">This
week, I looked at what was available not just in my constituency, but
throughout my city. Some 36 one-bedroom properties are advertised. The
council and all the housing associations, bar two very small ones,
advertise together. Ten of those properties are sheltered housing, and
people who are not eligible cannot be housed in those houses, so that
is 10 out of the way already. Another 11 properties are ground-floor
flats, which are mostly allocated to people with what is called gold
priority—top medical priority—for housing, because they
are on the ground floor and if a ramp is necessary it can be put
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000007">Some
people with gold priority may also be affected by the bedroom tax,
which might be convenient, but the chances are that they will not. If
we give those ground-floor flats to able-bodied people who do not need
them, people who are waiting to get out of a third or fourth-floor flat
for medical reasons will become angry. People frequently bend my ear
about that if they think it is happening. People who must be moved
because of the bedroom tax cannot be
prioritised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000008">That
leaves 15 houses available for let this week. A one-bedroom third-floor
flat has attracted 110 online bids—that is not the total because
paper bids can also be made—since last Friday. A one-bedroom
first-floor flat in the city centre attracted 303 bids. Even a
one-bedroom flat in a multi-storey building has attracted 35 bids.
Those are active bidders, not people on a waiting list that might be
described as not real. Those people are probably not yet affected by
the bedroom tax, but the houses are simply not available. The real
reason for  the spiralling housing benefit bill is not
under-occupancy of social housing; it is the huge expansion of the
private rented sector and its high rents. That is what the Government
should be addressing to bring down the housing benefit
bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:25:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13012374000200" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000200">3.25

to two cases, having been approached by parents of adults with
disabilities who will be profoundly and specifically affected by the
changes. One, Mrs Rosemary Burslem, asked me to specify the particulars
of her son’s case. She is in her 60s and has an adult child,
David, who has severe disabilities. He has autism and needs overnight
sleep-in staff, as well as one-to-one staff support during the day and
two-to-one support when he goes out in the

the view of David’s mother, who has looked after him for many
years, it would be inappropriate for him to share a house with anyone
with a learning disability because his behaviour is very challenging.
He regularly takes food out of the fridge, as well as cutlery and
crockery to bedrooms for no apparent reason. He flushes the toilet
regularly, and switches electrical items on and off. His behaviour is
regularly obsessional, which makes it virtually impossible for him to
share accommodation with anyone. David has what Mrs Burslem describes
as mega-tantrums. She says they are like the tantrums of the terrible
twos, but 30 times worse because he is in his 30s. He is angry,
frustrated and feels unwell, and is unable to work or live easily with
other people. He then acts for no apparent reason, and all that makes
it extremely difficult for him to live with anyone
else.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000012">The

house with an individual who suffers from spina bifida and
hydrocephalus. An additional room in their house is used for the
storage of oxygen and other disability aids, and a separate room is
used as a living room by the individual concerned, who has specific and
profound additional needs. Under these proposals, none of the
particular circumstances for those individuals is taken into account,
and they are some of the people who we all think—and I am sure
the Minister thinks—should have our support, but they have no
guarantee that they will continue to receive it. The fact is that this
set of proposals is creating enormous worry for people who have huge
burdens in caring for people whom they care profoundly about. They have
contributed enormously to society by helping to look after those people

heard the Minister’s response yesterday, and in it, he referred

time as they are letting those people down, have chosen to give a tax
cut to the richest people in the country. That is the type of political
choice that we all have to make, and the reality is that the Minister

prisoner can be away from home for up to 52 weeks and not have their
housing benefit docked, but if someone is a serving member of the armed
forces, their housing benefit will be docked if they are away for 13
weeks or more. It is astonishing that Ministers are giving prisoners
more flexibility to claim those benefits than serving personnel. They
are choosing prisoners over patriots. Some 96,000 members of the
regular forces do not live in service accommodation, and I want to know
how many of them will be affected. The Minister seems to be indicating
that they will not be affected. Perhaps he can explain how that is,
because we are aware of examples where they will be. Service families

country.</hs_Para>

They must publish the impact of the bedroom tax and set out very
clearly who will be affected. It is the least they can do to clear the

is going to happen now to constituents with  a boy and a girl?
They are currently nicely housed in a three-bedroom house. Is it the
Minister’s expectation that they would move into a two-bedroom
house until one of the children reaches the age of 10, when they would
have to move into a three-bedroom house? What happens when one of the
children moves out? Are they then expected to move back into a
two-bedroom house, and then into a one-bedroom house when both the
children move out? That is even if all the housing stock is available.
Just imagine the monetary costs—how could people on low wages or
benefits afford new carpets and curtains each time they have to move
house, or does the Minister expect them to have bare floorboards and
newspaper at the windows? What about the children’s schooling?
Will they have to keep moving schools, or will the family have to find
additional money for transport to school?
Fundamentally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:38:45"></hs_TimeCode>,
what about the community? Social housing is not only somewhere that you

community that will be fractured by this ridiculous, ignorant policy.

Members have talked about many other aspects of this policy, so I will
finish by talking about Isobel, who came to see me about her
situation—I have changed her name. Isobel lives in a
three-bedroom house. She has a daughter who has just moved out, into a
fairly insecure relationship, and she has a 17-year old son with
Down’s syndrome. Isobel is a full-time carer and she herself
understandably suffers from stress and depression. Isobel’s
son—I shall call him Carl—is severely affected by
Down’s syndrome. He has what I can best describe as autism-like
symptoms. He cannot cope with change to his routine or environment. He
needs everything to be in its place and everything to be done in the
same way at the same time every day. Indeed, while Isobel was visiting
me in the surgery, she received two phone calls to come home as quickly
as possible because Carl was becoming extremely agitated by her
absence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000035">Isobel
has told me that Carl could not cope with a move. Moreover, Isobel gets
support from her community. Neighbours understand Carl’s
behaviour and support her both physically and morally. What is she
supposed to do? She cannot work; she cannot move. What is the
Minister’s answer to that question? I hope he will not say that
she could get a discretionary housing payment. Bolton at Home does not
yet know how much it will get, but it has already worked out that it
will not have enough money to support everyone in

agree with the Government in wanting less overcrowded and less
under-occupied social housing. We want to see sensible, practical
welfare reform. We also agree that the housing benefit bill needs to be
reduced. The problem with the Government’s plan is that it is
unlikely to ease housing supply or to save money. In fact, it could end
up costing more. It could also mean, as so many of my hon. Friends have
said, that disabled people, war widows, foster carers and the families
of members of the armed forces all lose out. As we have heard, some
could even be made

will set aside the nauseating spectacle of a millionaire Minister
telling poor people that they are living in luxury and will instead
consider whether the policy will work. It is supposed to make
under-occupiers move into smaller accommodation, but the
Government’s own impact assessment makes it clear that all the
savings that it is estimated the policy could make are based on the
assumption that no one will actually move at all. Instead, all the
savings come from reductions in people’s benefits. This policy
is literally based on making some of the poorest people in Britain
poorer, and it is being implemented, as we have heard, at precisely the
moment when millionaires and the super-rich are getting a tax
cut<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:43:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000042">Let
us consider a practical example. Someone with terminal cancer who is
receiving employment and support allowance and is in the support group,
which is for people who are not expected to work again, has a spare
bedroom in a two-bedroom council house because their child moved out
recently. They would be happy to move into a smaller home, but the
council does not have one available. According to the National Housing
Federation, 
<?notus-xml column=126?>although 180,000 social tenants in England are under-occupying
two-bedroom homes, only 68,000 one-bedroom social homes became
available for letting in
2009-10<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:43:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000043">Usually,
there simply will not be a one-bedroom social home for the cancer
patient to move into, and more one-bedroom homes will not become
available as a result of the policy because, after all, it is not
possible to under-occupy a one-bedroom flat. Therefore, they would lose
£14 a week, on average, which they would need to make up to
their landlord from their benefit income. That is £60 a month
straight out of the pocket of someone with terminal cancer. How are
they supposed to cope with that loss of income?
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:44:14"></hs_TimeCode> Government
suggest that they work to make up the difference, or take in a lodger.
For people with terminal cancer or the most genuinely disabled people,
work is often not much of an option, and it certainly should not be
forced on them. Taking in a lodger simply is not an option for many
vulnerable households

one of three things could happen, not just to the family I am talking
about, but to hundreds of thousands of others, too. First, they could
lose income and be pushed into poverty. Secondly, they could move out
to a smaller home in the private sector, but that means higher rent and
higher housing benefit bills, and a policy that is supposed to be
saving money will end up costing much more. Thirdly, they could end up
in rent arrears, be evicted and even end up
homeless.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000045">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:44:13"></hs_TimeCode>
us be honest: homelessness is a real possibility. Even the office of
the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government—a
man not known as a bleeding-heart liberal—warned that the
Government’s housing benefit reforms could make 40,000 people
homeless and that the policy could cost more than it
saves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:45:03"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government claim that discretionary housing payments will help to make
up the shortfall between housing benefit and rent, but both the

funding available is likely to be woefully

would therefore like to ask the Minister a few questions—first,
about the cost of this policy. We have heard already that the policy
will make savings only if it does not work, and it is set to push
people into private rented accommodation, making supporting them all
the more expensive. Will he tell us why the Government have estimated
the costs of the policy on the basis that no one moves, but loses
benefit instead? Will he tell us what estimates they have
made of the number of people likely to move into expensive private
rented accommodation? Given the serious concerns about the cost of the
policy, can he give us an assurance that under-occupancy deductions
will not be increased if the Government do not make the expected
savings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:45:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000047">The
Government seem to have casually accepted that as many as 40,000 people
could be made homeless by the policy. What does the Minister say to the
housing association that has told us that it expects to have to evict
one third of its tenants? How many children does the Minister think
will have to move school as a result of the policy? Have the Government
put any measures in place to ensure that local authorities can cope
with the increase in the number of homeless people? What estimate has
been made of the cost of supporting homeless people and getting them

would also like to ask some questions about the people who will be
forced to rely on discretionary housing payments after the changes. The
Government 
<?notus-xml column=127?>have indicated that they expect disabled people with adapted housing and
foster carers to apply for the funding. Why should they face the
prospect of being moved out of adapted homes on the basis of whether
their local authority has enough money left in the DHP pot? Surely,
that is a monumental waste when significant time and money has already
been invested in their homes. Discretionary housing payments are short
term, and new applications must be made every few months, so how are
disabled people and foster carers supposed to plan their lives when
they cannot be sure that they will be able to afford their house in a
few months’
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T15:47:03"></hs_TimeCode>? Local
authorities desperately need to know how much funding they will have,
to plan their responses to the changes, so why did the Minister tell
the House at  the end of October that the
Government still have no idea how much money will be
allocated to local authorities for the next two

has also emerged that not just disabled people and carers might be
forced to rely on short-term discretionary housing payments, but
soldiers. <I>The Daily Telegraph </I>recently reported, as we heard
earlier, that the families of service personnel will face deductions if
they keep a room for a family member away on duty. Why should brave men
and women serving their country in the armed forces have no room to
come home to, because under-occupancy deductions have caused their
family to move? What assessment have the Government made of whether the

I said, there is no dispute about wanting to tackle overcrowding and
under-occupancy or the need to get the housing benefit bill under
control, but as Labour Members have shown, the current plans are
unlikely to ease housing supply or to save money and could end up
costing more. Worse still, they will put people in debt and risk making
them homeless. Labour’s alternative where under-occupiers would
face deductions if they had been offered a smaller property and refused
it would have worked and would have saved money. The fundamental truth
is that the best way to get the benefits bill down is not to attack the
families of disabled people, soldiers or poor tenants, but to get
everyone back to work. That is what Labour’s jobs guarantee
would do. Britain needs reform that is tough, fair and, most of all,
works.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13012374000204" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000204">3.48

that is the tenor of what has been said. When Labour introduced the
local housing allowance, private sector tenants did not get housing
benefit for a spare bedroom. Where is the morality in saying to private
tenants that they cannot have a spare room, when social tenants, who
are paying a subsidised rent, can? They could be living next door to

things that have been said are based on ignorance, rather than on an
intent to mislead. Let us take the example of a married serviceman or
woman. If one goes away, it does not matter, because there is still a
one-bedroom need, so married service personnel are not an issue.

forces who is on a wage is living at home with his mum and dad, the
benefit system says, “Ah, there is somebody in the house on a
wage.” We expect that person to pay up to £70 a week
towards the rent—it is called a non-dependant reduction. When
the serviceman or woman goes to the front line, and if they are away
for a long period, we no longer treat them as a non-dependant in the
household, so we no longer deduct £70 from the housing benefit.

long term, because some situations will not change. If someone lives in

return to the thoughts I was offering. Food prices are more volatile
than they have ever been, and even here in our own country hard-working
families are struggling to feed their children. The message is simple:
there is enough food in the world for everyone if we act now to address
the structural causes of poverty. Hunger and malnutrition are not
caused by a shortage of resources but by our inability to see beyond
our own immediate needs. The time has come to look beyond politics,
country borders and economic partnerships, and to make a decisive leap
forward for the sake of
humanity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:04:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000093">However,
that prompts a question: what are the structural causes of poverty?
They are the political choices made by Governments throughout the
developed world that ingrain inequality and
injustice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:04:55"></hs_TimeCode>. We
have a global mission and duty to ensure that the poor do not become
poorer while the rich become

farmers in the developing world produce more than half the

vital for farmers to grow food, but globally, in the past decade, an
area eight times the size of the UK has been sold off or leased out.

situation seems to me to be absolutely disgraceful. Beyond the way land
is bought, sold and used, the system is opaque. Once food is produced,
it enters the global market, which is dominated by a handful of
multinational companies in a system with little transparency. That is
not to say that those companies are inherently bad, but we would be
foolish to overlook their incredible power. For example, 90% of the
global trade in grain is controlled by five companies. Who benefits
from that control? Shareholders, or people who are hungry?
Companies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:06:39"></hs_TimeCode> have
more information about us than ever before, yet as global citizens we
have little useful information about their social and environmental
impact. There are reporting requirements under the Companies Act 2006,
but they are not useful to investors, producers, Government or civil
society. Decisions continue to be made in the shadows, without
participation by the people they affect. That cannot be

They spend a large proportion of their income on food, so are least

increase the production and returns of nearly 1 million smallholders.
We also provide support for safety nets so that the poorest people have
a buffer to help them to survive and recover from economic or natural
shocks that threaten their ability to feed themselves and their

tragic irony of PSP is that Brigadier Michael Koe, who is a constituent
of mine, lost his wife to PSP. His four sons, who were determined to do
something to raise awareness of the disease, decided to run in the
London marathon. The brigadier blagged his way in  to Lord
Coe’s offices when he was still a Member of Parliament, using
the fact that they shared the same surname although not the same
spelling, to ask for help in promoting awareness of PSP.</hs_Para>

supported them in that way only to find that on the fourth anniversary

2011, the association commissioned a UK-wide needs mapping exercise for
people with PSP and their carers. The results highlighted that the
nature and rapidity of PSP means that the needs of those living with

would be deemed to be required in the late stages of many conditions or
at the end of life may very well be required for someone with PSP for
almost half of the time that they live with the condition. The rapid
progression of the disease and often early onset of communication and
cognitive problems have a huge impact. Advance decision making on
end-of-life issues needs to take place much earlier with PSP than with

great value<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:43:55"></hs_TimeCode> of
these Westminster Hall debates is that, on something such as this,
Ministers are forced to think about a specific issue that might not
otherwise come across the radar and to devote some time and attention
to it. They also get officials thinking about things as well, so I am
grateful to the hon. Lady for securing the debate and for speaking so
clearly and passionately about it. I know that she is a patron of the
PSP Association, and I welcome anyone here who is from the association
or associated with it in any way. It is so good to have you present

Friend in paying tribute to the work of the association. She
described the support that it can give families who
have a loved one with this condition. For those individuals, it is a
lifeline of critical importance. The great value that disease-specific
organisations can provide is in this real attention to detail and an
understanding of the condition that the statutory services often cannot
offer. Their role in supplementing the formal NHS is therefore of
critical value. I pay warm tribute to the work that they
undertake<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:45:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000172">My
hon. Friend mentioned Lord Coe. It is great to have someone such as him
as an advocate for the condition and for the PSP Association. It was an
extraordinary and unhappy chance that his own mother ended up with the
condition and died from it. I should also, of course, pay tribute to
the work of Brigadier Koe, who clearly has made a big impact in
advancing the cause of better care and treatment of people with this
condition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:46:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000173">Voluntary
sector organisations will have a crucial role to play, offering their
expertise, as in the care pathway guide that I know the PSP Association
has pioneered. The expertise of such organisations will be invaluable
locally to clinical commissioning groups, to which my hon. Friend
referred, and the new health and wellbeing boards, which will be a
crucial local forum for discussion of a range of conditions, including
rare conditions. Such organisations will also offer their expertise at
national level to the NHS Commissioning Board, the National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence and
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:46:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000174">The
Neurological Alliance is the collective voice of more than 80 brain and
spine charities and, through its national leadership group and network
of regional alliances, is an influential player in this field. I
understand that the PSP Association is a member of the alliance and I
would encourage it to feed into the alliance’s work as a means
of getting its voice heard. That is clearly a very important
route<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:47:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000175">I
turn to the question of research. With no cure as of now, research
offers a source of hope for those living with PSP. The Department of
Health funds NHS research and development through the National
Institute for Health Research. In addition, the Medical Research
Council funds a broad portfolio of medical research. Neither the NIHR
nor the MRC usually ring-fences funds for expenditure on particular
topics. Research proposals in all areas compete for funding, based on
their strength as a proposal. Both organisations welcome applications
for research into any aspect of human health. Those are subject to peer
review and judged in an open competition, with awards being made on the
basis of the scientific quality of the proposals made. The principle
that decisions on individual research proposals are best taken by
researchers through peer review is a cornerstone of science funding in
the UK and is strongly supported by the coalition Government. Such
decisions are rightly left to those best placed to evaluate the
scientific quality, excellence and likely impact of the proposals under
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:48:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000176">My
hon. Friend asked how people with PSP would benefit in April this year,
when our new health and care reforms take effect. Through our reforms,
we are aiming to ensure that, as far as possible, people with
conditions such as PSP can maintain or enhance their quality of life.
This Government are committed to providing the 
<?notus-xml column=145?>best possible quality of care for people with rare conditions. When we
took office in 2010, we endorsed the right in the NHS constitution that
says that no one should be left behind just because of the rarity of
their condition. I recognise that there is often a problem within
health services of a lack of knowledge among the clinicians themselves.
I think that point was made in an intervention. It is always a
challenge to ensure that we spread understanding and
awareness<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:49:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000177">From
April 2013, the NHS Commissioning Board will directly commission
services for people with rare conditions on a national basis. Those new
arrangements for commissioning will bring real benefits to people with
rare conditions such as PSP. By commissioning these services just once
rather than reinventing the wheel all over the country, we will be able
to avoid duplication in planning and ensure that the highest level of
care is commissioned for patients, regardless of their geographical
location<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:49:50"></hs_TimeCode>. With
rare conditions, that is the best way to ensure that there is a real
concentration of expertise, so as to ensure that commissioning is
carried out in the best possible
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000178">The
NHS Commissioning Board will host four new strategic clinical networks
for up to five years, including a clinical network covering mental
health, dementia and neurological conditions. These clinical networks
are potentially of enormous value. We have seen the value of them in
treating cancer and other conditions. Now there is the potential for
benefits to be gained in the treatment of neurological conditions.
Through<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:50:37"></hs_TimeCode> this
particular network for mental health, dementia and neurological
conditions, the board itself and clinical commissioning groups will
have access to a broad range of expert clinical advice to inform

quality standards developed by the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence, commissioners, clinicians and providers of
services will have evidence-based descriptions of what good care and
support should look like. We have asked NICE to develop a quality
standard on relatively uncommon neurological conditions, as part of a
library of approximately 180 NHS quality standards. In addition, people
with PSP will also benefit from the cross-cutting quality standards,
which have already been published and which cover end-of-life care and
patient experience in adult NHS services, the point being that a number
of these standards are applicable across a range of different
conditions. So people with PSP will also benefit from the quality
standard on long-term conditions and people with co-morbidities and
complex needs, which we have also referred to NICE for
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:51:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000180">My
hon. Friend also discussed the importance of the patient voice within
the local health system. That is of critical importance. As we move
away from a paternalistic health system to a personal health system,
listening to what the patient actually wants and what their priorities
are will be vital. The theme of patient empowerment and voice is
central to our health and care reforms, and local HealthWatch
organisations—together with their national body, HealthWatch
England—will champion patient voice in the health and care
system.</hs_Para>

should also mention that in the mandate, which is the

there is a specific requirement for people with long-term conditions to
have a personal care plan, and they themselves will be involved in the
preparation of that plan. That happens in places already, but it does
not happen uniformly, and we must make it the norm rather than the
exception<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:53:08"></hs_TimeCode>. We
have to absolutely recognise that everything must be focused on the

I encourage those with PSP to feed their views into local HealthWatch
organisations—the local patient voice—which formally take
up their responsibilities on 1 April. Local HealthWatch organisations
will have a seat on the new health and wellbeing boards, and through
that they will be able to ensure that patient and public views are
represented and can help to shape local health and care
services.</hs_Para>

turn now to end-of-life care. My hon. Friend the Member for South
Northamptonshire also spoke about the importance of palliative care. As
she described, rapidly advancing diseases such as PSP may require
palliative care throughout the progression of the disease, in order to
support patients, as they face a declining physical and mental state,
and their families. We know that the current system of care does not
work well enough. Some patients receive excellent care and their
families receive excellent support, while others miss out. This is
partly a reflection of the origins of specialist palliative care as a
discipline in the care of people with cancer, and that remains the main
focus of palliative care
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:54:33"></hs_TimeCode>, but
those services must be appropriate for all conditions, obviously
including PSP.</hs_Para>

have highlighted the need to extend services to those with other
conditions or diseases. The end-of-life care strategy aims to improve
care for people approaching the end of life whatever their diagnosis
and wherever they are, including enabling more people to be cared for
and to die at home, if they wish. About 50% of people still die in
hospital, although most people want to be able to die at home if that
is possible, and we must ensure that their interests and priorities are
respected in that
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:55:20"></hs_TimeCode>. The
National End of Life Care Programme has developed an end-of-life care
pathway for neurological conditions, working with the Neurological
Alliance and the National Council for Palliative Care. The pathway,
which was published in 2010, sets out a framework to support the
provision of improved care for that group, including those with
PSP.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000185">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:55:36"></hs_TimeCode>
are committed to increasing awareness of rare conditions—a point
made by my hon. Friend in her speech—including PSP. That
commitment has been demonstrated through the development of the UK plan
for rare diseases. The plan will bring together a number of
recommendations designed to improve the co-ordination of care and to
lead to better outcomes for everyone with a rare disease, including
people with PSP. We have consulted on the rare disease plan, and we
published a summary of the consultation responses in November last
year. Work is on track to produce the plan by the end of this year,

hon. Friend the Member for South Northamptonshire also focused on
education and training. Our doctors and other staff across the NHS
receive some of the best training in the world, and as my hon. Friend
recognises, it is important for that to include the right information
and techniques to alert them to the possible presence of a rare disease
when a patient presents to them. We must recognise that PSP is a rare
condition, one among the hundreds that a health professional may see
during their career, and it may not be feasible or practical to draw
particular attention to it above all those other conditions. That said,
we recognise the difficulties and, as part of our consultation on the
UK rare diseases plan, we invited ideas on what more can be done to
train doctors in the identification of rare diseases and on whether
there are innovative ways of familiarising health professionals with
rare diseases in their professional training. Furthermore, the
consultation identified that training for all NHS staff to raise wider
awareness and understanding of rare diseases was also important in
promoting equality and in combating the stigma and discrimination
sometimes associated with such

entirely agree with my hon. Friend when she drew attention to the vital
role that carers play in supporting people with conditions such as PSP.
Between 2011 and 2015, the Department is providing the NHS with an
additional £400 million to support individuals in their role as
carers. The “Recognised, valued and supported: 
<?notus-xml column=148?>next steps for the Carers Strategy” document sets out Government
priorities in the area, reinforced in the 2012-13 NHS operating
framework, which sets out the priorities for that
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012374000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/halltext/130123h0002.htm#13012374000188">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-23T16:58:25"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend described the labyrinth that people with conditions and
their carers often find themselves trying to negotiate. One aspect of
the reform legislation, which I very much welcome, is the focus on
integrated care. Too often, carers are in silos, and people are pushed
from pillar to post. They can so easily fall into the gap. If we can
develop a much more integrated approach to support people with a rare
condition such as PSP, with clinicians at primary and secondary level
working together much more closely, everyone would

<?notus-xml column=12?>strategies. With this approach, I am confident that both organisations
will be able to reduce their administrative costs over this spending
review period and that we can deliver the strategic benefits of closer
working between the two organisations with immediate effect. This fits
logically within the context of the Government’s public bodies
reform programme which will reduce the number of public bodies by a
third, and it directly contributes to improvements in accountability
and transparency, and will cut out waste and duplication from the
system. It will also contribute to Government-wide reductions of over
£2.6 billion in the administration costs of public bodies over
the spending review

would impose an additional burden on the taxpayer and might have run
the risk of exacerbating blight (the very problem it seeks to address)

Gauke:</Member></B> The UK played a leading role in a 2008 OECD report
into the role of tax advisers. The report acknowledged that
intermediaries play a vital role in the tax system, helping taxpayers
understand and comply with their tax obligations, but it also observed
that some tax intermediaries act as promoters of aggressive tax
planning. The key conclusion was that the large corporate taxpayer, not
the tax intermediary, sets the overall strategy and appetite for tax
risk, and decides whether or not to adopt particular tax planning
opportunities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012373000462" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/text/130123w0001.htm#13012373000462">HMRC
recognises that this continues to be the case, and that tax advisers
play an important role in supporting responsible tax planning. HMRC
seeks to reduce tax avoidance by using customer relationship managers

biggest risks, for example through the

the United States of America, with the strong support of the UK and
other partners, to lead a major push to revitalise the peace process.
We are concerned 
<?notus-xml column=316?>by developments that threaten the viability of the two-state solution,
particularly continued settlement announcements. The UK continues to
urge both sides to refrain from any steps that would make the two-state
solution, or a return to negotiations, more difficult. 2013 is a
crucial year for the Middle East Peace Process if progress is to be
made before the window for a two state solution closes. Accordingly we
will continue to call on Palestinian Authority President Abbas and the
Israeli Prime Minister to show the strong leadership needed to achieve
a return to negotiations for a two-state solution, which will bring a
just and permanent solution to this

an increase in this funding of 9% since 2011/12. The Agency has been
working with all local authorities to establish a fair basis for the
distribution of these funds. If any local authority considers that the
distribution methodology will have a disproportionate effect on their
funding allocation, the Agency will look carefully at whether
adjustments can and should be made. Local authorities have the

Timpson:</Member></B> School Action and School Action Plus were brought
in by the revised 2001 SEN Code of Practice as part of a graduated
approach to meeting children's special educational needs. School Action
is where a pupil's needs can be met within the school and School Action
Plus is where extra or additional help from external specialists is
needed.</hs_Para>

authorities, schools and other agencies are required to have regard to
the guidance in the Code of Practice. In practice, the School Action
and School Action Plus categories are used by different schools and
local authorities in different
ways.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012373000752" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/text/130123w0002.htm#13012373000752">Our
proposal, set out in the Green Paper—‘Support and
Aspiration—A new approach to special educational needs and
disability’, is to make changes that bring together the School
Action and School Action Plus categories to help improve teaching and
support for pupils with special educational
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012373000753" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/text/130123w0002.htm#13012373000753">The
change will not affect the overall availability of support for children
with SEN; the aim is to promote better identification of need and
associated provision. Ofsted's 2010 report—‘a statement
is not enough’—showed that schools identify as having SEN
many children whose needs could be met by improving teaching and
learning for all, with individual goals for improvement. All children
need to have provision that is suitable to them. More accurate
identification has the potential to improve both the identification of
specific needs and the effectiveness of specific SEN
provision.</hs_Para>

geological disposal facility. The process for siting the geological
disposal facility, which is currently being followed in west Cumbria,
was set out in the 2008 Managing Radioactive Waste Safely White Paper.
It is based on voluntarism and partnership—the invitation for
other local authorities to express an interest in the siting process,
without commitment, is still open.</hs_Para>

low level waste has been consigned to the low level waste repository

specifically for wastes that require specialised containment. Low level
radioactive wastes that do not require specialised containment can be
consigned to other appropriate sites, subject to planning permission

permitted to accept low level waste from the nuclear industry are the
East Northants Resource Management Facility, and sites near Lillyhall
in Cumbria and Clifton Marsh in Lancashire.</hs_Para>

Hoban:</Member></B> People who are unable to work because they are ill
or disabled can claim employment and support allowance. Claimants who
are entitled to income-related employment and support allowance may
receive an additional element called support for mortgage interest.
This makes a contribution towards the interest on eligible loans taken
out to purchase the property occupied as the home, and specific loans
for repairs and improvements which are necessary to maintain the home's
fitness for
habitation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13012373001061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130123/text/130123w0002.htm#13012373001061">When
a new claim for income-related employment and support allowance is
made, there is normally a 13 week waiting period before
support for mortgage interest can be paid. Support for mortgage
interest is calculated by applying a standard interest rate (currently
3.63%), and to eligible capital up to a limit of

Wright:</Member></B> Criminal justice is a devolved matter. There is a
different sentencing and offence framework in each of the UK
jurisdictions. Sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the
independent courts, which will take into account all the circumstances
of the offence and the offender in determining the appropriate
sentence. In England and Wales, the courts must follow the sentencing
guidelines unless it would be in the interests of justice to depart
from them in a particular case. The independent Sentencing Council is
responsible for issuing the guidelines and, among other things, must
have regard to the need to promote consistency in
sentencing.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_23_PT_1/E13B0DC9F0111317E270A33AA2C82512666E4C05" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="23 January 2013">Wednesday

Care Pathway (LCP). As set out clearly in the guidance on the Pathway,
where it is possible to do so, it is essential that medical teams
discuss the LCP with the patient, their families or their carers if
they are considering its use. The independent review will be looking at
how the LCP is being used, in practice and will make recommendations on
its future use but in the meantime, health care teams must ensure that
they communicate fully with patients and

The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) has been advised
by Tower Hamlets Primary Care Trust that the figures they reported on
the number of children aged one year and over who had received BCG
vaccinations were over reported for 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11. This
has an impact on regional and national BCG vaccination figures for
those years. In light of this, the HSCIC is undertaking a general
review of BCG and Td/IPV figures from the KC50 data collection for
2008-09 to 2010-11. It is likely that revised figures will be published
for BCG and it may also be necessary to publish revised figures for
Td/IPV. While this work is in progress the HSCIC recommends that some
caution should be exercised when using the Td/IPV figures and that the
BCG figures are likely to be substantially over reported and should be
used with extreme
caution.</hs_brev><TableWrapper Columns="1" Size="8"><table tabstyle="headft"><tgroup cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="33*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="33*"></colspec><colspec colname="3" colwidth="33*"></colspec><thead><row><entry nameend="3" namest="1" rowsep="1"><hs_TableTitle Justify="centre"><I>Table
