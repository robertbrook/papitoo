every single taxpayer in this country, all 24 million of them, will see
a tax cut as we raise the personal allowance, and as we get close to
our goal of being able to earn £10,000 without paying any income
tax at all. Of course, the biggest tax cut has been for those
hard-working people on the minimum wage, going out to work day after

and they lose the house they have invested their lifetime savings in.
That is not fair, and for the first time this Government have come up
with the money to make sure that we put a cap on what any family has to
spend. It is the biggest pro-inheritance move that any Government have
made in 20 years. Let us be clear: the intention is not that people
should have to spend £75,000, but because we have put a cap in

constituency we have worked very hard to ensure that libraries will be
staying open—and they will be. The hon. Gentleman asks about the
big society. Part of the answer to helping to keep libraries open is to
tap the enthusiasm of communities to volunteer in libraries and to work
in libraries to keep them open. I am sure that he, like me, will
welcome the report this week showing that volunteering is up and
charitable giving is up. I think the big society has a big role to play

have done with some less developed countries has actually seen their

these countries because it is an absolutely vital part of development.
I also agree with the issue he raises with respect to tax transparency,
and that is why the Government are putting it at the head of our G8

Friend on that. This problem has dogged our economy over the last few

we had during the boom times, but we need to make available to young
people the chance of earning a decent salary to be able to buy a decent
flat or house with a mortgage that does not require a massive deposit.
That has not been possible for people in recent years, and I think that
the Bank of England move on the funding for lending

through to the mortgage market and making available lower mortgages at
a decent long-term rate. That is very important for our

the need for statutory underpinning. It would see the toughest press
regulation this country has ever had, without compromising press
freedom. The royal charter implements the principles of Leveson in a

allow the press to be part of the appointment process to the very body

organisations that are similar to this. I have to say that some of the
bodies involved in the conversations about the Leveson report, such as
Hacked Off, have actually proposed involving politicians and the press

the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s, engineering got a pretty
bad press. The news was dominated by strikes and job losses. It is
hardly surprising that the legacy of that time has had its impact. It
is no wonder parents have been reluctant to recommend engineering
careers to their children. But during my five years as Chair of the
Business, Innovation and Skills Committee in the last Parliament, and
during my two and a half years as a Defence Minister in this one, the
overriding concern I heard time and again from manufacturing and
technology companies was that there just are not enough
engineers—apprentices and graduates—to meet demand. I
remember one test and evaluation company telling me last year that it
had been forced to give up looking for engineering graduates in the UK
and was now recruiting from Spain, Portugal and Greece. That might help
to plug 
<?notus-xml column=874?>the skills gap for the companies that take that decision, but it is a

recruiting from abroad is not always an option. In defence, the armed
forces, the civil service and in companies, we often have to have UK
nationals doing the work on national security grounds—the
so-called “UK eyes only” requirement. To take the most
obvious example, unlike a nuclear engineering company in the civil

deterrent simply cannot rely on foreign engineering

week,</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13021368001255" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0001.htm#13021368001255">“there

need at least half as many more engineers. We might even need to double
the numbers qualifying at both level 3 and 4. To succeed in this, we
need to repeat three key messages. First, designing, making and
building things matters and provides real job satisfaction—old
truths that are being rediscovered. Secondly, careers in engineering
and technology are now well paid. Thirdly, engineering has changed as
technology has developed; it is now about problem solving, not oily
rags. Considerable practical outreach activity is directed at school
key stages 3 and 4. Some estimates suggest that there are more than
3,000 schemes reaching out to those age groups across the country, but
their reach is worryingly patchy: there are hot spots of overlapping
activity and deserts of inactivity. Unless pupils towards the end of
key stage 2—ages 10 and 11—realise the importance of
doing well in maths and physics, they will never be able to pursue
engineering or science careers. As the Science and Technology Committee
said in last week’s

its simplest, we need to inspire boys and girls at a much younger age
to want to do well in the two key subjects of maths and physics.
Perhaps the single greatest need is to make more girls want to do
physics. We do not need more schemes in order to do so. Indeed, there
are probably already too many. Rather, we should build on the excellent
existing work of EngineeringUK, the Royal Academy of Engineering and
many
others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021368000280" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0001.htm#13021368000280">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T13:20:29"></hs_TimeCode>
need more co-ordinated and focused business and official support for
schemes designed to attract young people to science, engineering and
technology by providing real experience, challenge and understanding.
Such schemes include Big Bang, Tomorrow’s Engineers, the
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network and its
ambassador programme, the STEM directories and Primary Engineer, which
is particularly important in addressing the key stage 2
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T13:20:29"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T13:20:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021368000281" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0001.htm#13021368000281">We
also need to make even better use of the many other more specific
schemes that exist. Two of my favourites include, first, the Bloodhound
SSC—supersonic car—project, which will attempt the 1,000
mph land speed record next year and is reaching out to about 
<?notus-xml column=875?>4,000 schools. The project will feature in a programme on CBBC this

major issue is that in most schools—this is not a criticism,
just an observation—teachers are not aware of the reality of
modern engineering and science. They just cannot steer pupils in the
right direction. However, as an engineering employer told the Science

often deter girls from engineering and science careers. Defence company
BAE Systems tells the story of a girl whose recent application to
become an apprentice was shredded by her head teacher because,
“Girls don’t do that sort of thing.” Well, they
do—and they do it outstandingly well, both as apprentices and as
graduates. Nevertheless, however we measure the participation of women
in engineering, it comes out at about 10% at best, which is the lowest
rate in the European Union—27th out of
27<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T13:21:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021368000284" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0001.htm#13021368000284">It
need not be like that. Missile manufacturer MBDA’s engineering
intake is now 50% female. If its success could be replicated more
widely, our skills problem would be solved. Securing genuinely equal
access at school to information on the modern reality of engineering
and science would help achieve this, and that is a key aim of this
Bill. Such equal access would show that there is something in
engineering and technology for everyone—fast jets, passenger
aircraft, avionics, cars, bridges, tunnels, satellites, mobile phones,
green technologies, environmental sustainability, water supplies in the

Bill contains some of the ideas that command strongest support in the
professions and industry. Each measure is a free-standing proposal to
the Government, but taken together they could be really powerful. My
proposals build in part on suggestions in Lord Heseltine’s
report on growth and they go some way to addressing my concern about
the profound inadequacy of careers advice in
schools<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T13:22:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021368000286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0001.htm#13021368000286">The
Bill does five things. First, it imposes a light-touch duty on
schools—primary, middle and secondary—to expose their
pupils to the realities of modern engineering and technology. Secondly,
it imposes a parallel obligation on local enterprise partnerships to
help schools in their area to fulfil that duty. Thirdly, it adopts Lord
Heseltine’s recommendation that secondary schools should have
two employers on the governing body, but adds that they cannot both be
accountants, solicitors or estate agents—one must be from a
science, technology, engineering or manufacturing background.
Fourthly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T13:23:54"></hs_TimeCode>, it
imposes a duty on the Department for Education to continue its support
for activity on engineering-awareness schemes. I say to the skills
Minister that I am not convinced that the Department really understands
how vital it is to help young people make informed career choices.
Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T13:23:40"></hs_TimeCode>, 
<?notus-xml column=876?>it sweeps away all restriction on schools using professional engineers
and scientists from local employers to teach maths and physics where
they have teacher
shortages<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T13:23:43"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
better to be taught—I know that my hon. Friend the Member for
Wycombe (Steve Baker) strongly agrees with this—by an
enthusiastic young professional who can show the value of the subject
to a sceptical class than by someone who is a good professional teacher
in other subjects, but who has no training in maths or

early measure of success over time would be the number of young people
doing well in GCSE maths and physics. Later, it would be a significant
increase in the number of girls taking A-level physics. Eventually, it
would be a sustained increase in applicants to engineering courses and
increasing female participation in the

course, we have been talking about this for years, but we cannot be
complacent. We are, as the Prime Minister has said, in a global race.
China is moving up the value chain. Like India, it is churning out
thousands of engineers every year. Our place as one of the largest
manufacturing nations on the planet—which we still are—is
threatened. Our resilience and security over a wide range of threats,

the Bill’s measures worked, the system would have to respond
with more teachers, more university technology colleges, more places in

the House what has happened to crime in the west midlands since this

As I have said in the House before, the two things that seem to make
Labour MPs look most glum are finding out that their constituents are
more likely to get a job or that they are less likely to be victims of
crime. In the past two years, crime in the west midlands has fallen by
13%, which is an extraordinary achievement. If I represented
a west midlands constituency, I would be pleased that my constituents
were less likely to be victims of crime than they were in 2010. I find

tidying up Labour’s mess is a difficult and painstaking process
that cannot be achieved overnight. In order to deal with the deficit,
tough decisions have to be made. I know that Labour Members, who have
never made a tough decision in their lives, find that traumatic, but it
has to be done. There is therefore less money for the Home Office and
less money for the police. As a service that was spending, in total, in
excess of £14 billion per year, the police can and
must take their fair share of the reductions in funding. As set out in
the policing Minister’s
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T13:35:05"></hs_TimeCode>written
ministerial statement, central Government funding to the police will be
£8.7 billion in 2013-14, which is only 1.9% less than in
2012-13. It is important to remember that the police do not receive all
their funding from central Government. In fact, the police receive
about a quarter of their funding from the police precept component of
council tax, which is of course determined locally.</hs_Para>

statement in December included further cuts of 1% to most departmental
budgets. However, the Home Secretary decided to protect the police from
these additional reductions in 2013-14. She also decided not to pass on
reductions relating to the November 2011 announcement on pay restraint
in 2013-14, which could have resulted in a further reduction of

the hon. Gentleman obviously missed it the first time. Let me tell him
how much progress has been made in the past year alone. I recognise
that every crime has a victim and I want to see crime go even lower. I
am genuinely pleased that crime is lower now than it was at the last
general election, when his party got the second worst result in its
history and did well to do as well as that. Crime in the west midlands
has fallen in the past year not by 5%, 10%, 11% or even 12%, but by
13%. Surely we can agree, if we cannot agree on anything else, that our
constituents being less likely to be victims of crime is a good thing.
However partisan Labour MPs are, surely they do not want their
constituents to be more likely to be victims of crime just so they can
try to score more cheap points across the

the vast majority of the NPIA’s budget will not be transferred

Labour does not want to spend more money, which would be great if it
had left us a massive budget surplus, but as the hon. Gentleman might

borrowing about £20 million an hour by the time the electorate

welcome that fall in crime and think it is a good thing. I do not want
people in our constituencies to face criminal actions—a victim
is 100% a victim. The key issue for the Minister to reflect on is that
there are crimes that are starting to rise, including acquisitive
crime, street crime, burglary, robbery and car theft. Areas of violent
crime are starting to rise, and the Minister must recognise that
policing is not just about discovering crime but about community
reassurance, being visible and accessible, and carrying out many tasks

policing, we had crime mapping, and there is a latency. Crime maps
enabled us to identify serious criminals and low-level criminals, but
today crime maps are being eroded, because PCSOs and sergeants are
being moved into other jobs. As my right hon. Friend has said, they are

years. That has been continuous since 1995, throughout my time in the
House of Commons. The key question for the hon. Gentleman is how we
develop that in future. Policing is, in part, about catching criminals
and solving crime, but it is also about community reassurance and many
other areas—dealing with floods, policing football matches,
crowd control and policing demonstrations. None of those is about
policing crime. Part of the reason why crime is falling is that the
Labour Government did good work in bringing together probation, prisons
and policing to look at reducing the number of serious offenders. The
number of first-time offenders going into the system fell under Labour,
as did the number of offences per person. There are a range of issues;
I just worry about potential difficulties arising downstream.</hs_Para>

Conservative Opposition supported and voted for, and it had the result
of making the British police force one of the best resourced in the

not just worrying primarily or solely about the amount of money put
into a service, but about how that service is organised. That is why
the Home Secretary should be thanked, again, for the shot of adrenaline
she has given to radical police reform—getting more for
less.</hs_Para>

want to talk not just about reducing bureaucracy as part of police
reform, but about getting more bang for our buck by doing more with
less. That relates to what are undoubtedly difficult and controversial
reforms to pay and conditions—the Winsor reforms. I remind the
House that when we talk about funding settlements for the whole of the
police service, a massive 80% of expenditure for most police forces in
England and Wales goes on pay. Yes, we can mandate collaboration, which
this Government are in the process of doing to make efficiencies in
procurement, information technology, uniform, traffic and so on. But
those and other heads of spending amount only to 20% of what a police
force spends; 80% is spent on people. It therefore seems to
me that it is incumbent on any Home Secretary, whether Labour or
Conservative, to look afresh at how we can get a modernised pay system,
crucially linking pay progression—the former Government
indicated that they supported this concept—with higher levels of
skills and with those who have undertaken higher professional training.
This is not performance by results, but linking pay to the skills that
officers have, paying less attention to progress up the pay ladder
simply as a result of age.</hs_Para>

Winsor proposals are, of course, more complicated than that. Chief
constables will have flexibility—and it is they, not Ministers
in Whitehall, who will make these managerial decisions—and this
will be done in conjunction with the locally elected police and crime
commissioners. It will be for them to ensure they have the proper mix
of ability within the uniformed ranks and they will also have to make
decisions about civilianisation in regard to the allocations laid

know it is early days, but my experience so far of the elected
commissioner in Suffolk, Councillor Tim Passmore, has been positive. He
has put together a draft set of priorities; he has gone to the trouble
of speaking to and meeting all the Suffolk MPs; and he has taken
amendments to his first draft. My own view—I think most police
and 
<?notus-xml column=898?>crime commissioners should look at this—is that a target should
be set for the percentage of time that officers are visible to the
Suffolk public. I think, too, that an objective should be set to move
towards the 10% of uniformed officers—and it is only
10%—who should be on non-front-line activities, which as I
outlined is the national objective, by March 2015. These commissioners
should hold themselves to account by explaining—in my case, to
the taxpayers of Suffolk, but to others in police force areas up and
down the country—what they are doing to reduce bureaucracy, to
get a higher percentage of officers on the front line and to ensure not
only that there are more of them on the front line, but that during
their shifts they spend a higher proportion of their time visibly out
and about so that the public can see
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021368000447" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0002.htm#13021368000447"><Member ContinuationText="Dr Thérèse Coffey" PimsId="5608" UID="13021368001630" xid="1185" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0002.htm#13021368001630"><B>Dr

every one of us whose area has a police and crime commissioner. The
essence of localism, which I think, in its broadest sense, is supported
by both major political parties and by the Liberal Democrats, is that
we cannot for ever say that it is the Minister’s fault. We
cannot keep on saying that the man or woman in Whitehall knows best.
Those on the ground, the elected police and crime commissioners, must
explain what they are doing in their forces, with their chief
constables, to bring about greater visibility of policing—with
manifestly constrained resources—and, if they are not able to
hit their objectives, they must explain why.</hs_Para>

may think that we are doing ourselves out of a job—that we are
just voting for the money and telling people to get on with it. That
would be a crude gloss on what I am saying, but I think that the thrust
of it is absolutely correct. We need local people, whether in
Humberside, Suffolk, Dorset or the west midlands, to stand up and be
counted. We need people to know how many hours have been saved in
cutting red tape, because more red tape can certainly be cut: it can be
rooted out. Assets are underemployed—estates are badly managed,
for instance—and we need to get more value from those
assets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021368000450" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0002.htm#13021368000450">We
face reductions throughout the comprehensive spending review period
during the current Parliament, but I repeat that we started from a high
base—a 20% real-terms increase over the 10 years of

against that backdrop. We do not support the cuts because we want to be
beastly to public services, or because we think that the police should
become more efficient and should therefore be paid less. We should all
like to be in a position to look again at what we spend on the police
once the economy starts growing again at trend or above, but in the

One of the public’s first concerns is whether they can see their
local police officer—the bobby on the beat—walking
around, and whether they can go to the local police station and report
crimes and feel safe as a result. Not all of us can have a Dr Who-type

yesterday from the Home Secretary that Herne—which has been
under way for the past year, with a number of police officers involved,
and at a cost to the taxpayer of £1.2 million—will now be
taken over by the chief constable of Derbyshire. That operation deals
with important issues involving undercover agents and the recent public
revelations, and a lot of money is being spent on these matters. I

welcome the decision of the deputy mayor of London, Stephen Greenhalgh,
to take a careful look at how the Metropolitan police have spent their
procurement budget. He took evidence from Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe on the
issue. When we commission companies to act if the public sector cannot
act, we must choose only companies with a good track record. Only
yesterday it was announced that G4S was going to have to hand back to
the taxpayer about £70 million. We should take into
account the expenditure from the police budget that goes on companies
such as G4S. The Select Committee was very clear that, as a result of
the big mistakes G4S made, it ought to have handed back all its
management fee of £57 million plus all the other money it ought

I want to say a few words about the need to carry people with us. The

consensus. We will see that when he comes to the Dispatch Box. I will
not say he is the most courteous of the Home Office Ministers as the
others might get upset if I were to do so, but he does not pick a
fight. The current Home Office policy is, in effect, picking a fight
with the people who have to implement the changes, however. Now is not
the best time to be cutting police officers’ pensions, forcing
them out under rule A19 and cutting their pay
retrospectively—although I perfectly understand why we might
need to make changes for new recruits.</hs_Para>

remember my last conversation with Paul McKeever on this subject. He

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T15:06:23"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown), was about
police pay. He was quite robust with me when he asked me not to go on a
demonstration under the last Labour Government in support of the police
who were having their pay cut. I said to him then—and I say to
the Home Secretary and Home Office Ministers now—that we must
carry the work force with us. If we say we have the best police service
in the world, the only way to express our admiration for what the
police have done is to treat them with proper respect—to have a
dialogue with them, to stop cutting their pay and conditions, to speak
to them because they know best day in, day out. As we have seen
recently in Manchester and other parts of the country, they lay down
their lives for us. They go out in the morning and they do not know
whether they are coming back at night, unlike all of us in this Chamber
today. If we do not carry them with us, the world-class brand

right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson) read out a number of quotes
from chief constables saying that they would have more
money—that is a shock! I would be concerned about any chief
constable’s future if they were to say publicly, “I
don’t want any more money. Frankly, I can’t think of any
way I could possibly spend that extra cash.” We would all like
to see more money in this area, but we know that we are in straitened

right hon. Gentleman argued in favour of 12% cuts as opposed
to 20% cuts. It is worth highlighting the fact that those figures apply
to the amount of money that goes from Government to the police and do
not take account of the amount generated locally, so the actual effects
are rather smaller than that. Disappointingly, what he did not do was
to answer my repeated question about where he would get the money from.
If I had an extra spare billion quid, I, too, would love to spend it on
a range of things. We could have a fascinating debate about how to
spend it. He simply said that he was going to spend it without saying
where he was going to take it from, and that is a cheap thing that
should not be done by an Opposition.</hs_Para>

used to be leader of the opposition on Cambridgeshire county council. I
insisted that we put together a costed budget and take it through the
same scrutiny process as the administration’s budget, and
Councillor Kilian Bourke has done that incredibly well this year. It
would be fantastic if the Opposition in this place were to provide
fully costed proposals and subject them to the same scrutiny as the
Government’s proposals, so that one could see where they are
just coming up with fanciful sums. I was disappointed not to hear that

crime has fallen almost everywhere in the country, and everyone in this

up.” It might do, because nobody knows exactly what will happen,
but if someone does not put some sort of time scale on how long they
think this will take—this was the point of my 
<?notus-xml column=904?>question to the right hon. Gentleman—they can keep saying that

bad. If they want to make a genuine prediction, they need to have some

crime going up.</hs_Para>

are tight, so we have to prioritise spending on policies that reduce
crime and achieve the goals of the police. The key is how we spend the
money we do have. I am pleased that we are cutting spending on a list
of things that the right hon. Gentleman was concerned about that. I am
pleased that money is being saved by not having CCTV cameras across the
entire country, with so little regulation. I am delighted that we are
spending money on an excellent commissioner on surveillance cameras,
who will make sure that CCTV is used only where it is useful and
genuinely proportionate. I am extremely pleased that we are cutting the
money that was spent storing the DNA of innocent people—in some
cases, people who had never been even accused of any crime. I am very
pleased that we are saving money in respect of internal exile without
trial and on identity cards. I wish that we had saved more of the money
that went on identity cards and that it had not all been
blown.</hs_Para>

would still like money to be saved in other areas. I am very concerned
about the increasing spread of Tasers. I am in favour of Tasers as a
replacement for firearms—as a step downwards. However, if we
believe in policing by consent, having more and more non-firearms
officers having Tasers risks escalation. There are huge concerns about
the use of Tasers, which, as hon. Members will know, have been misused
in a number of cases.</hs_Para>

Government have made proposals in their draft Communications Data Bill
and plan to spend £1.8 billion on them. They have
already spent £400 million and the previous Government spent a
huge sum on all its attempts to have the intercept modernisation
programme—billions of pounds that could have been spent on more
useful projects. I hope that no party in this place will spend money
willy-nilly, without looking at how it is being spent and what the
benefits might be.</hs_Para>

order to have better prioritised spending, we could do a lot about
transparency. We need to be careful that the move to police and crime
commissioners does not reduce that transparency. We could also learn a
lot more, and I am pleased that the College of Policing is being
established. The Liberal Democrats have a policy to go slightly further
and have an institute for policing excellence, which would be linked
with universities, to try to find out the best things that we could do.
I hope that we will see a strong link between the College of Policing
and universities, in order to find out what is happening, because we
have many expert researchers. For example, Professor Larry Sherman, at
the institute of criminology in Cambridge, is a world expert on how to
police effectively and efficiently to achieve the goals that we want.
Such an approach would allow us to find out how police time is spent
and make sure that it is actually used effectively and efficiently. I
am in favour of visible policing, but that is not measured by how many
police officers are on the books; it is also about how much time those
officers can actually spend out on the streets, rather than having to
do all the bureaucratic work they have been doing when I have been to
visit them over the past few years. They spend far too much 
<?notus-xml column=905?>time struggling with IT systems and with paperwork, whereas we would
like them to be out on the streets delivering visible policing, just as
they would.</hs_Para>

could make improvements in a number of other areas. I still believe
that this country’s drugs policy does not make the best use of
police time. It sucks up vast amounts of police time for very little
benefit. We spend more than any other country in Europe but the
incidence of drug use is among the highest. There are better
alternatives, such as the Portuguese model. Earlier this week, I was
talking to the chief superintendent in Brighton, Graham Bartlett, at
the launch of “Breaking the Taboo”, a film by Sundog

He is doing some extremely good work in Brighton, reducing crime by
having a far more enlightened, semi-Portuguese approach, and I
recommend that to
many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T15:16:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021368000486" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0002.htm#13021368000486">There
is also a lot to say about the police’s role, not just in
detecting crime, but in stepping in much earlier. I have spoken in this
place before about a police officer who was in my patch when I was a
county councillor. He was then PC Nick Percival, but he has been
promoted significantly since. He had a very effective approach, which
he developed, whereby he used e-mail to chat to people and tell them
where he was. People got the visible policing by getting a weekly
e-mail from him saying where he had been and what he had been up to. He
also focused on working with young people, who were often bored during
the holidays, and set up a brilliant scheme of giving vouchers during
the holidays to children who were seen by a police officer or a police
community support officer playing well. Whichever class got the most
vouchers got a £15 voucher for the local shops. The effect in
the area was that kids were playing on the grass hoping a police
officer would see them. That made for a better relationship between
young people and the police, and it reduced the amount of crime. In his
first year on that beat, PC Percival reduced the amount of crime and
antisocial behaviour by 50%. He did not detect very much and
he did not arrest many people, but he halved the crime rate. That is
the sort of thing we want to see.</hs_Para>

policing and policing by consent is not always just about the total

From 2008, an officer in the west midlands was 28 times more likely to
stop and search a black person than they were to stop and search a
white person, and there are similar figures for Greater Manchester and
the Met. An officer was 10 times as likely to stop Asian Britons as
they were to stop a white person. That was a big project. It was a bad
project. It put a lot people off and it created a lot of hostility, and
it was expensive. The level of stop and search under terrorism
legislation fell by 90% between 2010 and 2011 under changes that this

some time, the Opposition have been warning the Government that cutting
police budgets by 20% will have an adverse impact on front-line
policing. To say that such cuts can be imposed without impact is simply
unrealistic. In Cleveland, the number of officers lost between March
2010 and September 2012 was about 234, reducing the total number of
police officers from 1,724 to 1,490. According to Her Majesty’s
inspectorate of constabulary, that translates into about 15,000 police
officers nationally, which will result in the lowest number of police
officers for more than a decade. As at September 2011, 11,500 officers
had already

of that necessarily has an impact on the ability of officers to respond

for Cambridge (Dr Huppert), who said it was not simply a question of

people of this country do not expect politicians to go about their
business by reducing the number of police officers. That is evident
from the manifestos at the last election, which were couched in
completely opposite terms. The Government will plead that crime is
down, so the reduction in the work force is manageable, but that does
nothing to address the fact that fewer crimes are being solved: 30,000
fewer crimes are being brought to justice, including 7,000 offences of
violence against the person. This is the wrong moment to relax and take
our foot off the gas. Pressures building in our society may lead us to

reduction in grant has consequences. In my constituency, the police and

2010-11 to £8.66 billion in 2013-14. That is a cash reduction of
nearly £1.1 billion, equivalent to 22,000 police officer posts.
In Cleveland, the result is that savings of £24 million will
have to be made. If there are then plans to cut a further £2
billion from police budgets over the next funding period, as discussed
today, that is equivalent to 40,000 police officers. In my area, that
would track down to a further impact on the

conclusion, I urge the Government to think and pause. There is a real
risk that the cuts will lead to problems in the months and years ahead,

to take credit for that, but crime began to fall just before 1997, when
a Labour Government came to office. When we did so, the morale of the
police force was at an all-time low. The Labour policy of increasing
the number of front-line police officers; introducing thousands of
bobbies on the beat, police community support officers and
neighbourhood policing units; the record investment in rehabilitation
centres for people addicted to drugs and alcohol; the fact that we
funded various youth services and increased the number of drug
rehabilitation centres; the policies of diverting young people from the
criminal justice system: collectively, all those things led to a
significant fall in crime. While crime was falling, no Opposition
politician at the time, whether Liberal Democrat or Conservative, who
appeared on television or radio or in the print media, ever
acknowledged that crime was going down. In fact, every time they
appeared on radio and television when Labour was in power, they argued
that crime was rising. I am glad that finally that mindset has changed

austerity measures, which have been criticised by the International

often prevents people from committing crime is the sight of a police

Minister boasted that recruitment was not a problem and that the
Government were doing everything they could to encourage recruitment
and create a better police force, but that is not the impression that I
get from police officers on the front line. Let me tell the House about
Police Constable Turnbull, who came to see me in my constituency
office. He said that he had joined the police force many years ago,
full of hope and with a high level of dedication to duty. I know that
he will continue in that way, but he said that morale in the force,
especially among younger police officers, was at an all-time low.

whether to join the police force on that basis, but to take away
people’s pension rights retrospectively, when they have spent
10, 15 or 20 years contributing towards their pension, is plainly
unfair and will not help police morale. Morale affects
performance—if people are happy, they perform better; if they
are demoralised, their performance may be affected. I hope that will
not happen, because we have an incredibly good police force, one of the

have also seen the work of the integrated offender management system,

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:06:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bury St Edmunds said that pay accounted for a large

issue. Our aim has been to have pay and conditions that support forces
in driving out costs and making the best use of their resources. That
is why we have asked the police, along with the rest of the public

was interested to hear the assertion from the Opposition Front Bench

Opposition apparently also support reforms to overtime and shift
patterns, the pay freeze and the police arbitration tribunal’s
decision on police pay. They must therefore be talking about 12% plus
all those elements. When we analyse that, we find that they are in
substantially the same position as the Government, although they did
not accept that. If they are saying that they would implement 12%
savings, which of those elements do they not accept? They will need to

right hon. Member for Leicester East asked me whether the
counter-terrorism element should be part of the National Crime Agency.
He and his Committee highlighted that point in their recent report. I
can tell him that there will be no wholesale review of
counter-terrorism policing arrangements in England and Wales until
after the NCA is up and running. We judge that to be the right time to
look at that issue, although we recognise that it needs to be examined
in the context of the changed landscape for policing. On the point
about rural policing, the formula distributes funding based on relative
work loads in an area, and apportions according to population sparsity
to address the specific needs of rural
forces<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:09:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Andy McDonald) highlighted regional
organised crime units, and in many ways he touches on the important
issue of collaboration. I had the pleasure of going to the east
midlands special operations unit last year, and I saw how special
operations come together and how collaboration can make an important
difference. The Government strongly support that model of forces coming
together in that way.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin) highlighted a point about
partnerships, and I am sure that police and crime commissioners will
focus on that when considering how they apply the community safety fund
and budget. Yes, there is still more to do, but we are confident that
with a clear focus on making the necessary changes, the police will
continue to provide 
<?notus-xml column=918?>the service that the public deserve, alongside delivering value for
money for the taxpayer. I pay tribute to the work of the police in
doing that, and to their success in cutting crime and keeping our
community safe, and I commend the motion to the
House.</hs_Para>

of local authority income will now be raised locally, councils have
more power than ever before. However, they need to understand the
implications, act in their residents’ best interests and work
hard on their behalf, as I know many authorities across this country
do. That could be done by redesigning council tax benefit to cut fraud,
promote local enterprise and get people back into work, or by
redesigning services to make them more efficient and sustainable. Town

consultation process we were looking at how we reward councils that are
doing the right thing for their residents and moving away from the
begging bowl of the past, highlighted by some of the questions and
interventions from the Opposition Benches. I am happy to look at bids
and will be announcing details of the scheme next week for authorities

want authorities to go further and faster so that residents see and
feel the benefits. We want to help and reward those who are doing
things right. The evidence shows that it is good to share. South
Oxfordshire and Vale of White Horse have a joint chief executive and
management structure. South Holland is sharing its chief executive and
officers not just with Breckland but with Luton, showing that this
works well across different counties without shared boundaries and
across parties, despite the views of some Opposition Members. Babergh
and Mid Suffolk are sharing not just a chief executive but service
delivery across the whole range of their councils’ functions and
looking to go further. Those who follow suit will now get extra

settlement that captures a new ethos within local
government, generating more income through the new homes
bonus, business rate retention and a challenge fund. If
councils are willing to put people above political
grievance, as Luton has done—I hope Opposition
Members will join me in supporting it—and if councils
are willing look to the future, not in the rear-view mirror, they have
a once-in-a-generation chance to step out from the shadow of Whitehall,

Benn</B> (Leeds Central) (Lab):</Member> I am sorry and surprised that
the Secretary of State decided not to lead this debate. We know that
there are many issues on which he is all too willing to express a view,
and it would have been good to hear from him about the most important
responsibility he has in the job that he holds—the funding of
councils that help support the services on which all our communities
rely<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T16:59:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021368001182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0003.htm#13021368001182">That
would have given us an opportunity to question the Secretary of State
on why he told the Select Committee in December that the cuts to local
government funding were “modest”, and that the Local
Government Association’s fears for the future were
“utterly ludicrous”. In effect, he told councils to stop
complaining. I wonder whether he understands the anger and dismay that
those comments have caused, or the great disservice he is doing himself
by being in denial about what is happening in local
government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021368001183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0003.htm#13021368001183">This
is a time of rising pressures. In particular, as the Minister will
know, the costs of looked-after children and social care are rising.
The demands on local authorities are going up while income is going
down significantly. That is why the much-debated “graph of
doom” produced by the LGA does not, I think, cry wolf; it is
what it says is its best assessment of where local government is
heading if things continue as they are. If the Secretary of State does
not like what I have to say, the LGA’s Conservative leader, the
highly respected Sir Merrick Cockell, has called the cuts
“unsustainable”, and the Tory leader of Kent county
council says that his county cannot cope with further reductions and is
“running on empty”.</hs_Para>

by cutting more from them than from any other part of the public

save”, which is a combination of some things councils are doing
already, some things that are pretty darn obvious and some things that
are insulting. On value for money, will he explain why his colleague,
the Secretary of State, decided, despite all these pressures, 
<?notus-xml column=934?>to take £250 million of public money in an attempt to persuade
councils to change the way they collect bins, which resulted in only

us take a comparison between Wokingham, which the Minister referred to,

that spending power per dwelling in Leeds will be £1,874 in

year, it will be £1,800 for Leeds and £1,796 for
Wokingham—a difference of just under £5. It is clear that
the figures do not take account of relative need, because the
percentage of children in out-of-work families in receipt of child tax
credit is three times higher in Leeds than it is in Wokingham, the
percentage of 18 to 64-year-olds claiming income-based benefits is more
than three times higher in Leeds than it is in Wokingham, and the

of the problems councils face is that there is some uncertainty in the

local authorities will benefit from business rates localisation,
particularly because the Government have given themselves so many ways
in which they can take some of that growth in business rates for
themselves. The business rate projection for each local authority has
been averaged out over two years. Why did the Minister decide on a
two-year period, rather than averaging out over a five-year period as
his own consultation

business rate appeals, although the Government have increased the
adjustment of that to £593 million, will the Minister say
whether he is confident that that will be sufficient given that the LGA
says that appeals in the pipeline could be considerably larger than
this, thus exposing local government to an unacceptable level of risk?
Why did Ministers change the 2012-13 baseline to include cuts that
would not take place until the next financial year? Was it to try and
make the reductions in spending power look less than they actually
were<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T17:19:46"></hs_TimeCode>? I welcome

transition scheme worth £100 million, because they
knew there was a car crash heading their way. Especially since councils
finalised their council tax support schemes, which they had
to do by the end of last month, it has become clear that a large number
of councils, including the Secretary of State’s
council of Brentwood, are not taking any of the transitional
grant. Why is that? The report that went to Brentwood council made it
clear that it would have cost it more to do so. It would
have received just over £100,000 from the
transitional fund, but it would have cost it an extra
£300,000 to have taken it. That is not much in the

families? It is a tax rise on people who work hard—do not forget
that some people receiving the benefit are in work—carers, the

reductions would have to take place in local government. It is a bit

important point to make about that is that it is slightly depressing to

rebuild the base.” With respect—I say this from my
experience, for what it is worth, in local government and from my
period as a Minister—that is a profoundly misguided approach to
adopt. The world of public service delivery is changing. Simply
rebuilding the base on its old basis is not the answer. The base will
never be as it was before, because the way we do things will never be
as it was before. We are seeking to give local authorities the
flexibility in their funding arrangements to find new ways of using
their budgets, not simply saying, “Let’s get back to the
old levels of money and the old way of doing things.” That was
the mentality that got us into this mess in the first place. On the
contrary, through the initiatives announced by my hon.
Friend the Minister to reward efficiency much more—I hope we can
look at what more we can do in future—we are giving
local authorities an incentive to work together. It is not

Opposition Members will say, “Oh, what’s £1.2
million here or there?”—that is not the sort of money
they are interested in—but let us contrast that with my borough
of Bromley, which has never run a municipal newspaper in its life, but
which, when it needs to, simply takes out an advertising wraparound
with the free sheet. I can tell hon. Members that Bromley has been
done: it is appointing a shared director of public health, because part

spending power will be reduced in real terms by a third. That is a
significant reduction—indeed, a massive reduction. We are not
just talking about local council spending; we are talking about the
services that the money is spent on and the effect of the withdrawal of
those services on our local communities. The Minister talked about
hard-working council tax payers, and of course, council tax payers are,
by and large, hard working; but not once did he refer to hard-working
recipients of council services. People will now lose those services,
which in many cases they rely on. It seems as though the Government are
saying to our country and the public at large that libraries, parks,
environmental health and adult social care are, in some way,
second-rate services that we should have less regard for, because they
are prepared to make cuts of a third to those services, but cuts of
only 20% across the board to other Government services. What they are
really saying is that those local services, which our communities value
so much, are worth less and should be esteemed less than other things
the Government do.</hs_Para>

more comfortable for Ministers to see councils and councillors as
something of a human shield—people they can hide behind or to
whom they can say, “You’re the people to blame in your
local council chambers.” They are the people the public can get
at for making the cuts that are affecting them. There is someone
between Ministers and the impact on local communities of the cuts they

have always been very good. Under the Labour Government, when we used
to have increases in council funding each year, councils were always
required to make 2% efficiency savings a year. It is interesting that
in the latest MORI poll two thirds of the public said that they had not
yet noticed any impact from 
<?notus-xml column=945?>council cuts on their lives. That will change, but it shows how good
councils have been so far in absorbing the savings and achieving the
efficiencies that have been requested of them. But people will be
affected and, frankly, the Secretary of State’s 50 ways to save
the world will not save our local
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0003.htm#13021388000039">The

pennies is important. When I went to a meeting at Sheffield council the
other day I did not get tea or coffee and biscuits. They were not

has rented out. Those are the sorts of things that are being done.
Sheffield has a brilliant record of collecting council tax—a 99%
collection rate—although that is likely to change with the
changes to council tax benefits, when it will have to try and get
£2, £3 or £4 from people who cannot afford it. We
have saved more than £2 million a year through going to an
alternate-week bin collection, and I have not had a single member of
the public write to me with a discarded chicken masala in hand saying,

That is five times more in Sheffield than other authorities. The
Minister will say that Sheffield gets more grant, and because it has
had more grant, there is more grant to cut. But Sheffield, like other
cities, has had more grant because it has fewer resources and more need
than other areas. Ministers are taking grant from areas that have
traditionally had more grant, but those are the poorest, most deprived

Betts:</Member></B> There are lots of factors that have been put into
the formula in the past. We can all make arguments about the details.
For example, it is more expensive to provide services in Sheffield
because of its topography. We have hills, so construction costs, such
as for the tram, go up. But on the index of deprivation, the most
deprived areas will get the biggest cuts. There is no argument about
that—if there were, Ministers would be jumping up to the

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0003.htm#13021388000043">The
Secretary of State says, “It is all right, councils have got
reserves. There is no need for cuts.” That is not true. Yes,
Sheffield has around £150 million of reserves, but more than
£25 million of it is held for schools, and it cannot spend that;
£25 million is in the housing account, ring-fenced and
dedicated; some £50 million is to be allocated for capital
projects; and then there is the 
<?notus-xml column=946?>money that has to be used to match-fund a PFI scheme that the Government
have just approved—I give credit to them for taking forward that
Labour scheme. That leaves around £11 million of reserves, and

Ministers talk about the new homes bonus as if it were new money as
well as new homes. It is not: it is top-sliced from the grant. In
Sheffield’s case, the figures are very stark. For every 55p the
council gets from the new homes bonus, it would have received £1
if the money had been allocated through the grants system. It is not
that Sheffield does not want to build new homes. There is a reason. The
market is flat in the private sector, the money for housing
associations comes through the Homes and Communities Agency and the
money for council housing is not there because the Government have
capped the amount councils can spend from the housing revenue account.
That is why not so many new homes are being built in
Sheffield—it is not through want of trying or want of effort on
the part of the council.</hs_Para>

welcome the fact that this local government financial settlement is
moving away from an unfair and incomprehensible formula grant system.
This will put more power into the hands of local councils by letting
them keep more of what they raise locally in business rates. I am
firmly in favour of the principle of localisation of business rates.
Local authorities will directly retain nearly £11 billion of
business rates instead of returning them to the Treasury. Allowing

highlighted as having some of the best financial procedures of any

put in place by the Labour Government with commendation and improved

education and ring-fenced grants.

received in 2012-13. Secondly, the cost of the council tax support
scheme is included in both the council tax requirement figures and the

pressures and hugely disproportionate reductions in funding from the
coalition Government, which has created a budgetary black hole. The
city treasurer has revealed that the funding gap in Newcastle by the
end of 2014-15 will not be £90 million, as originally thought.
Following further announcements by the Secretary of State at the end of
last year, that will increase by an additional £10 million, so
the black hole will now be as large as £100 million over the
next three years. Around half of this is a direct reduction in central
Government grant funding, with the rest being unavoidable cost
pressures that the council must absorb. Based on the
Department’s own figures, the cut in Newcastle’s spending
power between 2012-13 and 2014-15 will be £218 per person,
compared with a national average cut of £134 per person. At the
same time, as my right hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State set
out, the Prime Minister’s own local authority is getting an
increase in spending power of 3.1% in its local government finance

keep skewing the funding more and more. It was both politically

represent, we have both an elderly population and a great number of
people on low incomes. That combination needs to be addressed, as does
the cost of service delivery, because it is more expensive to deliver
many services, although not all, in the rural East Riding than it is to
deliver them in north Hull. The last thing I want to do is talk down
the residents of north Hull or of any other part of the country, urban
or otherwise, but we need to have another look at need and ensure that
we, preferably with a broad consensus across the House, can have a

The hon. Lady heard the Minister say that the percentage cut in
Newcastle, which has a vastly greater budget than rural and deprived
areas of the East Riding, is experiencing lower levels of reduction. To
make out that it is the opposite and that this is an unparalleled

I have said, the costs of delivery in sparsely populated areas are
often higher than those in urban areas and, overall, rural residents

made out that everybody in an urban area is in the most terrible,
deprived state, but most people in the cities are not and lots of
people who live there earn more. They have higher average earnings than
those in rural areas. Council tax in rural areas, where incomes are
lower, is £75 a head higher. If we apply that across the
household, we will see that the spending power in rural areas is lower.
I sympathise with Labour Members on the closure of cultural centres in
their areas, but my area does not have any because we do not have the

Johnson</B> (Kingston upon Hull North) (Lab):</Member> I have listened
carefully to the debate and I have to say that the Government are out
of touch with what is going on in many parts of the country. I want to
talk about what is happening in my home city, because the
disproportionate nature of the cuts in Hull needs careful
examination.</hs_Para>

the past two years, Hull has lost £163.50 per person, compared
with a national average of just £74 per head. From
the cumulative figures that have been provided by Newcastle city
council, it appears that, over the four-year period, the figure for
Hull will rise to £228.36 per head. Hull is taking a much larger
share of the Government’s council funding cuts than many wealthy
areas. When I looked through the figures, I was particularly struck
that West Dorset district council was losing only £2.70 per
head.</hs_Para>

know that, from April onwards and up to 2015, Hull will lose a further
7.2% in what the Government are now calling “spending
power”. As has already been said, the Prime Minister’s
West Oxfordshire council will be receiving a rise, even though it is
the 316th least deprived local authority area out of 325. Hull is the
10th most deprived area and is taking a much larger cut. That is not
fair, and I think that that unfairness forms the basis of the
objections of many Labour Members—the lack of fairness in the
distribution of the cuts that are taking
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:36:19"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:35:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

the Government have to face is that they are using all sorts of
different terms and ways of describing the funding that is going to
local authorities. What I know is that in Hull the cuts are much deeper

think again if they want to rebalance the economies of the north and
the south. This is just another hammer blow to economic regeneration in
the north, and to cities standing up and paying their own way. It will
not help my city of Hull, which is struggling at the moment. Just

the Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts), the Chair of the

important work that local councils do on environmental health and
trading standards, and in looking after some of the most vulnerable and
damaged young people in our society—looked-after children, and
elderly and disabled people who need social care. The councillors in
Hull are doing their best to make sure that they can cover as much of
those services as possible, but the Government are making it completely
impossible to provide the kind of services we need in an area with such
disadvantage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:39:09"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:35:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

that people in Hull should lose the money they need to deal with health

that the Government provide the necessary

am reminded of the 1920s and the dispute involving Poplar borough
council. We had a Liberal-Tory coalition then, and the good councillors
of Poplar had to fight their corner then, because of the nature of the
cuts being imposed on poorer areas of the country. It was generally
accepted after a High Court ruling that richer areas should subsidise
poorer areas, but of course the Government are rowing back completely
on that and reverting to the idea that everywhere has to cope on their
own, as a result of which the wealthy areas do well and the poorer
areas sink without trace.</hs_Para>

new homes bonus will not help areas such as Hull. It is the wealthier
areas that benefit from new homes being built. The Liberal Democrats
like to talk about the pupil premium, but in 2011-12, Hull city council
had £6,516 per pupil to spend on education and support services,
whereas Kensington and Chelsea could afford to spend £8,920 per
pupil. My constituents know jolly well what the Government are doing to
the funding available to them and other northern cities.</hs_Para>

is a time for people in Hull to come together, and that includes the
Liberal Democrats. There was a brief flirtation with the Liberal
Democrats in Hull, but I think that most people there now recognise
what they really are—Tories. People in Hull now recognise that
this is not a fair settlement from the Government. We need to stand
united in Hull, just as people in Newcastle and other parts of the
country are standing united, and say, “Enough is enough.”
The bedroom tax, council tax benefit—they cannot keep doing this
to cities that are already struggling. I call upon the Minister to
address the inequality in the cut given to Hull in particular and to
explain it to my constituents, because they do not understand why they
are being so penalised. They are doing their very best, living on
limited incomes, working as hard as possible and looking for extra work
when possible, yet the Government, time after time, seem hellbent on
making the poorest pay the most. It is not
fair.</hs_Para>

Their response was illuminating. They asked me what on earth I thought
they had been doing over the years. They also said that most of the
changes would save only pennies, in comparison with the £43
million savings that they needed to find. As Members would expect,
however, I did not accept that. I went through every one of the

offices except the central one. It shares buildings and is centralising
its staff, who already hot-desk. The canteen breaks even. The council
stopped using posh hotels and holding glitzy award ceremonies years
ago. It opened a coffee shop in the library, but it did not work. It
has got rid of more than half the senior posts in the authority. It

physiotherapy to get injured employees back to work. It releases staff

Gordon Marsden</B> (Blackpool South) (Lab):</Member> As the
Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon.
Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis) who opened the debate moved
to the apotheosis of a speech that, sadly, was rather shot through with
bombast and self-satisfaction, he delivered the stirring words that
putting councils in charge of their own destiny was the centre point of
this local government statement. In the time allowed I would like 
<?notus-xml column=965?>to look at one council—my own council in Blackpool—and see
what it has done to put itself in charge of its own destiny and how it
has been affected by the way the Government have dealt with
it.</hs_Para>

a small unitary authority, Blackpool is entering a difficult situation
and difficult narrative due to Government cuts over the past two years.
According to the multiple deprivation index, it is the sixth most
deprived council in the country, and in that respect resembles a number
of other seaside and coastal towns that have pockets of severe
deprivation—such as the Minister’s council in Great
Yarmouth, for example. Most of those areas, including many in the
north, were hit badly by the removal of area based grants, which, as we
have heard, were famously defended by a former Minister because most
must be cut from those who have received the most.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021388000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0004.htm#13021388000179">Blackpool<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:53:50"></hs_TimeCode>
does not benefit from any dedicated funding because of the level of
transience, and there is no acknowledgement in its health funding of
the extra burdens placed on services by visitor numbers. On the heat
register, Blackpool will lose an average of £215 per person over
four years, and £83 over two years. My council has had funding
cuts of 19.2% for the past two years. It has lost £40 million
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T18:54:18"></hs_TimeCode>over the past
two years, with approximately £14 million of further cuts in
2013-14 and approximately £20 million more over the next two
years. I noticed that the Minister waxed lyrical about profligate
councils sitting around with big reserves, but Blackpool
council’s current reserve stands at £4 million, out of a
proposed net expenditure budget for 2013-14 of £150
million.</hs_Para>

many other councils we have heard about this evening, Blackpool has
done many of the things that Ministers have preached should
be prudent for local government to do. It has worked on ways to cut
waste in a major way and cut a whole level of senior officers. Sadly,
it has had to lose hundreds of posts and hundreds of jobs over the last
two years, with 300 posts proposed to go this year. Blackpool has also
frozen the council tax, but—of course, the Minister
did not tell us this—that is on the basis of a grant of only 1%
this year as opposed to 2.5% for previous years. Despite all
that, Blackpool council has gone ahead with progressive
measures, including moving towards a living wage for its workers and
free breakfast clubs, so it does not need to take any lessons from
Ministers about that. The cash reduction in this year’s
Government settlement is £3 million. The council tax
freeze grant, to which I have referred, means a further loss of
£1.5 million, with demographic pressures from children’s
social care of £1.1 million.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn), the shadow
Secretary of State, millions of people in England on low incomes face
rising council tax this year, including those who will now have to
contribute to council tax who have previously been exempt. What will
that figure of £410 million and a 10% cut in funding do for
people in Blackpool? In Blackpool, it means a tax rise on a large
number of people on low incomes. Like most seaside and coastal towns,
we have people doing two or three part-time jobs, many of them women.
We 
<?notus-xml column=966?>have larger than average numbers of older people and disabled people,
which has specific implications for the amount that my council will now
be forced to charge those who are not exempt, because this Government
have decided that pensioners should be exempt from contributing to the

has to be placed on other people. Who are those other people? They are
not the millionaires, who will receive a tax cut; they are people
working hard on low incomes—carers, the disabled and single
mums. They are people who are already being hit by the
Government’s cuts in the uprating of benefits and working

the transitional grant, because in percentage terms the average
transitional grant will cover only a quarter of the original 10% cuts.
It just so happens that my council in Blackpool will receive the lowest
proportion of the transitional grant, so I am afraid the Minister will
win no plaudits from Opposition Members or, I suspect, from many of his
own constituents for the settlement he has imposed on them. The reality
of this settlement is that it is unfair and unjust for some of the
poorest people who are working hard as carers, part-time workers and
single mums. Such people in Blackpool and many other places can ill
afford to pay this money, and the Government should be ashamed of the
incoherent and unequal settlement that they have put before the

settlement that ensures that the 10 most deprived authorities in the
country are taking spending cuts six times higher than the 10 least
deprived is not fair by anyone’s estimation, however much the
Government try to use smoke and mirrors to cover it up. That is indeed
what they have done. First, they changed the base—the 2012-13
funding base—by including in it cuts that do not start until the
next financial year, including cuts to council tax support, to early
intervention grants, and to grants for preventing homelessness. Then
they added in the public health grant, but that is not only
ring-fenced, it is a grant for new burdens on local authorities, so it
cannot be used to calculate year-on-year
changes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0004.htm#13021388000194">The
reason for those changes is very simple: they want to make it look as
though the cuts in spending power are less than they are. But we know
what they are. There is a 33% cut in funding for local authorities over
the spending review cycle. For some authorities, of course, it is much
worse. The Secretary of State has taken to giving out spending power
cuts per dwelling now, rather than per person, but even on the
Government’s own figures the unfairness is clear. Over the next
two years, Knowsley will lose £206 per dwelling, Surrey will
lose £14, Camden will lose £200, Wokingham—our
favourite council—will lose £43, Liverpool will lose
£184, and Windsor and Maidenhead will lose £46. At least
we can grant the Tories the merit of being consistent: they always take
money from the poorest people, whether it be through a bedroom tax for
the very poorest and a tax cut for millionaires or attacking the
poorest local authorities in the country. We can rely on them to be
consistent.</hs_Para>

heat maps for where the cuts fall, I doubt whether he would say that in
the north-east, in the north-west, in inner London boroughs or in our
big cities—even in what he used to call “my city of

we have the smoke and mirrors applying to the rest of the grant. We
have heard about the new homes bonus. In fact, the money for that bonus
is taken out of the formula funding by a straight percentage cut, but
its distribution is related to council tax bands, which means that
local authorities with a higher tax base gain more than those with a
lower tax base. That is why Newcastle will lose £6.4 million and
get back £3 million; and why Knowsley gets only 15p for every
pound it is top-sliced. “To them that hath shall be
given” seems to be the mantra of this Government. That is why in
this settlement, the relative needs block has been cut by over
£500 million. It is because this Government are not
interested in funding for need.</hs_Para>

same is true if we look at the early intervention grant. Money in the
settlement has been top-sliced supposedly to account for nursery places
in schools for two-year-olds. In the autumn statement of 2011, however,
the Chancellor promised that that would be new money. It is not new
money; it is money taken from some of the most deprived children in the
most deprived areas of this country. By the end of next year, the
funding gap will be £488 million—and it will go on
rising. I do not know how any Liberal Democrat who has trumpeted the
need for support for the poorest children can possibly vote for such a
settlement.</hs_Para>

us look at the other part of the settlement—the localisation of
business rates. The Government have determined local councils’
allocation based on a two-year average, but their own consultation
recommended a five-year average. The reason is very simple: it was to
reflect appeals over a full cycle. Now under great pressure, they have
put money back in for appeals, but it is nowhere near the costs that
local councils will face. What will happen when the appeals come in?
Councils will have no choice but to cut services yet again to fund
backdated
appeals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T19:08:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0004.htm#13021388000200">The
Government have, of course, come up with a figure by which they expect
business rates to grow. No one knows quite how they have reached that
figure. I think that they have probably plucked it out of the air. The
Office for Budget Responsibility has been wrong in every estimate it
has made of business rate income since it was set up. It has always
overestimated it. So, local authorities are then told to grow their
business rates. They must bring in more jobs and businesses, but they
are facing a flatlining economy and a double-dip recession. The
Government have no plan for growth, yet they lecture local authorities
on promoting it. It is like King Herod lecturing people on child care.
What is more, they make it more difficult for the poorest economies
because of the amount of money they are taking out of them.</hs_Para>

consider the reductions in council tax benefit funding. Birmingham
alone will lose at least £10 million. Newham will lose £3
million, and Gateshead £2.9 million. Only a fraction of that
will be returned in transition grants. Then there are the benefit cuts.
Liverpool will lose £7.3 million per annum in bedroom tax alone,
and 
<?notus-xml column=969?>Knowsley will lose £3.4 million. Newcastle estimates that the
incomes of 27,000 families will be cut as a result of the
Government’s tax and benefit changes. That money would otherwise
be spent in local shops and businesses, funding the local economy. The
Government take money away from the local economies that are struggling
most, and then lecture authorities on how to grow those
economies.</hs_Para>

suggest that the hon. Lady is wrong in her analysis. I genuinely
believe that the settlement is fair, but I also believe that it
represents a watershed moment for local government. We have made clear
that it arms authorities with an average spending power of
£2,216 per dwelling with which to protect services. We have also
acknowledged that that is a reduction—a reduction in spending
power of, on average, 1.3%. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull
North (Diana Johnson) questioned which figures we should use. We are
using the spending power figure because it is the figure that the Local

certainly was not the policy of the Labour party when it was in power.
Central Government’s stranglehold over local government got ever
tighter then, but perhaps he is right and Labour has seen the error of
its centralising ways.

key change that has occurred in this budget which has almost totally
been ignored is the one to allow local councils to retain a key
proportion of business rate, giving them the real opportunity, for the
first time, that if they work with the local business community to help
get growth in that community, they will get a real-terms reward. This
is a fair settlement and it is a settlement about opportunity. We are
talking about opportunity through the new homes bonus, through the
business rate retention scheme and now through our new challenge fund.
We believe that the majority of local councils are up to the challenge,
and those who take on that challenge will have our full
support.</hs_Para>

December, we have taken steps to ensure that the poorest pensioners

standard minimum guarantee must be increased by law at least in line
with earnings. That means that the minimum increase this year would be
1.6%. However, we decided to increase the value of the standard minimum
guarantee credit by 1.9% so that single people will receive the full
increase of £2.70 a week, which is equal to the increase in the
basic state pension, while couples will receive £4.15 a week.
Consistent with our approach last year, the resources needed to pay
that above-earnings increase to the standard minimum guarantee have
been found by increasing the savings credit threshold, which means that
those with higher levels of income will see less of an

pension credit has been a persistent problem. Over the past year or so
we tried a pilot scheme in which we took a sample of people we thought,

money in your bank account. Would you like to claim pension

it, or decided that they did not want or need it, or thought that they

authorities to dampen down the effect of the council tax

on empty homes and on second homes—which are not generally

is worth reflecting on the history of the triple lock. In its first
year, it was announced but not actually implemented. If it had been
implemented, it would have produced, from the Government’s point
of view, an embarrassingly small pension increase. The Minister,
sensibly, chose to override it and instead apply a larger increase that
in that year was in line with RPI. At its first outing, therefore, it
failed. In its second year—last year—it was actually
implemented, and delivered an increase in line with CPI, along with
working-age benefits. This year it is being applied again, and for the
first time it is delivering something better than CPI uprating—a
point made by the Minister.</hs_Para>

increase in CPI, as measured last September, was 2.2%, and the uprating
amount in line with the triple lock is 2.5%. So that is it: in
comparison with the CPI uprating, which until recently was the
Government’s policy for working-age benefits, the triple lock
has delivered a higher pension by a paltry 0.3%. Of course, if it had
been applied in the first year, it would have been less than the CPI
uprating. The triple lock has delivered a higher pension of 0.3% over
three years—a rather derisory achievement. It is clear that the
triple lock has been something of a damp squib. Of course, if it was

restricting the tax relief on pensions saving for those
earning over £150,000 per year. We will guarantee anyone over

pointed out just how successful the future jobs fund was in getting
young people back to work. It estimated that the net benefit to society
as a whole was £7,500 for every participant in the future jobs
fund, and that is after taking account of all the costs of the
initiative. Of the gross cost of some £750 million for the
future jobs fund, over half was recouped by the Treasury in additional
tax payments and reduced benefit payments. Our compulsory jobs
guarantee will repeat that success for the over-25s. We will get

further down the income scale, families with children and women who are
heading 
<?notus-xml column=991?>lone parent families. I think that when we take decisions such as this,
it is important to assess the position of those whose benefits are at
stake and to look at their plight. The Institute for Fiscal Studies
said that 2.5 million workers’ families will lose an

Children born in families with low incomes already have a birth weight

These families are more closely associated with infant mortality and
chronic disease later in life, yet these are the ones whose benefits
and income we are cutting. Before their second birthday, a child from a
poorer family is already showing a lower level of attainment than those
in professional families. By six, a poorer child will already have been
overtaken in terms of attainment by a child of lesser ability from a

had a consensus for at least two generations after the welfare state
was established that when inflation took hold, we would increase social
security benefits in line with inflation, so that the poorest would be
protected. I agree that we occasionally had rows in this
House—both between and within parties—about what form
that protection should take. I refused to support the shift from RPI to
CPI. That was a debate worth having, and even under the new definition,
at least people on social security benefits were protected. Now we have
torn up that consensus and the people who suffer will not be those who
take part in party political debates, but the sort of people who were
surveyed by Save the Children, and most of them will be children. That

benefits have risen by more than earnings in the past five years, using
it to justify the 1% rise. However, he knows that if we look at a
different time period, we come up with a very different figure. Since
1979, unemployment benefit and its successor benefit,
jobseeker’s allowance, has fallen from 22% of average earnings
to 11% of average earnings. We are starting from a very low base
indeed, and it is not right or fair therefore to say that 1% is
adequate for people who are

are we in some of these spending positions? The irony of all this is
that so many of the policies we are facing will drive up spending, be
it on some of the benefits under discussion today or on the related
benefits—the ones that would come under the tax system at the
moment, such as tax credits. Some 90% of new housing benefit claimants
in the past couple of years have been people in work, and that has been
because of the level of wages and because these people are in part-time
work. That has been driving up the housing benefit totals, which the
Government are very concerned about, as I am. I am not comfortable with
the fact that, as we are told repeatedly, the housing benefit bill has
risen so much in the past 10 years, but we need to examine the reasons
for that. The major reason is because so many people on low incomes are
finding themselves with no other housing choice but the private rented
sector, the cost of which in housing benefit is very high. If we do not
tackle that underlying issue, in one way or another, be it by creating
more affordable housing or by dealing with the issue of private sector
rents, the housing benefit bill will still creep up and up, and in a
couple of years’ time we will not have made any progress in
reducing it.</hs_Para>

for Eastbourne decided to raise the question of jobs. It is frequently
said in this place that 1 million private sector
jobs have been created, and therefore our economic policy is
working. The Prime Minister says it all the time. In January 2011,
within a short time of coming into office, the Government told us that
half a million new private sector jobs had been created. Presumably
that was the true figure at the time. Many of us think that one of the
reasons for the increase in jobs was the economic stimulus
applied by the previous Government; it was certainly very
soon for the coalition Government’s policies to have
taken effect. If that figure was correct and the figure of 1 million is
correct, since then—two years ago—apparently only half a
million jobs have been created. But—it is a big but—in
that period, 170,000 jobs in colleges were reclassified from the public
to the private sector, and 100,000 jobs appear to be unpaid work
placements. At the last Department for Work and Pensions questions,

about to say that many of the jobs are exactly of that nature, which
ratchets up the support payments. People on low earnings or who work
very part-time hours are the very people who depend on housing benefit
and, in many cases, tax credits. When we look at that situation, we see
that the wonderful recovery in jobs is really not so wonderful. Indeed,
some of the jobs are so part-time as to be almost
invisible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000866" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0004.htm#13021388000866">Life<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
is very difficult for people who work in those kinds of jobs. They
often have to start work at very difficult hours. A constituent who
came to see me was desperate to work, and she found a job, but it meant
that she had to get from Edinburgh to Livingston, which is about 20
miles. Without a car, it is quite a long way—it may be 18 miles;
my figures might not be quite right. She had to get there for 7
o’clock in the morning. How can someone do that when they do not
have a car and public transport is either non-existent or very
expensive? That job did not last long, because she could not keep
it up.</hs_Para>

worked for a number of years in a job that fitted with her

available to her. She now had to work for just 12 hours—she had
previously managed to work for 20 hours—or she had to go on a
flexible contract so that she could be called in whenever the shop
wanted her. That was difficult—in fact, virtually
impossible—for her because of things such as child care
arrangements. She could not just suddenly come in on a Saturday or come
in of an evening. The job had suited her needs, and it had brought a
reasonable income that enabled her to support her children. Now she was
told, “Well, if you don’t like it, there are plenty of
people looking for these jobs and we can fill them very easily. If you

we debated the issue a few weeks ago, I raised a number of concerns.
What I have heard this evening has done nothing to assuage those
concerns. A below-inflation rise and a real-terms cut over three years
will do nothing except pile on the pain for low and middle-income
households that are already paying the price of the recession. The cap
of 1% on the uprating of working-age benefits will drive low-income
families into real hardship, increase levels of deprivation, and
accentuate the gross inequalities that plague our society. It will hit
parents especially hard, particularly those in low-paid or part-time
work. Given the extremely short time that we had to debate this a few
weeks ago, with strict time limits, it would be utterly wrong to allow
this debate to end without challenging those points and reiterating the
key issues.</hs_Para>

is fair to say that low-paid workers have already borne the brunt of
the economic downturn. Many people have seen their working hours cut.
Increasingly, we find people, especially women, working part-time when
they really want a full-time job. Those who have child care and caring
responsibilities, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore) mentioned a moment ago, often find
themselves in seasonal, temporary, part-time, insecure and sometimes
zero hour contract work. It is extremely difficult for them to juggle
the competing demands on their time if they have caring
responsibilities or children to look
after<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000876" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0004.htm#13021388000876">We
should not forget that unemployment is still unacceptably high and
concentrated geographically in certain parts of the UK. It is neither
fair nor accurate to lay responsibility for high unemployment solely on
people who are unemployed. Although it may be easier for us to abdicate
responsibility for economic policies and political decisions and blame
unemployed people for their own plight, we should acknowledge the role
of the wider economy, the climate we are living in, our political
response to it and the inadequacies of that in creating the present
high levels of
unemployment<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000877" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0004.htm#13021388000877">The
key point is that it is not just the unemployed who are hit by a freeze
and a cut in working-age benefits—it is people in work who will
pay the highest price. The Resolution Foundation has said that around
60% of the cuts will fall on people in work. It is important to see the
impact of the autumn statement in the round, looking at the freeze on
benefits alongside other measures. According to Citizens Advice, a
family of two parents both working in full-time low-paid jobs, with two
children, paying a modest rent of £130 a week, will be more than
£12 a week worse off by 2015. A similar family with one
full-time earner on minimum wage will be about £13 a week worse
off by 2015.</hs_Para>

disabled lone parent of two children receiving the support component of
employment and support allowance will see a comparable net loss of
income in real terms. This does not take account of the cuts that such
families have already experienced through last year’s changes to
the tax credit system and child care support. The distributional
analysis of the Government’s own impact assessment shows that
the Government’s reforms will hit the lower half of the income
spectrum hard. The analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows
that the pain of the austerity measures is being felt in the lower five
income deciles, with the biggest losses in the lowest
deciles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T20:57:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000879" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0004.htm#13021388000879">The
point that I have made previously in debates on this subject is that
although these distributional analyses can be helpful, they do not tell
the human story. More than that, they do not show the disproportional
impact that the rising cost of living has on low-income households. In
the context of today’s inflation forecasts that show that high
inflation is set to be with us for several years, this point becomes
even more acute. Whether it is hikes in domestic fuel prices or rises
in the price of staple foods, it is the things that lower income
households most depend on that are going up in price most quickly. I
have said before that I do not think the retail prices index or the
consumer prices index is a particularly good measure for assessing the
experience of inflation in lower-income households, but the CPI for
sure underestimates the real impact of those real-term cuts in
support.</hs_Para>

is not just abstract economic theory. We are talking today about the
difference between a 1% rise of about 71p and an inflationary rise of a
meagre £1.50 a week. It is important that we bear in mind what
we are doing. Abandoning any link with earnings or prices sends a
strong signal that the Government are abandoning any support for
citizens going through tough times. It undermines the social contract

the Member for Hayes and Harlington made about families and children.
If we do not give the next generation the right start in life when they
are children, we give them 
<?notus-xml column=1000?>the wrong start. I must say to the Minister that even now we see across
our country the struggle that my party had in government to undo some
of the damage from the previous 18 years. The damage can be done in a
short period, but it takes an awful lot longer to recover from. We
struggled in government to try to get things back on track. What the
Minister is doing today is not what he said he would do when he was in
opposition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T21:04:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000895" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0004.htm#13021388000895">When
he leaves this place tonight, I implore the Minister to pick up a copy
of a documentary called “Poor Kids”. I have seen it a
couple of times and it is heart-breaking, to say the least. As a father
and grandfather, I say to the Minister that what the documentary shows
is not beyond belief, because it does happen. It happens in many towns
and cities across this country where families are living on basically
nothing. Children as young as eight, nine or 10 years old have become
worldly wise: they know about not having money and what debt is, and
they understand how trying to put a meal on the table can result in
other elements of poverty. That is not how children in this country
should be spending their early
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T21:05:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T21:05:33"></hs_TimeCode>.
They survive on hand-me-down clothes, not necessarily from older
brothers or sisters but from other family members. Despite what many
people think, charity shops on our high streets are an absolute godsend
for such families, because sometimes they are the only way children can
be

sometimes sacrifice their own meals to feed their children. Perhaps I
have led a sheltered life, but it was only when it was drawn to my

tell them, “I’ll get something to eat later,” that

way that some families are going to survive. My wife volunteers and
works alongside the local church providing meals for homeless families.
In reality, there are very few homeless families, but there are
families who are in great need of a hot meal a couple of times a week.

patients with fluctuating conditions, mental health problems and

People are going back to their GPs to look for help, support, guidance,
and even help with completing forms. Some GP practices are beginning to
creak at the seams in having to deal with people they should not really
be seeing—people whose conditions will never, in all honesty,
get any better medically. It is a real worry when the professional

second order is uncontroversial, as the Minister explained at the
outset, but inside the controversial order on social security benefits
uprating are two issues in particular. First, there is the nature and
extent of the uprating of pensioner incomes; and, secondly, there is
the Government’s decision to cut in-work and out-of-work
benefits. It would be better if those two things had been separated to
allow for a proper debate on both, but the Government have taken the
decision to place one inside the
other<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T21:13:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T21:13:35"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms), who forensically

the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr Brown). All their
contributions were characterised by an emphasis on and an interest in
how the Government’s decision to cut in-work and out-of-work
benefits will affect families—not only families in what we might
call the squeezed middle but families who are looking for work. I will
return to the issue of what we might call the strivers tax, but let me
first deal with the nature and extent of the uprating of pensioner
incomes.</hs_Para>

have heard much from the Minister about the triple lock. I do not know
if he is aware, but the original triple lock was a handgun first
produced by Smith &amp; Wesson in 1908. Like the Minister, it had such
high hopes for its triple lock. It claimed it was the best gun it had
ever made and yet, just eight years later, the triple lock was
redundant: it was a triumph of rhetoric over reality. The same might be
said of the Government’s triple lock. This is the third year it
has been in operation, and we know that the increase in the state
pension is less than it would have been if the uprating method used by
the previous Government was still in place.

is worse than that, however. The triple lock this year has produced a

Friend, one could only feel that the Minister wants to have his
proverbial cake and eat it. Last year, the Minister trumpeted that he
had delivered the highest real-terms increase in the state pension for
about 10 years. Having in all seriousness claimed that credit, it is
difficult for him now to avoid the blame for the very same mechanism
that is producing a real-terms cut in the state

increase of 2.5% over inflation, compared with 2.2%, as derisory. I
remind him that the extra 0.3% cost the taxpayer £150 million. I
remember the funny-money days of Labour when £150 million was
considered a mere rounding error. He dismisses it as derisory. When his
party was in office, it was borrowing £150 billion a year, so I
appreciate that for him, £150 million is small
change, but I still have the naive feeling that that amount is a lot of
money. He and others derided our triple lock as though it were a trifle
and of no consequence, but had Labour implemented the triple lock
between 1997 and now, we would be spending an additional
£3 billion on the state pension. So if Labour had
applied the triple lock that he derides as inconsequential throughout
their term in office, we would be spending £3 billion a year
more on pensions. But perhaps he thinks that that sum is derisory, and
a frippery, as well.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway mentioned people having their
disability-related benefit reassessed. I would gently remind him that
reassessing the millions of people on incapacity benefit, many of whom
had been parked on benefit for a decade or more, was begun, rightly, by
the last Labour Government. That process has been carried on. That is
why people are being reassessed. We think it right not to park people
on incapacity benefit for decades, only for them to retire and find
that they have no pension either. So the reassessments are right. I
entirely accept the point that they have to be done well, but they were
begun under the last Government and they continue under this
one.</hs_Para>

pm, but that should not take away from the importance of the issue and
the child care crisis facing many families in my constituency and
across Britain today.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T21:33:11"></hs_TimeCode>I wanted to

is debate so important now? First, families are being hit by a triple
whammy of the Government’s making: rising costs of child care;
reduction in financial support; and for many, a financial disincentive
to work. I will say more about those issues shortly.</hs_Para>

not only were the Government’s recent announcements on changes
to child care regulation—a loosening of ratios between carers
and children, and a greater requirement for qualifications—not
brought to the House for debate, they have been widely derided by
parents and providers and are confused and dangerous. What is more,
there is little evidence that those proposals will have any impact on
costs

for many weeks now we have read in the papers and heard from
Ministers—not least in the mid-term relaunch of the coalition by
the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister—about a new package
of financial support for parents to help to meet the costs of child
care, yet these proposals raise many questions. I would like to put
them to the Minister this evening.</hs_Para>

I would like to begin a broader debate—it is an important one
for this House to have—about what the shape of future child care
policy should be. It is vital to the economic future of the country
that we enable as many women as possible—and, in some cases,
men—to return to work at the level and pay they were receiving
before having children. Not only would that pay for itself, but there
would be wider social benefits to society from more early years
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T21:34:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000973" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0005.htm#13021388000973">First,
let me address the crisis currently facing the majority of
families—a crisis of this Government’s own making. It is
a triple whammy. Families with small children are seeing the costs of
child care soar. Recent reports suggest that fees have gone up by 6% in
the last year. Costs are set to increase further with the severe
reduction in available places owing to this Government’s
slashing of funding. Some 401 Sure Start centres have closed since the
Government came to office, despite the Prime Minister’s pledge
to “back Sure Start” during the election. Many more, such
as those in my constituency, have ceased to offer any day-care
provision at all. In addition, cuts to local authorities’ early
years budgets have meant school nursery places falling. The choice for
families has dropped greatly and, with the shortage of supply, costs
are going up and
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T21:35:50"></hs_TimeCode>. On top of
that, the Government are slashing financial support for most families,
especially those on low or middle incomes. For those on the lowest
incomes, the maximum allowance of child care costs that can be claimed
through tax credits has been reduced from 80% to
70<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T21:36:07"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_Para>

set to get even worse for the lowest-paid families. A recent report by

third element of the triple whammy for families is that the crisis is
creating disincentives either to work or to work more. Moreover, the
introduction of universal credit builds in even greater disincentives,
especially for lone parents. A recent report by the Resolution
Foundation, “Counting the Costs of Childcare”, found that
for lower to middle-income families, the extra income generated by a
second earner is almost entirely lost on child care costs, leaving
lower or middle-income-earning households no better off in work than
out of work. That just cannot be right. With the introduction of
universal credit, Barnardo’s has calculated that a lone parent
family—with two pre-school children—working 16 hours a
week would be zero pounds—yes, zero pounds—better off if
they increased their hours to full time. This is a perverse situation
that needs looking at urgently. This is a real crisis for many
families—who in turn are opting to work fewer hours or not work
at all, which in turn is costing our economy and costing the
taxpayer—and it is a crisis of this Government’s
making<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-13T21:38:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000978" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0005.htm#13021388000978">One
of the Government’s flagship policies to address the triple
whammy was announced a couple of weeks ago, yet the Minister’s
plans to loosen the ratios of childminders to children—to 1:4
for under-twos and 1:6 for over-twos—have been met
with anger and derision by parents and providers. What is more, there
is little or no evidence that these plans will have any impact on costs
at all, yet there is evidence—especially from France, which the
Minister is so keen to look to—of quality being compromised.
Parents are overwhelmingly against these proposals. A recent survey by
Mumsnet found that 94% are happy with the current arrangements. I have
been contacted by many anxious parents. If parents are not happy with
the quality and care options they have, they are more likely to opt to
stay at home and look after the children themselves.</hs_Para>

turn now to the issue of additional financial support, on which the

Perhaps in recognition of the effect of the Government’s own

my reckoning, many families who currently benefit from the voucher
scheme, especially dual-earning couples who currently get nearly
£3,000 a year of tax break each, would be worse off under this
proposal. Can the Minister today guarantee that no family in receipt of
child care vouchers would be worse off under her new

Minister explain how the tax-break scheme will work? Many people in the
sector, and leading experts, think that there are only three different
options for how it can work—through the employer, which places
an extra burden on them; via self-assessment; or through providers, who
would need to claim it back and then supposedly pass it on to parents.
So which of these unappealing options does she favour? Will she say
more about when these long-awaited proposals will be brought

am conscious that it is getting very late, but I would finally like to
set out what I would like to see as the scope and framework for future
child care policy, as I believe the scale of the crisis we
face—and its impact on the economy—requires more radical
thinking. The Government’s proposals are just tweaking at the
edges. Before we even get into this debate, it would be useful if the
Minister clarified what the current Government spend is on child care
and child care support. I have heard her use different figures, ranging
from £5 billion a year to £7 billion. Which is it? How is
she calculating it? The OECD figures that she is fond of quoting,
indicating we spend more than most, do not compare like with like, as
children start school younger here than in many other European
countries, a cost that is
included.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000990" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0005.htm#13021388000990">Starting
with what we currently spend on child care, we then need to look at how
much the economy would benefit from more women returning to work
immediately following maternity leave. All the evidence shows us that
women—I am afraid it is still women—who take a break from
work and their careers suffer a pay gap for the rest of their lives,
very rarely returning to the level, hours and pay they were on
previously. In many cases, they work part time on low pay for years
after having children and do not return to their previous
job.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000991" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0005.htm#13021388000991">So,
we not only need to eradicate the disincentives to work, as outlined
earlier, but we need to make the case to the Treasury of the long-term
added value to the Exchequer of the tax revenue from women returning to
their existing jobs. The recent Institute for Public Policy Research
report “Making the case for universal childcare” argues
that point extremely well. It argues that over a four-year period,
there would be net return to the Exchequer of over £20,000 per
parent from a returning mother, even when 25 hours a week of free child
care is provided over that same four-year
period.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000992" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0005.htm#13021388000992">Once
this case is made, I believe we should look at investing up front the
extra tax generated from parents earning more and working more, through
more radical child care support. In my view, that should be focused on
the points at which parents make decisions about how and when to return
to work, especially when their maternity leave comes to end or when
they have had their second child. These are critical moments of choice,
but too often child care policy is centred on older children; by then,
the parent might either have chosen to return to work or already have
managed to struggle along with the extra support—however welcome
it is when it comes. We need a parent-centred child care
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000993" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0005.htm#13021388000993">Critical
to this parent-centred approach is parental leave and flexible working.
I welcome the Government’s bringing forward proposals for
parental leave to be shared between both parents—as Labour would
have done. This is an important component to changing the 
<?notus-xml column=1013?>nature and culture of workplace attitudes to having children, and I
believe it will enable more parents to stay in the work
force.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388000994" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0005.htm#13021388000994">I

the OECD figures, and it is often difficult to get to the

however, that although we do not spend as much as the Nordic countries,
we do spend as much as countries such as France and Germany. Yet,
despite the high parental input and the high Government input, we have

the hon. Lady said, we are giving high-quality providers more
flexibility, but only when they invest in high-quality staff, and only
if they want to use that flexibility. There is nothing compulsory

providers to upskill their work forces, and it gives them headroom in
which to do so.</hs_Para>

established, many staff are paid barely more than the minimum wage. We
want to emulate high-quality countries where pay is much higher. The
Nordic countries tend to pay their staff more than £20,000 a
year, while France and Germany pay between £16,000 and
£18,000. Here in England, we pay £13,000. All those other
countries pay considerably more to their early education staff, and all
of them have larger allowances in terms of ratios than we do. Indeed,
Scotland and Ireland have higher ratios than we do. At present we have
the lowest ratios in Europe, and I do not think that that gives
providers enough headroom to hire high-quality staff. As I have said,
however, it is for providers to make the decision, and we will only
allow them to do so if they invest in high-quality staff.</hs_Para>

asked me who supported these changes. One supporter, I believe, is the
shadow Education Secretary, the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby
(Stephen Twigg). He has suggested that we should adopt the Danish or
the Swedish model. Neither Denmark nor Sweden sets mandatory ratios at
national level. They believe in paying people well, and in employing
high-quality professionals who make judgments at local level. That is
the kind of system that I want to see. I want to see a more diverse
system, in which we trust professionals to make those local judgments.
Two-year-olds or three-year-olds may be at different stages of
development, and may have different needs. I think that we should allow

hon. Lady asked me who else supported the changes. They are supported
by Sir Michael Wilshaw of Ofsted, and by Andreas Schleicher of the
OECD, who produced an important report called “Starting
Strong” about the impact of improved qualifications on the
attainment of children. Providing a teacher in an early years setting
and providing high-quality staff can have a massive effect. A number of
leading providers in the 
<?notus-xml column=1015?>child care industry also support our proposals. I admit that not
everyone is supportive. I can only say that we are giving people the
opportunity to offer more places, it is not compulsory, and it is
certainly not something that we will allow providers who do not invest
in high quality to
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021388001008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/debtext/130213-0005.htm#13021388001008">We
are also simplifying the system to make much more funding reach the
front line. That is another important part of the proposals. Under the
present system, local authorities and Ofsted are both responsible for
quality, and quality assurance in different areas is at different
levels. We are investing in Ofted and in more front-line inspectors
from Her Majesty’s inspectorate to ensure that inspections are
of genuinely high quality and focus on what is important. We have just
changed the Ofsted framework so that it is much more focused on
outcomes and the quality of engagement with children. There will be
more emphasis on qualifications and the outcomes for the
children.</hs_Para>

parties agree that the current system is not working. There are issues
with the availability of child care. We want there to be more
childminder agencies to help us provide more child care. Over the last
20 years the number of childminders has halved. They are a vital source
of flexible child care for parents who do not work normal
hours—MPs are one such group. We want childminders to be more
widely accessible. Childminder agencies will be required to provide
training, and they will be regulated and inspected by Ofsted. They can
be set up in schools or nurseries. There will be great opportunities to
expand the number of childminders and the amount of care

will also allow good nurseries who hire high-quality staff to have more
flexibility and to expand, again helping parents with availability. If
a provider—a childminder or a nursery—shows that they are
good quality according to Ofsted, they will be able to offer
Government-funded places. There will no longer be a

need to go through a culture change in this country. Child care has
been a low-wage, low-status profession. That is wrong, as it is an
important profession in which lots of dedicated people work.
Unfortunately, they are not rewarded sufficiently. We must look at what
other countries do well in terms of remuneration and training. We are
currently devising our early years educator qualification, and we are
looking at the best practice in other countries and how we might adopt
it.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady asked about funding proposals. I will consider the points she
made about how we might improve the funding system. We must make sure
we get the best value for money from the £5 billion we currently
spend. The hon. Lady asked about the various different figures. They
vary because the child care element of the working tax credit is a
proportion of the spend that parents have. That must be tracked and
estimated and it is not always the same from year to year because the
budget is not fixed; it is a reimbursement of what parents pay.
Therefore, there are various difficulties in calculating the total
amount we spend and there are variable estimates. We do know, however,
that we spend a lot through the system.</hs_Para>

former children Minister Baroness Hughes of Stretford admitted that the
funding had not been set up in an ideal way, as there are three
separate funding streams that all feed into nurseries in different
ways. She said that not enough of it goes through to the front line. We
are looking at ways of fixing that. It is a complicated system, so it
takes a while to do that, but I am working on it now. I would be very

last year, the health care regulator, the Care Quality Commission,
reported that 33% of people spent more than four hours in A
and E—that was before this
winter—while research shows that the number of people waiting
for A and E treatment in England has risen by
47,000. Those waiting times are the worst in almost a decade.
Nationally, almost 1 million extra visits to A and E units
across England were recorded by the Department of Health in 2010-11,
with a doubling of trolley waits—people waiting in A
and E for longer than four hours to be admitted—in a
single year. A freedom of information request revealed that eight-hour
trolley waits almost trebled between 2009 and

CQC has warned that 17 hospitals are understaffed and cannot guarantee
patients’ safety. The excellent James Cook university hospital,
which serves many in my constituency, including Mrs Anderson, has said
that delays in admitting patients are being caused by insufficient
staff and a lack of available beds. My most recent information is that
the hospital is holding weekly meetings with ambulance bosses in an
attempt to alleviate delays. The trust should be praised for taking
action, but the fact that action is necessary is indicative of a sorry
state of
affairs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021360000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021360000010"><Member ContinuationText="Pat Glass" PimsId="5555" UID="13021360000059" xid="1190" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021360000059"><B>Pat

very unfortunate experience of the NHS involving admissions to

A and E over the past two months. Their care has
been absolutely excellent—I could not criticise it at
all—but staff took the opportunity to tell me that the staffing

say that delays prevent them from responding to calls, and fear that
such delays could lead to a tragedy. As recently as last week, it was
reported that the hospital was the second worst in the north-east for
hospital handover delays of longer than two hours. Any hospital
handover delay of more than two hours is classified as a serious
incident by the NEAS. Of equal concern is the fact that in December,
the hospital failed to meet national targets of responding to 75% of
the most serious incidents—classified as red
incidents—within eight minutes; its result was
69%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021360000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021360000013">Accident

occurred at James Cook hospital, where there was a queue of up to 10
ambulances at one point. Frankly, that is an appalling risk to patient
safety. The Prime Minister has personally promised to protect the NHS,

delays are obviously stretching resources all over the place; for
example, ambulances from as far away as Lancashire are being brought in
to cover other emergencies. I fear that, with changes in NHS provision
elsewhere in the north-east and north Yorkshire, James Cook
hospital’s resources might become even more stretched.
Surgeries’ general reduction in their late opening times for
out-of-hours appointments in some areas across the north-east 
is putting further pressure on regional A and Es.
For example, in County Durham, 69 GP surgeries offered late opening
appointments in 2011, but in 2012 that was 
<?notus-xml column=275?>down to 61 surgeries, which is a 7.6% drop. In Newcastle, 33 GP
surgeries offered late appointments in 2011, which dropped to 24
surgeries in 2012. In Hartlepool, 15 GP surgeries
offered late appointment times in 2011, but that dropped to 10 in 2012,
which is a 31.3% decrease. As the Minister will admit, triage is
essential, and that is enormously helped by walk-in centres in my
constituency, across Middlesbrough and in Redcar, especially as regards
less affluent transient populations who are often not on GP
registers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021360000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021360000019">As

different financial package and under a different scheme, but it was
always in the Labour Government’s plans. It is good that the
present Government also want that to happen. However, we are discussing
current services, and the impact of the reduction in moneys on James

in provision for A and E departments in north
Yorkshire might increase the pressures faced by James Cook hospital. In
the neighbouring constituency of Scarborough, the trust has given
assurances as to the future of overnight A and E
services, but local people feel that there are uncertainties over the
future of those services. In Northallerton, the Secretary of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the right hon. Member for Richmond
(Yorks) (Mr Hague), has been campaigning against cuts to services,
particularly maternity services, at the Friarage hospital. In Malton,
the minor injuries unit has been closed at weekends. I fear that if
services at those hospitals are further reduced, additional demand

hospital by paramedics. I do not hold nurses or doctors responsible for
that; after all, more than 5,000 nurses have been cut across the
NHS since May 2010. The situation is more likely to have
been caused by the budgetary squeeze and the organisational changes
that local NHS trusts find themselves dealing with due to the

I would be grateful if, alongside that process, he closely monitored
A and E performance at James Cook university
hospital. There is a very real danger that the situation could
deteriorate. At the moment, the capacity for the hospital’s
A and E department is 60,000 patients a year;
that is what it was designed for. This year, it expects almost double
that figure—105,000 patients. That is a time-bomb waiting to go

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Dr Daniel
Poulter):</Member></B> It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr Crausby. I congratulate the hon. Member for
Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland (Tom Blenkinsop) on securing the
debate and I thank all hon. Members who have come to advocate their
constituents’ needs. The hon. Gentleman and I met earlier this
year to talk through some of the problems and challenges in his local
area. We discussed some of the individual cases that he has highlighted
today, which we all agree to be unacceptable, in particular the case of
one of his constituents who experienced a completely unacceptable
11-hour delay as a result of problems with getting the high-quality
care they deserved.</hs_Para>

several interacting issues: the ambulance service, the local
A and E response, and the services provided at
local A and Es. One key theme, as the hon.
Gentleman and I discussed when we met, and as his speech made apparent,
is the need to fundamentally change and improve how the NHS looks after
older people. That point was brought home vividly last week by the
report on the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. In addition, at
the end of last year the Dr Foster hospital guide found that 30% of
older people in hospital should not be treated there, and that more
community-based support was needed. When we met, the hon. Gentleman
rightly stressed the important role that local, smaller health care
providers, in Guisborough and East Cleveland and elsewhere, can play in
providing better community-based care. When people do not need to be in
A and E in the first place, it is better for them
to be looked after in their homes and communities, and it also brings
financial benefits to the NHS. For older people, being admitted to
hospital when they do not need to be there is distressing, and their
length of stay tends to be much longer.</hs_Para>

Gentleman threw down this challenge: will the changes being made to the
health care system nationally put us in a better place to deal with the
long-term  
<?notus-xml column=277?>challenge? The answer to that is yes, and I will briefly deal with that
point before I come on to the local challenges that he has
outlined.</hs_Para>

need to change what we are doing in the NHS? I have set out clearly
that we must do better, by keeping people well in the community. Before
I came to the debate, I was talking, over the river at St
Thomas’ hospital, about how we must improve children’s
health, better look after children with long-term conditions, ensure
that children with asthma and diabetes who do not need to be in
hospital are not there in the first place, and provide better
community-based care. Such improvements are particularly important for
the care of the elderly. From April, we will put 80% of the NHS budget
into the community, with clinical leadership through doctors and
nurses. That is a strong step in the right direction of focusing on
community-based and preventive care. I believe that we should all
regard that as a good way forward.</hs_Para>

Glass:</Member></B> My recent experience reflects what the Minister has
said. Older people who stay in hospital for long periods of
time come out able to do less for themselves because things are done
for them in hospital. When my father came out of hospital after five
weeks, he was able to do far less. Will the transfer of funding into
the community prevent that from happening? Will it allow people like
him to be supported at home so that they do not have to spend long
periods of time in hospital and come home with less
mobility?</hs_Para>

Poulter:</Member></B> The hon. Lady makes a good point. A prolonged
period of bed rest can have a huge impact on an older person’s
mobility and their ability to look after themselves. The challenge, as
she rightly outlines, is to get more support in the community. Putting
the budget in the community is a step towards the provision of more
preventive care, more community-based care and more care that keeps
people, particularly older people, better supported and looked after in
their homes.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021360000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021360000031">The other
challenge is to achieve a more joined-up approach between secondary
care in an acute hospital—such as James Cook hospital—and
care in the community. There is sometimes too much silo working, and we
need to break that down and develop a more joined-up approach to care.
That might be done, for example, through intermediate care teams that
operate out of a hospital, who will help through physiotherapy and
occupational therapy. When an older person arrives in A
and E, we need immediately to gear up the right support in
the short and longer term to enable them to go home more quickly. That
is an important part of a more integrated and joined-up approach to
ensure that an older person can be effectively supported and looked
after at home if that is right for them. It is important that we get
that more integrated approach across the whole country.</hs_Para>

issues, the hon. Gentleman highlighted two-hour handover delays, which
are clearly completely unacceptable. In my experience, the fault for
handover delays might lie in two areas. First, the triaging system in a
hospital might need to be reviewed to ensure that ambulance handovers
are dealt with more promptly and quickly. Secondly, a delay in
ambulance handover results in ambulance crews and ambulances being
pinned down 
<?notus-xml column=278?>in A and E when they need to be back out on the
road elsewhere. I know that the hospital will want to look at that
closely.</hs_Para>

to having more community-based care, sufficient community-based
resources must be available to better support people with day-to-day
health care needs in the community, so that they are not forced to
pitch up at a hospital’s main A and E
department. At our meeting, the hon. Gentleman and I discussed the fact
that the opening hours of the urgent care centres at Guisborough and
East Cleveland hospitals are now 9 am to 5 pm during the week
and 8 am to 8 pm at weekends, which has made it difficult for local
people to access local health care service and created pressure on
A and E departments. Having spoken to the trust,
I am pleased to report that job interviews will be held on, I believe,
25 February for specialist nurse and other posts at those hospitals,

my constituency, is in one of the remotest parts of the country, but
5,000 people live there. Their out-of-hours GP service is at Bishop

Poulter:</Member></B> Absolutely. Sir Bruce Keogh will be conducting a
review of emergency and other urgent care services, in which
A and E services will not be lumped into one
category but will be considered in a more nuanced way, reflecting the
fact that rural communities face particular challenges. The review will
consider how out-of-hours care, urgent care and emergency care should
be delivered in such areas to take into account the rural nature and
the distances that people have to travel. In some cities, there is a
lot of A and E provision, but in other, more
rural parts of the country where people have to travel further that is
not the case. I am pleased that Sir Bruce will take that into account
in his review.</hs_Para>

A and E provision, and urgent care provision,
must take into account travelling distances and transfer times to
hospitals and between hospitals. Those issues will be part of the
discussion and the review, although they are not the major thrust of
what Sir Bruce is doing. However, a number of hon. Members have
arranged to meet my ministerial colleague Earl Howe, who is currently

pressure on hospital services is not necessarily unusual for this time
of year, notwithstanding the fact that it is completely unacceptable
for there to be long handover delays or for people not to receive
prompt and high-quality treatment. There are winter pressures that
occur every year, and the Government will always do all we

Department of Health conducts daily monitoring of the winter pressures

NHS Foundation Trust has James Cook University hospital as its main
acute site—of course, it is also the local hospital that most of
the hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland’s
constituents will attend—and the trust, like other
organisations, has experienced some additional pressures in recent
months. However, under the trust’s own internal criteria, the
pressures that it experienced during late December and early January
were identified as level three on a scale of one to six, which
demonstrates that the trust has been busy. It is important to
highlight, however, that it has been coping with those additional
pressures, notwithstanding the issues raised in the debate, including
the need to upscale the community-based response to prevent patients
who would be better looked after in the community from being in an
acute hospital setting in the first place.</hs_Para>

important to say that we expect all NHS commissioners and providers to
ensure that appropriate measures are in place to manage any increases
in demand, particularly during the winter. The delays in patient care
that have been outlined eloquently by hon. Members are simply
unacceptable, be they in A and E departments or
in ambulance journeys to hospital. Delays are of concern, and the local

needs to be aware of such seasonal variations in the NHS. That is why
the Department of Health has given more than £300 million to the
NHS specifically to deal with winter pressures. However, it is for
local NHS providers to recognise that that extra investment has been
made and to co-ordinate their response with the community, particularly
through highly skilled community intermediate care teams, which help to
get older people back home from hospital as quickly as possible so that
they can be better looked after in their own homes.</hs_Para>

main concern expressed by the hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and
East Cleveland was about ambulance performance. Delaying ambulances
outside A and E departments, as a result of a
temporary mismatch between A and E and hospital
capacity and the numbers of elective emergency patients arriving, is
simply not acceptable. There is a need for the local ambulance trust
and the local hospital to work more constructively together, to ensure
that such delays do not happen. That might be about having better
triage, or the local ambulance trust might need to put more resources
into the front line in the local area.</hs_Para>

funding, and Middlesbrough primary care trust has received a further
£264,000. Investment in social care services will also benefit

constructively with the trust to encourage a quick solution to the
problems that have been outlined. One good thing that came out of the
meeting, as the hon. Gentleman already knows, is that there is now an
active process going on for the recruitment of specialist nurses to the
smaller hospitals—the community hospitals —in the local

I hope those hospitals will be open for additional hours, which

to growing demand, an overall increase in ambulance activity and longer
stays in hospital owing to more complicated medical conditions, I
understand that the trust has already taken some specific measures,
with £650,000 of investment being put into extra nurses and
consultants. To deal with times of acute winter pressure, a bed winter
ward will also open. The trust is also now working actively with its
partners to redesign patient services, along the lines of the rapid
response teams and intermediate care teams that I described earlier, to
prevent inappropriate hospital admissions in the first place. In
addition, it is exploring the development of a separate paediatric
A and E department to create extra space for
patients.</hs_Para>

applicants for the posts, so a good number of people have applied. I am
hopeful that after the interviews on 25 February there will be
additional nursing capacity in those local health care settings, to
ensure that the scope of the community health care response is
improved. Also, I hope that the number of hours that the services are
available will be increased, because as the hon. Gentleman knows
community health care is about taking pressure off acute A

those two hospitals—Guisborough hospital and East Cleveland

Christopher Chope</B> (Christchurch) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Bayley. The debate is surprisingly
topical. Only two hours ago in the Chamber, in response to an urgent
question from the Opposition, the Minister responsible for press
regulation, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport,
answered on behalf of not the Government, but the Conservative party,
which I thought was rather bizarre. There followed a contribution from
the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr Leech)—who is not
a member of the Government or part of ministerial collective
responsibility—who purported to make a statement on behalf of
the Liberal Democrat party. Surely the whole purpose of collective
ministerial responsibility is to ensure that there is certainty outside
about the Government’s view on a particular issue, so that they
do not speak with forked tongue.</hs_Para>

for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General, my right hon. Friend the
Member for Horsham (Mr Maude)—to whom my question to the Prime
Minister was transferred—about the number of occasions on which
collective ministerial responsibility had been set aside in this
Parliament. I received a non-answer. I then went to ask some questions
directly of the Prime Minister, but again my questions were not
answered. Some of those non-answers are referred to in the briefing
that is available to hon. Members. I will not go through those answers,
because they are not answers. I could not understand why the Prime
Minister was so reluctant to be accountable to Members of Parliament
and put a straight answer to a straight question on how many occasions
collective ministerial responsibility had been set aside.</hs_Para>

of answers—or non-answers—from the Prime Minister, I
asked specific questions about what had happened in relation to the

consideration of Lords amendments, the Leader of the
House of Commons announced that collective ministerial
responsibility had been set aside—the first time that we have
heard officially that that has happened—and, in answer to my
intervention, explained that that was the Prime Minister’s
decision. Following that, I asked the Prime Minister on what day he had
set aside ministerial responsibility in relation to the Bill and the
reasons for that. I have had no answers to those questions; in fact, I
have had a deliberate refusal to answer. I cannot understand why,
because I thought that the Government were interested in transparency
and openness and that they would want to put their answers on the

Deputy Prime Minister had given notice that he would lead his troops in
the opposite direction to the rest of the coalition was when, in
August, he said he would withdraw his support for any Boundary
Commission proposals put through the House via a statutory instrument.
The revolt must have come as a bit of a surprise, but back in August he
was giving public notice that he himself would set aside collective

Chope:</Member></B> That is a telling point. All I know is that, for
one Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Private Secretary who voted against
the Government on tuition fees and consequently was forced to resign
her position, it was only a few weeks before she was reinstated, and
she has subsequently reached ministerial level. That is the rule that
seems to apply to minority members of the coalition. As far as those on
the Conservative side of the coalition are concerned, I have no
information that suggests any Parliamentary Private Secretary who has
been forced to resign has subsequently been reinstated, even if their
reinstatement would coincide with a change of Government
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000025">On
the face of it, double standards seem to be operating, which is why
transparency on the rules that apply to Parliamentary Private
Secretaries is important. I hope my hon. Friend the Minister will be
rather more forthcoming than the Prime Minister has been so far,
because collective ministerial responsibility is a developing subject.
We have already heard the Prime Minister, having initially said that he
has not made up his mind, publicly say that, in the event of an in/out
referendum in the next Parliament, which we all welcome, it would 
<?notus-xml column=285?>not be possible for members of his Government to vote for us to leave
the European Union if he, the Prime Minister, were of the opinion that
we should stay in the European Union. Collective ministerial
responsibility apparently will not, therefore, be set aside on that

irrespective of how much or how little is clawed back as a result of
renegotiation, no one will be allowed to vote against the Government by
voting to leave the European Union, without giving up their ministerial

question to put to my hon. Friend. Let us say that our starting point
is what was in the coalition agreement, forgetting about the

ministerial responsibility if one of the parties to the coalition

particular policy to which it signed up? What sanction would the Prime
Minister have, for example, if the Deputy Prime Minister decided to

hon. Friend, that is a question for the Prime Minister. He is solely
responsible for collective ministerial responsibility.
If he had chosen not to set aside collective
ministerial responsibility in relation to the Electoral Registration
and Administration Bill, it probably would have been the end of the
coalition. He would have ordered the Deputy Prime Minister to resign on
the basis that he had breached collective ministerial responsibility,
along with all the other Liberal Democrat Ministers who had done so.
Then he could either have carried on with a minority Conservative
Government and given people such as my hon. Friend the Member for New
Forest East (Dr Lewis) the
opportunity to join the Government as a Minister. Or, if there had been
a subsequent vote of no confidence, we would have had  a

cannot carry on like this, gradually eroding the principle of
collective ministerial responsibility without anybody being held
properly to account. Either the coalition Government sticks together on
the basis of collective ministerial responsibility or it breaks
asunder, leading to an early general election, which I would certainly
favour; that is my personal view. Otherwise, we face two years ahead

Prime Minister or the Government, because I am no longer a member of
the Government. However, my hon. Friend is right: the question is about
the nature of the agreement made. At the outset of a five-year term, an
attempt is made to agree a coalition agreement that is to run for the
five years. Such an agreement was novel territory in UK politics. We
had not seen one for a long time. There were pressing economic
circumstances in May 2010, as there still are today, and the judgment
was made by both sides in the negotiation that speed was of the
essence. However, if historians draw any lessons from this experience,
they will surely come to the view that we may have something to learn

reached in a matter of a few short days, however comprehensive they

years that follow. There are, of course, “Events, dear boy,
events.” Governments will have to take a position on issues that
they had not anticipated at the start of a five-year term; that is
inevitable. Collective responsibility, in the sense in which we have
understood it, can exist only where there is a collective view, a
collective agreement and a collective decision between the two parts of
the coalition that they will proceed in a certain way. Where something
breaks down or has not been anticipated, or something new arises on
which the two parties are unable to reach agreement, it is inevitable
that we will not be able to apply a traditional doctrine of collective

Londonderry (Mr Campbell) made with reference to Northern Ireland, when
there are two parties in a coalition, the world can see, recognise and
understand that there are differences of view because there are
different underlying philosophies. That is healthy 
<?notus-xml column=290?>and transparent. In Labour’s years in office, there was the
running soap opera of the view in No. 10 and the view in No. 11 Downing
street. I should have thought that the differences of view between the
wings of that Government were every bit as large as those within the
coalition, but there was no transparency there—nobody could
really see or understand the debates. We relied on the columns of Mr
Andrew Rawnsley and others, who provided us with a running commentary
on what they thought was going on. It is far more transparent when two
parties with acknowledged differences are conducting a debate. There
will always be occasions when the two parties are not able to reach an

in the quad—the quadrilateral meeting that brings into play the

continuity of the coalition that—this is precisely the choice
that the hon. Members for New Forest East (Dr Lewis), and for

whether it is just a tiresome irritant that will have to be taken on

are of such significance that the coalition’s

the election, and would not have been able to form a Government capable
of doing very much at all if they had not been able to reach some

clearly events that were not anticipated in the coalition agreement; we
have heard examples of them today, and Lord Justice Leveson’s
report is a good one. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch,
I believe that we still need greater clarity on how the mechanisms of
government should operate in such circumstances. Today, the Secretary
of State for Culture, Media and Sport was called to answer an urgent
question in the main Chamber, and I rushed along, interested to hear
what Government policy was on a royal charter. I listened intently, but
it was only after 20 minutes that she referred to the fact that she was
making a Conservative party announcement. If that was the case, why was
she answering for the Government? Clearly, the Speaker will, with
respect, have been correct to make his wise decision to allow this
urgent question, but I was left in a state of confusion about whether
the discussion related to Government policy or to a Conservative party
policy that had not yet been discussed, or at least agreed, with the
Liberal Democrats.</hs_Para>

issue arose when, in response to Leveson, the Deputy Prime Minister
gave a separate statement immediately after the Prime
Minister’s. That struck me as a constitutional innovation. Some
people may have mentioned precedents, but they went back decades, if
not centuries. I asked the Deputy Prime Minister whether he was
speaking for the Government; I was not seeking to be difficult, so I
referred to Cabinet responsibility and sought further information about
how it was now operating, but I did not get a satisfactory response. As
a Back Bencher, I would appreciate clearer guidance, in my interaction
with Ministers of whichever party, on whether they are speaking as
Ministers or merely as party leaders or party representatives on
particular issues.</hs_Para>

problems with that in another context. Our highest Court has ruled that

Ministers refuse to do so, on the basis that the Court in Strasbourg

Attorney- General, among others, to that bit of the ministerial
code. I do not quite understand its applicability, to the extent that
our own highest Court has interpreted the relevant international law
and has said that the individual in question can go. I note that the
same sentence refers to the coalition agreement, and how the
ministerial code needs to be read alongside it. When there is an
apparent breach, issues to do with the ministerial code are
raised—of which, clearly, the Prime Minister is the arbiter. I
wonder whether we are giving too much semi-constitutional significance

coalition agreement is a different thing for the Liberal Democrats and

if not unanimously at least overwhelmingly, the
coalition agreement and participation in the coalition with the

with the expectation of ministerial office, and the leader of our party

meeting, at which there was arguably agreement, or
acquiescence—although not all of us were allowed to
speak—on the issue of having a referendum on the alternative
vote in exchange for equal boundaries. That was the only discussion
that the Conservative parliamentary party had, so the Liberal Democrats
should not complain if we seek to hold them to that deal. We gave them
the AV referendum and took the risk of a change to the electoral system
that would disproportionately benefit their party, and won our argument
in public, and the other side of the coin was fair, equal boundaries.
Now they have welshed on the deal. That was the only deal into which

the Liberal Democrats believed in, or spoke quite highly of,
parliamentary procedures, the importance of Parliament, and the holding
to account of the Executive. However, now that they are in coalition,
too often it is a question of a deal between the party heads, or the
quad, and there are great problems with that. Quite minor issues are
pushed all the way to the top of Government. The Prime Minister and
Deputy Prime Minister are extremely busy people, as are the two
Treasury representatives, and I fear that that approach has led to yet
more power being put in the hands of the civil service—Sir
Jeremy Heywood has been mentioned—and that the civil service has
its own interests.</hs_Para>

across an instance of that in the context of policing finance. There
was a White Paper in July 2010 called “Policing in the 21st
century”, which was sound in many respects. It included the
agreement that Liberal Democrats and Conservatives had reached on what
to do in policing. It encompassed the directly elected police and crime
commissioners that we wanted; but the Liberal Democrats also wanted the
police and crime panels, which we agreed to. The White Paper said that
if it was not possible to agree on a police precept, the panel, perhaps
by a super-majority, could trigger a local referendum. I thought that
was an excellent localisation and democratisation of politics, and I
was grateful for the Liberal Democrat input.</hs_Para>

between the publication of the White Paper and Royal Assent to the
legislation that emerged, the referendum element was removed and
replaced with a weak power for the panel, which was misleadingly
described as a veto. The panel can say it does not like the precept
once, and as long as the elected PCC comes back and says something
slightly different he can just impose it. That is all that the panel
can do. My view was that we did not want that; we wanted a democratic
local approach that would permit a referendum if there was strong
enough feeling, but I was told that that could not happen because the
Liberal Democrats would not accept it, and the Deputy Prime Minister

hopeless for the Prime Minister, or anyone else, to seek such a
reduction. We were miles away from other countries on that matter, and
it could not be done. Yet yesterday at Deputy Prime Minister’s
questions, speaking as the Deputy Prime Minister—with, I assume,
collective responsibility—he told us that he supported that
approach, and that it was because of him we had got the cut. He had
spent months going around Europe pushing that extraordinarily tough
stance, while publicly saying that he disagreed with it and it was
completely unrealistic. Which is it?</hs_Para>

know that sometimes a coalition is difficult, and that the

away all the dusty old conventions because they do not matter

accept that there was any breach of the coalition agreement until the
Deputy Prime Minister decided that he would welsh on it with respect to
boundaries. Then his Ministers voted against it. Yet they stayed in the
Government, notwithstanding collective responsibility and paragraph 1.2
of the ministerial code. If the Prime Minister has waived that, and the
need to refer to the coalition agreement on all things in government, I
trust that he has also waived the part about international law, at

not previously aware; he seems to have said that whether he is in
favour of a yes vote or a no vote in the referendum, he will compel
Conservative MPs, whether Ministers or not, to campaign in exactly the
same way. That is taking collective responsibility to a ridiculous
level. At the same time, on many other issues, he is allowing
collective responsibility almost to disappear through the floor. That
is completely different from the position in the 1975 referendum, which

misunderstood what the hon. Member for Christchurch said and thought
the concept applied to the whole of  
<?notus-xml column=298?>the Conservative parliamentary party. Even if it applied only to
Ministers, the position remains different from 1975. When Harold Wilson
called for a referendum on the basis that he had renegotiated
Britain’s terms of entry to what was then the Common Market and
won a great victory—although it turned out that he had not; we
might see a similar set of circumstances in 2017 or 2018—he
allowed Ministers to campaign in whatever way they saw fit. I was only
11 years old at the time, but I remember Tony Benn and Michael Foot,
for example, campaigning on the no platform, while other members of the
Cabinet and shadow Cabinet were campaigning for a yes
vote.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000108">As
has been mentioned extensively, a number of Parliamentary Private
Secretaries were forced to resign over the vote on the in/out

the Labour Government in 1997, which was on single-parent benefit. We
probably all remember that, and it was a particularly scarring
experience—I was one of those who voted against the Government.
A large number of PPSs and one junior Minister were forced to resign as
a result. At the time, Prime Minister Tony Blair got a lot of stick for
being a control freak, but I had no problem with that. My view was that
people either abide by collective responsibility and back what the
Government are doing, or they resign and go on the Back Benches with
the rest of us, so that they are free to criticise, but people cannot
have it both

Ministers, over many years, not only in this Government but in previous
ones, have tried to have it both ways. In previous Governments, some

Cabinet and junior Ministers. That is completely unacceptable, as is,

I am not a fan of proportional representation, although I do not want
to go too far into that subject, because you will probably stop
me, Mr Bayley. One of the great problems with PR—this
has been debated a lot in the main Chamber—is that we would get
coalition Governments, and they tend to undermine faith in democracy,
because what then happens is deals behind closed doors, with a lack of
accountability. After an election and the subsequent negotiations,
Ministers emerge and say that they stood for election on this or that
issue or policy, but have completely ripped up their manifesto, because
they have done a deal with the lot who stood against them.</hs_Para>

the Lib Dems tend to be inconsistent. Consistency is not their strong
suit, as I have experienced in my constituency. Collective
responsibility means more than just supporting a collective decision by
the Cabinet or a similar body, such as a Cabinet Committee. It means
supporting anything that another Minister says; it is as radical as
that. The Deputy Prime Minister said that collective responsibility
applies when there has been a collective decision—presumably he
was talking about the Cabinet—but it does not; it means, and
always has meant, that if a Minister is asked about something another
Minister, particularly a senior Minister, has said, they support that
other Minister. That is completely disintegrating, and we are seeing

It is a pleasure, Mr Bayley, to serve under your
chairmanship. I congratulate the hon. Member for Christchurch
(Mr Chope) on securing this debate. Collective Cabinet 
<?notus-xml column=300?>responsibility is a major concern to perhaps dozens of our constituents.
Hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber have argued passionately that
collective Cabinet responsibility is an important pillar of our
constitution and underpins our system of government. The economy, jobs,
housing, health care, crime and education may be at the forefront of
our constituents’ minds, but it is important to discuss how
government is carried
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000118">In

no surprise that a Government comprising two parties will disagree
regularly. We have heard many examples today, and Leveson is the most

questions remain to be answered—for example, on why the

it is essential to understand the difference between Ministers speaking
as Ministers, and Ministers speaking as representatives of their party,
if we are to hold the Government to account. Clarity on when Lords and

anyone who will listen. Last year, following the Oldham East and

agree wholeheartedly with that sentiment, but it is not possible when
we are unsure who is speaking as a Minister and when. Sad as it
is—we have heard criticisms from coalition
Members—setting aside collective responsibility is not the worst
scandal of this Government. The worst is their chaotic, ad hoc approach
to government in general. That may in some part be due to the nature of
coalition, as might be the concerns about the suspension of collective
ministerial responsibility, but my argument is that it has more to do

we have heard, there are precedents for setting aside collective
responsibility in the European Community referendum in 1975, and back
in the ’30s under the last coalition. However, there is no
precedent for the scale of incompetence and incoherence we see from
Ministers almost weekly. Ministers have locked themselves in Lobby
toilets; they have forgotten to vote, sometimes very conveniently; they
have been absent from important votes; they have voted both ways; and
Cabinet Ministers have mooted abstaining on their own

Liberal Democrats seem happy to put collective responsibility aside
when it comes to media reform and boundary reform—that is, when
that is in their interests—but there was no such hand-wringing
when it came to tuition fees, welfare reform or tax cuts. I do not want
to let Conservative Members off the hook; last week, when Liberal
Democrat Members faced both ways, one Minister referred on her website
to her pride in the Government’s commitment to gay marriage, and
then voted against it. The fact that we are having this debate
highlights the confusion that seems to be the only constant in how this
Government are run. It is no wonder staff in No. 10 wake up and tune in
to Radio 4 to find out what the Government are up to.</hs_Para>

shall start with the historical view, in brief. Collective ministerial
responsibility has a long-standing place in the British constitution.
As far as historians can tell, the doctrine came into being during the
reign of George III, who had the perhaps rather dangerous
habit of asking Ministers to come and see him individually to give him
their views on important matters of state. I do not know whether he did
that sitting on a sofa, or whether there were briefings later in the
Red Lion. Who would know better than some Members in the Chamber where
that style of government ends up, and what happens when senior
Ministers cannot agree and go so far as to change their Prime Minister
or Head of State without an election, which the hon. Member for Leyton
and Wanstead (John Cryer) suggested was a very bad thing indeed? To
return to George III, the Cabinet realised that the King’s
actions were an attempt to undermine their unity and work out who his
supporters were. They therefore agreed that they would tell him exactly
the same thing, taking collective responsibility for their
decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000136">Clearly,
we have moved on a long way since then, in historical terms. Collective
ministerial responsibility is about how Ministers behave towards the
public and Parliament, rather than towards the Crown. However, the
basic point remains the same: Ministers need to be able to have frank
discussions and disagreements in private, while maintaining a common
purpose once a decision has been taken.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021373000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000137">It is to
maintain the principle of collective ministerial responsibility that
the ministerial code states that the Government will not normally
disclose the level at which, or forum where, a decision was
taken—my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch has sought to
discuss that matter through parliamentary questions. If the code were
not applied, it would be possible to work out which Ministers were
present at a meeting. It would also open up debates about which
decisions were accorded a higher or lower perceived level of importance
than others. That would detract somewhat from the policy quality of
issues that might be scrutinised in that way.</hs_Para>

ministerial responsibility does not abolish individual responsibility.
Each Minister must decide for themselves whether they are happy to
remain part of the Government and to support the Government’s
decisions. There have been many cases of people feeling no longer able
to stand behind the collective conclusion. Famous examples include the
noble Lord Heseltine, who, when he was merely Michael Heseltine,
famously walked out of Cabinet following the decision on the future of
Westland, and the late Robin Cook, who resigned from Cabinet because he
did not feel able to take collective responsibility for the decision to
go to war in Iraq.</hs_Para>

version of the ministerial code makes it clear that collective
responsibility can be explicitly set aside on occasion. Even before the
inclusion of that provision in the code, there was an established
practice of doing so on specific issues. Most notably, it has long been
the case that collective responsibility does not apply to issues of
individual conscience. Most recently, there was a free vote of that
kind on the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill last
week.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000140"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Andrew Turner" PimsId="4359" UID="13021373000343" xid="604" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000343">Mr

year, I visited a small business in my constituency known as Autotech.
I was incredibly impressed by that business, so much so that I wanted
to call this debate today. That was because I was not only impressed by
the business, but incredibly concerned about the problems that that
growing business faces. We had hoped that its CEO, Andy Robinson, would
be able to get here today, but I think that unfortunately his journey
has been blighted by the problems on First Capital Connect this
afternoon. He will probably arrive during the
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000154">Autotech
represents what many companies should be striving towards in the UK. It
is a small business, specialising in supplying control systems for
automated manufacturing and distribution operations. I hope that no
hon. Member intervenes to ask me to explain that further, because I
left after my visit to the business that afternoon none the wiser about
what it actually did. I saw lots of robots, graphics, wires, computers
and machines. I know that it has something to do with cars. It is
incredibly high tech and very
impressive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000155">What
also impressed me was the ethos of the company and the staff. When I
say to a member of staff, “How long have you been here?”,
and they say, “I’ve been here since the day the company
started,” I know that it is a good company. When I said,
“What do you think of the boss?”—he was coming
around with me—they were all glowing, and not just because he
was stood behind my shoulder. It was obviously a company that has very
good employment practices, so I was incredibly shocked to discover that
it has had to turn down millions of pounds’ worth of business in
the past few years. It has had to turn that business down because it
relies, obviously, on well trained, highly professional, skilled
engineers—that is what its business is about—but its
inability to attract people to fill those jobs is preventing the
company from growing. It cannot grow any more, even though it wants to.
It has the capacity, the location and the orders coming in, but it
cannot grow because it cannot get the people it needs to do the jobs.
The company not only cannot get the people to do the jobs that are
available today, but it has problems getting people to come and train
from school, as apprentices, who would enable it to project growth for
the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000156"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Robin Walker" PimsId="5656" UID="13021373000349" xid="1178" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000349"><B>Mr

Friend on securing this very important and timely debate. Is she aware
of the ten-minute rule Bill put forward by our hon. Friend the Member

very much the issue of getting expertise into schools. Will she comment
on the aspect of it that requires the governing bodies of schools to

Dorries:</Member></B> Yes. I will cover that issue later, but 
I shall just mention it now. One thing that I did when I was at
Autotech was put it in touch with Wootton school 
<?notus-xml column=306?>in my constituency. Wootton has an application at the moment for a
STEM—science, technology, engineering and maths—academy.
It seemed to me that it would be a perfect match if the school and the
business worked together. The business could get involved in the school
and take its business opportunities there. A bit like businesses used
to do with “milk rounds” at universities years ago,
Autotech could do a milk round in the school and try to nab them young
and get them more interested in a different form of career. My hon.
Friend is absolutely right: it would be an ideal solution to get
engineers as members of the governing bodies of schools, if only to
influence how teachers think about the career prospects for their
pupils in the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000158"><Member ContinuationText="Chris White" PimsId="5660" UID="13021373000351" xid="1201" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000351"><B>Chris

inspiring young people into engineering. On that point, I urge the hon.

such a high-tech form of engineering could be quite attractive to
girls. There are so many more opportunities open to both
genders now. I know that some girls are involved, but I cannot
imagine that we would see many girls wanting to get involved—I

absolutely key? Does she recognise the good work being done by EDF
Energy and Horizon in raising awareness of those needs, especially for
the nuclear power engineering opportunities of the future with some
20,000 jobs at the three new nuclear power stations? Does she also
agree that there are some great female role models? For example, the
engineer behind the design of the world’s fastest vehicle, with
which Squadron Leader Green broke the world record, was a woman. If we

Dorries:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes his points very eloquently,
as usual. I fully endorse the point that it would be fantastic if
female role models went round schools to promote engineering as a
career path for young women. He mentioned bigger companies such as EDF.
One problem for Autotech in my constituency is that it does not have
the budgets or the reach of so big an organisation as EDF. People in my
constituency do not even know that Autotech is there; neither did I
until recently. It does not have the advertising and marketing budget
to reach out and sell itself to young people, whereas EDF is fortunate
enough to be able to do the milk round and offer a global package. I
want to focus on the problems faced by small companies that need to
grow and are growing, and that are receiving orders that they cannot
fulfil because they have not yet reached the dizzy heights of
organisations such as EDF, with all the accompanying infrastructure and
finance. Autotech is not quite there yet, although it has grown from
200 to 350 employees in a short space of time.</hs_Para>

Lady on securing this important debate, to which I am listening with
great interest. Does she agree that engineering suffers from an image
that is out of date? The image that girls, in particular, have of
engineering is being clad in a boiler suit and working with heavy
vehicles, engines and oil. Those things would not attract a woman to
the industry. We have to change that. Much as I am fascinated by the

Dorries:</Member></B> I agree with everything that the hon. Gentleman
has said, particularly the necessity of disabusing young women of the
notion that engineering is about getting their nails dirty, or about
carrying an old rag or wearing a boiler suit. Mechanical engineering
has moved on from that, and it is now much more about electrical
engineering. It is much more sophisticated and high tech. It is much
more about the sort of thing that Autotech does, which, as I said, I

Autotech in touch with the Wootton Academy Trust in my constituency,
which is currently applying to establish a science, technology,
engineering and maths academy. As we touched on in the first half of
the debate, it would be fantastic to see STEM academies and schools
linking up with smaller businesses. As well as the big businesses that
such schools will be attracted to because they provide sponsorship
and—for want of a better word—the sexy image that goes
with engineering, schools would do well to link with smaller
businesses. The tendency will be for schools to work with bigger
organisations.</hs_Para>

summer’s Olympics, High Speed 2—although it is not
popular with some Members—and Crossrail prove that we can do big
engineering projects in this country. There will be a forward market
for engineers, hopefully, if we can embrace engineering at the root, in
schools and in small businesses. It is a feeding market, because if
pupils train in small businesses, they might move up to bigger
projects. There will always be a good living to be had in engineering,
and there will always be good employers.</hs_Para>

that concerns me is that over the next decade, salaries across the
world will level out as companies and countries compete with each other
on a much more global stage. When young people choose a career and when
they go to university or enter apprenticeships, they must keep their
eye on what will employ them in the future and what will allow them to
earn a living  in the marketplace and progress as individuals.
That is why organisations such as Autotech need help. We need to do
what we can to incentivise schools. The Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills is already working hard in the area, but I hope
that the Minister will tell us what the coalition can do to help link
schools and small businesses to make engineering a much more attractive
option for young people. In particular, I want to know what the
coalition can do to help businesses such as Autotech to reach out to
young people and let young people know that they are out there and that
they offer good career
opportunities.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_13_PT_1/58F82821602E9F9484C13B38A1901313699ADC49" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="13 February 2013">Wednesday

an outbreak of consensus about the need to tackle the problem, and I am

congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Bedfordshire (Nadine
Dorries) on securing the debate. I 
<?notus-xml column=311?>know that we often have debates in this Chamber and on the Floor of the

minutes that I have, I will provide some context and go through some of
the things that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is
doing to rise to the challenge and answer the shortfall that many
Members have eloquently described. Many estimates have been made of the
shortage of engineers in the country, and although it is impossible to
put a precise figure on that shortage, it is clear that we need more
engineers. We need those who are qualified at university level, both
undergraduate and postgraduate, and those who are qualified through
apprenticeships at technician level.</hs_Para>

few years, steps have been made in the right direction. The
number of engineering and manufacturing apprenticeships has risen to
60,000 starts in the past year, up from 25,000 starts a decade earlier.
This year, the number of applications to university to study
engineering is 127,000, which is up 8% on last year alone. The
proportion of those applying to university to study computing, which is
an important element of engineering, has risen even more sharply. At
school, participation at GCSE in maths, physics and the sciences, which
are an essential bedrock of engineering, has been rising sharply. The
Department for Education, as well as BIS, is playing a big role in
ensuring that the building blocks, which for too long have been
deteriorating, are in
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000195">Let

Hancock:</Member></B> That is an important point, and I will look at
what more we can do in enterprise zones to add a skills element. The
employer ownership strategy is about ensuring that we provide the
skills that employers need. We have a conundrum in this country.
Although youth unemployment is falling, it is still slightly less than
1 million, which is too high, but, at the same time, we have skills
shortages. That tells me that the skills  and education system
has not worked to match up the supply and demand for
skills.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000198"><Member ContinuationText="Jonathan Lord" PimsId="5687" UID="13021373000376" xid="1177" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000376"><B>Jonathan
Lord</B> (Woking) (Con):</Member> Will the Minister join me in paying
tribute to McLaren in my constituency, which helps to sponsor an annual
technology and engineering prize? Indeed, the Prime Minister came the
other year to give out the prize to the winning team. Not only
glamorous technology companies such as McLaren, but every technology
and engineering company should hold open days and become involved in
such 
<?notus-xml column=312?>competitions, to engage young people and, indeed, their teachers to
ensure that they are aware of the career options that are on offer and
the sort of subjects that need to be studied to pursue those
careers.</hs_Para>

Hancock:</Member></B> Absolutely. I pay tribute to what McLaren, and
many other companies, are doing. That brings me on to my second point,
which is about careers advice. The Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics Network, or STEMNET, is a network of 25,000 STEM
ambassadors who go into schools. Where they go into schools and inspire
the pupils, they can be a huge driver, by explaining the exciting
things that are going on in modern engineering, and not only to boys
but girls. After all, only 7% of those in engineering are female, and
so the easiest way to increase the number of engineers is to
have more of a balance, because if we are only
recruiting—broadly speaking—from half the population, we
are clearly missing a very important trick.</hs_Para>

in skills are very important, too. The annual skills show, which was in
Birmingham in 2012, is an extravaganza of brilliant exhibitions of
high-level skills by highly trained people. There is also an element of
competition to show the very best of British skills, as it leads on to
the world skills competition. It is absolutely brilliant, and I
encourage everybody to go and see it for themselves. Similarly, the Big
Bang fair is a competition to drive the excitement of this agenda about
engineering through schools.</hs_Para>

the new duty on schools to provide independent and impartial advice and
guidance to pupils from the age of 12 all the way up to 18 is very
important. Ofsted is studying its implementation. It was introduced
only last September, and this summer we will have a report from Ofsted
on how it is going. So, as I say, the second element is careers advice
and getting that right, and engaging with STEMNET in particular to get
inspiring people into schools to inspire pupils about
engineering.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000202">The
third element is reforming the skills system, so that it is more
rigorous and more responsive. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid
Bedfordshire talked about the need for more rigour in the schools
system, but we also need to drive up rigour in the vocational
qualifications area. We have done that by supporting and recognising
only the highest quality vocational qualifications from 14 to 16 in the
new accountability structures—they were set out by the Secretary
of State for Education last week—but we also need to do that
further up the age range.</hs_Para>

we need to ensure that the skills system is responsive to the needs of
employers, which brings us back to employer ownership of skills. In the
field of apprenticeships, the Richard review very much drove down that
track, and I am looking forward to responding to it with enthusiasm,
because the vision set out by Doug Richard was a powerful one that
argued for apprenticeships to be much closer to what employers need and
for employers to be able to start up skills academies and
apprenticeship qualifications. Autotech has started a skills academy.
However, more broadly—not just in that single example—we
need to have more apprenticeships with the qualifications, as well as
the content, designed by employers themselves.</hs_Para>

employers to respond to the Richard review and to engage with it, as we
try to improve those qualifications. That is already happening in two
areas. First, the Royal Academy of Engineering is introducing four new
engineering qualifications for students aged 16, which I think will be
very important. We hope that they will be high-quality. Secondly, we
are introducing the technical baccalaureate at 18, which is an idea
that has cross-party
support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0001.htm#13021373000205">Finally,
I urge all Members to get involved in apprenticeship week. It starts on
11 March, and it will be a big, national celebration of what
apprenticeships have achieved during their 600-year history and what
they can achieve if we can reform them to make them better. I end by
reiterating that the passion shown by Members of all parties today, and
my passion, is a passion to ensure that we solve this problem, which
has bedevilled our country for far too
long.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_13_PT_1/F726BF999CE0D98416C3DEDB86E0EF53424E5B48" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="13 February 2013">Wednesday

Evans</B> (Islwyn) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Mr Bayley, and to discuss the vital role that
that Army recruitment offices play in Welsh life. One of the main
features of many high streets, not only in Wales but all over the
country, is the Army recruitment office. Indeed, I can recall many
family and friends joining the Army as a result of a visit to one of
them. Many people will have joined because they were able to talk face
to face with someone who had served in the forces. I have no doubt that
such expertise allowed potential recruits to go into forces life with

the 2nd Battalion the Royal Welsh, while the Royal Welch Fusiliers
became the 1st Battalion. The 2nd Battalion can boast of having been

punches above its weight. Additionally, 10 of the 22 local authorities
in Wales have already shown their support for the armed forces and
veterans by signing up to community covenants, and the remainder are
expected to sign up this year. I am sure you would welcome that as much
as the rest of the House, Mr
Bayley.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0002.htm#13021373000240">We
ask a great deal of the men and women who join our armed forces, and we
need the right young men and women to join up. Although the regular
armed forces are reducing, they are still very much open for business.
The Army, for example, continues to require 7,500 new recruits a year,
yet over the past decade the Army has missed the recruiting targets
necessary to meet its operational requirements. To address that, the
Army has entered a partnering arrangement, known as the recruiting
partnering project, with Capita, which seeks to improve Army recruiting
by exploiting the expertise of the private sector while retaining a
strong military interface with potential recruits at key stages. The
contract covers the entire recruiting and selection process for 
<?notus-xml column=319?>both the Regular Army and the Territorial Army and
will transform the way the Army recruits officers and soldiers. In
doing so—this is an important point to stress—the
contract will release more than 1,000 military recruiters back to the
front line, where they are needed, and deliver some £300 million
in benefits over 10
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0002.htm#13021373000241">The
recruiting partnering project will also provide a centralised
recruiting operation delivered through a five-region structure using 73
Army careers centres, of which 38 are embedded within tri-service armed
forces careers offices. The five current selection centres, including
the Army Officer Selection Board, will be retained. To co-ordinate all
recruiting activities, a national recruiting centre will be set up in
the headquarters Army recruiting and training division, which is based
in Upavon, Wiltshire. The centre will provide an initial point of
telephone and on-line contact for early inquirers and will provide
recruiting teams to co-ordinate and control recruiting activity and
liaise with regional recruiters. Importantly, the centre will take on
back-office administration tasks, such as reference and security checks
and arranging medical screenings, thereby removing the burden of much
of the administrative activity from front-line military recruiters in
the regions, leaving them free to concentrate on face-to-face liaison
with potential
recruits.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021373000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/halltext/130213h0002.htm#13021373000242">Over
the years, the Army has continually reviewed the location of its
recruiting offices, and the number of offices has ebbed and flowed to
meet the changing demands of the recruiting environment and the needs
of the armed forces. However, the approach that is now being introduced
marks a major change in our marketing methods. Following extensive
consultation with the Army, the number of recruiting offices will
reduce by about half to 73, which reflects that times have changed
since the hon. Member for Islwyn and I left school and began looking

there will also be the mobile teams. Where those mobile teams are
deployed will be partly down to the experience of recruiters, but the
capability is available to go out to people where we believe

fixed Army careers centres will be manned by a mix of military and
civilian staff, whose combined roles will include visits to education
establishments and other local liaison activities. That will allow
military personnel to spend most of their time face-to-face with
potential recruits, rather than on administrative tasks that can be
best managed on a centralised basis. Service personnel will continue to
be at the front end of the recruiting process. It is less an
outsourcing of recruiting, as some have characterised it, and more of a
partnership between the Army and Capita. The Army will still be an

for petroleum products including road fuels and fuels used for home
heating. The UK and other member states are required to report to the
European Commission each week on the prices of petrol and diesel pre
and post-tax. For the UK, the weekly results are based on a sample of
major oil companies and supermarkets. Prices are published on the .GOV
website on a Tuesday morning. On 12 February this update noted that on

Hammond:</Member></B> The strategic national corridors were established
in 2009 to define the transport links over which the largest proportion
of strategic traffic—that is traffic travelling between the 10
largest urban areas, 10 busiest ports and seven busiest airports in
England—moves around the country. The strategic national
corridors are therefore defined by the places they connect and the size
of traffic flows using them rather than by road classification. A road
could become part of the strategic national corridor if the total or
HGV traffic flows grew to be within the top 20% for
GB trunk roads in England, or if the Department for Transport were to
change the criteria used to define the SNCs. The Government has no
current plans to review the criteria for the strategic national
corridors.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13021386000028" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/text/130213w0001.htm#13021386000028">Staff</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13021386000284" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/text/130213w0001.htm#13021386000284"><B><Member PimsId="5618" UID="13021386000915" xid="1153" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/text/130213w0001.htm#13021386000915">Priti

the possible effects of further inclement weather, it is recognized
that the weather is a factor that influences domestic tourism patterns
and visitor expenditure (its impact on inbound visitors is much more
limited). VisitEngland has worked with the Met Office to examine the
impacts of weather forecasting and in particular how medium-term
forecasts can impact on resorts. The inclement summer weather of recent
years has caused destinations to examine more wet weather options for
visitors and many are now offering a much wider choice of

endeavours to accurately respond to all tax credit appeals as soon as
practically possible. One of HMRC's objectives is to minimise error and
fraud. Increased activity to ensure people who are entitled receive the
correct tax credits awards has increased the number of appeals from
people who have had their entitlement stopped or reduced. In response
to the increased number of appeals, HMRC have deployed additional
resource to reduce customer waiting times to acceptable

Fisheries Minister, I continue to have discussions on our key
priorities for fundamental reform of the Common Fisheries
Policy (CFP), including the regionalisation of fisheries management,
with a wide range of people and organisations. This includes Members of
the European Parliament, who will play a significant role in agreeing
the reforms we are seeking, although this has not, to date, involved
direct discussion with the

Heath:</Member></B> The provision of food aid ranges from small, local
provision, through to regional and national schemes. But the landscape
is mostly community-led provision responding to local needs. It is not
clear what purpose would be served by keeping a record of the number of
food banks, nor the potential number of people using them or other
types of food aid, without placing unnecessary and costly burdens on
volunteers trying to help their communities.</hs_Para>

regularly to discuss issues related to food labelling and provenance,
to exchange information and co-ordinate our work on common areas of
interest. DEFRA and the FSA have had daily contact at a high level
since 14 January to discuss the specific issue of horse and pig DNA
found in meat products. I met with the chair and chief executive of FSA
on 29 January and again with the chief executive on 4

FSA has a memorandum of understanding on how it collaborates on the
handling of food incidents with authorities in Ireland. All parties
agree others will be notified at the earliest opportunity about any
food incident or potential food incident, which may affect any of the
jurisdictions and where there may be risk or potential risk to
consumers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1302142000534" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130213/text/130213w0002.htm#1302142000534">As
part of these arrangements, on 23 November, the Food Safety Authority
of Ireland (FSAI) told the FSA that it was developing authenticity
methods and considering a survey, with which the FSA offered
assistance. On 10 January, the FSAI then advised the FSA that it was
undertaking some authenticity checks on meat products and that it would
keep the FSA informed of the results. On 14 January, the FSAI told the
FSA that it had found contamination and that Tesco, Iceland and Lidl
products were implicated. On 15 January the FSAI published the results
of the survey on its website and we were then able to access these
results.</hs_Para>

flammability regime for children's clothing in Europe (along with
Ireland) and I have no plans to extend it. Extending the requirements
of the Nightwear (Safety) Regulations to children's day wear would make
the supply of compliant cotton clothing problematic. Cotton garments
would need to be made either from heavy cotton fabrics, e.g. unsuitable
for many children's dresses or shirts, or from fighter cotton that has
been treated with flame retardant chemicals. This would raise the cost
of cotton garments, and if flame retardant chemicals are not applied
correctly, materials can become toxic and present a health

Swinson:</Member></B> As an Executive agency the IPO must comply with
civil service pay policy. The Government implemented a pay freeze for
all civil servants in 2010. As part of that pay freeze a decision was
taken that there would be no pay progression unless there was a
contractual right for this to be paid. Careful consideration was given
within the agency as to whether there was a contractual right for staff
to receive annual salary increments. On the basis of the legal advice
received, it was determined there was no legally binding right. It is
recognised that staff have been adversely impacted by not receiving
paying annual salary increments. But we are experiencing one of the
most significant periods of financial restraint across the whole of the
civil service at present. The challenges of reducing the national debt
cannot be underestimated and civil service pay restraint is one of many
measures being pursued. The IPO executive team, within the remit of the
civil service pay policy, will continue to do what it can to ensure
staff are fairly
remunerated.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_13_PT_1/6E92BF08A41FEC5EA5CAB2B91F67E65A67D21E6F" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="13 February 2013">Wednesday

The figures given in the table relate to persons for whom these

When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is

the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>3</Sup>

welfare of children. This includes preventing and mitigating the risk
of them going missing from care. Local authorities work in close

forthcoming revised statutory guidance on children who go missing from
home or care will include advice on how to safeguard trafficked
children. We have also asked the Refugee Council and The Children's
Society to carry out a review of the practical care arrangements for
children in care who may have been trafficked.</hs_Para>
