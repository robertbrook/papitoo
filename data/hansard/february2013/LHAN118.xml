Statement. On 10 December 2012, during a Report stage debate on the
Crime and Courts Bill, I intervened to answer a suggestion that judges
did not need protection, as reported at col. 865 of the <I>Official
Report</I>. I had not prepared what I was going to say. I referred to
death threats that I had received as a judge from dissatisfied
litigants. Most unfortunately, in referring to the people who had made
such threats against me, I included the unwarranted suggestion that the
organisation Fathers 4 Justice was among those who had made such
threats. It was not true that Fathers 4 Justice had made any death
threats against me.</hs_para>

that two West Country newspapers reported what I had said in this
House. I did not speak to either newspaper. Fathers 4 Justice got in
touch with me by e-mail and I immediately withdrew the allegations and

but Fathers 4 Justice asked for a public apology. The most convenient
way to do so seemed to be by a Personal Statement to this

comprehensive reply, may I highlight the seriousness of the situation?
I have just returned from Kachin state where a 17-year ceasefire was
broken by the Burmese army. Fighting continues with widespread
violations of human rights, including torture, killings, rape and an
aerial bombardment causing 75,000 civilians to flee to camps or hide in
the jungle. In Shan state, a military offensive caused hundreds of
thousands of civilians to flee their homes, and the Rohingya people
have been reduced to conditions of severe destitution and massive
displacement.</hs_para>

Questions with the most up-to-date information that could possibly be
obtained, and I thank her for the enormous work that she does in Burma,
as well as in many other places around the world. Our policy is one of
constructive engagement on human rights, and ethnic reconciliation is a
central part of that. I can assure the noble Baroness and the House
that we take the humanitarian challenges in Burma extremely seriously.
Indeed, the Minister with responsibility for Burma, Hugo Swire, when he
visited that country, travelled to Rakhine state with a view to making
representations to the regional governments as well. It is a matter on
which we continue to press the Burmese Government and on which our
ambassador there is hugely engaged.</hs_para>

Kinnock of Holyhead:</Member></B> My Lords, when the EU common position
on Burma is reviewed, as it will be in April, what position will the
Government take on the EU sanctions that were suspended on the specific
understanding that there would be progress on human rights and
democratic reform in Burma? Is it not the case that in many respects
human rights violations have significantly increased, especially with
the Rohingya and Kachin, as the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, has said? Is
it not the case that the Government should therefore support the
reintroduction of some of the measures that were suspended, and resist
efforts to lift sanctions completely unless and until there is
significant progress on these issues?</hs_para>

Warsi:</Member></B> As the noble Baroness will be aware, the sanctions
were suspended in April last year, and it was made clear at that stage
that they would be 
<?notus-xml column=1157?>lifted only if the Burmese Government was measured positively against
the benchmarks set by the Council conclusions of earlier that year.
Those benchmarks are that there should be free and fair elections, and
that there needed to be progress on political prisoners and ethnic
reconciliations. These matters will be discussed again in April this
year but, as the noble Baroness is aware, for those sanctions to remain
suspended or not to be lifted requires unanimity at the EU level. We in
the United Kingdom will be pressing for those measures, those
benchmarks, to be tested against the Burmese
record.</hs_para>

Rohingya have been described as some of the most wretched people
because of the way in which they have been abused over many years. They
are left in a situation where real questions are being raised by the
Burmese Government about their citizenship. The Minister responsible
for Burma, Hugo Swire, visited Rakhine and met leaders of the Rohingya
community. Last week, I was in Bangladesh and became the first British
Minister to visit the Rohingya refugee camp at Cox’s Bazar, in
Bangladesh. We are looking at the problem from both sides of the
border. Ultimately, however, the issue of citizenship of the Rohingya
people is what needs to resolved. There is a history of these people
being in Burma for the past 200 years. They now need to be
recognised.</hs_para>

the developing relationship of the UK Government, particularly the
Prime Minister, not only with the Burmese Government but with Aung San
Suu Kyi, who is incredibly influential in this situation. Will the
Minister outline what representations the UK Government have made to
Aung San Suu Kyi about the growing concern among nations that are being

his tireless championing of those who suffer from dyslexia. I stress
that the process for any complaint is to exhaust the centre’s
procedures first—and that would be a face-to-face meeting, not
necessarily a written procedure—and then go to the awarding
organisation. If that does not work, complaints can be raised with
Ofqual. However, Ofqual has been proactive in this respect and is in
active discussion with the British Dyslexia Association to try to get a

point. It is absolutely right that people who are practically very
skilled often find that making an assessment in a written paper poses
much more of a problem for them. On apprenticeships, there has been a
change to functional skills that focus on applying knowledge rather
than having to pass written tests, and these are widely available as

However, these drugs are extremely expensive and are therefore likely
to be commercially unsuccessful because they help only a relatively
small number of patients. Now that the Government have abolished the
Advisory Group for National Specialised Services, can the Minister

sympathies to his wife. Unfortunately, with many very rare diseases, it
often takes a great deal of time for a fully fledged diagnosis to be
arrived at. I welcome the suggestion put forward by Rare Disease UK for
co-ordinators and we will certainly look at that idea positively. I can
tell him that the imperative to look at rare developmental disorders in
children is the focus of a project that the NIHR and the Wellcome Trust
are funding through the Sanger Institute in Cambridge. Scientists are
analysing the genomes of 12,000 children with developmental disorders
who could not be diagnosed following routine genetic evaluation. We are

international collaboration has set the ambitious goal of finding
treatments for 200 rare diseases by 2020. One of the
important research areas has already been mentioned, which is the
sequencing of the genome of patients with rare diseases. The other
area, which alludes to the question asked by the noble Lord about the

services is a matter for the local NHS. Any decisions regarding changes
to services are taken locally and are subject to the four tests for
service change. On 19 February, the NHS North West London Joint

waiting times are increasing in the areas covered by the four hospitals
even before the closures have taken place? There is enormous local
concern about a plan to, as it were, reduce services in a series of
hospitals more savagely than anything else in the history of the NHS.
In particular, the plan includes the proposed demolition of Charing
Cross Hospital and its replacement by a handful of beds. Is it not the
case that the Minister or the Secretary of State has the
final decision and that it is quite possible for the Secretary of State

principle that the reconfiguration of services works best when there is
a partnership approach between the NHS, local government and the
public. That is why we are strengthening local partnership arrangements
through the health and well-being boards. To answer the noble
Lord’s question, it is entirely possible for a reconfiguration
decision to be referred upwards to the Secretary of State by the
overview and scrutiny committee of a local authority, and in that event
it is customary practice for the Secretary of State to receive
independent advice from the independent reconfiguration panel. However,
we have not reached that stage yet. We have agreement locally as to
what these arrangements should look like and I think that we should

particular set of proposals. However, I can say that we made it very
clear nearly three years ago that reconfiguration proposals, wherever
they arise, should be underpinned, as should the arising decisions, by
four reconfiguration tests. Local plans must demonstrate support from
GP commissioners; a strengthening in public and patient engagement,
which is the issue raised primarily by my noble friend; clarity on the
clinical evidence base for whatever is proposed; and support for
patient choice. We expect that where proposals of this kind arise,

certainly a factor. In the case of north-west London, an independent
equalities impact assessment was undertaken to check how the proposed
options would affect all strata of local population under the Equality
Act in particular. The assessment found that the impact on travel times
by car, and indeed by blue light ambulance, would be minimal under all
three of the options that were being looked at. The point that I am
making is that in any context, it is important to factor in the effect
on travel for all patients likely to be

explained to patients, they realise that the word
“downgrading” is inappropriate. For example, in
north-west London, there has been a lot of unnecessary worry about
urgent care centres as substitutes for A&amp;E units. The majority of
people who attend A&amp;E can very well be treated in an urgent care
centre on the same site, and patients who dial 999 will be taken by
ambulance straight to the appropriate hospital. Therefore, I think
there is, in some senses, a false debate going on
here.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_28_PT_1/C8B29605B79C9B311977E3F3FFBF7099CA485792" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 February 2013">Thursday,

the correction, but the basic principle is correct.
Members have not retired; they have simply got leave of
absence. That is the point I make. It is technically correct to say
that the Bill does not reduce the numbers in the House, but that is not
a valid point. What it does is to give this House the statutory
authority that the original report, by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of
Wirral, said we needed to devise a scheme of retirement. All sorts of
schemes have been put about. If these were not times of austerity, we
could have had a retirement or resettlement grant, or the
opposite—a cut in the allowances paid to Members who have served
over a certain number of years or reached a certain age. We could leave
it to each of the parties and groups in the House to come to some
arrangement. We could even have an age cut-off in our Standing Orders.
All these are possibilities, but there is no point in debating them

them</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000079">All we

objective of a House of Lords membership that is proportional to
general election vote share is unrealistic. She said then that it would
require the appointment of, at a minimum, 269 new Peers, and that this
would have disastrous consequences for the operation of the Chamber,
would be unpopular with the public and would be a foolish and
unsustainable course to pursue. It if were continued as a principle at

contributions to our debates are limited to three minutes or even less.
There is a real issue to be faced about the membership of this House.
In my view, the Motion is not helpful. I was going to speak about the
report to which the Motion refers but as the noble Lord, Lord Steel,
has accepted the amendment I will move
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:00:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:00:41"></hs_TimeCode>.<I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:00:47"></hs_TimeCode></I></hs_para>

yesterday two new Cross-Bench Peers were announced. I very much hope
that at the appropriate time your Lordships’ House will make
those new Members extremely welcome. This House has a record
of doing that and we should avoid the danger of giving the
impression that we are resisting new Members. My concern is solely
about tactics and timing. My fear is that the amendment will be
perceived to be either irrelevant in the current situation or, at
worst, provocative. I well recognise the thought that the noble Lord,
Lord Hunt, has given to the amendment and I do not doubt for one moment
the good intention behind it. However, I still fail to see how it will
have a significant impact on reducing the size of this House and, in
particular, the pressure on the facilities and costs. We already have a
voluntary retirement scheme that has not been a great success. Any form
of financial inducement to make such a scheme more popular would, in my
view, especially in the current circumstances, be inappropriate.
Trying<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:02:30"></hs_TimeCode> also to
reduce the membership of the House by excluding those who do not, for
whatever reason, attend regularly could be counterintuitive in that it
would run the risk of encouraging them to attend your Lordships’
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000096">The
frustrations frequently expressed are sincere, although I cannot help
but feel that we are in danger of giving the impression that we want to
resist any newcomers into our House. That would be to the disadvantage
of the work of this House in revising and improving legislation for the
benefit of our fellow citizens and holding the Government to account.
In recognising that the House is too big, I nevertheless fear that the
amendment will not have the desired effect. I hope that out of this
will come something that will be a stimulus to much more detailed
discussion across the House in order that we can work towards achieving
consensus. That said, I will, as always, listen carefully to the

Cormack:</Member></B> If that became the will of the House we would all
have to accept it, wouldn’t we? My old and mischievous friend
from another place makes his point with his customary tact. It is now
11 years since my noble friend Lord Norton and
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:05:33"></hs_TimeCode> formed a group
called the Campaign for an Effective Second Chamber. My noble friend
Lord Norton, who did that group great service as our convenor
throughout those years, cannot be here today because of his teaching
duties at his university. We miss him and the contribution he would
have made. We formed that group, over which I have had the honour to
preside, because we believe that this Chamber is effective but could be
much more effective. We were always committed to an appointed House
rather than an elected one, but we also recognise the fact that the
House as it exists can and should be improved even though many people
in this House—by no means the majority, but a number of very
distinguished Members—would like to move towards election. The
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, has made that his position in the
past<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:06:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
Nevertheless, surely we can all recognise that the House as it exists
is not only capable of improvement but cries out for improvement, not
only in its size but in the way in which we do business. We all owe a
great deal to noble Lords such as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:06:42"></hs_TimeCode> noble Lord,
Lord Filkin, who have been working hard in this regard over recent
months and years. Whatever one’s ultimate view is, surely we
should not stand in the way of what the noble Lords,
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:07:02"></hs_TimeCode> Steel and
Lord Hunt, have referred to as “housekeeping
reforms”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000100">To
the Deputy Prime Minister, who has shown an interesting flexibility of

Clegg’s own admission it cannot be fundamentally changed for
some years—should now be changed in the way proposed in the
amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. We all hold my noble friend the
Leader of the House in the highest regard. I very much hope that he
will take it upon himself as Leader of the House—leader of all
of us—to convene a meeting to discuss ways and means of
approaching the problems referred to by the noble Lords, Lord Steel and
Lord Hunt. He would be doing us all a very great service if he
exercised his initiative in that regard and I very much hope that he
will. Of course, our expertise and experience, notwithstanding the

On the face of it, the admirable amendment of the noble Lord, Lord

states that it shall be done. The second is not in our gift; the first

Cormack:</Member></B> I understand and sympathise with the point made
by my noble friend, but the fact is that there are issues like royal
prerogative that have to be taken into account. We do not want to
precipitate—this was implicit in the remarks of the noble Lord,
Lord Hunt—a major constitutional crisis. What we want to do is
address the housekeeping issues in this House. That is a simple and
reasonable aim. This is declaratory, of course it is, but, if we have a
vote at the end of this debate, I hope that the House will declare that
it really is concerned about these matters. We are asking the Leader to
do what he can to bring some common sense to bear.</hs_para>

a particular person should be the stumbling block in the face of
sensible reform. Mr Clegg has many admirable qualities, but
he should not be allowed to be the arbiter of our constitution. That is
wrong. He introduced a Bill, which failed. I am proud to wear this
morning the tie made by the 91 stout Tory rebels who
frustrated that Bill in July by saying, “You cannot get this
through because we will not give you the time to do so”. Mr
Clegg recognised that, and he should now recognise that if he believes
in parliamentary democracy, and if he believes in this House as being a
fundamental part of this democracy as it is the moment, it should be as
effective as it possibly can be. If we continue to appoint new Peers
without addressing the issues so eloquently talked about by the noble
Lord, Lord Hunt, we will run the risk of making this House fall in
public repute and indeed become something of a laughing stock, which it
should not be. That would fly in the face of history and of what has
been achieved by so many, particularly over the years since 1958 when
life Peers were introduced. If this comes to a vote, I urge Members to
vote in significant numbers to show that there is indeed a consensus in
this House on these modest
proposals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:11:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000104"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Tyler" PimsId="4859" UID="13022861000991" xid="1879" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000991">Lord
Tyler:</Member></B> My Lords, I want very briefly to put a couple of
points to my noble friend the Leader of the House before he responds to
the debate. I wonder whether he might reflect on the fact that in the
previous Labour Administration, some 40% of the new recruits to this
House were added to the Labour Benches, compared with 21% to the
Conservative Benches and 15% to the Liberal Democratic Benches. Even
more significantly, in May 2010, immediately following the general
election, there were additional recruits to your Lordships’
House—28 Labour Members, 18 Conservative Members and nine
Liberal Democrat Members. Will my noble friend reflect on the very
interesting Pauline conversion, if I might put it like that, of the
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, who suddenly seems to find the overpopulation of
this House such a terrible problem? 
<?notus-xml column=1174?>Apparently it was never a problem under the previous Administration, nor
was it a problem even in May 2010. I am the last person to turn against
a sinner who repenteth, but there is an important question to put to
the opposition Benches about their change of
attitude<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:13:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000105" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000105">Would
my noble friend also note that some of the Members who now object so
strongly to further appointments were indeed the most vociferous when
the Government came forward with a proposal to end a fully appointed
House? My noble friend Lord Cormack, who is a very staunch defender of
the primacy of the House of Commons, may have forgotten that the
Government’s Bill received a considerable—indeed, a
uniquely—sizeable majority at its Second Reading. That was an
attempt to sort this problem out. It had indeed built very firmly on
the proposals put forward by Mr Jack Straw, in which the noble Lord,
Lord Hunt, played a very important part. Again, he seems to have
changed his
attitude<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:13:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000106">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:24:59"></hs_TimeCode>
share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, that this Motion as
amended would still be inappropriate at this time. Having had, I
accept, an expression of concern on all sides of the House about this
problem, I very much hope that the Motion, even amended, is not put to
a Division because I think it will have more power if it is not seen to
be something that is divisible and therefore divisive in your

Grocott:</Member></B> My Lords, I was just sitting here quietly,
looking forward to the conclusion of the debate without, I hoped, a
Division, but hoping that if there was a Division it would result in a
resounding majority for the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Steel, and
my noble friend’s amendment. However, the comments of the noble
Lord, Lord Tyler, make it impossible for me to remain in my seat
because I think he suggested that the previous Labour Government paid
no attention to what he now considers a very sensible proposal that the
membership of this House should reflect the result of the previous
general
election<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:19:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000108" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000108">I
remind the noble Lord of the facts. I know that facts can sometimes
ruin arguments, but the facts are as follows. He may recall that the
1997 general election resulted in a Labour majority of something over
150 in the House of Commons. I will be honest enough to say that I
almost wish I had thought of this at the time. It would have
been extremely tempting to argue that the membership of this House
should reflect the huge majority that the Labour Party had in 1997, and
on which it was re-elected, with an almost identical majority, in 2001.
The noble Lord can do the maths rather than me, but there would have
needed to be a colossal addition to the Labour Benches in this House to
reflect
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:15:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000109">I
ask for a little indulgence and sympathy towards my dear old party from
all quarters of this House. The Labour Party eventually became the
biggest party in this House in 2005: that is, eight years after we
received a colossal overall majority in two successive general
elections. We have been the biggest party in this House for eight years
out of the 110 years of our existence as a political party. I do not
think it is being greedy to say that eight years is not too bad. If the
noble Lord, Lord 
<?notus-xml column=1175?>Tyler, did argue for a huge influx of Labour Peers at that stage, it was
obviously on one of those days when I did not attend the House. I

one other matter on which the noble Lord should reflect, in this of all
weeks, is the election in Italy, a country which adheres to the
constitutional principle that the second chamber should be elected and
have pretty well equal powers to those of the first chamber. He should
reflect for a moment on whether that is a good idea to incorporate
here. While he is about it, he should reflect on whether the
proportional representation system of election to the Italian
Parliament provides stability and security for a Government. One or two
of the noble Lord’s theories have been road tested this week and
I could not forbear but to refer to them. On that note, I will sit

like the noble Lord, Lord Steel, I was deeply depressed when I read the
Written Answer that appeared in <I>Hansard</I> on 15 February. While it
is understandable that the Government should feel frustrated at the
loss of their proposals for an elected House, those proposals were
indeed lost. The reality of the situation is that we have two and a
half years until the next general election and some time beyond that
during which this House will continue to be an appointed House. It is

some modest measures now to take us

am not a supporter of an elected House. I am a supporter of
a rather radical reform of this House which is not encompassed in what
is before us today, or the Bill before another place. However, I have
to accept that that reality cannot be achieved at the
moment. The elements in the amendment in the name of the noble Lord,
Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, provide a minimum basis
for us to take forward some of the changes that
are need in your Lordships’ House. It will not radically reduce
the numbers but, having been deeply involved with these issues for
some time, I believe that not having a legislative
base on which to build the House’s
consensus—as I hope it will develop—on
retirement is a terrible impediment to going forward. One thinks of
resources as being about money and people, but as a Minister
I learnt that, in politics, resources are also about

criminal convictions, though very small, narrow and, of course, not
retrospective—how could it ever be?—is important for this
House. It is also an important basis for our own disciplinary action in
future. Even this minimalist legislative change is enormously important
and would give us the basis on which to go forward. The other day, I
asked the Leader whether he would do the service to this House that
could be done by allowing us that minimum basis. I am very encouraged
by the fact that there are those who, like the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of
Kings Heath—though unfortunately not the noble Lord, Lord
Tyler—believe in an elected House but still recognise the
problems and the reality of the years ahead. Noble Lords who want to
participate in the business of the House sometimes cannot because they
cannot be within the Chamber. That is not a proper way for us to
continue. We want to welcome new Members and if we are to do so, we
also have to find a way in which membership of this House can cease. It
is our responsibility to try and do that. We will not achieve it
overnight. There will not be immediate unanimity about the grounds for
retirement and how we go forward. However, since 1999 we have had
constant reasons why proposed changes were not exactly right. We have
had constant reversals to proposals for incremental change on the basis
that we were going to have all-singing, all-dancing proposals for
election. It has got us into terrible trouble over numbers and over
financial support for Members. Those who were arguing that we needed to
change that system sooner were told, “Don’t worry because
very soon we will have a Bill, we will have elections, we will have a

Higgins:</Member></B> My Lords, I very much welcome this debate. It is
important that we bring pressure on the Government to carry out the
urgent changes that have been set out by the noble Lord, Lord Steel,
and those on the Opposition Front Bench. I certainly welcome that. Like
others, I was concerned about the Written Answer to which the noble
Lord, Lord Steel,
referred.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000117" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000117">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:26:13"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Lord on the Opposition Front Bench pointed out that it will
clearly be a long time before there is any likelihood of our moving
towards an elected Chamber. However, there is another point. I am
optimistic on that issue because it is absolutely clear, despite the
rather mixed procedure on voting in the other place, that its Members
now clearly understand that it is not in their interests to have an
elected House of Lords with regard to the situation both at Westminster
and in their constituencies. It is high time that it is recognised that
this is the case and that we should not go further forward on that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:26:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

important that we deal with the issue of the size of this House and the
other issues mentioned in the amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker,
referred to the arrangements set out in the coalition agreement. Again,
the coalition should recognise 
<?notus-xml column=1177?>that that is not a sensible way of dealing with the size of this House.
We do not know on either of those points what will appear in the
manifestos—the reality is that manifestos are cooked up behind
closed doors, with virtually no consideration at all for Members of
Parliament in either House. We cannot tell, but I hope that on both
matters such proposals will not be included in either of the main
parties’
manifestos<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:27:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that there should be no increase in the number of Members until the
size of the House is determined—I do not have the exact wording.
However, it is extremely important that the Government clearly set out
how they envisage the programme for the House of Lords. The House is
getting bigger and bigger and, presumably at some stage, its size has
to be reduced. The danger then, particularly after an election, is that
it increases again. The Government need to say what they think is the
maximum size possible within that transitional period and what the
ultimate aim ought to be. We need some guidance on the optimum size of
the

have been debated concern the various amendments in what I am still
inclined to call the Steel Bill. We should simply go ahead with them,
and the block in the House of Commons ought to be
removed. It is difficult to avoid the impression that a
sense of pique on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister is leading to
that block. We ought to go ahead with those changes, and we can
perfectly well do so way before the date of the next general

perhaps I may make a more controversial point. Paragraph 47 of the Hunt
report suggests that provisions for retirement might be made. I realise
that this is highly controversial, but once a Treasury Minister, always
a Treasury Minister. If there is one crucial issue in the
Government’s policy at the moment, it is to reduce the deficit.
On the proposal that one should create, for example, an incentive
scheme whereby a modest payment was made based on the expenses incurred
in the previous full year, minus travel expenses, it would be helpful
to see to what extent that might produce a significant reduction in the
size of the House. At all events, it is a means of saving public
expenditure, which I hope would be

about the position of my own Front Bench. I am told that the position
normally is that they vote against things that are not government
policy. That is a rather strange doctrine: many good proposals are not
government policy; that is no reason to vote against them. As for the
proposals in the amendment, I think it is clear that the House has
already approved them in the shape of the legislation sent to the other

and that the outlines of the issues that the House will want to
consider are already clear. The points that have been made very
forcefully by a number of noble Lords have been well made; obviously I
have heard everything that has been said. Although I recognise 
<?notus-xml column=1178?>that I am new to this job, one issue on which I can be in little doubt
about the opinions of this House is that which we have been debating
today. Noble Lords have already been extremely generous—I might

possible opportunity. I am glad to say that I have had a chance to

subject, I cannot have the great expertise and history that many noble
Lords have on this matter. We have seen it again demonstrated by the

go back a long time. However, I do at least bring a fresh pair of eyes
to some of these issues. Given that the underlying issue to which all
noble Lords have referred is the size of the House, I thought that I
should start by going back to look at the figures to see by how much
the House has grown. This is what I found.</hs_para>

of the hereditary Peers following the 1999 reform. The House that
Gordon Brown inherited on taking office 10 years later in 2007 was
smaller: there were 738 peers eligible to vote. As of this week, there
are 761 Members of this House eligible to vote; that is 23 more than in
2007. We have had some discussion about the proportion and size of the
number who have been introduced, so I looked at the numbers for the
Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Cross-Bench Peers in
particular. In 2007, 698 Members sat on those Benches and were eligible
to vote. I accept that the equivalent figure today is higher: today it
is 704, which is six more than in 2007. Those figures come from the

attendance and participation, which I recognise as an important issue.
As far as the exercise of restraint is concerned, the amendment of the

recommendation has been followed and that the Prime Minister has indeed
shown restraint. Since the well publicised lists of May and November
2010, a total of eight new peers have been created, six of them on the
Cross Benches; 42 life peers have, sadly, died. I suggest, therefore,
that the Prime Minister’s record is consistent with the
recommendation from the Leader’s Group, both in terms of
exercising restraint and in ensuring that expertise is refreshed and

about which I was asked. The real issue is not so much the absolute
number of those entitled to vote, but attendance. Surely we all agree
that attendance and participation are good things that we ought to
encourage. That is one of the reasons why I am extremely keen, as a new
Leader, to try to find new ways to help a wider range of Members to
play a greater role in this House. That is why, as an early priority, I

Members to come in on supplementary questions and broaden
participation. I am acutely conscious of how crowded the Chamber is

about the need for restraint, the amendment of the noble

Indeed, the House has already made its position clear.
We passed the Bill without a Division and sent it to the
other place last summer. It contains measures which my noble friend
Lord Steel described as “housekeeping” and for which it
is clear that there is widespread support in this House. I know that my
noble friend is keen that the Government should take the Bill forward.
As he said, he made his case directly to the Deputy Prime Minister
earlier this week; he was the right person to talk to, as he is the
Cabinet Minister responsible for this matter. Despite that, the
Government’s position remains that we do not wish to facilitate
the passage of the Bill. I understand that the Deputy Prime Minister
made clear why that is the case. As my noble friend Lord Tyler said, it
is because the House of Commons voted overwhelmingly last year in
favour of an elected House of Lords. With that

when push came to shove some of the consequences of an elected House,

respect to the Leader of the House, who I hope will be engaging in

legitimacy that he raised—that it would not be legitimate when
something has been done to appear to do the opposite
subsequently—must be truly addressed. Does he recognise that not
only was the idea of proportionality lost in the proposals for this
House but it was previously rejected under this Administration by the
country in the referendum on the alternative vote system? Given that
there is an apparent consistency about the legitimacy of the processes

things stand, it is clearly the case that the proportion of Labour
Peers in this House is greater than was the case in the popular vote at

subsequently, that the Government have sought to

I may, I will say something briefly about the effectiveness of the
measures proposed in the Bill to substantially reduce the number of
Members who attend this House each day. This point was made by the
noble Lord, Lord Laming. In other words, would my noble friend’s
Bill tackle the problem of size that it seeks to address? There has
been mention already about the non-statutory, voluntary retirement
scheme that has been put in place. Two Peers have taken advantage of
it. Therefore, there must be some reason for the reticence of Members
in volunteering for retirement. I am not personally persuaded that
making the scheme statutory would overcome that reticence. Some
supporters of my noble friend’s measures suggest that some kind
of payment might help overcome this reticence. I should make clear, as
I have done before, that the Government do not support making
taxpayers’ money available to Members of the House to encourage
them to retire. That would be wrong, and it would be seen to be wrong.

However, I recollect, when I was in both those roles, a number of noble
Lords who attended quite regularly and with great difficulty because
they felt that they had been asked to come in and serve for life. I
would not dream of naming them, but some are quite regular attendees

I can think of no more appropriate opportunity to put this point. I

noticed how it changes during a Parliament. At the beginning of a
Parliament, the wisdom and experience of those who have served is
diluted by many who come in with their head full of theories but no
understanding of what the effects would be. As we have been, not
promised but led to expect legislation in the next Parliament, perhaps
I may ask my noble friend to exercise his greatest efforts to see that

briefly. I welcome the willingness of the Leader of the House to seek
advice from Members of your 
<?notus-xml column=1183?>Lordships’ House. He is a fresh pair of eyes and we very much
look forward to working with him. I also very much support his work in
trying to encourage Members who perhaps are not as active as possible
to participate more in the future. Ultimately, though, I was
disappointed with his response. He started to trade statistics and
there always seems to be a risk in doing so. My general conclusion is
that whatever Government are in power, in general and over time that
governing party will tend to see an increase in the number of seats
they hold in the House of Lords. I certainly agree that we need fresh
blood form time to time, and I actually agree that restraint has been
shown so far. As the noble Lord, Lord Elton, said, the issue is the
future. The rumours which have been around this House for quite a long
time now, are that the Government want to make a very large number of
new appointments in the next few weeks or months. Above all, I hope
that the noble Lord will consider this. The plea of restraint is very
much directed at those future
appointments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:51:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000150" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000150">The
noble Lord, Lord Cormack, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman,
helpfully reminded the House of my own views on Lords reform. I was
hoping that my noble friends behind me might forget that, but they are
right—I have consistently voted in favour of an elected House.
However, the Leader of the House essentially says that because the
Commons voted at Second Reading for Mr Clegg’s Bill, that means
that it would be wrong to put to them proposals for incremental
housekeeping. As someone who favours an elected House I strongly refute
that. First of all, that Bill did not go through. Secondly, under the
proposals of Mr Clegg, or indeed those of my right
honourable friend Mr Straw, if a party pledged an elected House of
Lords and that party came into power in 2015, the first element of
elected Members would not come to your Lordships’ House before
2020. That is seven years away. For the Leader of the House to say that
no useful housekeeping or incremental change can take place before that
moment is a matter of regret. I think that is the implication of what
he said.</hs_para>

Trefgarne:</Member></B> My Lords, I have never quite understood, and do
not now understand, why it is thought so necessary that this Bill
should be driven through with such speed. The plain fact is that the
arrangements it seeks to change—I do not disagree with all of
them—have been in place in some cases for many hundreds of
years. Why we need not only to drive the Bill through swiftly but also
to backdate one of its provisions is not immediately obvious to me. I
therefore propose that, at the end of the first clause, we should
provide that it should come into effect in, say, 50 years’ time,
which is a very short time in relation to how long these arrangements
have been in place. That would be an appropriate change to the Bill and

Advocate-General for Scotland (Lord Wallace of
Tankerness):</Member></B> My Lords, the effect of my noble
friend’s amendment would be, as he has indicated, to delay the
removal of the male gender bias in the line of succession for almost 50
years. Perhaps I may pick up the point made by my noble friend Lord
Elton and his reference to the report of your Lordships’
Constitution Committee. It is fair to say that since that committee
reported, there has not been any undue haste. The time made available
for debate on this Bill in the other place was not even fully used up,
and in your Lordships’ House we are proceeding in the normal
fashion with the appropriate elapses of time between the different
stages. There is certainly no intention to cut short the debate in this
House.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022861000160" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000160">My
noble friend has asked why we are doing this now and at this speed. The
position is that the Prime Ministers of 16 Commonwealth nations, of
which Her Majesty is the head of state, agreed during the Commonwealth
Heads of Government Conference in 
<?notus-xml column=1187?>Perth in October 2011—that is why the date has been put into the
Bill—to work together towards a common approach to amending the
rules on the succession to their respective Crowns. It is fair to say
that that was the product of considerable work and discussion over many
years. Indeed, discussions were ongoing during the previous
Administration in this country. All these countries wish to see change
in two areas, the first of which is covered by this clause, and that is
to end the system of male preference primogeniture, under which a
younger son can displace an elder daughter in the line of succession.
It is right and appropriate that this clause will remove a piece of
long-standing discrimination against women that may well have been
acceptable in earlier centuries, to which my noble friend referred.
This provision will modernise and affirm the place of our
constitutional monarchy.</hs_para>

future within the line of succession a younger son were to take
precedence over an older daughter, it would seem to be at least
controversial and at worst discriminatory, out of date and out of

is why this is an appropriate time to make the change, because it will
be done without affecting anyone who currently would have a prior claim
on the throne. If, however, we wait for a situation where there may be
a daughter and then a younger brother, and we tried to make the change
then, it is inevitable that that would be more
controversial.</hs_parafo>

worth reflecting that if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have as
their first born a son, have only sons or, indeed, have only daughters,
the effect of this clause may not bite until the next generation,
possibly after 2060. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Janvrin, made
clear, it would be controversial and possibly even destabilising to the
monarchy to have this kind of debate at that point. We look forward to
the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s first child
knowing that we can celebrate, when this Bill is passed, that whether
the baby is a boy or a girl they will have an equal claim to the

Trefgarne:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope that we will not hear too much
more about the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference where it was
all said to be agreed. These matters are not agreed by ministerial
diktat, however senior and distinguished the Ministers may be, but by
the Parliaments of the countries concerned, and in some cases by a
referendum as well. When the Heads of Government agreed all this in
Perth back in 2010, it was subject to parliamentary approval in the
relevant countries. That parliamentary approval has not yet been
received, not least in this country. I hope very much that we will be
thinking in terms of parliamentary approval rather than ministerial
diktat, upon which my noble and learned friend seems to be
relying.</hs_para>

Royal Highness and the Duchess of Cambridge have a daughter, she may,

Lloyd of Berwick:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendment. I do
so because many years ago when I was a struggling barrister, I was
appointed Attorney-General to the Prince of Wales, which carried with
it also being Attorney-General to the Duchy of Cornwall. Therefore, I
do have some—albeit from rather long ago—experience of
what the Duchy of Cornwall is and how it
works.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000168">In his
reply to the Second Reading debate, the noble and learned Lord made
three points, at column 830, about how the Duchy of Cornwall would be
affected if this Bill becomes law, as I hope it will. I very much
apologise that I was unable to be present, but I was abroad. First, he
pointed out that Princess Elizabeth, when heir to the Throne, did not
become the Duke of Cornwall. Secondly, he pointed out that if the Bill
becomes law and the heir to the Throne is a daughter, the title would
go into abeyance in the ordinary way. Thirdly, he pointed out that if
the heir to the Throne is a daughter, she will not suffer financially
from the title going into abeyance because of the Sovereign Grants Act
2011, to which the noble Lord, Lord
Jan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T13:17:57"></hs_TimeCode>vrin, had
drawn attention during the

the first point, it is of course true that the title fell into abeyance
when Princess Elizabeth was heir to the Throne. As to the third point,
it is clear that the heir to the Throne will not suffer financially
anyway, so to some extent we can disregard that as a relevant point.
However, I question the second point, and 
<?notus-xml column=1189?>whether there is any need for the title to go into abeyance. Why, I ask
the noble and learned Lord, should
it?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000170">It
seems to me that to enable the heir to the Throne to become Duke of
Cornwall if female is the logical extension of the provisions of this
Bill. It is within—if only just—the royal title.
Obviously, there is no difficulty in a female heir to the Throne being
called the Duke of Cornwall because, as we all know, the Queen is also
the Duke of Lancaster. In addition to what I submit is the logical
extension of this Bill, there is a practical reason why I support this
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000171" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000171">I
remember very well meetings of the Duchy council, which the Prince of
Wales, then a very young man, would always attend. He took a close
interest in the affairs of the Duchy. One must remember that we are not
talking about just a paper title but a large estate and what has become
a large business in recent years. It is my belief that the Prince of
Wales’s experience in chairing the Duchy council and dealing
with a large estate and matters of business has served him very well in
subsequent
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000172" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000172">That
experience, which has served the present Prince of Wales well, should
not be denied to a future heir to the Throne if she is a woman. In
fact, one might almost say it is all the more important that she
should, as heir to the Throne, have the sort of experience that the
present Prince of Wales has had. I hope that that experience will
become available irrespective of the gender of the heir to the Throne.
This may come as a bit of a surprise to the noble and learned Lord, but
perhaps he will consider the matter and take advice from the Duchy of
Cornwall itself if necessary—I could perhaps give him
advice—that this is a sensible extension of the

Lexden:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, support this amendment and will
add a small footnote to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd,
has just said. I understand that an amendment would be needed to the
Duchy’s founding charter, drawn up in 1337, to enable a female
heir to inherit. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, stressed,
this is a Bill that provides for gender equality. If that principle is
to be fully and completely embodied in it, action must surely be taken
to revise the founding charter of the Duchy of Cornwall so that a
female heir to the Crown can succeed to it.</hs_para>

learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, so wisely pointed out, there is a further
practical consideration. If the Duchy is not held by an individual but
placed in abeyance and administered by its council, there is a real
risk that its affairs will not be administered with efficiency and
skill. There is a strong view held by many that the absence of a Duke
of Cornwall between 1936 and 1958 led to a serious decline in the
running of its estates and other properties, a decline from which the
present Duke, now the Prince of Wales, successfully rescued it. For
these reasons, I support this
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T13:22:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000175" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000175"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Mancroft" PimsId="1669" UID="13022861001024" xid="1137" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861001024">Lord
Mancroft:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, support my noble
friend’s very important amendment. I was going to make the point
that I have heard repeated again and 
<?notus-xml column=1190?>again—which my noble friend Lord Lexden has made very strongly
for me—that not only does the Duke of Cornwall need a Duchy but
the Duchy needs a Duke. Estates, businesses, or whatever you may choose
to call them in the modern day and age, that are run by councils,
groups of trustees or boards of directors are all very well but in the
case particularly of a large agricultural estate such as the Duchy or
Cornwall—and there is none larger or better run—the
present Duchy of Cornwall runs so well because the Duke of Cornwall has
taken such an interest in it, and if there were not a Duke, regardless
of that Duke’s sex, I think that would not happen. My noble
friend Lord Lexden’s point is absolutely
valid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000176" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000176">Another
point that has been made, which I will repeat, is that the splitting
apart of ancient titles is unsatisfactory and untidy. In dealing with
important constitutional matters, although these are technicalities and
perhaps of interest only to historians, politicians and noble Lords who
can be bothered to spend their Thursday afternoons in your
Lordships’ House, they are important matters and need to be done
tidily. I do not think they are done tidily in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000177" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000177">Lastly,
when my noble and learned friend Lord Wallace responds, will he assure
the House that the Duke of Cornwall—the Prince of
Wales—was consulted over this and that he is comfortable with
the way in which the Bill is going forward? I do not wish my noble and
learned friend the Minister to breach any confidences or step outside
the correct procedures but it would give comfort to the House to know
that the Government had consulted His Royal Highness and that the Duchy
and the council and the Duke of Cornwall himself were comfortable with
the way in which this is

Trefgarne:</Member></B> My Lords, I do not intend to delay your
Lordships on this matter. All I will say is that a number of years ago
now I had to deal with His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in his
capacity as the Duke of Cornwall in connection with the use of Dartmoor
as a military training area. He dealt with it with enormous skill and
understanding and we were grateful to him for that. If this amendment
seeks to preserve and encourage those arrangements, I am in favour of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T13:25:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000179" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000179"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Berkeley" PimsId="3972" UID="13022861001026" xid="1072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861001026">Lord
Berkeley:</Member></B> My Lords, I support this amendment, but for
rather different reasons from those of some other noble Lords who have
spoken. It is ironic to me that we are having a debate, quite rightly,
about equality between men and women in inheriting titles. I understood
from what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, said at Second
Reading that if the next heir to the Throne is a lady, she could be
called either the Prince of Wales or the Princess of
Wales—heaven knows; I would have thought she would be a
princess, but I am no expert. If she can be called the Princess of
Wales, why can she not be called the Duchess of Cornwall, or the Duke
of Cornwall, or whichever way we want to put it? It seems
extraordinary,
really.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000180" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000180">At
Second Reading, I spoke about a number of issues that I had with the
current structure of the duchy: whether it is in the private or public
sector; what it does with its revenue; and the ability of the 
<?notus-xml column=1191?>Prince of Wales to approve legislation. Frankly, this is one of the few
Bills that he and Her Majesty should have a view on because it affects
them in their roles. However, there are an awful lot of other issues on
which I have not put amendments down because I was advised that they
were a bit outside the Long Title, so I shall be looking to prepare and
propose a Private Member’s Bill on some of these issues in the
next Session, I hope. When the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, said
that he had been Attorney-General to the Duchy of Cornwall, I thought,
“Fine, the Duchy is getting free legal advice from some of the
best lawyers in the land”. However, it then goes to tribunals
and says it is a private organisation. Well, no other private
organisations get free legal advice from an attorney-general. There are
many other issues to discuss on that, but I support the amendment as a
logical extension to the Bill. I look forward to hearing the
Government’s

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, we are dealing with anomalies here and
seeking to remove them. One reason we are doing that is because it
sends a very clear signal about the attitude of the state towards
certain issues. That is why so many of us are such supporters of the
removal of gender discrimination in this
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000182" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000182">I
genuinely find it difficult to understand why, if we are going to do
that, we have not thought through one or two other things that are also
signals. The concept of the heir to the Throne having this remarkable
opportunity, which history has given them, of running a significant
estate and dealing with significant matters of business is something
that has characterised the monarchy for a long time and has given the
present heir a remarkable opportunity, which he has used to huge
effect.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022861000183" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000183">I do
not think it right to put before the House a Bill that specifically
denies a female heir that opportunity. I know what will happen. She
will in effect be the Duchess of Cornwall. I have no doubt that she
will be asked to take the chair. I have no doubt that all this will
happen. But what I find so difficult—I rise on this point only
because it is a continuing concern of mine—is that we do not
understand that when you decide you are going to deal with an anomaly,
you have to deal with it. You cannot say, “I am going to deal
with this bit of it, but I have a particular concern that it would mean
changing something that happened in 13-something”. What a good
opportunity to remind people of the great length of our history and of
the fact that at this moment something has changed and we want to put

Government at their least compelling when they have found it impossible
to recognise that these things hang together. I hope that the noble and

difference in the other countries of the Commonwealth. No one will say,
“I am frightfully sorry, I cannot vote for this
because I am not prepared to give the Duchy of Cornwall to a
female”. Surely this is something we can sort out properly. If
the argument is that this might affect the issue of primogeniture with
regard to your Lordships’ House and those who were once in it,
then the answer is simple: this whole Bill is about the monarchy. We

Trefgarne. In effect, he is saying that this is too complicated to rush
and we need more time on much more detail. We are on only the third
amendment and already we are looking at a series of complexities which
have not so far been considered. This Bill is riddled with the
potential for unintended consequences of the type we are talking about.
We need much more thought and much more time. In the two weeks since
Second Reading I have had a great many communications from your
Lordships, mostly disagreeing with something I said on that occasion. I
have a shortlist of what the principle points are and they are not
really addressed in the process today.</hs_para>

no Parliament may bind its successors. One of my contentions is that
the deed of rights does effectively bind its successors, as does the
Act of Settlement. The question of entrenchment was not considered at
all, yet it is fundamental to that issue. There is the issue of the
sovereignty of Parliament and of the Crown. The Crown in Parliament is
a special factor and an expression which needs to be redefined in that
context. There is also the question of the limitations that the Bill
seeks to avoid and thus whether the constraints which normally apply do
not apply to the limitations of power. Amazingly, one of your Lordships
accused me of committing “desuetude”. I do not have a
clue what desuetude is, but I assure you that it has nothing to do with
what has been going on in the Liberal Democrat party.</hs_para>

they have a new story, I wish to make the point that this Tory Peer has
never done desuetude in his life as far as he is aware and if he did,
it was an accident and he was lured into it unawares. I found that
desuetude is not recognised under British law and does not apply, so we
can kick it into touch. On all the other issues, particularly the right
of this House to accept the delegation of the royal prerogative, I
stand firmly in my belief that we do not have the right to act
accordingly and we have been ill advised and inadequately advised about
our proper role and authority.</hs_para>

I will leave your Lordships with two thoughts. There are two awful,
unintended consequences which we have not thought of. First, if we pass
this Bill we have effectively done away with the need for a Scottish
referendum because 
<?notus-xml column=1193?>we have driven a coach and horses through the 1707 Act of Union. It no

I hate to say this—I fear that if we pass this Bill we have in
effect created what will amount to the accidental and unintended
abdication Bill. I cannot see how this Bill can be given Royal Assent,
and without it, it cannot pass. In those circumstances, the only way it
could ever be passed is during an interregnum, which can happen only
with the death of a monarch or an abdication. There would then have to
be an interval of several days before the proclamation of the new

way of modest qualification is that I understand there are a number of
other dukedoms and titles held by the Prince of Wales which might also
need to be changed and modified to bring them into the needs of this
Bill. As long as this does not delay action on the Duchy of Cornwall, I

Lord Lang—or about a business, in the words of the noble and

other noble Lords who contributed to the debate are coming from as they
seek to remove gender bias in the descent of the Duchy of Cornwall. I
will try to clarify the current situation. The title can pass only to
the eldest son and heir of the monarch. Thus—as has been

that this was an opportunity seek to remove anomalies. It is fair to
say that this one is perhaps even slightly more anomalous than it might
appear on the surface. The mode of descent specified by the charter is
unusual, and differs from that which commonly occurs in respect of
hereditary titles. The monarch’s eldest son is automatically
Duke of Cornwall immediately that he becomes heir apparent. However, if
the monarch has a son who is the heir apparent and that son dies before
the monarch, leaving a son of his own—a grandson of the
monarch—the grandson would become heir apparent but would not be
Duke of Cornwall because he is not the son of the monarch. It is not
just a question of daughters not inheriting the title; it would be that
grandsons did not, either.</hs_para>

access is the most radical transformation in academic publishing since

challenges of the transition to open access apply to all academic
disciplines, although the details may vary from subject to subject. I
will first explain the traditional model of scientific publishing.
Researchers, having garnered results and written them up, submit a
paper to a scientific journal, which has an editor who sends the paper
out for peer review, decides whether or 
<?notus-xml column=1197?>not to accept the paper for publication and, if revisions are needed,
supervises those. The publisher then edits the revised paper and prints
it.</hs_para>

of that process are born by individuals or institutions paying
subscriptions to the journal. It is a model in which the consumer
rather than the producer pays for access to academic research. Some
journals are purely commercial enterprises, but many are owned by
learned societies that use the profits from publishing to support
research, such as sponsoring studentships or conferences in their own
discipline.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000215" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000215">This
traditional model has been radically changed in the past decade or so
by the advent of online publishing, which presents the possibility of
anyone, anywhere in the world, accessing scientific articles. Part of
this disruptive change has been an increasing shift to open access,
meaning that the consumer can read the literature free of charge.
Perhaps the great majority of academic journals now allow readers free
access but usually only after a delay following publication; this
delay, or embargo, on free access enables the journals to maintain
their subscription-based model and people or institutions that pay get
a head start in reading the latest
articles.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000216" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000216">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T13:50:18"></hs_TimeCode>
is also rapid growth in a more radical form of open access, in which
the producer or author of the article pays the full costs of having it
refereed and published via a so-called article publishing charge or
APC. The consumer therefore gets free, immediate access and there is no
embargo. In the jargon of the trade, the embargo model is known as
green open access while the instant access, the producer-pays model, is
known as gold open access; some journals operate a hybrid

why did we carry out our inquiry? We were not questioning the move to
open access. It is an inexorable trend and it is generally considered
to be desirable that everybody should have access free of charge to new
research results and data. We had, however, heard informally from both
publishers and academics that the implementation plan following the
Finch review was not proceeding adequately. In the words of one
commentator, we were heading for a “car crash”
on 1 April 2013, the date for the implementation of Finch
recommendations. We therefore inquired, as a matter of urgency, into

to embargo periods. It is generally recognised that for the foreseeable
future, most journals will operate a hybrid of gold

is the final destination. Therefore, a crucial question for both the
publishers and for academics is the length of embargo periods. For
publishers, longer embargos are more likely to sustain the
subscription-based model. The Government’s position has been
that the starting point should be flexible, allowing for longer embargo
periods but moving gradually to shorter periods. However, the research
councils, through RCUK policy and guidance, require an instant change
for all research funded by the councils to short embargo periods.
Crucially and happily, in its evidence to our inquiry, RCUK appeared to
change its position and said that it would adopt the flexible starting
point that is the Government’s
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000220" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000220"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T13:54:11"></hs_TimeCode>Can

This tree makes it explicit that if the author does not have access to
funds to pay for the APC—in the early years RCUK expects to fund
about only half the APCs—longer embargo periods are acceptable.

inquiry also highlighted the possibility of various unintended
consequences of the open access policy, as well as lack of clarity. For
example, who will pay for the APCs when UK research council-funded
scientists are collaborating with scientists from other countries, as
happens in many of the top laboratories? Is the UK taxpayer to
subsidise other countries’ scientists? This has not yet been
clarified. Will there be a race to the bottom, in which journals cut
corners in peer review and editing to minimise their charges to
authors? Will UK scientists be allowed to publish in journals that do
not comply with RCUK policies? Could charging for publishing drive
scientists from other countries away from UK journals? Academic journal
publishing is a significant industry with a turnover of more than
£1 billion a year and 80% of that is

along with a number of other points, emphasise that the UK is entering
unchartered territory. It is one of the first countries to adopt an
open access policy with a stated preference for gold open access. Can
the Minister therefore confirm that, as we recommend, RCUK will
carefully monitor the consequences of the new policy, not only in 2014
but also at further stages during the five year implementation phase?
We suggest reviews in 2016 and 2018. We also suggest that, if the
unintended consequences and disadvantages turn out to be more
significant than anticipated, the RCUK should modify its
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T13:56:21"></hs_TimeCode>. Other

consultation was clearly inadequate. We recommend, and I seek the
Minister’s confirmation that this will be accepted, that BIS
should undertake a review of the consultation process and ensure that
lessons are learned. Finally, we were surprised to find that, although
there was much talk of the benefits of open access, no analysis of
these benefits has been done, either by BIS or by RCUK. Does the
Minister agree that in implementing one of the most fundamental changes
in academic publishing in 350 years, it would be appropriate to
understand the benefits, especially in light of the considerable costs
to the science base involved? Open access is a disruptive change to
academic publishing. It is potentially beneficial and desirable but it
must be introduced with clarity and care if it is not to have

Earl of Selborne:</Member></B> The House will be grateful to
the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, for introducing what is to many
a complex subject but one, as he pointed out, which has radical
implications for academic publishing. He very clearly set out some of
the knotty issues which must be rapidly resolved. In this inquiry
conducted by the Select Committee the process has been as valuable as
the product. When we invited written evidence, we rapidly received more
than 60 submissions, just about all accepting the principle
of moving towards open access—not an issue, as the noble Lord
has explained—but with greatly differing views on the wisdom of
the present preferences and timetable of the Government and the
research councils to achieve this desirable
aim.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000225" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000225">Having
recognised that this is a desirable aim, we should be highly supportive
of the leaders in this field; the Medical Research Council and the
Wellcome Trust have led in this respect. The MRC open access mandate
has been in place since 2006 and compliance with this mandate has
increased from about 24% in 2006 to almost half last year, and at the
end of the transitional period proposed by the research councils of
five years they hope to achieve 100%
compliance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000226" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000226">For
the areas of biomedical research with which the Medical Research
Council is concerned, without doubt the gold open access model has much
to favour it. That certainly is why the MRC and the other research
councils have preferred the gold open access model over the green. As
well as dispensing with the need for embargoes, it lends itself well to
some of the quite sophisticated procedures nowadays, such as text and
data mining, all of which have enormous commercial importance and
importance in promoting the dissemination of
knowledge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000227" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000227">As
we have just heard,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:00:04"></hs_TimeCode> gold model
requires article processing charges—APCs—and in the case
of the Wellcome Trust, the cost, which it calculated at between l% and
1.5% of its total research spend, has been met by the trust. It simply
says it believes that in the field of biomedical research, the benefits
flowing from open access more than justify the additional cost. It
strongly supports the commitment of the research councils to provide
funding via institutional block grants to meet the cost of gold open
access APCs.</hs_para>

the Select Committee notes, there is considerable doubt as to whether
everyone who wants to publish via the gold route will be funded for the
APCs. It further notes
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:00:55"></hs_TimeCode>, while the
principle of favouring open access was almost universally accepted, the
one-size-fits-all approach certainly was not. It is evident that the
research councils now accept this and are prepared to be much more
pragmatic and flexible than perhaps the original proposals seemed to
imply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000229" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000229">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:01:19"></hs_TimeCode>
concerns of a number of organisations were particularly centred on the
risk of being the first mover. While in biomedical research it is
certain that the gold open access route ultimately will be followed by
most other countries, it is by no means evident for other disciplines,
particularly but not exclusively the humanities and social sciences.
The green route, once a suitable repository is in place—many
obviously now are in place—is a cheaper route. It does not rely
on APCs, which at least in the early stage will have to be rationed.
The very real difficulty of some researchers, such as independent
scholars, in finding up-front funding for their APC is met by the green
route. They have no problems. It is true that embargo periods will
restrict the flow of research findings for a period but in practice we
have already seen that in many cases this does not present insuperable
problems for many disciplines. In other words, people are finding ways
around it in so far as it represents an
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000230" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0001.htm#13022861000230">Subscription
journals will not all wither and die. Some will be here for many more
years. Therefore, having identified the direction of travel, it will be
as well to recognise this and other concerns, and to ensure that in our
enthusiasm for being an international leader we do not do ourselves an
unnecessary disservice. The noble Lord, Lord Krebs, referred to the
problems for periodicals, particularly those of learned societies.
These learned societies very often rely on subscription journals for
promoting their charitable objectives and their discipline, including
public outreach, bursaries for students and fellowships, all of which
are commendable causes. However, one has to recognise that periodicals
and subscription journals first and foremost are there to disseminate
knowledge. Clearly, they will have to move with the times and
recognise, as the noble Lord reminded us, that things have changed
dramatically in academic publishing.</hs_para>

legitimate second-best alternative gold. However, for some it still
will remain a perfectly viable option and a legitimate, long-term

backdrop to these proposals is the manner in which digital technology
has impacted upon the production of the journals and the manner in
which their vast legacy is nowadays handled and controlled. At present,
a few overpowerful commercial suppliers are dominating the markets for
academic journals. They are deriving excessive profits from their
position as virtual monopolists. The profitability of these enterprises
can be explained by their market power and by the
extraordinarily favourable way in which they acquire their principal
assets, which are texts for publication. They are in possession of
valuable legacies of published material stretching back in time, often
by as much as a century, from which they can derive considerable rents
by granting access to their electronic archives.</hs_para>

my knowledge, the oldest collection of back issues is from the
<I>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</I>, which dates
back to its beginning in 1665. This collection has been digitised by
JSTOR, which is a not-for-profit operation for the electronic archiving
of journals that began in 1995 under the auspices of Princeton
University. JSTOR represents a countervailing force, which is limiting
the strength of the commercial monopolies. The principal clients of the
commercial monopolies, the universities, often feel greatly aggrieved.
University librarians and bursars are angered by the expense of paying
for access to the legacy, which is an expense that cannot be avoided by
any institution of higher education that supports research. The
academic staff are angered by the manner in which the commercial
journals presume upon their time and exploit their labour without
offering any financial recompense.</hs_para>

free services of academics consist not only in the supply of articles
for publication but also in their services as editors and referees. In
recent times, authors of technical papers have been rendering another
valuable service; that is, typesetting the articles. Nowadays, the

languages of TeX and LaTeX, which can be converted to the

outcome is to relieve the authors of unnecessary drudgery and to
enhance the profitability of the journals. If anyone wonders why this
unpaid labour is supplied so plentifully, the answer is that the
achievement of publication is essential to the advancement of an
academic career. The journals, therefore, have a captive workforce. The
commercial journals have been acutely aware of the threat that digital
technology in the hands of its clients can pose to their enterprises

greatest fear surely is that the workforce might decide to serve its
own interests by publishing rival journals that do not presume to

existence and they are becoming quite numerous. In the main, they
dispense entirely with printed volumes and rely on the web freely to
disseminate their output. Already,

my perception, such journals offer a paradigm of open access. There is
open access on both sides. Authors can submit their articles without
paying submission fees. Access is also free to any reader. I suggest
that there is nothing to prevent the national research
councils from taking the unprecedented step of providing
small subventions to such journals. The monopoly of commercial journals
is under threat from such developments. Also, their monopoly over the
legacy of journals is only partial. Many of the journals owned by
learned societies have contributed their back issues to JSTOR, which,
ostensibly, has impeccable charitable

against that backdrop that we must scrutinise the recommendations of
the Finch report. Before doing so, we should note that the
membership of the committee that produced the report contained
representatives from the big commercial academic publishers. Surely, it
was they who cautioned that the development of open access should not
be allowed to destabilise what, in their estimation, is most valuable

the committee’s deliberations has emerged a recommendation in
favour of the so-called gold option. As we know, this proposes that
articles should be made available immediately and free of charge in
return for a payment by an author, or by their institution, to the
publisher of an article processing charge, an APC. An estimate of
£1,750 per article has been mooted, which would provide a very
generous income to the commercial publishers, seemingly of an assured
nature. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:11:54"></hs_TimeCode>Where
would this money come from? It is blithely assumed that it would be
provided by research councils or by the author’s institution,
using a block grant given for the purpose. This would surely deny
authors access to journals unless they were in receipt of a research
grant, or unless they could prevail upon their institution to support
their submission. It would give those institutions powerful control
over what has hitherto been regarded as the province of an essential
academic freedom: the freedom of authors to submit their articles

not all journals would merit the submission fee, or APC. Journals would
be divided into those that were sanctioned to receive the APC and those
that were denied it. It would be difficult to start a new journal,
because the APC would not be granted before it had established its
reputation. The commercial suppliers of established journals would come
to occupy impregnable positions, and they would become even more
profitable. This is a nightmare scenario, and I hope it will never
materialise. Now is the time to stop the prospect of any such
eventuality. However, it is doubtful whether the UK has sufficient
leverage over the international market to influence it to any great
extent. I hope therefore that this will never

good. It emphasised to a very considerable degree this process of a
journey. It noted that it would take time for the world to move towards
open access. It said that there was already a very considerable
momentum behind that movement, particularly in the world of science
journals, but it would be a journey over time. During that
period—and indeed for a very considerable time to
come—some journals would be published under the gold open-access
route and some published under the green open-access route. Under that
route, after a period of time, the articles would be placed in a
repository and would become available for open access, but with the
requirement of an embargo period. Some journals would operate under a
hybrid scheme, whereby you could pay upfront to access journals through
open access, but the journal would also publish articles for which
there was no upfront payment. Those would be put behind a paywall and
would be accessible only behind that paywall.</hs_para>

which their libraries would have to continue purchasing the journals
concerned as not everybody would be able to use the open access system.
Universities would have to pay for their own researchers to make the
upfront payment—partly through the research councils or through
funders such as Wellcome—if they decided on full gold open

should bear in mind that the UK publishes only some 6% of the
world’s scientific output. Ninety-four per cent of the
world’s scientific output comes from other countries. The
arguments for gold open access, which in many senses is the best of all
worlds—we all acknowledge that it is a very good route to go
down—are somewhat similar to the arguments for free trade. If we
all indulge in free trade there are very considerable benefits to
everybody concerned. On the other hand, if a country moves to open up
its markets without other countries also pursuing a free-trade route,
then essentially its markets are open to competition but other
countries retain protectionism and do not open up their markets. That
is a very unsatisfactory situation. It is why the process of opening up
towards free trade has been a very long one involving multinational
negotiation. The rounds under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade and subsequently under WTO took a very long time. Countries sat

result of this, we in Britain will be in danger if we move too

should be the first mover here and that we should to some extent use

needs to be accelerated. There is a danger that we will open up our

The diagram on page 13 of our report shows that most countries are very
much still using the green-gold hybrid system. More countries are going
down the green route than the gold route. It is not yet clear that the
general move will be towards gold open access. Green open access is a
very real option and it is an alternative. There is therefore a need to
monitor what other countries do over the course of time and a need for
some form of cost benefit

because I come from a social science background, I have been extremely
concerned about the position of the learned societies. They have faced
difficulties in relation to the process, both in terms of time and in
terms of the preference for gold open access. It is quite clear that
many of these societies exist by subscription, but 80% or 90% of their
subscriptions come from overseas subscribers. Regarding access to these
journal articles without having to pay a subscription, in the social
sciences and the humanities you very often have to wait two years for
an article to be published. To have to wait another 12 months for
others to access it means very little. The consequence is that for many
of these learned societies the whole process of publication is not
viable. This raises very important issues which need to be considered.
As I say, I am delighted with the reaction we have already had from the
research councils and from HEFCE. I look forward to seeing further
moves in this
direction.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13022861000628" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000628">2.18

Broers:</Member></B> My Lords, I too congratulate the noble Lord, Lord
Krebs, on gaining this debate. I compliment him on his excellent
opening speech, which so clearly explained the issues and the reasoning
behind our recommendations. I also compliment Christopher Atkinson, our
clerk, who once again provided highly professional support to the
committee on this inquiry, which was mounted in a very short
time. I join other members of the committee in supporting the
recommendations of our report, especially that Research Councils UK
should include reference to the five-year implementation phase in its
requirements documents so that everyone is aware that it is not asking
for a precipitous implementation of its rules. I also feel that the
long-term aim of migrating entirely to gold access, as has been
mentioned by other noble Lords, needs continually to be reviewed. I was
particularly troubled by the fact that many of the most important US
journals with which I am familiar, and in which I have published, such
as <I>Science</I> and the journals of the American Institute of
Physics, the American Physical Society and the IEEE, do not seem to
have plans to offer gold access. It would significantly reduce the 
<?notus-xml column=1205?>impact of some of our most important research if they were not available
to our researchers in engineering and the physical sciences. I was,
however, reassured by David Willetts’s statement
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13022861000594" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000594">“we

wish now, with your Lordships’ indulgence, to talk about
something that is not directly a part of this report. It is the complex
situation encountered when considering when and how to publish new
science that contains ideas that have potential for commercial
application. This was not something we considered, although the noble
Lord, Lord Wade,
and<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:20:43"></hs_TimeCode> I asked
questions of our witnesses about whether the move to open access would
have any effect on patents and commercialisation. We were told that
this was a separate matter. This was a correct answer in the context of
this inquiry, but this matter is none the less of great importance to
the UK economy. Over the past few decades there has been a steady shift
of research, as opposed to development—unfortunately, we almost
universally elide these two—from industry to universities, with
a consequent increase in expectation about the potential
commercialisation of ideas emerging from academic research. Much of our
applied science and engineering research addresses science that is of
interest because it has the potential of benefiting mankind through
commercial development. Indeed, on examining the 36 units of assessment
in the Research Excellence Framework, I identified at least 15 units in
which patents might well be one of the
outputs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000252" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000252">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:22:00"></hs_TimeCode>
is not always the case that early and wide access to research results
is good for our economy. One of our witnesses, Professor Walmsley of
Oxford University, referred to this issue,
saying:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13022861000562" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000562">“Our
policies internally at Oxford are to try to capture that IP in a manner
that is consistent with UK law—i.e. getting the IP protected
before one comes out and
publishes”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13022861000535" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000535">I
am not aware, however, that this is widely practised and can find no
advice on this issue in the description and guidance literature for the
Research Excellence Framework. Patents are of course recognised output
for the REF, and it is stated that all forms of research will be
assessed on a fair and equal basis, but there is always a tension
between the wish to publish new results and the need to wait until
potentially valuable intellectual property has been protected. In fact,
the incentives for academic researchers seem strongly biased towards
publishing as early and as widely as possible. I am sure that any
formal requirement to ensure that IP was protected before publication
was approved would be controversial, as it would be regarded as a
constraint on academic freedom. To counter this in industry, many
leading technology companies, at least in my experience in the US,
directly reward employees for their IP output to compensate them for
the loss, for a time, of recognition in the wider world for their
advances. I have no specific recommendations to make on this issue, but
it is a topic that should be considered in depth by the funding
councils, the research councils and by vice-chancellors, with the aim
of improving our ability to secure the economic potential of our
academic research before we share all our ideas with the entire world
over the internet. There has never 
<?notus-xml column=1206?>been a time when an increase in our ability to commercialise academic
research would be of more benefit to the
nation.</hs_parafo></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_28_PT_1/606D63918E5579518A6B6A8A72266AA3B83FC6B4" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 February 2013">Thursday,

academics, the open access campaign is pushing at an open door.
Researchers like their work to be freely available to everyone,
including those with no institutional affiliation, but achieving this
goal is a bigger challenge in some disciplines than in others. My own
field, physics and astronomy, is more or less there already. That is
because of a well organised web archive started in the 1990s by Paul
Ginsparg in the US. I look at this archive every day and far less often
at actual journals. However, we still value the peer review provided by
“traditional” journals and want our papers to appear in
one as well—for accreditation reasons rather than for increasing
the number readers. In our field, the journals survive. Theoretical
physicists have, in effect, green open access with a zero embargo
period. If the paper is published, the journal version appears and
remains on the archive. However, I realise that other disciplines are
less lucky, with a real gap between current practice and the eventual
goal. It is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:26:26"></hs_TimeCode>
rather sad that, thanks to Paul Ginsparg, the educated public can read
everything on superstring theory, which will not enlighten them much,

humanities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000256" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000256">There
is a global move towards open access. Indeed, just last Friday, a paper
from Dr John Holdren, President Obama’s science adviser,
enjoined all government agencies to come up with proposals to implement
enhanced open access to the results of all the research that they fund.
However, what is not clear is whether the so-called
“gold” route will be widely followed globally. Let us
remember that we publish less than 10% of the world’s research.
Unless other countries follow the gold route, we will be paying twice:
foreign scientists will benefit from our decision but we will not get a
reciprocal benefit. That is why it is important that BIS should assess
the value for money and that RCUK and HEFCE should keep the situation
under review in an international
context.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000257" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000257">The

developments. Traditional journals, even in electronic form, are no

the widespread support for open access in academia, academia displays
undue rigidity in some respects which plays into the hands of
commercial publishers. Surely it is far from optimal that the career
prospects of young academics depend on a single monograph or on the
bibliometric scores of a few papers. It is even worse if there is an
“institutionalised” pecking order of journals, with a
frustrating and morale-sapping delay while young authors struggle for
acceptance in a top-ranked journal. One of the most deplorable remarks

expand access in such a way that the policy implications would be well
understood, the Government facilitated an independent group of
stakeholders chaired by Dame Janet Finch. The Finch group concluded in
June 2012 that a mixed economy for open access was most appropriate,
but with the policy direction set towards “gold open
access”. Gold requires payment, by the researcher, of an
up-front article processing charge, with the advantage of making the
information freely available immediately to all users and without
restriction of use. The Government’s open access policy has a
strong preference for gold open access but, in keeping with the mixed
economy recommended by the Finch group, also accepts “green open
access”, which allows the publisher to charge the user a
subscription or access fee to reach the published research during an
embargo

responsibility. They will be expected to responsibly strive to comply
with RCUK’s stated open access policy—that is, preferably
to use gold, or alternatively green, with embargo periods of no more

assessment of the implications of RCUK’s open access policy has
therefore considered its impact on stakeholders, including researchers

Government’s open access policy for publicly funded research is
more responsive to the needs of all stakeholders than the equivalent
policies being proposed in Europe and, as announced on 22 February
2013, by the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the United
States. By making funding available through the research councils for
gold open access and simultaneously allowing green as an alternative,
with longer embargo periods when there is no funding available to the

balanced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000281" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000281">A
well structured policy is important since open access is expected to
strengthen direct and spillover benefits from research to stimulate
economic growth. Publicly funded research can lead to important

placed on open access. We now have an even greater opportunity, by
exploiting the internet itself, to further amplify the benefits of
publicly funded research. By publishing research papers

developments lie behind this issue. The first is the techniques and
ethics of the procreation of children and social attitudes towards
these which have been fast-changing, still are changing and will
continue to change. Secondly, at some time in the future a monarch and
his or her consort may wish, where no other course is available to
them, to seek to procure a child by use of a donor. That child, the
first of whom would have been the heir if born naturally, would become
a much loved member of the Royal Family and one whom many might wish to
see as their monarch. There are clearly seeds of controversy there. The
second issue is that it seems likely that the Parliament of the United
Kingdom, although not those of all Her Majesty’s realms, will
very shortly legislate to allow same-sex marriage. These measures,
taken together, will alter for all time the concept of what a family,

must make it clear that I take no view on same-sex marriage for the
purpose of this issue. In case anyone should think there is an ulterior
motive, I should make it clear that I do not believe that all the
consequences of that momentous social change have been thought through
and I would not have been inclined to take the step without more notice
to the public and wider and more open consultation. Be that as it may,
I did not want to raise the issue of the Crown, in any circumstances,
in our debates on the same-sex marriage Bill, lest it be seen as an
attempt to use the monarchy as a device to debate that Bill. That would
be deplorable: I would not and will not take such a step. The issue is,
none the less, fast upon us. As we are legislating in this Bill to
change the laws on royal marriage and succession, it would be wise to
reflect on the potential impact on the Bill also now before Parliament
on same-sex marriage and how those two Bills might, in future,
interrelate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:53:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000298" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000298">The
governing phrase as to the conveyance of the right of succession in the
Bill of Rights, which is reused in Section 1 of the Act of Settlement
and is left unchanged by this legislation is that he or she be the
“heir of the body” of the Electress Sophia of Hanover and
her successors, being Protestants—which we will discuss later.
There is surely scope for contentious argument, if not litigation, over
what, in the new circumstances of the 21st century, is the definition
of those ancient words “heir of the body”. That phrase
does not require that the heir should be the heir of two 
<?notus-xml column=1214?>specific bodies. Indeed, the originating Act of Settlement includes
reference to the body of a monarch and a prospective monarch alone.
What then if, in the context of either a different or a same-sex
marriage—the question is immaterial—the sperm of a King
is used to procure a child of his body on a donor woman or, even more
directly, a child is born from the body of a regnant Queen by use of a
donor? Some might ask whether the child is the heir of the body of that
regnant Queen. This is the only method by which an heir of the body
could be procured by a same-sex married monarch, and the human impulse
of such a loving couple may well be to seek to procure such an heir.
Will some not see that child as a legitimate heir of the
monarch’s body if that marriage has been accepted by the British
people? Might that child not feel that he or she has, in turn, a human
right to expect to succeed to his or her mother or

may well be that the Crown is encompassed within that definition as a

beyond and above. It is, indeed, the fount of all title or dignity of

the succession to the Crown is engaged by the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act. Furthermore, are we certain that it is not arguable in
a court, in default of a statement to the contrary, that the UK

Queen is monarch of 16 realms, in not all of which is the view embodied
in the legislation on marriage now before Parliament shared
or likely to be shared. In Canada, gay marriage is already legal, the
Australian Parliament has recently rejected it. A divergent view on the
legitimacy of a royal marriage might, and a divergent view
on the legitimacy of an heir would, break the union of realms. In 1837,
the dominions of the Crown were irretrievably separated
because of differing rules on the succession. Hanover did not allow
female succession, so Queen Victoria could not rule Hanover, which
passed to her uncle. It seems inherently unlikely that in the present
diverse evolution of social policy in the Queen’s realms that
any progeny of a same-sex marriage—even same-sex marriage
itself—would be accepted in at least some of the existing

understand the motivations of those who have introduced this Bill. I
think it has been rather rushed, and a number of noble Lords have
mentioned the words “possible unintended consequences”
during the course of our deliberations. We could be facing a very
difficult unintended consequence if we do not further clarify the Bill
in this particular regard. Therefore, I am suggesting that there should
be some proper agreement or concordat—call it what you
like—with the Vatican to say that the children of a union with a
Roman Catholic partner in the marriage are not obliged, according to
the Roman Catholic canon that exists, to be brought up in the Roman
Catholic faith.

is so bound up with the constitution of our realm, that we need some
form of concordat or agreement sanctioned at the highest level of the

words of my noble friend Lord Cormack about the nature of Her Majesty
and the way in which she has discharged her duties. Not only has it
been remarkable but it has been so remarkable that it may have blinded
us to the nature of the discussion that we are having today. In the
past, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England was a Calvinist and
a Lutheran. The only reason they were able so to be was that they were
prepared to say, of their own volition, that although they were
Calvinist or Lutheran, for this purpose they would be a member of the
Church of England. I make no comment on them; I merely say that it was
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:21:55"></hs_TimeCode>.

say to the Minister that I accept that this is a very anomalous

Majesty had played. There is no doubt that, as Supreme Governor of the
Church of England, she has brought 
<?notus-xml column=1221?>something to the religious life of this land that has been unique and
remarkable. However, there are few theologians who can easily argue
that this position has a serious theological basis today. We all know
that the reason we have it is that the state decided to nationalise the
church—that is what happened—in order to get its hands on
money and power. It is no good ignoring that. It is not a prejudiced
comment. I used to believe it when I was an Anglican, so I cannot be
criticised for saying it. That is what happened. The arrangement today
arises from an attempt to bring together the facts of history with the
perfectly reasonable desires of religious people to make the
establishment work. I am in favour of the establishment; I do not want
the Church of England disestablished. I pray that, one day, the Church
of England and the Catholic Church will again become

this allegiance in no way contradicts my allegiance to the Queen of
England. She is the Queen of England as far as I am concerned because I
am English, but I realise that she is also the Queen of Britain. I
defer to my noble friend. I see no contradiction between those

something quite different about the heir to the Throne”? That
looks to me precisely the sort of deal, a political deal, about which
many reformers complained. I cannot possibly put my name to something
which proceeds in that manner. Then, one has to ask His Holiness to say
something most remarkable; that, despite the Church’s teaching,
children of the union can be brought up as Anglicans. Therefore, the
Pope says that, they get married and they say, “The Pope may say
that the children can be brought up as Anglicans but we do not want
that”. What, then, do we say in this constitutional arrangement?

happens if they bring the child up as an Anglican and he does not think

of the Synod of the Church of England. I became increasingly clear that
the Anglican Church had moved from being part of the Catholic Church to
being a sect because it had decided that it had its own rights to make
its own decisions about the teachings and the doctrines of the Catholic
Church. Once it did that, it seemed to me to change its position.
Therefore, I 
<?notus-xml column=1222?>ceased to be an Anglican and I became a Catholic. What happens if the
Pope has said that the heir to the Throne may be brought up as an
Anglican, he is brought up as an Anglican and he says to himself,
“In truth, I think that the Pope is right—with the
exception that he has done a deal with the British authorities. I have
therefore decided that I will become a Catholic”? What do we do
as a society then? Do we say, “We are frightfully sorry, you are

with which I shall not bother the House as I know very well that the
Government are determined not to take it seriously. It seems to me
perfectly right that the Church of England should have a Supreme
Governor. In normal circumstances, the Supreme Governor should be the
monarch where the monarch is an Anglican. But where the monarch is not
an Anglican, the monarch should nominate as Supreme Governor someone
from the family who is an Anglican. That seems to me to be a perfectly

Holiness. They are not going to agree to it either. What I would say to

comment to my noble friend. On Sundays, Anglicans do not pray for the
Queen as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, they pray for
the Queen. At exactly the same time, although in larger numbers and
with greater enthusiasm, Catholics pray for the Queen. There is no
distinction between our prayers. The fact of the supreme governorship
does not relate to the way in which subjects pray for their Queen. The
only reason I raise this is because on these occasions there is always
just a little hark back towards a feeling that there is a position
before the Almighty that makes the Church of England special. The
Church of England has an important history and its evensong is in many
ways one of the finest services produced by any church of any kind.
However, let us remember that we live in a pluralist society and that
much of this anomaly is something that most people cannot and do not

bring forward a Private Member’s Bill to deal with this issue. I
was ambushed at the very first stage by my late and much missed friend,
Lord St. John of Fawsley, who by use of procedure, prevented me from
even being able to speak to my Bill or to introduce it again for a

reasons that my noble friend Lord Deben spelled out so clearly—I

therefore there is no reason, as my noble friend said, why the monarch
has to be a member of the Church of England. There may be other issues
that arise from that, and I appreciate that the example of James VII or
James II—depending on your perspective—may not have been
an entirely happy one. However, it did not end in tears because he was
a Catholic and head of the Church of England; some other issues
resulted in it ending in
tears.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000346" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000346">The
Deputy Prime Minister has brought forward this legislation on the basis

talking about equality in the context of the monarchy. It seems to me
quite extraordinary that we have not been able to take that further
step and remove the prohibition on the monarch being a Catholic. In the
18th century, there were very good reasons for having this language; it
was about the security of the nation. Indeed, the very Act of Union
itself occurred as a deal; the Scots were bailed out from the huge
losses which had been created by the Darien scheme, and in return the
Protestant succession was secured. That was what it was about.
Therefore, to leave on our statute book words which cause great offence
to many Catholics and non-Catholics in our country is shocking and it
is sad that the Bill does not deal with

constitution. Although the Vatican is no longer a foreign power which
will encourage the French or anyone else to usurp the

the amendment is unnecessary because under the present rules no

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend
Lord Cormack for introducing this amendment. It has generated a
passionate debate and raised important issues, not least ones also
reflected in our Second Reading debate about the upbringing of children
should there be a mixed marriage. The noble Lord, Lord Luce, quite
properly indicated that this Bill is limited in its scope and does not
deal with the established church or the monarch as Supreme Governor. I
know the passion with which my noble friend Lord Forsyth takes a
view—which I share—on the wording of some 17th century
legislation. That wording is offensive, but as the noble Lord
recognised from his early attempts with a Private Member’s Bill,
these matters are hugely complex and I do not believe that this Bill is
the appropriate place to deal with
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000359" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000359">As the
noble Lord, Lord Luce, indicated, at Second Reading he and the noble
Lord, Lord Janvrin, asked if I would meet representatives of the
Catholic Church. I did so earlier this week. I can inform the House
that I came away with a clear message that in the instance of mixed
marriages the approach of the Roman Catholic Church is a pastoral one.
It was considerably stressed to me that the Catholic Church will always
look to provide guidance that supports and strengthens the unity of the
partnership and the indissolubility of marriage. It is in this context
that the Catholic Church expects Catholic spouses sincerely to
undertake to do all they can to raise their children within the
Catholic Church.</hs_para>

not been possible for the child of a mixed marriage to be brought up as
a Catholic, it has been drawn to my attention that the Catholic parent
does not fall subject to the censure of canon law. The clear signal was
that the overriding concern in Catholic pastoral guidance to couples in
mixed marriages—it was drawn to my attention that there are many
mixed marriages today in England and Wales—is the unity and
indissolubility of the marriage. I assure the House that it is not the
case that the children of all mixed Protestant and Catholic marriages
must be brought up in the Catholic
faith.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000361" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000361">It is
also important to note the important concept within the Catholic Church
of subsidiarity. As a Presbyterian I do not pretend to understand it,
but it is one that I have certainly heard associated with the Catholic
Church. We perhaps debate the word in another context, but within the
organisation of the 
<?notus-xml column=1227?>Catholic Church, subsidiarity is an important concept and much
decision-making is devolved to a local level, including
decisions relating to mixed marriages. Quite simply, the Vatican does
not get involved. My noble friend Lord Deben highlighted both the
constitutional implications and significance if the amendment moved by
my noble friend Lord Cormack were to be carried. It would raise
constitutional issues and would put the Pope in a very difficult
position, one that I suspect the Vatican does not aspire to have thrust
upon it. In its recent letter to Members of your Lordships’
House on this issue, the Church of England
stated:</hs_para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:49:30"></hs_TimeCode>it was both. It
was to allow someone in the line of succession to the Throne to marry a
Catholic and to remove that discrimination. I know that the noble
Lord’s subsequent question would be, “Why don’t
you remove the ultimate discrimination?”. However, as he
acknowledged, from his own efforts to do something, this is a much more
complex issue. He says that he does not wish to disestablish the Church
of England. Many would argue that if we went down that road, it
possibly would lead to the disestablishment of the Church of England.
There is a proper debate to be had there, but this emphasises that that
is not the purpose of this Bill. However, where an opportunity has
arisen to remove at least one area of discrimination, it has properly
been

interesting short debate. Some of the language used by my noble friend

people in this country are concerned. Parliament has a duty to address
this issue. Mentioning a foreign power in legislation is by no means
unprecedented. However, I take the point of my noble friend Lord
Fellowes; indeed, I made it obliquely myself in my introductory remarks
when I said that I was not wedded to the words of the amendment. I
wanted to have a debate on the subject. This we have had. I would be
glad to talk to my noble friend Lord Fellowes and others before
deciding whether to pursue this, which I may well do on Report. The
issue deserves mature and thoughtful debate. It is of importance for we
do not know how long. There may be no problem in the next century;
there may be one within a very few years. One just does not know.
However, when we are legislating in good faith for a long
time—in spite of the fact that no Parliament can bind its
successors; we can repeal whatever we like tomorrow—we have to
do our best to make it as clear, precise and right as we possibly can.

this amendment and pick up a point which my noble and learned friend
Lord Wallace made in his response to the previous amendment when, with
typical skill, he used something I said as an argument against me. I
had said that the issue was too complex to be dealt with by a Private
Member’s Bill. I was persuaded by the late Lord St John of
Fawsley that this was not a matter suitable for being dealt with by a
Private Member’s Bill and was best left to the Government to
deal with. It is not really good enough for the Government to say that
this is a very complicated area and it would mean having to deal with
the whole issue of maintaining an established church and therefore we
have gone for half a loaf. In my speech on the previous amendment I
asked my noble and learned friend Lord Wallace to explain why it is not
possible to devise a basis on which the monarch can remain head of the
Church of England but not actually be of the Anglican faith. This
amendment, moved by my noble friend Lord Trefgarne and supported by my
noble friend Lord Northbrook, is a particular
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:58:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000374" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000374">I
do not think it is necessary to create a regency in order to do so. We

will not do it in this Bill, it is disappointing that they are not able
explain what the options and difficulties are about it. My noble and
learned friend did not fall into the trap when I intervened in his
speech and asked him what the Government are trying to do here. Are
they trying to end discrimination against Roman Catholics or are they
just trying to enable the heir to the Throne to marry a Roman Catholic?
I would be horrified if it is the latter. Of course, that is a good
thing to do—if two people want to get married they should be
able to do so—but I thought that this was part of a wider agenda
of ending discrimination against Catholics. We need to understand why
the Bill has not provided for that and why the idea contained in the

irresponsible to dismiss out of hand. Therefore, I suggest that all

subject remains a topic for further parliamentary consideration. That
might be by way of using the existing committee
structure—perhaps the Constitution Committees in both Houses
might wish to take this on—or even through the facility in your

purpose. It seems to us that the spirit of change, referred to by the

Trefgarne indicated in moving this amendment, this is one of the key
issues raised by this Bill. Certainly, his Amendments 10 and 11 and the
consequential ones to the schedules are interesting and were flagged up
at Second Reading. They are an interesting way of addressing what has
been seen as a dilemma: if the sovereign was to be a Roman Catholic,
how could that person also be the Supreme Governor of the Church of
England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:01:29"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000378" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000378">When
I tried to answer my noble friend Lord Forsyth’s question as to
whether the proposal was to allow the heir to the Throne to marry a
Roman Catholic or to remove discrimination, I think I said that it was
both, and it is. Clause 2 is of symbolic importance because it removes
a discrimination which I believe does not have a place in our society
today. As I think I also indicated, and as has been accepted across the
Chamber, 
<?notus-xml column=1231?>these issues with regard to the sovereign being a Roman Catholic go much
wider than the person who may ascend to the Throne being married to a
Roman Catholic.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:02:14"></hs_TimeCode> Government
are committed to the Church of England as the established church in
England with the sovereign as its Supreme Governor. I note what the
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, says about a possible further examination.
Certainly, the Government have no plans to do so. Indeed, the
Government suggesting to Select Committees what they may or may not do
probably is not good form. But he has made his proposal and there will
be others who will have heard it. It may be that a Select Committee

the importance of the issues. It is very obvious that some
people see this Bill as a Trojan horse for disestablishment and some
are frightened in the opposite direction. I do not believe that this
Bill is appropriate for that. Therefore, I cannot give my noble friend

the idea of separating the roles of sovereign and Supreme

that would represent a very major change to the role of the

require extensive consultation. It is a significant diversion from the
traditional role of the monarchy over recent centuries. The Government
consider that the change in the law effected by
Clause 2 is a valuable one but we do not believe that it is
necessary for the Bill to go beyond that and to
delve into the significant wider issues that this amendment

questions about the relationship between the sovereign and the Supreme

be taken? The oath of accession includes a promise to maintain and
preserve the Protestant religion and Presbyterian 
<?notus-xml column=1232?>Church government. Who would take this oath? Presumably it would not be
appropriate for a regent who is a Supreme Governor of the Church of

could help him on the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Every year, at
the opening of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the
monarch promises to defend the Presbyterian Church Government in
Scotland—I will not get the words exactly right. I think that
she does that in a personal capacity, not as head of the Anglican
Church. She promises to defend it, so there is no reason why a Catholic
monarch could not still promise to defend the Presbyterian Church
Government in Scotland. To confuse that with Presbyterianism in England

myself clear. I did not mean to suggest that it was as Supreme Governor

the opposite; it would not be appropriate for someone who was appointed
as a regent—a Supreme Governor—to make that oath. I think
that that would be wholly inappropriate. It raises the question of

Reading, and I do not wish to extend this debate too much. The problem
ultimately will be a human problem, as it was in 1936. That human
problem, if it arises, will concern a child who is an heir, either the
heir presumptive or a child who by some accident becomes the next in
line, a popular expectant heir to the throne, who, whether from birth
or by proximity to the Catholic faith when being brought up, believes
that they cannot take up the duties of a monarch without the support of
the church that they love. That might well be the Catholic

<?notus-xml column=1234?>do the Government have any proposals to change the law—the
sovereign may not be, nor have been, a Roman Catholic. Therefore, the
situation which my noble friend Lord True suggested, where the
sovereign comes to the Throne having to agonise as to whether to
renounce the Catholic religion, just would not arise, because, having
been a Catholic, he or she would not be eligible to ascend to the

entirely concur with my noble friend’s opening remarks: these
are very much human matters at the end of the day. There is a human
dimension to it, and that is why, in response to the earlier debate, I
sought to reflect the discussions which I had with representatives of
the Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales so that this is
looked at at a pastoral, human level, which seeks to reflect the
importance of the union of a partnership and the indissolubility of
marriage. It is against that background that decisions should be made

Forsyth of Drumlean:</Member></B> My Lords, I had not appreciated this
until my noble and learned friend said it: he said that not only would
a Catholic not be able to ascend to the Throne but that someone who had
been a Catholic but had then converted to be an Anglican could not
ascend to the Throne. That has nothing whatever to do with the position
of being Supreme Governor of the Church of England. That is a simple
discrimination against Catholics. My noble and learned friend said,
“Oh, the reason that we have made this Bill focus on just these
three areas is because the issues are so complex”. It is clear
that he will not accept the amendment, and I accept some his arguments
for that—but, in listening to this debate, can he not see that
there are a number of issues? The noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, suggested
that we should have a Select
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:14:05"></hs_TimeCode>, or
some kind of body to look at these issues, and park the Bill while that

at the end of the day, it might be concluded that it was impossible to
reconcile maintaining an established Church with removing this
discrimination against Catholics. However, if the Government say,
“Oh well, this is just a Bill that’s dealing with these

by all the other Parliaments around the world. Would they not think it
very odd if we came forward with this Bill now and then a short while
later came forward with the other bit of it? Or is the proposition that
this is just too difficult? If it is too difficult, why on earth did

Cormack:</Member></B> I would like to add a word. There is a real
danger that we are treating exceptionally complex matters far too
simplistically. The constitution of our country, which is not written,
has often been compared to a beautifully constructed watch—take
away one 
<?notus-xml column=1235?>ostensibly tiny piece of the mechanism and the whole thing falls apart.
Some fairly unpleasant things were said about my amendment
earlier on, but there we are; that is the rough and tumble of debate.
However, I really believe that those of us who are concerned about this
issue—coming from slightly different points of view, I
accept—are on to something that the Government have not bothered
to think through. They have said, “Oh look, this is so complex
that we’ll just concentrate on these things”, which is
equivalent to saying, “This watch is beautifully constructed;
we’ll just look at the hands in the face and forget the bit
behind”. There is merit in the interesting suggestion from the
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson—if I may have his attention for a
moment—or at least in the Minister calling a meeting in his room
for people who are concerned, and possibly in going forward to a
special committee. This is not really the ideal forum for a detailed
discussion of these exceptionally important and complex matters, which

establishing a committee to look at these matters. It is clear that
there are committees of this House and indeed of the other place that
could do so. Obviously the Government would contribute to any such
committee that we had invited to do this, but I do not believe that
that is a pathway that is inconsistent—nor did the noble Lord

to this amendment is very similar. It is a different structure for
having, as it were, a divergence between the person who is the
sovereign and the person who is the Supreme Governor of the Church of
England. Some of the difficulties and arguments which were expressed
with regard to the regency are also applicable to the slightly
different structure proposed in Amendment 11. I am not sure that I can

itself to the Roman Catholic faith, or the possibility of the sovereign
or the heir to the Throne being Roman Catholic, but deals with all
other possible faiths. At the moment, many legal restrictions apply to
the Roman Catholic faith in this regard but none applies to Muslims,
the Jewish faith or any faith other than the Anglican and Roman
Catholic faiths. Therefore, that matter certainly bears additional
consideration, but perhaps not today. In the meanwhile, I beg leave to

and practical amendment, which seeks to increase from six to 12 the
number of persons in line of succession to the Crown who would be
required by the Bill to seek the consent of the monarch before
marrying. The existence of that provision in the Bill is to my mind a
tacit admission of the potential for turbulence created by Clause 2 and
that part of Clause 3 which repeals the Royal Marriages Act 1772, the
Bill pitting, as it does, a relaxation over the entry of Catholics into
the royal line against the absolute ban on their reaching the Throne.

least some effort to

1772 Act had the draconian effect of voiding a marriage that lacked the
monarch’s consent and it had become unworkable because of its
extent, but it did have the virtue of certainty, which was needed then,
as now. King George III’s seven sons between them entered into
nine marriages—a case of nine brides for seven brothers. Three
of them were in contravention of the recently enacted Royal Marriages
Act and were therefore void, thus keeping the line of succession
relatively tidy, if nothing else. I wish we could say the same for the
new provision, but I fear that it could lead to great untidiness. The
only argument that my noble and learned friend could offer in favour of
exchanging the open-ended control of the 1772 Act for a list of just
six, was that when Queen Victoria was born, she was fifth in line of
succession and no sovereign had come to the Throne from further out
than that. However, he chose a bad example and I would like to use that
example to answer his

remarkable thing about Queen Victoria’s circumstances was not
that she started life so far out in the line but that she did not start
much further out. After all, King George III had 12 surviving children,
seven of them sons, so the succession must have looked pretty secure as
they grew up. Of course, only six of them would have been in what one
could call the “club of six” under the clause we are now
considering. Indeed, half the King’s children would have been
outside it, just as a third of Queen Victoria’s children would
also have been outside it. I ask the House to consider how this club of
six would have worked at that

1817, two years before Victoria was born, Princess Charlotte, daughter
of the Prince of Wales and second in line to the Throne, died
tragically in childbirth, along with her baby, who would have been
third in line. King George’s sixth son, Prince Augustus
Frederick, who would have left the club of six at her birth, would now
have rejoined it. At the time, only three of the Prince’s
brothers were married within the terms of the Act. They were all
middle-aged and had no legitimate children. It suddenly became apparent
that the succession was at risk. Within a year, three more of the
brothers hurried into marriage, including Prince William, Duke of
Clarence and St Andrews, and his younger brother, Prince Edward, Duke
of Kent and Strathearn, who was then aged
50.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000412" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000412">A year
later, in 1819, Prince Edward’s daughter, Victoria, was born and

his daughter Victoria moved up to fourth in line and Prince Augustus
Frederick would again have rejoined the club of six. Six days after
that, King George III died, Princess Victoria moved up to third place
and her youngest uncle, Prince Adolphus Frederick, who would have left
the club of six at the age of 21, rejoined it at the age of 45. Eleven
months later he was out of it again as his brother, Prince William,
became father to a daughter, Princess Elizabeth. She took third
position in line and his niece Victoria moved back down to fourth
position. Less than three months after that, the infant Princess
Elizabeth tragically died. Those below her, including Victoria, moved
back up the line and Prince Adolphus Frederick—not to be
confused with his brother Prince Augustus Frederick, still less with
his other brother Prince Frederick Augustus—would have been back
for the third time in today’s club of six. Fortunately for him,

Princess Victoria’s place in the succession had changed upwards
and downwards four times. I recite all this simply to show that the
line of succession to the Crown can easily involve an almost random
element. The unexpected often happens, as my noble friend Lady Thatcher
almost said. The highly improbable can quickly become the near certain.
It also shows that the succession can move in both directions, up as
well as down, and between late middle-age and infancy. Queen Victoria
was 18 when she came to the throne, her predecessor was 64 and her
successor was 59. Her circumstances were unlike any other before or
afterwards but they demonstrate the unpredictability of the line of
succession and therefore the need to provide for that when we legislate
on the matter. We cannot predict what future circumstances will be, so

my noble and learned friend, who attempts to justify six with the
repeated argument that Princess Victoria was fifth in line at her
birth, I point out that, in the terms of Clause 3, it is not her birth
that is relevant or requires the sovereign’s consent but her
marriage. By the time she married and would therefore have become
subject to this clause, Victoria was already Queen herself. I venture
to suggest that that indicates a bit of a design fault in the clause
which might merit some
attention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:27:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000415" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000415">The
choice of Queen Victoria as a case to strengthen the
Government’s case is, to say the least, unfortunate. Her example
is, at best, irrelevant and it demolishes any rationale the Government
have for confining the number in this clause to 6. As for the other
explanation, that the choice of six was, as the Deputy Prime Minister
admitted, arbitrary and pragmatic, that is not an argument but an
apology. At Second Reading, I suggested that we should not think of the
line of succession as a straight line of descent but rather in family
groupings, and that is particularly so as life expectancy lengthens.
All six places covered by this clause could be within the family of one
son or daughter of the sovereign, which leaves other sons or daughters
exposed in the event of a tragedy befalling the family of the heir
apparent. The search for heirs might then need to move outwards,
possibly encountering families who, for religious or other reasons, had
to be leapfrogged to 
<?notus-xml column=1239?>find heirs that fitted. A club of 12 would be more likely to avoid that.
One could argue for more but I accept that 12 should be enough to put
matters beyond a reasonable doubt, which six does

amendment, where there is a specified limit there will always be the
possibility of those in the line of succession going on and off the
nominated list like poor Prince Adolphus Frederick and not forgetting
Prince Augustus Frederick. However, this amendment would move such
comings and goings further away from the immediate line of
succession and offer a better chance that the
monarch’s immediate family would all be on the list, at least
until they had passed the normal marrying age. I chose to table this
amendment as it covered the one area of the Bill that could be improved
quite easily and with little controversy. It does not frustrate the
Bill’s purpose but is simply an amendment of detail. This detail
does not, I gather, feature in the Perth agreement: perhaps my noble

Second Reading. Even before the Royal Marriages Act 1772, the sovereign
had a right, and exercised it, not under statute but under the common
law, to prevent marriages of other members of the Royal
Family—for example, to prevent the Queen Mother from remarrying.
This right, as I understand it, still applies, whereby under the common
law the sovereign could enforce his or her consent to the marriages of
brothers, sisters, cousins and so on. Therefore, as the noble Lord,
Lord Carlile, said at Second Reading, this right should be abolished.

noble friend Lord Lang has explained so fully and convincingly, leaving
very little further to be said. Today, we expect families to be of
modest size and assume that the future will closely resemble the
present. That is surely an arrogant and misconceived assumption.
Historically, the monarch’s immediate family has often been
extremely large in number, and the Bill ought to provide for a
recurrence of a substantial number in their immediate family by
extending to 12 the members of the Royal Family for whose
marriages royal approval will be
required<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:33:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

family to secure the triumph of good behaviour. It has been said of
George III’s abundant offspring that that they inspired the
nation about as much as a procession of Banquo’s descendants
inspired Macbeth. The strength of the Crown in those days rested wholly
on the character of King George III himself. We should also remember
the fragility and impermanence of the world’s order. Reference
was tellingly made by my noble friend Lord Lang to the position of
Queen Victoria, who was fifth in line of succession at the time of her
birth—a position that then oscillated considerably, as my noble
friend amusingly told us. However, Queen Victoria very nearly did not
inherit. A boy named Hook, out shooting sparrows, sent a shower of
pellets through the window of the house in Sidmouth where the future
Queen and Empress had been taken shortly after her birth. She narrowly
escaped some of the pellets, tearing the sleeve of her nightgown. If
the boy Hook had, by terrible mischance, removed Queen Victoria, that
game of musical chairs over the succession that my noble friend
described would have begun all over again.</hs_para>

it shows that there is a very long list of candidates, which
might even rival that of my noble friend Lord Lang. I do not think that
six is enough and perhaps one day, my noble and learned friend will be
able to explain to me what I seem to remember from my earlier studies

sure that my noble and learned friend will be able to accept it if for
no other reason than that his right honourable friend the Deputy Prime
Minister has indicated that the choice of six was purely arbitrary. My
noble friend has made a strong and powerful case and what struck me
most about his speech was the sheer serendipity of this matter. If this

note that in the period I have studied, families have become rather
smaller; having two or four children seems to be slightly more normal
now. If it is true that the Deputy Prime Minister took six as a purely
arbitrary figure, perhaps it is connected to his belief that 600 is an
appropriate number for MPs in the House along the way. However, I am

head of state of another country with whom perhaps we have less than

interest to the body politic, as well as to the lovebirds concerned, in
such a matter. Therefore, there is reason to consider the matter of

Lord Lang for this amendment, and not least for the way in which he
moved it. Although it was entertaining in many respects, I fully
recognise his points. I am not being disparaging—I enjoyed
his speech. It was a very good speech and his points were
interesting. It is important to point out that none of the people who
were in and out actually ascended the Throne. I take his point, which
is a pertinent one. Reference has been made on more than one
occasion—in another place, too—to the issue of Princess
Victoria, as she was known when she was born, being fifth in line to
the Throne. There has not been a monarch since the 1772 Act who has
been any further out at birth.</hs_para>

my mind was working along similar lines to that of my noble friend
because I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:45:43"></hs_TimeCode> also
asked whether it is worth considering when the provision actually
bites—which, of course, is at the point of marriage. Since the
1772 Act came on to the statute book, the person who was furthest away
from the Throne at the time of consent to a marriage being sought and
given was, indeed, around the same time as my noble friend was talking
about: King William IV was third in line to the Throne when he married
and when he sought and was given consent for his marriage under the
1772 Act. So, in the 240 years since the Act was passed,
William IV has been the furthest away from the Throne at the time of
his marriage. Again, I am not pretending that there is perfection in
this, and I do not believe that a Select Committee could attain
perfection in this either. The proposal for six therefore still allows
a considerable amount of leeway—which is probably not the right
word, but it is the most appropriate word that comes to mind at the
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000436" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0002.htm#13022861000436">It is
important to remind ourselves that a balance needs to be found between
mitigating against catastrophic but remote hypothetical events of a
line being wiped out and the risk of impinging unnecessarily upon the
lives of those who are distant from the Throne. Clearly, my noble
friend Lord Lang would prefer to give greater weight to the former; my
noble friend Lord Northbrook gives greater weight to the other end of
the spectrum. I will not found my argument on that. As three is the
farthest away from the Throne at the time of marriage, I believe that
six is reasonable. This is bearing in mind that, on the other side of

other important point perhaps addresses the point made by my noble
friend about the European Convention on Human Rights. There are two
issues here. First, the European Court of Human Rights has generally
been very reluctant to engage in issues which go to the heart of a
nation’s constitution and who should be their head of state.
Secondly, unlike the 1772 Act, which made a marriage void if the
consent of the Sovereign was not forthcoming, this does nothing so
significant. It simply removes the person from the line of succession
and the marriage will still be valid. It means only that the person who
had not received consent would not take their place in the line of
succession<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:49:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lang asked where the number six arose from. Ahead of the Perth
agreement my right honourable friend the Prime Minister wrote to each
realm Government proposing changes to the law of succession principally
with regard to the removal of male bias and the bar on the heir
marrying a Catholic. At that point the realm Governments were also made
aware of the issues surrounding the Royal Marriages Act and the view of
this Government that it was outdated. Subsequent discussions with the
realm Governments were led by New Zealand which concluded that it was
in the public interest and reasonable and proportionate for those who
are genuinely close to the Throne to seek consent to marry. To avoid
the same problems presented by the Royal Marriages Act in attaching a
monarchical consent requirement to the descendants of a specific
monarch—at Second Reading I think that someone suggested that we
could make it the descendants of George VI rather than George II; that
was thought to store up problems for the future—the number six
was proposed and agreed. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister

consent to this

unable to respond to my noble friend Lord Trefgarne at Second Reading
when he asked whether consent had ever actually been refused
under the 1772 Act. So far as the Government are aware, there has been
no instance when the sovereign’s consent to a royal
marriage has been refused. My noble friend Lord Northbrook
asked in relation to Amendment 14 whether the common law still applies
to monarchical consent in cases such as the remarriage of a dowager
queen. There is a good argument that the 1772 Act replaced all common
law provisions on royal consent to marriages, but it also could be
argued that because the 1772 Act applies to the descendants of George
II, the common law requirement might conceivably still apply to members
of the Royal Family who are not descendants of George II, for example
in the remarriage of a dowager queen or a prince consort. But these
instances would not affect the line of succession and it is important
to recognise that what we are doing here relates only to that. The Bill
is concerned with people who may become the sovereign, not with members
of the wider Royal Family. It has a specific

unanimous voices in this Chamber expressing their support for an
expansion of the number from six. My noble friend Lord Northbrook
offered an alternative of either four or zero. I would live with zero,
but only if the provisions that still require the sovereign to be a

time, since when our Select Committee commented on that and the
Government have changed the pace of the legislation. My anxiety about
this is reawakened by the resolute rejection by my noble and learned

Forsyth of Drumlean:</Member></B> To argue that it did not take up the
time and to try and present this as treating an important
constitutional measure properly is quite unfair. The point is that all
stages of this Bill were 
<?notus-xml column=1249?>carried out over two days in the other place. The conventions have been
that constitutional Bills are dealt with over a proper passage of time
so that people can make points, the Government can think about them and
perhaps even come back with a suggestion for change. By tradition,
constitutional Bills have always been taken on the Floor of the House
of Commons. To try to argue that this Bill was not rushed through the
other place in an untimely manner, with many Members’ speeches
protesting about the way it was handled, is a little
misleading<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T17:06:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in your Lordships’ House that we can go through every amendment
that is within scope and debate it. It helps us to undertake
the scrutiny role which is appropriately ours. I hope that your

then the legislation falls everywhere and will not be implemented in

That is why we have the implementation clause. Even if we pass this the

Elton:</Member></B> My Lords, as this is the realm in which the Queen
is perceived as being principally the head, Supreme Governor, monarch
and the rest of it, presumably the legislation in the other realms and
territories is, in a sense, consequential. Therefore I was a little
surprised to hear that they are already putting things on their statute
books while we have not finalised what we are putting on our statute
book. The question I again ask is: what is the procedure? The timing, I
gather, is terminus ante quem non; there is no time by which we have to
get this done, so the pressure is off. The next question is: what do we
use that time for and how does it impact on the other members of the
Commonwealth and the territories? If we were, for instance, to adopt my
noble friend Lord Lang’s eminently sensible 
<?notus-xml column=1250?>suggestions—or, indeed, the less sensible, in my view,
suggestions of my noble friend Lord Northbrook—would that
require those countries which already had something on the statute book
to adjust it? Or are they simply saying, “We hereby agree with
whatever the United Kingdom Parliament finalises”? It is
difficult to know how all this is negotiated and how that affects our
dealings in the
Chamber<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T17:10:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

helpful. When we come to later amendments, if there is any further
information I can give or anything I
say needs to be corrected, I will do so. Some of the realms
take the view that under their own procedures they require legislation.
It is not for this Parliament to determine what happens in other
countries. At Second Reading I reported that a Bill had already passed
through the lower House in Canada and had been presented in the upper

will stand corrected, and in response to my noble friend Lord

accept that it is unconventional. If this Parliament had decided what
it wished to do and dictated the matter to the other realms—that
have legitimate interest in who is their head of state—it would
not have been consistent with the notion of countries such as Australia
and New Zealand being independent from the United Kingdom. It was
always anticipated that if there were to be a change,
agreement would be reached. However, as I said in an exchange during
the first amendment with my noble friend Lord Trefgarne, it was
important that we sought to get agreement among all the realms and for
the changes to be implemented as appropriate in each country. It would
have been wrong if we had dictated what the terms should
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T17:15:36"></hs_TimeCode>. Considerable

It depends on whether they passed Acts in the parliaments to say that
they would agree to whatever we do or whether they try to enact the
particular provisions. It would be worth the Minister looking at how
they implemented it in Canada or Australia. Did they say, “We
will assent to whatever”, or did they say, “This is what
we are going to do”? For simplicity, I suspect that they may
have gone down the route of saying, “We will assent to whatever
the UK Parliament decides”. If so, it solves the problem; though
the Executive may enter into treaties on behalf of the 
<?notus-xml column=1252?>Crown, it is for Parliament to enact the rules that govern the Executive
and therefore Parliament legislates and forms the principles of these
things. If this were a treaty, I would have said it was then in the
power of the Executive to agree this. If it is not a treaty, it is in
Parliament’s remit to decide what is done. I suggest the
Minister should look at how these countries have enacted it into their
local
laws<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T17:18:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000484" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0003.htm#13022861000484"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Tankerness" PimsId="5278" UID="13022861001138" xid="1977" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0003.htm#13022861001138">Lord

does not change the substance of the agreement but rather seeks to
remove a possible ambiguity. It was circulated among the other realms,
their comments were sought and they were satisfied with
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T17:19:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000485" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0003.htm#13022861000485">With
regard to the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, I understand
different realms are dealing with this in different ways. At least one
of them, I think, is saying that it approves of the law passed by the
United Kingdom Parliament. Others are approving more substantive
legislation, and some that believe no legislation is necessary at all.
It varies, but at the heart of it was an agreement on the
substance—namely, the removal of male bias in terms of
succession to the Throne; the removal of the barrier of the person in
line of succession marrying a Roman Catholic; and the abolition of the
Royal Marriages Act 1772 and its replacement with the
sovereign’s consent for the first six in line. Earlier, in my
response to my noble friend Lord Lang, I indicated that I do not think

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend
Lord Trefgarne for raising an issue which I think he raised at Second
Reading. The effect of his amendment would be to ensure that in no
instance could the sovereign’s consent or otherwise to a royal
marriage be challenged in the courts. It has to be said that over the
240 years when consent has been required, it has not been tested in the
courts. But in the Government’s view the decision, given that it
is a decision taken by the sovereign, could not be challenged in the
sovereign’s courts. We do not believe it to be necessary to
provide for this in the Bill. Indeed, whether the number is six or 12,
it is an unlikely event that someone so close to the Throne would
contemplate such an action. My point is that the decision would be one
made by the sovereign and would not be challengeable in the courts of
the sovereign.</hs_para>

True:</Member></B> My Lords, as I said earlier, is it not the case that
in the early 1830s Augustus d'Este, the son of the Duke of Sussex by a
marriage unapproved under the Royal Marriages Act 1772, did in fact
posit documents in Chancery to challenge the legitimacy of the action?
Furthermore, in 1843 papers were put before the Committee for
Privileges of this House, and the case was heard by this House in 1844.
There is certainly an historic precedent and, as I mentioned in
passing, a challenge. Some of the issues that came up today are perhaps
rather wider than Clause 3. To my mind, this goes to reinforce the
points made by a number of noble Lords about the need for absolute
clarity, and the fortification of what we are doing against potential
challenge in the courts that now

stage the noble and learned Lord may on reflection be able to offer a
more forthright assurance than that which he has been able to give so
far, if I may say so. The fact is that the process for judicial review
in this country is a comparatively new one. It has only been going for
the last 15 or 20 years. Therefore the fact of there being no precedent
is not much of a comfort to the noble and learned Lord, if I may say
so. I would be grateful if he would consider this further before the

the Report stage, because a lot of matters have been raised this

nodding—about which many of us remain either mildly or even
acutely concerned. Some of us would like to have conversations with him
on some of these issues. I hope that there will be time, because the
one thing that has not been made clear during today’s

there will be adequate time between now and Report, and between Report
and Third Reading. I fully appreciate that my noble and learned friend

this group would give us an alternative way of bringing the
Bill’s provisions into force. Amendment 17 slightly overlooks
the point that local parliamentary approval is not necessary in all
realm Parliaments as we have discussed, so it perhaps should not be
taken forward at this stage. However, I am interested in Amendment 16,
because it plays to some of the strands of discussion that we have had
both at Second Reading and today. For instance, the Minister addressed
at Second Reading the issue of whether the Bill was being fast-tracked.
He
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13022861000591" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0003.htm#13022861000591">“I

Constitution Committee was therefore listened to in respect of the time

talked about. It is this point that I am interested in. There is
obviously a case for moving the legislation forward in a way which
minimises any possibility of getting out of sync with the other realms,
and we must have regard to that, but there is another strand, which is
that this is a major constitutional position. We are all, I think,

Houses? I know that it would be more onerous and would involve a little
more time and effort on the part of the Minister and his officials, but
it would mean that we had the evidence that all the other realms had
looked at the Bill properly and considered it. We would have the detail
about which ones had put forward a different or alternative version of
the words—we could check whether exactly the same intent was
being imported by the words being used in those local areas—and
we would have the reassurance that everything had been done, with all

the Executive; it is okay for Ministers to decide things over lunch,

Amendment 17, which I believe is grouped with this one. That is a
slightly separate point, if I may say so. I am picking up the point
that my noble friend Lord Northbrook has made, that the parliamentary
approval process in many of the Commonwealth countries includes a
referendum and is over and above whatever Ministers may have agreed
over lunch, as my noble friend Lord Forsyth put it. The fact is that
parliamentary approval is required in most, if not all, the
Commonwealth countries concerned, and in some of them a referendum is
also required. Presumably that cannot be done 
<?notus-xml column=1258?>overnight, so it would be better if the Bill came into force when all
the Commonwealth countries had consented to it.</hs_para>

would not have to think too tortuously to conceive of a situation at
some future point where the late sovereign’s eldest child in one
country was to be their head of state and the second child, who was a
boy, was head of state of another. That is clearly absurd, so we need
to speak with one voice on this matter as far as the Commonwealth is
concerned. It might therefore be best to wait until they have all
agreed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000515" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0003.htm#13022861000515"></hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_28_PT_1/365D2EDEBDF3DAB60B5E54615F77B6608596EB59" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 February 2013">Thursday,

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, this picks up on some
issues that were debated earlier. I should clarify that the reason why
the Bill specifies the Lord President is that the ministerial
responsibility for constitutional and elections law currently rests
with him. The Privy Council is also involved in constitutional matters.
Indeed, credit should go to my right honourable friend the Prime
Minister because I do not think that my right honourable friend the
Deputy Prime Minister was in Perth. It was not simply a case of
discussing this matter over lunch; it was more than that. I think that
the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, was involved in this issue in a
previous incarnation under the previous
Administration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T17:40:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000517" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0003.htm#13022861000517"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Stevenson of Balmacara" PimsId="5801" UID="13022861001162" xid="2067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0003.htm#13022861001162">Lord

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> The noble Lord may
not have been involved in any lunches but I think that he
was involved in efforts at No. 10 to try to forge some of
the agreements to take this matter forward. That indicates that this
issue did not suddenly emerge at the Commonwealth Heads of Government
conference in Perth, Australia. It was the opportune time, with the
Heads of Government being present, for that agreement to be finalised,
but a considerable amount of work and discussion went on ahead of that.
As I have indicated, the reason why the Lord President is referred to
is due to the current ministerial
responsibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T17:41:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000519" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0003.htm#13022861000519">I
am not wholly unsympathetic to the idea that we might have a subsequent
form of approval, but it is not common for Parliament to approve
commencement orders. This is a commencement order. It is not as if it
is an order that will make amendments to anything or promulgate a new
set of regulations; it simply commences something which Parliament will
already have approved through the proper parliamentary procedures.
Indeed, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, whose
reports the House sets great store by, found no fault with this
provision. Given that this matter has been debated, I wonder what
further steps we could take. The noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, indicated
that there might be an opportunity to reassure both Houses that each of
the realms had done what was necessary under their own provisions. I am
very sceptical about that but it does service to the arguments that
have been put to consider
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T17:42:30"></hs_TimeCode>. We have made
it clear—I must again give this reassurance—that we will
commence

noble friend Lord Northbrook raised the question of referendums. This
was also picked up by my noble friend Lord Trefgarne. My understanding
is that referendums would be necessary in other realms only if they
decided to amend their constitutions. We do not
believe that any realm intends to do so. Officials working
on this legislation do their utmost to try to keep in touch with the
different realms and they have been given no indication by any realm
that it intends to hold a referendum. However, as I indicated to my
noble friend Lord Forsyth on an earlier amendment, I will do my best to
give an update on where each realm is in terms of what process they are
proposing. Perhaps in that context I could helpfully clarify the
position on referendums. However, I emphasise to your Lordships’

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, as I indicated on Second
Reading, the intent is that it should be simultaneous commencement in
each realm and therefore, by definition, it will not be brought into
effect here. Clause 5 will come into effect on the day on which the Act
is passed, but that is the commencement section. Otherwise, that then
gives effect to what else is there in terms of the commencement order.
If there is a material difference we would clearly not be in a position
to commence. I think it was my noble friend who made the point that it
would not be a very satisfactory position if two generations down the
line the Crown went in one direction in one realm and in another
direction in another realm. That is what we are seeking to avoid, that
is why there was such an effort made to reach agreement and that is why
it is important that, in translating that agreement, each realm does
that by whatever means it thinks is appropriate according to its own
procedures. When these are all done and delivering on the agreement has
been reached, the commencement order would be made to ensure that
commencement started simultaneously in each realm, delivering the same
things<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T17:47:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022861000527" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0003.htm#13022861000527"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" PimsId="3285" UID="13022861001170" xid="1225" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-0003.htm#13022861001170">Lord

a material difference to the import or impact of the Bill. I would say
that it was a perfectly sensible, minor adjustment. However, if one of
the other realms, overwhelmed by the power of the argument put by my

VIII’s wives, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, were executed
under this Act. They were alleged to have had sex with others, but the
word “violer” was used, and it was likely that they were

the amendment removes the consequential amendments to the Treason Act
1351, which are necessary to ensure that the Act continues to have
effect, given that the eldest son may not be the heir—in other
words, if there is an older daughter and heir. I understand why my

he has rightly identified that the purpose of the Bill is not to deal

tempted to observe that if all parts of criminal legislation that pass
through your Lordships’ House have such a deterrent effect that
no one offends against it for 600 years, we would be very satisfied.
However, the point is that the purpose is to bring the provisions of
the Bill into effect. It is a purely consequential change. However, I
take the point made by my noble friend. As he is aware, there is more
recent legislation relevant to treason and I have noted that the Law
Commission has treason noted as a “simplification/codification
project”. It will be interesting to see what recommendations it
provides, but I do not think that this is the place to have a more
fundamental review of the treason legislation. If, however, this
legislation is to be on our statute book, it is important that it is

removes the consequential amendments to the Regency Act, which are
necessary to ensure that a person who has married without consent, and
therefore loses their place in the line of succession, is also
disqualified from being regent. I can assure my noble friend that this
consequential amendment is necessary to harmonise the legislation, but
also that there is no mistake in not going further and providing for a
non-Protestant regent. This takes us back to an earlier debate, because
in the Sovereign’s absence, the 
<?notus-xml column=1263?>regent undertakes duties related to the Sovereign’s position as
Supreme Governor of the Church of England and must therefore be a
Protestant. That is what underlies this: it is to ensure that there is

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and
Local Government (Baroness Hanham):</Member></B> My
Lords, this order will enable local authorities to implement localised
council tax support from 1 April when council tax benefit is abolished.
These changes are part of the Government’s wider policy of
decentralisation. The order will amend the Local Authorities
(Contracting Out of Tax Billing, Collection and Enforcement Functions)
Order 1996, which allows local authorities, if they choose to do so, to
contract out statutory services relating to the administration of local
taxes which they would normally have to provide themselves: for
example, the calculation of individual council tax liabilities and the
serving of demand
notices.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000004">New
administrative functions will be created when localised schemes are
implemented. This order will add these new functions to those that can
be contracted out already. The new functions are: the issuing of
council tax reduction decision letters; the payment of reductions in
certain circumstances where the billing authority is of the opinion
that it would be appropriate; the serving of penalty notices in
connection with a reduction; the repayment of an amount paid in
connection with a penalty issued in connection with reductions under
local schemes that has been subsequently quashed; and the calculation
and collection of premiums on long-term empty
dwellings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000005">The
Council Tax Reduction Schemes (Detection of Fraud and Enforcement)
(England) Regulations 2013 deal with the detection of fraud and

regulations are being put forward for approval using powers in Sections
14A, 14B and 14C of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, which were
inserted by Section 14 of the Local Government Finance Act 2012. These
powers allow for the creation of criminal offences, the creation of
civil penalties that may be imposed by local authorities, and
regulations providing powers to require information from individuals or

powers are broad, and noble Lords and Members in the other place
rightly sought assurances from the Government during the passage of the
Bill on how the Government would seek to exercise them. A statement of
intent, <I>Localising Support for Council Tax: Information Sharing and
Powers to Tackle Fraud</I>, was published in July last year and
committed the Government to bringing forward proportionate and measured
proposals that would not go beyond the existing powers relating to
council tax benefit, while replicating only the powers that were
essential in the context of reduction schemes. These regulations are
the result of that commitment, and I shall explain how that has been
translated into specific
provisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000008">Regulation
2 sets out a number of definitions, but noble Lords may wish to note
how we are defining a council tax offence for the purposes of
subsequent regulations. A council tax offence is defined as any
criminal offence committed in making an application for, or in the
award of, a council tax reduction; or an offence committed for the
purpose of facilitating the commission of such an offence; or any
attempt or conspiracy to commit such an offence. It does not include
offences committed for wider purposes related to council tax
administration and enforcement, nor for other criminal offences
committed against a local authority. Noble Lords may wish to bear this
context in mind when examining later regulations that deal with
requiring information and the creation of
offences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000009">Regulation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:05:14"></hs_TimeCode>
3 provides for local authorities to authorise individuals to undertake
investigations into council tax offences. The provisions are equivalent
to those that are currently in place for local authorities to authorise
investigations into housing benefit and council tax benefit cases.

their powers. They may do so

the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, was saying, when services are contracted

information can be provided to a private company or organisation.
I understand that under data protection legislation, the
responsibility would remain with the local authority, but would the
DCLG give any guidance to local authorities on how they may enforce
their responsibilities to organisations to which they have contracted
out those services? What redress would remain available to an

a general point about freedom of information in circumstances where
services have been contracted out or privatised, under a public
authority we regularly read in the press information about the
collection and enforcement of council tax. It is open to public debate;
indeed, we sometimes even see league tables published of how local
authorities have performed. Will that information still be available if
it is held by a private company rather than the local authority?
Clearly it is information that is of interest at
present<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:15:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000029">The
order is relatively straightforward, and those are the only questions
that I have on that.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:16:05"></hs_TimeCode> have a few
questions on the regulations. On the power to require information,
Regulation 4(1)
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13022857000223" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000223">“An

goes on to explain why the information is required. I am not clear
about the phrase “reasonable grounds”. Is there a
definition of the reasonable grounds required for suspecting that
someone has the information?
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:16:34"></hs_TimeCode>What happens if
the evidence required cannot be produced? Although an authorised
officer may have reasonable grounds for suspicion, that does not mean
that the organisation or individual definitely has the information

am also curious about the sanctions for not doing so. Under Regulation
6, headed “Delay, obstruction etc of authorised officer”,
it appears that sanctions apply only to an individual. If the delay,
obstruction 
<?notus-xml column=214?>or refusal is due to the extreme inefficiency of an organisation and not
an individual, are there any sanctions in place? Regulation 6(1) seems
to apply only to an individual not providing information, not to an
organisation. I may be wrong, but that seems very specific. Perhaps the
noble Baroness can explain whether it is my understanding or the
drafting that is not accurate. That would be very helpful. I assume it
is my mistake, although the mistake might lie somewhere else, but from
here it appears that it is only an individual, not an organisation, who
can face

to Regulation 11 concerning a penalty as an alternative to prosecution.
In principle, it is absolutely right and good if legal proceedings can
be avoided, as they are costly and often not the best way of resolving
an issue. I would hope that the Government and all of us would
encourage local authorities to distinguish between a genuine mistake
that a person had made and was keen to rectify as soon as possible and
a deliberate attempt to defraud. A penalty as an alternative to
prosecution should be just that: it should be for an intention to
defraud, not a catch-all for a genuine mistake where there is no clear
evidence to take the matter to court but someone ends up paying a
penalty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:20:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

a person negligently making an incorrect statement or representation or
negligently giving incorrect information or evidence. I am not a
lawyer, but I consulted a lawyer on what “negligently”
would mean in that context. He told me that he could write a book on it
but I wanted only a paragraph. My understanding is that something that
is negligent can indeed be a genuine mistake. Obviously such a mistake
should not be made when dealing with issues such as someone’s
council tax, but I hope that the Minister  
<?notus-xml column=215?>would not want to see the automatic issue of a penalty when a person
might be very upset about making a mistake and want to resolve
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:21:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

clearly very sensible to avoid legal proceedings wherever possible for
all the reasons that I have stated. However, if someone has made a
genuine mistake and they have a genuine defence, they should be able to
receive independent advice regarding their options before accepting a
penalty. I have recently heard of a number of cases where council
officers have been posted at magistrates’ courts, and before a
person goes into the court to offer their defence for not having paid
or for there having been a delay or some other problem they are
encouraged by the council to pay up because, they are told, it could
cost them more to proceed in court. They do not really understand that
they would have a chance to offer their defence in court. Having paid
up, however, they still have to pay more because the case has got as
far as the court. Clearly, the issuing of a penalty before that point
is the right course of action but not if it is used as a catch-all for
dealing with somebody who has made a
mistake<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:22:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000037">If
would be helpful if the Minister could say something about the

to report that to local authorities and not just go ahead. We have had

Lords, there are two elements under these two orders and I wonder
whether I might deal with them both together. The first is the
Gateshead and Northumberland (Boundary Change) Order 2013, and the
other is the East Hertfordshire and Stevenage (Boundary Change) Order
2013. I will talk to them both if that is acceptable to your

Boundary Commission invited local authorities across the country to
tell it whether there were any boundary anomalies that councils
believed should be investigated. The Boundary Commission was prepared
to undertake reviews only where both the affected local authorities
agreed. In essence, only three cases came out of that request, and
these are the final
two.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000053">These
orders are very straightforward; they transfer small areas of land, and
in the case of East Hertfordshire and Stevenage a few houses, from one
local authority to another. The transfer between Northumberland and
Gateshead is basically a case of the transfer of 
<?notus-xml column=218?>one house, which ratifies the position on the ground. The property and
its residents are already registered with Northumberland, although at
present they are not in the county. The first order simply puts that
right. In both cases, the councils concerned agreed that a change is
necessary and supported a boundary change.</hs_para>

explained the statutory framework that allows change and the context
within which boundary change is now being considered. On the statutory
framework, this is the second use of the powers in the Local Government
and Public Involvement in Health Act for boundary change. Under the
legislation, a boundary change can take place between two local
authorities only on the recommendation of the Boundary Commission,
whose responsibility is to give advice to the Secretary of State. In
doing so, it: gathers evidence, for example from the councils involved
and local people; publishes and consults on draft recommendations based
on this evidence; and, once it has considered the representations,
makes final recommendations to the Secretary of State. When considering
whether a change is desirable, the boundary commissioners bear in mind
the statutory criteria that change should lead to effective and
convenient local government and reflect community identities and
interests.</hs_para>

through a property or an estate is unlikely to be convenient to the
property owners, who may have to have dealings with two separate local
authorities: for example for council tax, refuse collection or planning
purposes. While local government will in practice generally put in
place informal arrangements—or indeed make formal agreements to
deal with such situations, as they have done in the case of
Northumberland and Gateshead—the very fact that they need to do
so can be wasteful of resources and not conducive to effective and
convenient local government.</hs_parafo>

moving a boundary and changing the area of a local authority is a
fairly large step to take, particularly when the number of residents
affected is small. We would expect councils to work together to
alleviate the impact of such boundaries. However, we recognise that,

the area of their local authority, to reflect the concerns of local
people it is best to take that further step and amend the

Northumberland, as is the entirety of the gardens and grounds of it and
neighbouring properties. Not unsurprisingly, very few representations
were made, but the county council, the local councillor and the parish

will make exactly the same point that the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, so
eloquently made as to what exactly has been going on over what appears
to be the past 11 months since the consultation ended—on draft
recommendations on which, we are told, there has been no significant
disagreement. It would certainly be of interest to know why there has
been this

should like to pursue—I am not seeking to suggest that it is a
major point because clearly it is not—is that paragraph 8.1 of
the Explanatory Memorandum states that the normal minimum period of
consultation is six weeks. In the case of Gateshead and Northumberland
it was less than six weeks. In fact, it appears to have been about four
weeks, the argument being the small scale of the change. One might have
some sympathy with that argument, but what exactly has been achieved by
reducing the consultation from the normal minimum of six weeks to
somewhere around four weeks? Looking at the timescale, I cannot see
that anything at all has been achieved. I appreciate that it was a
Boundary Commission decision, but does the Minister know why it was
done if it has not speeded things up, or has the Secretary of State
perhaps asked the Boundary Commission why it thought it necessary to
reduce the period of consultation when it does not appear to have been
done in order to speed up the
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:41:21"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Gateshead and Northumberland order, the noble Baroness referred to
those who had responded. However, can she be a bit more specific about
how many people responded to the draft recommendations? No
figures are given, but figures, including a breakdown by
category, are given for the East Hertfordshire and Stevenage order.
Paragraph 7.8 of the Explanatory Memorandum says that the
Gateshead and Northumberland order will affect only two electors. Are
the residents of Ravenside Farm, who were not exactly supportive, the
two electors in Northumberland referred to in paragraph 7.8? If they
are, they are apparently the only ones affected by the Gateshead and
Northumberland order. They did not appear to support it and if they are
the two concerned, I suppose you could say somewhat facetiously that
there was 100% rejection by the electors affected. I do not want to
turn this into a major point, but it would be interesting to
know.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000067">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:29:55"></hs_TimeCode>

are two of those three. However, paragraph 8.3 indicates a measure of
disagreement from the residents of Ravenside Farm, which would appear

touching briefly on the Guaranteed Minimum Pensions Increase Order
2013. This order 
<?notus-xml column=223?>provides for contracted-out defined benefits schemes to increase their
members’ guaranteed minimum pensions that accrued between 1988
and 1997 by 2.2%, in line with inflation as at September
2012.</hs_para>

the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order 2013, I shall start with
the increase in the basic state pension. One of this
Government’s first acts was to restore the earnings link to the
basic state pension. Indeed, we went a step further and secured a
triple lock for pensioners: a commitment from the Government to
increase the basic state pension each year by earnings, prices or 2.5%,
whichever is the highest. This year, that third element of the triple
lock will have an effect for the first time. The basic state pension
will be uprated by 2.5%, a level above both earnings and prices. This
means that millions of pensioners will see an above-inflation cash
increase of £2.70 a week, taking the new level of the basic
state pension to £110.15 a week; and that from April 2013 the
basic state pension is forecast to be around 18% of average earnings, a
higher share of average earnings than at any time in the past
20 years. I can confirm that additional state pensions will
rise in line with inflation at 2.2% in 2013-14, which means that the
total state pension increase for someone with a full basic pension and
an average additional pension will be around £175 a
year.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022857000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000081">On
pension credit, we have taken an important decision to ensure that the
poorest pensioners are able to benefit from the effects of our triple
lock. That means that rather than rising in line with earnings at 1.6%,
the minimum required by legislation, the standard minimum guarantee
credit in pension credit will be increased by 1.9% to ensure that the
poorest pensioners benefit from the full £2.70 cash increase in
the basic state pension.</hs_para>

approach last year, the resources needed to pay for that above-earnings
increase to the standard minimum guarantee have been found by
increasing the savings credit threshold, which means that those with
higher levels of income will see less of an increase. The decisions
that we have taken on pensioners reflect the Government’s belief
that even in exceptional economic times it is important to protect
those who are less able to increase their spending
power.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022857000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000083">However, noble Lords
will also be aware that this order takes forward a number of decisions
that are a lot harder to make. Some tough choices are necessary if we
are to restore our public finances. The working-age welfare budget,
which accounts for about £1 in every £8 that government
spends, cannot be immune from these tough choices. That is why, having
regard to the national economic situation, we have decided that the
working-age personal allowances in jobseeker’s allowance, income
support, housing benefit and employment and support allowance, along
with the work-related activity component of employment and support
allowance, will be uprated by 1% next year. On the same basis, this 1%
uprating will also apply to statutory maternity pay, statutory
paternity pay, statutory adoption pay and statutory sick pay. This will
save around £200 million in 2013-14, savings that are
crucial as we continue to pay down the deficit.</hs_para>

decisions lightly. Wherever we have been able to do so, we have sought
to protect those who have the greatest difficulty increasing their
spending power. The benefits that reflect the additional costs that
disabled people face will be uprated in line with inflation. These
include disability living allowance, attendance allowance, the
disability premiums in working-age benefits, and the support component
of the employment and support allowance. This is true of the
carer’s allowance and the carer premium as well, both of which
will be uprated in line with
inflation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:55:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

this week I have spoken of the need to strike a balance. At a time of
great economic difficulty we have had to find savings, but we have
sought to balance these with key protections wherever we can. This
order is also about balancing our commitment to the here and now with
our commitment to the long term. We have a responsibility to the next
generation to secure a stable and growing economy, and I do not believe
we can achieve that without taking these difficult decisions. Of
course, we have a responsibility to those who will be affected by this
order today, and we take that responsibility
seriously<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:56:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000086">It
is worth noting that at a time when the nation’s finances remain
under real pressure, through this order the Government will be spending
an extra £2.8 billion in 2013-14 as part of our drive to ensure
that the people who are least able to change their incomes are
protected against increases in the cost of living. Of that £2.8
billion, about £2.1 billion is for the state pension, including
an above-inflation increase for the basic pension. Nearly £500
million will go to disabled people and their carers, and nearly
£300 million will go to people of working age. I believe that

add my welcome to the triple-lock pensions increase that has been put
into this measure again, and as the Minister has indicated, using 2.5%
as the third trigger—the third lock that is being used for the

is interesting from the information that has been presented to us, and
from my noble friend’s introductory comments, is that from April
2013 the basic state pension will be about 18% of average earnings. I
have two points to make about that. First, it is a higher percentage
than at any time in the past 20 years; and, secondly, it is
only 18%. Recent research conducted by the pensions industry indicates
that many people approaching retirement say that they need 50% of their
average earnings—that is the rough figure they say they
need—and they believe that they will get 50%, which in the
nature of these things is obviously not true at
present<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:59:02"></hs_TimeCode>. It
demonstrates the importance of the new flat-rate pension and that
auto-enrolment will be decisive in helping people to meet their own
aspirations for retirement. However, in 
<?notus-xml column=225?>the interim, the pension credit increase in line with the triple lock,
as opposed to average earnings, goes a little way to helping
Britain’s poorest
pensioners<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T14:59:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000090">I
turn now to the uprating by 1% of all benefits apart from those
protected because of disability or age. I still find that the issue of
personal allowances indicates that there is an underpinning rationale,
which has not yet been fully demonstrated to me, in having the personal
allowance element of the employment support allowance being the same
personal allowance that applies for housing benefit and anything else.
Can my noble friend the Minister first outline why those personal
allowances have to be the same for each allowance? It interests me to
know what the rationale is behind

Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to follow my
noble friend and concur with everything that he said. I have been doing
uprating statements since 1984, I think, and I am here this afternoon
really because I did not want to miss one. I have the boxed set, so I
would feel that I was in the wrong place if I was not here. However,
and this is me in my moaning mood, in the old days when men were men
and women were women these debates were really big parliamentary
occasions. These are huge sums of public money that we are considering
this afternoon. This is no reflection on the Government at all, because
while it is a question for the whole House I do not think that if we
held this debate on the Floor of the Chamber there would be many more
people here. I cannot help but say that it is a shame that we do not
have more concern or attention from other colleagues albeit on what I
accept is a ritual.</hs_para>

important annual debate, but this year it is different. My noble friend
explained some of the differences, and I want to explore them a little
more deeply, because, both qualitatively and quantitatively, these
orders are different from any I have seen before. I make it clear that
the Government are absolutely entitled, under the rules of the game as
I understand 
<?notus-xml column=226?>them, to make these reductions against an economic background that we
can all see. I am obviously not going to move against these orders,
particularly in the context of the uprating Bill, which is in front of
the House, but we are in exceptional circumstances. There is therefore
a case for the Government to say, “For the next 12 months,
Britain is a poorer nation and we all have to make a contribution
towards getting back on to a steady state”. My point is that I
am not confident that we will get back to a steady state for a number
of years. I am not an economist and I do not know, but I really believe
that the paradigm has changed and that we will all be forced to face up
to the circumstances. That may be supporting the Government’s
case more than I am accustomed to do, as the Minister might
say.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022857000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000094">The
point I want to make on the back of that is that if we are in different
circumstances, if I can use the analogy of discretionary housing
payments, if the Government are saying that the housing benefit changes
are so profound that there have to be mitigating short-term
time-limited emergency procedures to take the sting out of them for
low-income families, we may be forced to think about an equivalent
emergency package for low-income households if year after year we find
that we do not get back to trend levels of growth. I think that in
future uprating debates we are going to be forced to look very
carefully not only at adjusting the levels down but in addition at ways
of getting behind people who are really at the end of the financial
road. They have no scope.</hs_para>

Government have recognised the plight of pensioners, and the rationale
for that is understandable. My noble friend mentioned it: they have
limited ways of increasing their earnings. The Government’s
suggestion is that working-age households always have the option of
work, but I wonder how realistic that is. If we are seeing food banks
develop to the extent to which I fear they may develop in future in
local communities, I think as legislators we will have to reflect that
rather than just assuming that we are in a steady state and that the
Government can take those savings out year after year. We might all
need to think about how we tackle this. Part of that might be
exceptional measures for low-income households.</hs_para>

administration and regulation of payday loans. The statement from the

payday loans. Working families take advantage of them. I am not against
payday loans. Short-term unsecured credit has a role to play. I do not
think it is regulated properly, but that is a different argument. These
are working-age families. In my estimation, these levels of increase
are not going to  
<?notus-xml column=227?>get any less any time soon. I recognise that something has to be done
with the deficit reduction, but we may need to have a grown-up
discussion about this across the parties and across Parliament to make
sure that we are not ignoring what is happening in a lot of our
challenged communities, particularly in the old social-rented council
estates of my native Glasgow, for example, where I know that some these
changes that we are introducing on top of everything else that is
happening will produce levels of financial challenge for particular
groups. Lone parent families are one group that I particularly care

it is something I would ask about—the impact of this uprating
order on child poverty. What assessment, if any, have the Government
made of this

poverty more generally? What do they think about the food banks, which
are growing up in our country at the moment? One opened in Lewisham,

have heard about the basic state pension and the much lauded triple
lock—the highest of earnings, prices or 2.5%, in this case. We
have no difficulty with the basic state pension having been a higher
share of average earnings for some time, although is that not largely
because average earnings are so depressed because of the state of the
economy? My right honourable friend Stephen Timms in the other place
dug away at the triple lock, saying that it is certainly a success in
terms of rhetoric but that its practical implications have been much
more limited. He knew of one that was not operated because RPI gave a
better result, and in year 2 inflation was used. It was only in year 3
that the 2.5% kicked in, in excess of inflation. On the old basis of
uprating by RPI in those latter two years, the award would have been
higher<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:14:43"></hs_TimeCode>. Perhaps

again from the Minister the repeated assertion that those who face
additional costs because of their disability, and who perhaps have less
opportunity to increase their income through paid employment, will see
their benefits increase by the full value of CPI. As the noble Lord,
Lord German, alighted on, this is not entirely true. It is true to a
limited extent only for people in the support group who have the
support component uprated by inflation, but it is not true of the
personal allowance. The noble Lord raised an important question: what
is the rationale for having that personal allowance standard throughout
the system? It might be arithmetically comforting, but in its impact on
people there seems to be no great rationale for it.</hs_para>

short-term benefit that they would come out of and get into work. I do
not think that is the basis on which it was introduced. It was
certainly seen as a benefit for people who were not deemed currently
fit for work but who could engage in work-related activity and could be
moved closer to the labour market. I do not believe that the concept
that it was essentially a short-term benefit featured in its
introduction in Parliament, in which the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, and

with the original legislation at this end. If that is the assertion and

those that are restricted to 1% in the uprating Bill, other than the

addition, can we have some detail on costings? Comparing 1% with what
would have been CPI, can we hear from the Government what savings they
are anticipating next year from restricting uprating separately to SMP,
paternity pay, adoption pay and SSP? What are the figures for the
subsequent two years, taking account of inflation at OBR forecast
levels? Also, can we have the costings in respect of the personal

attracted by the concept that we have lower levels of benefit because
the very poor and disadvantaged can have some supplementary cash to
help. In a sense that has been the Government’s approach when
they have hacked away at things such as the benefit cap or housing
benefit, and with the underoccupation provision and putting aside a bit
of money or discretionary housing payments to placate and help a few

move to some of the points raised in the wider debate. My noble friend
Lord German talked at some length about pensions and welcomed the
triple lock and its effect this year. He noted that it would now be 18%
of average earnings—the highest for 20 years—but that
there was evidence to suggest that some people would need more as they
neared retirement age, and worryingly thought they would get it. I do
not have an immediate response to that, but as he acknowledged, it is
one of the reasons why it is important that we are taking steps towards
the single tier and auto-enrolment. While these measures will not

we are on the pensions issue, the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, referred
to the triple lock. He was trying to question whether it was really as
beneficial as we believe. I am surprised that he raised that question.
It has delivered this year. As I said, it has come into effect for the
first time and is above inflation and earnings. As he knows, it has
been the policy of successive Governments to use the inflation figures
of the previous September to determine the rates for the following
year. We have done nothing other than what all Governments do, which is
to use the September figures. The September figures were 2.2%
inflation, and that is why we introduced the triple lock this year: so
pensioners have benefited. That is a good thing and we are pleased
about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:24:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000114" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000114">My
noble friend Lord German asked a question that he said he had asked
earlier this week, when we were debating the Bill, about the
consistency of personal allowances across the various benefits. That
was echoed by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie. I can do no more than
restate what I said when were debating this then. Personal allowances
across income-related benefits for working-age people create the basis
for the way our current benefits form a consistent means test across
the income-related benefits. If we were to treat different benefits
differently in terms of their personal allowances, there would be no
clear level of income at which state support via income-related
benefits is set and at which access to other help, such as prescription
charges or free school meals, would be available across a wide range of
services. At a time when we are trying to simplify the welfare system,
it would seem strange to introduce an additional layer of complexity
for those who are seeking to use the benefit system and for the way we
operate it because that would attract additional
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000115" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000115">My
noble friend Lord German also asked about guidance and leaflets that
are issued to pensioners. Benefit recipients and pensioners are
notified of their new provisional rates following the announcement of
those rates by the Minister for Pensions in his Oral Statement. That
needs to happen over a number of months because of the volume of
notifications and because we need to make an advance claim to basic 
<?notus-xml column=231?>state pension. It is useful for recipients to have early notification of
provisional rates, and it has been the practice for some
time.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022857000116" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000116">The

however many years. I hope I do not disappoint him. This is my first,
so I have a lot of catching up to do. He made the point that these
orders are different from anything that he had seen before, but he
acknowledged the economic conditions that we are in and that they are
an important reason why we are in a different situation from that of
previous uprating statements that he has contributed to. He asked what
might happen for people who are exceptionally poor or who might over
time be affected in ways that at this stage we may not be able to
anticipate. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, echoed some of that in his
remarks.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022857000117" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000117">I

changes are being made that will have an effect on child poverty. For
example, the introduction of universal credit is expected to lift up to
250,000 children out of poverty. There are varying ways of looking at
its impact on child poverty. We want to make sure that it is done in

McKenzie, asked about the 1.5 million pensioners who will see a loss
from the savings credit measures. The pass through to the triple lock
is a cost-neutral measure: 1 million people gain an average of 50
pence. They are the poorest pensioners, but as this is cost neutral
some will obviously see a smaller cash increase. One and a half million
pension 
<?notus-xml column=233?>credit claimants will see this smaller cash increase, which is on
average about 35 pence. We have done this to provide protection for the
poorest pensioners and ensure that they see the cash increase from the
triple lock. As I said at the beginning, my main point here is that
this order ensures that the poorest pensioners receive the proper
entitlement to that triple lock and get its full benefit. As I have
said, I will respond to any outstanding questions that I have not

conclusion, my main point is that this uprating order is one for the
long term, but it is critical to have regard to those who will be
affected by the order today, and we have done that. I have already
explained that we are spending an extra £2.8 billion on uprating
pensions and benefits in 2013-14, enabling us to protect key benefits
and vulnerable groups, but we are also taking decisions that will
matter to all families in the years to come. Those decisions will help
us to secure a better economy and a better future for everyone. That is
something which I hope all noble Lords can support and it is on that
basis that I commend these orders to the Committee.</hs_para>

NEST was established to support automatic enrolment. It is a
trust-based, occupational pension scheme, and the NEST order and
non-statutory rules act in the same way as a trust instrument. The NEST
order was set in March 2010 
<?notus-xml column=234?>and NEST has been operational since July 2011. Like any other pension
scheme, occasionally NEST’s operating framework will need
adjusting. Since 2010, there have been a number of changes to automatic
enrolment legislation which impact on the order. In addition, live
running of NEST has highlighted that some provisions in the order are
unclear or do not operate as intended. The changes in this order were
requested by the NEST trustee. They will allow NEST to focus on its key
remit: to support automatic enrolment and provide clarity to employers
and members who use
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000131" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000131">I shall
now summarise the changes. To give smaller employers more time to
adjust, we have extended the staging period for implementing automatic
enrolment. We are therefore extending the period during which NEST has
discretion to defer admitting self-enrolling members—for
example, the self-employed—until 1 March 2018. This will enable
NEST to focus on helping employers to meet their automatic enrolment
duty.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022857000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000132">We have
removed the duty for employers to automatically enrol jobholders who
are also qualifying persons as defined by the Occupational Pension
Schemes (Cross-border Activities) Regulations 2005. However, NEST is
not able to decline contributions from a member who, because of a
change in circumstances, later becomes a qualifying person. It could be
costly to accept contributions from a qualifying person. This would
require NEST to ensure that it met the pension regulations of another
EEA state. It is important that NEST remains a low-cost scheme for its
target market, so this order allows NEST to decide whether to continue
to accept contributions in respect of members who become qualifying
persons or qualifying self-employed persons.</hs_para>

may want to cease participating in NEST, for example, when an employer
changes pension provider. This order allows employers to terminate
their participation in NEST and includes a consequential amendment to
the definition of participating employer. Members admitted through
employers are not required to sign terms and conditions. NEST is
obliged to admit self-employed individuals to membership, but the order
requires them to sign terms and conditions. We are therefore removing
this requirement to bring the admittance process into line with other
members.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022857000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000134">The
current description in the order of who can contribute to a
member’s account is unclear. We are making an adjustment to that
description to ensure contributions from third parties—for
example, a member’s relative—will be accepted. We do not
want to place unnecessary burdens on employers to process refunds of
contributions not made through payroll, so this order allows the
trustee to refund third parties or members directly.</hs_para>

contributions, all contributions made by an employer count towards the
annual contribution limit. Where a member of NEST has multiple jobs,
NEST must accept minimum contributions from each employer. The quality
requirement in Section 20 of the Pensions Act 2008 sets minimum
contributions, which are currently 8% of earnings between roughly
£5,500 and £42,500. Regulations now also allow for an
alternative quality requirement, known as certification. The minimum
contribution under the alternative 
<?notus-xml column=235?>requirement is one of 9% of basic pay, 8% of basic pay where basic pay
is at least 85% of total earnings taken in aggregate, or 7% of total
earnings. This order makes it clear that minimum contributions capture

benefits, I am sure that noble Lords will understand the importance of
NEST being able to respond quickly to pay benefits to a deceased
member’s closest relations. The order removes the requirement
for the trustee to consider next of kin as strictly defined by rules
applicable in England and Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland. Like
other schemes, it allows the trustee to decide to whom to distribute

have an interest in the sense that I am relating my question to the
technical change removing the requirement for the trustee to consider

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
introducing this order and I say upfront that we will be supporting it.
Perhaps I may revert to an item touched upon by the noble Lord, Lord
German, which I was going to raise in our previous debate concerning
people’s expectations of pensions, the importance of
auto-enrolment and certainly the importance of NEST as a key component
of that. When the Turner commission looked at the prospect of
auto-enrolment and how employer pensions were to be organised in
future, I think that the criteria around contribution levels and the
band of earnings to which they applied were struck so that over a
working lifetime the required level of replacement earnings would be
produced. I am bound to say that with what has happened to the band of
earnings, contribution levels have not shifted. I have not seen an 
<?notus-xml column=236?>update of that calculation and I do not know whether there is
one—I think that it is an adjunct to this order—but if
there is, it would be interesting to see
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:49:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

one or two questions in respect of some of the detail. We understand
why the discretionary period to allow self-enrolling members to be
accommodated is necessary, but can the Minister update us on the
current elongated process for enrolment? I do not have that fully in my
mind. What is the position of new self-enrolling members at the end of
that period? Do they have an unfettered right to enrol? Perhaps we can
use this occasion, given that NEST has been up and running for a little
while now, although with regard to auto-enrolment larger employers are
involved first, to find out whether we have any early numbers for the
employers and employees who are
enrolled<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:50:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000142" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000142">We
support the lifting of the obligation dealing with cross-border
obligations and the other essentially technical amendments. I have a
small point on terms and conditions. The Minister said that the
proposed change would mean that self-enrolment individuals, as others,
do not have to agree to members’ terms and conditions, so what
is the purpose of those conditions? What relevance do they
have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:50:49"></hs_TimeCode>? As for
multiple jobs, again we support the change that has been outlined, but
what is the position on multiple jobs within the same employer group?
There is a maximum of 4,400 but, if that can be exceeded and there can
be multiple jobs, are there any constraints if those multiple jobs are
within the same group, possibly on a specifically organised basis to
circumvent the

probably have to write to the noble Lord on many of his queries. This

year. We estimate that by the end of staging it will have 2 million to
4 million members and 750,000 participating employers. To the end of
January, NEST has more than 200 participating employers, around 45,000

requirement for NEST to have to consider next of kin is in line with
the Administration of Estates Act 1925. In Scotland, a person is
entitled to moveable estate on intestacy. These are very specific; the
change allows NEST to determine who to pay survivor benefits to. The

the order<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:54:15"></hs_TimeCode>. On
why the trustee’s discretion to pay survivor benefits is
applicable to pots only under £5,000, the Administration of

disposed of on death without the necessity for probate or other proof

to him about. In the hope that this answer will mean a shorter letter,
if not another letter, the qualifying earnings band is from about
£5,500 to about £42,500. A revision order has been laid
in draft and will be debated shortly. The noble Lord is correct in

of the level of replacement income for somebody about to retire. There

there were any constraints on minimum contributions within the same

limit could not result in contributions that are less than those

Lucas:</Member></B> My Lords, it has been widely acknowledged that we
have a problem as a nation with the quality of the teaching of
vocational subjects in further education. The most recent example and
proof of that has been Ofsted’s refusal to grant outstanding
status to any FE college, although I believe there is one going through
the process now. I am being told that it got it, which is wonderful.
That news had not reached me. It would certainly be a first, and a very
welcome first. So we know that we need to improve the quality of our
vocational education
teaching.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000154" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000154">Vocational
education is not an easy thing to teach. There are demands for a
high-quality outcome. Most of these courses are intended to produce
someone who will be an employee or craftsman of high quality, and we
need a high-quality system and a high-quality foundation to get them
there. That is why I am very pleased to be able to draw attention to
this report from the City &amp; Guilds Centre for Skills Development. I
declare an interest as a member of its advisory board. By foundation, I
mean not the main foundation, but one of the stones in the foundations
of a high-quality vocational education system because we ought to base
the way that we are teaching vocational education on a sound pedagogy,
on a sound theory of how vocational education is best
taught.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000155" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000155">I find
this document extremely readable and lucid. It is just a beginning.
From here, it will go on to be discussed with employers and teachers.
It will find its way through a process that is at educational rather
than political speeds, so I suspect that it will take a year or two to
get to the point where it is not just a theory of vocational pedagogy
but a practice and something with some well consulted
background.</hs_para>

I draw particular attention to page 47 of the report, which looks at
the structure of the outcomes that one is aiming for from a well
organised vocational pedagogy. It looks at the skills that one would
expect a plumber to have, starting with routine expertise. It states
that, if a boiler requires an annual service, the
plumber,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13022857000237" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000237">“is
familiar with the make and model and runs through a routine process of
checks to ensure the boiler is safe and working
properly”.</hs_quotefo>

plumber requires resourcefulness because the boiler may be exhibiting
some strange symptoms. You want the person who has passed out of a
vocational course, once they have tried the obvious solution, to
consider alternative courses, to think carefully about what they might
be, to investigate and to try alternatives. One also wants the plumber
to have what you might call “functional literacies” so
that they can handle language and interpolate between technical
language and the level of comprehension of clients, so they do not just
spout jargon at customers but can explain in their language what is
wrong with their boiler and what needs
doing.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13022857000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000157">We
want craftsmanship, which we often look for in vain. It is such a
delight when one comes across a builder who really cares about what he
has done, who takes joy and pleasure in a job well executed and in
having done something right that will last. That is going beyond just
doing the job; it is being able to do something relatively simple and
routine a great number of times and still take pleasure in a job well
done at the end. It is a matter, too, of business-like attitudes: to
have a proper relationship with the client and know that he has often
relied on your assistance; to do something little free of charge; and
to build a long-term relationship. Beyond that, people need to develop
wider skills and resilience to build on their qualifications to go
further in their career, to have determination to refuse to give in, to
know how to look for resources beyond their own immediate understanding
and to consult colleagues, carry out research and look
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000158" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000158">When
we think of what we would like the plumber who calls round to look
after our boiler to be, that is a pretty good set of ambitions to have
for a trained plumber, and a pretty good set of resources and
qualifications for a plumber to have. Based on that, you can hope for a
secure life if you choose to stay as a plumber, or if you want to go
beyond it, you have learnt a lot of skills that will apply elsewhere.
One could read through that list and think that it applies pretty well
to a Minister and to many other professions. Indeed, one could say that
it would apply pretty well to school education, although not in the
context of a particular
skill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000159">This
research has led to a good place. It resonates for me as the right
answer. It obviously needs polishing and working through with employers
to make sure that they recognise the skill sets that they would hope to
have, with teachers to make sure that what is being said is teachable
and workable, and indeed, with customers. It cannot hang as a piece of
research on its own but needs to be worked at and enriched over the
next year or two to produce a thoroughgoing basis on which to build a
very high-quality system of vocational education. I am looking for the
Minister’s supportive interest and hope that she will say that
this is an initiative that the Government support and to which they
will continue to pay attention. I want them to keep up communications
about their own thoughts on this so that it does not go wandering off
in a different direction from the one with which they feel comfortable.
I feel confident of receiving that, not least because I know the
Minister’s background in this area. I hope that she will have
sympathy with it. I beg to

the report now two or three years old from Alison Wolf on vocational
education and training, she drew attention to the fact that we have
getting on for 2.5 million young people aged 16 to 19 who are going
through vocational education of one sort or another. In this country,
we give a lot of attention to those who achieve GCSEs A to C, and we
measure to some extent the success of our educational system by the
proportion of the young people who achieve at least five and, moving
forward, six GCSEs A to C, including English, maths and science. What
we often fail to recognise is that something like 40% of young people,
and often more, fail to achieve GCSEs and in fact follow the vocational
pathway. They go on and often achieve quite highly in other respects
through the vocational pathway. The Wolf report made it quite clear
that these vocational programmes, if well taught, are for those young
people not only a more satisfying preparation for employment and life
than the GCSE and A-level route but for the country they are extremely
necessary in raising productivity and meeting our skills
deficit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000162" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000162">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:12:43"></hs_TimeCode>
put emphasis on the words, “if well taught”. The issue of
the quality of teaching and learning in vocational education came to me
during the making of the report that I chaired, sponsored by NIACE, the
157 Group and the Association of Colleges, in looking at the role of FE
colleges and their communities. That particular report picked up in
many senses the same issues as this one—namely, that FE colleges
have new flexibilities. An element of deregulation has taken place, and
they now have much greater flexibility to decide on their own courses.
One aspect of this is the need for these colleges to be seen to serve
their communities, in two senses. One is that the student body
represents the community, and colleges must do the best that they can
for that student body. Secondly, if they are to do the best that they
can, it is important to train those young people for the jobs available
in their communities. Therefore, there must be a very close liaison not
only<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:13:52"></hs_TimeCode> with the
employers in their communities but with the other public sector bodies
in their communities, such as hospitals and the police
force.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000163">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:14:59"></hs_TimeCode>
became clear, as we wrote that report and talked about the potential of
colleges to provide a degree of leadership within those communities
that we needed to look at a new pedagogy. The changing circumstances of
further education and adult education in this world require us to look
again at the whole body of teaching and what goes on there. So we need
high-quality 
<?notus-xml column=241?>teaching and learning that moves with the times. That is why this report
from the City &amp; Guilds centre is extremely useful to have. It gives
us a template on which to build and think about a new
pedagogy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:15:02"></hs_TimeCode>. In
itself, it does not really provide us with the pedagogy as such. The
noble Lord, Lord Lucas, drew attention to the diagram on page

one learns from this is that vocational education needs to be taught
within the context of practical problems. It is best when it is
hands-on, practical, experiential and real world. It involves
feed-back, questioning and reflection, and the application of
theoretical as well as practical
explanations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:15:38"></hs_TimeCode>. It
needs tried and tested teaching methods—learning by watching,
learning by imitating, learning by practising, and trial and error in
real world situations, feed-back, conversations, listening,
transcribing, critical thinking, drafting and
sketching<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:15:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000165" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000165">Picking
up on the need to consider the world of vocational education and
training within the changing context that we face, we must also
consider the role of the internet and the increasing use of distance
learning and social media. One of my commissioners was very concerned
about the curriculum, in which pedagogy played quite a part. Sally
Dicketts, the principal of the Oxford and Cherwell Valley College said
that we need a curriculum that is any time any where.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:16:45"></hs_TimeCode> is a vital
subject. OECD recently produced a report on the UK remarking, once
again, on low levels of productivity. It identifies three key issues as
influencing productivity: first, and above all, investment in
infrastructure; secondly, investment in R&amp;D; and, thirdly, once
again, investment in education and training. The deficit lies in
training in vocational areas up to level 3 and level 4. It is
absolutely crucial to our future and vital for productivity and growth
in the UK that three-year apprenticeships to level 3 and the skills
required at HND level should be taught
well.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_28_PT_1/DFB1652E48979FA4793E783803C0743CB53848E9" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 February 2013">Thursday,

Lingfield:</Member></B> My Lords, I add my thanks to those of the noble
Baroness, Lady Sharp, to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, for initiating
this debate about a sector which is too often the Cinderella sector of
education and on which, however, we shall rely, if our economy is to
grow again, for the creation of a technically accomplished workforce
for the future, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, mentioned. I pay
tribute to the noble Baroness because her work in further education is
much admired throughout the
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000167">I,
too, declare an interest as a fellow of the City &amp; Guilds of London
Institute and as chairman of the Government’s review,
<I>Professionalism in Further Education</I>, which was published late
last year. This was conducted against the background of the
Government’s policy of giving as much autonomy as possible to FE
institutions, be they in the public or private sectors. I give my
earnest thanks to those professionals who comprised the panel that sat
with me and to the many who gave evidence to us throughout that
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000168">It is
impossible in the short time that we have to comment on all the
findings of the review and how they touch on the work of the City &amp;
Guilds, which I much admire. However, one that is hugely important 
<?notus-xml column=242?>concerns the occasional difficulties caused by the current funding
system which requires FE institutions to work with at least two
agencies—the Skills Funding Agency and the Education Funding
Agency. It would be preferable, in my view, for post-compulsory
education to be seen as more distinct—I know that not everyone
will agree—from secondary education policy and
procedures.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022857000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000169">At the moment, FE
providers are often undergoing mission drift. One of the reasons is the
easier availability of grant funding for courses for the under-18s as
opposed to older vocational students. In my view, a review is necessary
to remove these unintended distortions from the system and to look
forward to a single post-compulsory funding system with an aim of
giving the highest quality of vocational education to all, whatever age
they may be. I firmly believe that it is right to give the managers of
our FE providers as much independence as possible. They are the
professionals on the spot and they deserve the authority to match their
great responsibilities. Only they should set the spending priorities of
their colleges and decide the age groups which they feel will most
benefit from available funds, free of central bureaucratic controls and
constrictions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000170">However,
autonomous institutions have to have touchstones of quality against
which they must measure themselves, and I welcome the
Government’s acceptance that there should be created a royal
chartered body to which colleges and other providers can apply for
corporate membership. They would be admitted on criteria concerned with
the high quality of their pedagogy, their governance, their financial
management, their results in the qualifications that they offer to the
young people and their response to the autonomy on which the
Government’s policy is currently founded. Institutions admitted
would thus enhance their status and perhaps earn the freedom from
inspection already granted to a few—a very few, as we have
heard—outstanding colleges. It seems to me essential that the
credibility of such a royal chartered body and its potential to raise
the professional standing of all who teach in its member institutions
will be secured by eventually placing it at arm’s length from
government, for it will need to be both professionally authoritative
and independent. It will need to take into important account the words
to me last year of a young FE lecturer. He said, “I have two
interwoven careers to develop: first, I am a teacher and I want to
learn the very best pedagogical techniques to let me enable my students
to learn at the highest level. But, as importantly, I am an automotive
engineer and I want to ensure that I keep absolutely up to date in
current practices. It is no good being a good teacher if I am teaching
the mechanical techniques of five years ago”. This is touched
on, on page 25 of the City &amp; Guilds report. It is hugely important
and I hope that central to the mission of institutions in membership of
the proposed royal chartered body will be a total commitment to the
professional updating and development of their
staff.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000171" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000171">Further
education, as the City &amp; Guilds report implies, is the most
diversified of our sectors and that is one of its strengths, but it
also can be one of its weaknesses, for, as we have heard, it is
estimated that it deals with some 3 million students each year studying

<?notus-xml column=243?>for an incredible 17,000 or so vocational awards. Alas, such a plethora
is rarely understood by students and particularly not by employers.
Some clear rationalisation is needed and, in my view, we need the
establishment of a simple set of high-quality benchmark qualifications
readily understood and valued by
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000172" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000172">My review

Addington:</Member></B> My Lords, when I saw that this debate had been
tabled, I initially put my name down for one reason—to have a
slightly more detailed dig about the development of, for instance,
those with special educational needs and their way into further
education. That was as a result of my experience of dealing with the
new apprenticeships and the problems there associated with dyslexia,
although apparently there are problems with dyslexia in other sectors
as well. However, as I started to read through the report, I was also
convinced that I should put my name down to speak because of the use of
the term “coaching”. I know rather more about
coaching in relation to sport than I do about coaching in relation to
any aspect of further education, but I appreciated that it was a new
way of learning and one that I knew something about. It involves a
different process of imparting and using knowledge and teaches people
how to apply that
knowledge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000174" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000174">My
noble friend Lord Lucas started with examples of trying to make
training appropriate. The example we use in the documentation is a
plumber. You take information, you approach how it is integrated and
you go back and through. My very distant noble kinsman Lord Lingfield
spoke about keeping people up to date, making sure the information is
ongoing and how to learn and approach others. This approach is more
appropriate for people who are not really designed for being in a
classroom receiving facts and figures, which surely must be one of the
primary differences between further education and the schoolroom. The
connection between the two and acknowledging that there are differences
between them is a very positive step forward. You create a different
learning process to which those who have not enjoyed school or had
great success there will find themselves more open, particularly if
this different approach is explained to those on entering
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000175" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000175">The
briefing for this debate mentioned the Wolf review. I became less happy
with aspects of it, particularly going back to the insistence on GCSE
passes when we brought in apprenticeships under the previous
Government. I remember hearing that employers want people who can pass
English and maths, but they also want people who do not put in for
overtime, do not have time off, do not have children who get sick and
so on. They really want people who will turn up and work for nothing;
they have no right to expect that. They have the right to expect
somebody who will able to do the job at least competently, who has a
decent 
<?notus-xml column=244?>approach to what is coming next and who will not be rude to clients and
fellow workers. That is what they have a right to expect.</hs_para>

Guilds has done good work, it is one of the bodies I had disagreements
with. I discovered considerable resistance to the idea that you could
change the way exams are taken. It had to catch up with the fact that
the rest of the education system acknowledges things such as dyslexia,
dyspraxia and dyscalculia and allows people to take qualifications and
different ways forward. One example of that is telling people that they
cannot have differently formatted online exams for security reasons. It
might be a bad thing if somebody gets hold of the answers in advance,
but it is not a nuclear strike. Other examination bodies, such as
universities and GCSE and A-level boards, manage this process
consistently and have done so for years. How are we going to make sure
that the further education sector gets itself more up to date on taking
on a mass group and giving meaningful qualifications, and how you let
those people
in?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000177" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000177">The groups
that I am talking about should be over-represented in the general
population in this process of education. Let us take dyslexia, which is
the biggest group; it affects 10% of the population. The first example
I saw of somebody failing in a skill that requires using your hands due
to what was key skills then—it is functional skills
now—was a hairdresser who had won an award but could not pass
the English assessment. You can get a degree with dyslexia by using
assistive software. It is available for free on the phone I have on the
desk in front of me; that is how common it is. I draw attention to my
interests in the fields of both technology and dyslexia, but they are
both predated by my interest in this subject—or my interest in
the subject predates them. I am sure that <I>Hansard</I> will have fun
with
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000178" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000178">However,
the further education sector has to grow up and become part of the
mainstream about bringing these groups in. It has not done very well as
a starting point. If we could hear from my noble friend that she can
build on what she said at Question Time today about making sure that
they all take on board the fact that they must bring in these people, I
would be a much happier person. This was not a confrontation I looked
for and it was one which I thought would be over and done with by now.
I have on one occasion had a Minister of State shouting at officials,
“Sort it out, it’s ridiculous”. That was nearly 18
months ago. There does not seem to be an embracing of the fact that we
have a legal framework that says that those with hidden disabilities
should be brought into the mainstream. They should not be left on the
side.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000179" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000179">We do
not want to create a situation where more people find greater
difficulty with employment because they cannot access the very basic
and fundamental forms of qualification, which we need now in finding
employment—or at least to change employment frequently, as we
seem to have to do. Unless we can start to address this and work it in
with that very welcome change towards coaching and a more flexible
approach to learning and teaching, we will just create more problems. I
hope that my noble friend will be able to give me a positive reply.
Indeed, I hope that the 
<?notus-xml column=245?>noble Lord, Lord Young, will give us an idea about where he thinks it
should develop, because I recognise his expertise in this field as
well.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_28_PT_1/BFB4F7DE75898CCAF9F46388D73D17F29B3AD47F" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 February 2013">Thursday,

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble
Lord, Lord Lucas, for ensuring this debate. If nothing else, it forced
me to look up “pedagogy” and find out what it meant. I
thought I knew but that, being a fully paid-up member of
“Pedants are us”, I had better know the precise meaning.
I am also grateful to the City and Guilds Institute, for two reasons.
First, the only qualifications I have are from it, so I have some
reason to be grateful to it. Secondly, I am grateful for the report,
although when I looked at its equilateral triangle that promised to
identify the three types of vocational education I did not quite
understand it, so it is back to the drawing board for me.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, for the name of the plumber. If he was as
good as that, everybody would want him. Unfortunately, not all of them
measure up. I remember seeing a television programme which showed far
too many of them saying, “Your boiler’s had it and you
need a new one”, when it actually had quite a simple
fault. Of course, a plumber these days is not just a plumber. A plumber
is required to have knowledge of electronics and chemicals, plus the
basic plumbing techniques, so I do not knock that.</hs_para>

approach to vocational education is, briefly, that we want to develop a
transformational 14 to 18 education system featuring a
quality technical baccalaureate at 18 for those achieving a rigorous
vocational qualification, a work experience placement and achievement
in English and mathematics. That is taking into account the point from
the noble Lord, Lord Addington, about having different methods for
those who have real problems in approaching exams in the standard way.
The TechBacc would sit alongside those A-level programmes. We want more
and better vocational education up to 18, with all young people
undertaking some vocational learning from 14 and compulsory work
experience for all 16 to 18 year-olds. I am rushing this because we
have only a short time.</hs_para>

things that we did in Government was, I felt, that instead of raising
the school-leaving age we raised the participation age. All Governments
make mistakes, but I thought that was a good one. One of the mistakes
we made was in picking a random figure and saying, “We want 50%
of young people to go to university”, which somehow implied that
the other 50% had failed in some way. Eventually, we realised that that
was not the case and we put a lot of effort into both FE and
apprenticeships, but I feel that it was a sort of catching-up
process.</hs_para>

reports but, looking at the Government’s response to the Wolf
report—whether or not we like every aspect of it—it was a
significant report. The Government identified a number of things that
they felt were failures, and I agree with them. They include perverse
incentives created by the performance and funding systems and
encouraging the teaching of qualifications that attract the most
performance points or the most funding, not the 
<?notus-xml column=246?>qualifications that support young people to progress. I saw evidence of
that in my brief ministerial career, so I do not in any way blame it on
this Government—we are all on a journey trying to improve
quality. The failures also include students without a solid grounding
in the basics being allowed to drop the study of English and maths. We
know that they cannot do that. Many potential employers say, “If
they want to progress, they’ve got to have a basic grounding in
those subjects”. Therefore, we are looking to improve the
quality of FE, and we know from the Ofsted review that it needs to be
improved.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022857000185" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000185">I
was attracted to the point that the noble Lord, Lord Lingfield, made
about giving institutions more autonomy. However, with autonomy comes
responsibility. Before he said that, I thought that I would not give
them autonomy unless they came up to a certain standard. The noble Lord
then went on to talk about the royal charter, which I think is a good
approach.</hs_para>

colleges—and I have visited quite a few—you can see that
when they work, they work really well. One college that I went to had a
department dealing with painting and decorating. It worked well because
the college had managed to attract a local painter and decorator who
ran a highly successful business. It had initially lured him into the
college on the basis that he would be coaching, but it trained him in
teaching and he created a fantastically successful department. I
instance that because we need all colleges to have that relationship
with the business community, as the noble Lord, Lord Lingfield,
mentioned, as well as the local community.</hs_para>

available to me, I want to touch on a couple of other things. We have a
concern about the looming introduction of FE loans for all courses at
level 3 and above for those aged 24 and over. There is already some
evidence that that might prove to be a disincentive. We live in a
society where we know that people are not going to retain one job
throughout their life and that they are going to have to retrain, and
that is something that the Government may need to reflect
upon.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022857000188" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000188">Something else
identified in the Wolf report is that we can have the best further
education but if it does not lead to work experience and
apprenticeships then we are in trouble. It is not that the Government
are not focused on apprenticeships—I pay tribute to some of the
work they have done—but there is still some way to go on
quality. Just quoting numbers is not enough, as a lot of the figures
relate to adult apprenticeships. The area where I think we need to
focus is the 16 to 18 age group, and I say that because of
youth unemployment. Although the unemployment figures may be coming
down, youth unemployment is still a serious problem. The number of
firms employing apprentices is still pathetic. I think that only about
a third of the FTSE 100 companies have apprenticeships, and the average
is somewhere between 4% and 8%. I fail to understand why the Government
do not insist that if you want a public procurement contract, you have
to specify the training and the number of apprenticeships. I have just
been invited to a Crossrail apprenticeship award event. Crossrail has
400 apprentices because we insisted on it, and the same applied to the 
<?notus-xml column=247?>Olympics. I do not understand why the Government will not go down that
road.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022857000189" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000189">We are
in an ever-changing environment—the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp,
mentioned further education, distance learning and social
media—but we are also in an era when UTCs are on the scene. One
question that I used to ask when I went around schools, colleges and
universities was, “How many apprentices do you, as an
institution, have?”. Often I might as well have asked them how
many people from their college had landed on Mars because they did not
seem to understand that it is no good teaching about apprenticeships if
you do not have any yourself. It is important to encourage them to
recruit not just as one school or one college but together as a group.
We have ATAs and group training associations, which have been
identified in the government report, and every local authority ought to
ensure that GTAs operate within their area working with schools,
colleges and further education colleges. They are part of the solution
to this problem but we have a long way to go.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022857000190" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000190">As part of the Lords
outreach programme, I will be speaking to some sixth-formers tomorrow.
They are all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, and we cannot help but think
that they are about to face reality. They will be trying to enter the
world of work, assuming that they do not go on to university. Even
those who go on to university are now wondering whether it is the right
journey. We have a huge challenge and responsibility. We cannot afford
to fail to create not only apprenticeships, which are fundamentally
important, but work experience. If further education colleges are able
to apply their pedagogy in an environment that will produce results,
they must be able to give confidence to young people that they will
find work and work experience out there. Those are some of my brief
reflections. This has been a very worthwhile debate, and the subject
merits a much longer debate at some time in the future when we can
pursue some of its complexities. I look forward to the
Minister’s
response.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_28_PT_1/47BFFB6EDBFEED6D447CA812D7F86FCC2AE0DF60" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 February 2013">Thursday,

Garden of Frognal:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
friend Lord Lucas for initiating this debate. Vocational pedagogy is an
issue seldom discussed in your Lordships’ House, but it is a
legitimate area of concern for both the House and the
country.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022857000192" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000192">I
declare an interest—a number of interests have been declared in
this debate—in having been associated professionally for more
than 20 years with City &amp; Guilds, and it was the City &amp; Guilds
Centre for Skills Development that produced the report under debate. It
is clear from reading <I>How to Teach Vocational Education</I> that the
institute maintains its standards of expertise and insight in relation
to vocational teaching and assessment. It has been tremendous this
afternoon to hear people coming from all sorts of backgrounds talking
with the same enthusiasm and passion for vocational
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000193" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000193">I
can assure my noble friend Lord Lucas that the Government welcome the
report and the evidence that it provides to inform the work of the
Commission on Adult Vocational Teaching and Learning. The Government 
<?notus-xml column=248?>are not alone in this. Both the Institute for Learning and the Learning
and Skills Improvement Service have also applauded the report as a
valuable contribution to work on this theme. As the originator of the
<I>Good Schools Guide</I>, my noble friend Lord Lucas is fully aware of
how fundamental standards of teaching are to eventual learning
outcomes. What constitutes good and effective school teaching is,
rightly, a topic to which your Lordships’ attention is
frequently drawn and on which this House can boast substantial
expertise. However, too little attention has been paid both in
government and in the education sector as a whole to the quality of the
education and training offered to young people and adults after
compulsory school age.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022857000194" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000194">Teaching adults and
teaching vocational subjects call for different skills and present
different challenges from those required in school classrooms. For
example, learners’ ages may vary from 14 to over 90. The
experience they bring with them may be as a complete beginner in the
subject, as someone working towards a first step on the career ladder
or as someone who may have worked in an area for years and is looking
for the certification required for career enhancement. They may also
want to learn for personal satisfaction, and that, too, is worth while.
The task of teaching children successfully is hard enough, but the
range of variables with which teachers of adults must cope potentially
extends so much more widely. They tend to be better disciplined, which
I suppose is one of the advantages of teaching adults, and their
motivation tends to be higher than for those still of compulsory school
age.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000195" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000195">Two key
factors have a bearing on the quality of the results that vocational
education produces. First, there is the standard of qualifications to
which it leads and the degree of confidence that employers have in
those qualifications. My noble friend Lord Lingfield mentioned the
importance of benchmark qualifications and the ease of understanding
quite what the qualifications represent. City &amp; Guilds, as befits
an organisation founded by the livery companies and the Corporation of
the City of London, has been delivering these since 1878. In the
aftermath of the Wolf review, this Government have sought more and
better ways to encourage more employers to become involved in the
design and delivery of vocational qualifications as a guarantee of
quality and workplace relevance. The noble Lord, Lord Young, gave a
telling example of the local painter invigorating a class of people who
were learning that
craft.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000196" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000196">Secondly,
and equally crucially, there are standards of teaching and learning.
For this, we look largely to the commitment and expertise of the
further education sector. I echo the views of the noble Lord, Lord
Lingfield, and those expressed by other noble Lords, and I pay tribute
to the dedication of governors, leaders and, of course, teachers. On
the comment that my noble friend Lord Lucas made about FE colleges, my
understanding is that 66% of colleges are currently judged as good or
better and that around 13% hold an outstanding grade, which is
encouraging.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022857000197" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000197">As the report makes
quite clear, the sector has successfully adapted its methods to the
subject in hand and to the diverse characteristics and aspirations of
learners. Success depends not on new orthodoxy or 
<?notus-xml column=249?>dogma but on awareness and creativity. FE has responded, for example, to
the way that e-learning has grown in recent years—as my noble
friend Lady Sharp set out clearly—in recognition of the
technology-dependent lifestyles of today, especially among the younger
generation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000198" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000198">The
previous Government took welcome steps to guarantee the quality of
adult learning. I acknowledge the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord
Young, to the developments and progress made during that time. The
coalition Government are building on that but, equally, we are trying
to tackle the bureaucracy. We believe that one of the most useful
sources of expertise is to be found among teachers and so, rather than
impose central targets, the Government’s most effective role is
to help the sector to identify and share good practice wherever it
exists. We can see from the report that those directly involved in
further education, individual learners and their eventual employers
will all be the beneficiaries of high-quality teaching leading to
high-value
qualifications.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000199" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000199">As
noble Lords will know, the Government announced in December 2011 that
they would establish a new Commission on Adult Vocational Teaching and
Learning under the chairmanship of a distinguished college principal,
Mr Frank McLoughlin CBE. My noble friend Lady Sharp made reference to
this. Input to the review came from a wide range of sources, including
this valuable report and, crucially, real-life observation of adults
learning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000200" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000200">The
main findings, influenced by this City &amp; Guilds research, concluded
that vocational education and training programmes should be
characterised by learning with a clear line of sight to work, and that
specialist vocational teachers and trainers should be at the heart of
this system. To ensure that knowledge and skills are always current,
strong links with employers should be maintained and further developed.
In connection with this, following the review of professionalism of the
noble Lord, Lord Lingfield, the Government are developing new
professional qualifications for the FE workforce, and the new FE guild
will take that forward.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022857000201" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000201">Ofsted’s new
inspection regime has a greater focus on the quality of teaching and
teachers—my noble friend Lady Sharp referred to this—and
will report on the contributions of colleges to their communities. As
to teachers with dual professionalism, which the noble Lord, Lord
Lingfield, highlighted, the commission sees this as a fundamental
element of the future development of the FE workforce. Its
recommendations advocate equal focus on developing teaching and ongoing
professional skills. It has long been one of the strengths of the
further education sector that the practitioners were also frequently
the teachers, and that brought reality and relevance to their teaching
of
students.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022857000202" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000202">The
commission will also set out the standard for what an adult vocational
learner should expect and define a range of effective pedagogical
approaches that make full use of the potential of
technology—because, of course, technology has made an enormous
difference in life.</hs_para>  
<?notus-xml column=250?><hs_para UID="13022857000203" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000203">On
the points made by my noble friend Lord Addington, I recognise his
concern about the requirement for people with any form of learning
disability or disadvantage to be allowed to reach their full potential
without any barriers which particular forms of assessment may present.
I assure him that this is constantly under review. Ofqual is in regular
contact with disability interest groups, to which I pay due tribute for
the expertise and passion they bring to ensure that the groups they
represent are not unnecessarily disadvantaged by things which could be
removed.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022857000204" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130228-gc0001.htm#13022857000204">Ofqual is looking very
closely at the different methodologies for assessment. My noble
friend—I know of his particular interest in
dyslexia—mentioned the different ways, such as computer aids and
software applications, which can enable learners to demonstrate that
they can attain the standards of the qualification, albeit by a
somewhat different method of assessment. The awarding bodies and, of
course, the colleges have to maintain an interest in the
qualifications, when they are awarded, representing a pure standard of
achievement. A great deal of work is going on—and my noble
friend deserves thanks for the way in which he champions
disadvantage—to try to make absolutely sure that these different
methods can be brought in. Many colleges already have strategies and
technologies to support learners with special needs. We expect that
some of the results coming out of the commission will address this, and
we will have further information to support that. The websites of the
Government, of Ofqual and, indeed, of the awarding bodies are
available. My noble friend mentioned particularly City &amp; Guilds. I
know that all the awarding bodies have an interest in ensuring that
special educational needs are met. I am sorry that he has found
difficulties dealing with that, and we hope to take forward any
specific cases that he can bring forward to try to ensure that those
are fully addressed.</hs_para>

to considering that report and responding to it in due course, bearing

in this subject around your Lordships’ House, that response may

IRA—in July 2012, a number of disparate groups came together to
form an organisation generally referred to as the “new
IRA”. This new grouping primarily consists of members of the
Real IRA, Republican Action Against Drugs (which conducts brutal
shootings against nationalist members of the community) and a number of
unaffiliated individuals who we believe have connections to the fatal
attack against Massereene barracks in 2009. This group has already
demonstrated its lethal intent, claiming responsibility for the murder
of David Black last November. The group also conducted an unsuccessful
attack in September 2012, in which it attached a bomb to a bicycle as
part of a trap to kill police in Londonderry. It has, however, also
suffered setbacks. For example, on 6 December 2012 a number of
individuals were arrested and charged after being found in possession

pleased to announce that agreement has been reached with BP and North

allowing HM Coastguard to call on the BP-chartered vessel, the
“Grampian Frontier”, to provide support in the event of a

that an operational and commercial model has been identified, it is
hoped that the scheme will be broadened out to include other suitable

UK, who helped to broker the agreement, will work with the Maritime and

the possibility of other industry vessels that may be suitable to
register to assist. As a signal of their commitment, BP also announced
investment of up to $250,000 towards new towing equipment to upgrade
its fleet of Caledonian regional support vessels, enhancing their

marketing campaign as well as improvements to the UK visa service in
China, announced by the UK Border Agency in December 2012. The changes,
some of which have already come into effect, will help to further
improve the UK’s competitiveness in attracting Chinese visitors.
