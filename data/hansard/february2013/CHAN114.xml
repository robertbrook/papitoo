respected in all parts of the House. We are assessing a funding
application for a prevalence study. The Home Office and the NSPCC
co-hosted a recent round-table at which prevalence was discussed, and
we are considering various ways in which we can collect the data to
inform a more targeted

correct that education and information are very important aspects of

the Member for Battersea. As I said, the Government take this issue
extremely seriously and we look across the board at what Government can
do to deal with it. It is about helping communities themselves to
eradicate this problem. Everyone in this Chamber will be concerned
about the lack of prosecutions, and I am pleased that the Director of
Public Prosecutions has issued a new action plan on FGM to the
prosecutors, with the hope of getting prosecutions. We must recognise
that education of a variety of sorts is important, which is why
alerting people at various levels in the public services and in
schools, and others, and helping girls to understand the threat
themselves, is so important.</hs_Para>

combating terrorism. We will continue to take that approach and we will
look at ways of making sure that this country is not a soft touch when

ensure that policy is effective in combining all the elements needed to
reduce criminality. Although it is no consolation to the family in this
case, it might help the House to know that, according to the crime

reduction in homicides, a 9% reduction in violent incidents involving
knives or sharp instruments, and an 18% reduction in gun crime. It

to our attention, including in a lot of areas with Labour councils,
that people keep bringing complaints, particularly lower-level
complaints, about individual incidents that do not always warrant
immediate attention. We want to ensure that there is some measure of

week’s European Council agreed the overall limit on EU spending
for the next seven years, starting in 2014. When these multi-year deals
have been agreed in the past, spending has gone up, but last week we
agreed that spending should come down. By working with like-minded
allies, we delivered a real-terms cut in what Brussels can spend for
the first time in history. As the House knows, the EU budget is
negotiated annually, so what we were negotiating—initially at
the Council last November and again last week—was not the
individual annual budgets, but rather the overall framework for the
next seven years. This includes the overall ceilings on what can be
spent—effectively, the limit on the European Union’s
credit card for the next seven

the last negotiation, which covered the period 2007 to 2013, the last
Government agreed to an 8% increase in the payments ceiling, to
€943 billion. Put simply, this gave the EU a credit card with a
higher limit, and today we are still living with the results of
allowing the EU’s big spenders to push for more and more
spending each
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1302112000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0001.htm#1302112000173">In
fact, only last year, while member states were having to make tough
decisions to tighten their belts at home, the big spenders succeeded in
increasing the 2012 European budget by another 5% compared with the
previous year. If no deal had been reached, the existing ceilings would
have been rolled over and annual budgets could have continued to soar
for the next seven years. Because annual budgets are negotiated by
qualified majority voting, it can be difficult to constrain spending in
these annual negotiations. By contrast, the seven-year limits are
agreed by unanimity, so this was our chance to get the ceilings down in
line with what could be
afforded.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1302112000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0001.htm#1302112000174">The
European Commission produced an initial proposal for increasing the
payments ceiling still further to €988 billion. This
was strongly supported by a number of member states. The first
negotiation took place at the Council in November, and although the
President did then reduce this during the Council itself, it was still
some way short of the real-terms cut we were looking for. So together
with like-minded allies from a number of countries, including Germany,
Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark, we rejected the deal on the table

again.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1302112000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0001.htm#1302112000175">At
this Council, we made further progress. Together with allies, many of
whom like Britain write the cheques, we achieved a proper look across
all the areas where spending in the Commission proposal could be cut.
While there are areas where we could and should go further, not least
on reforming the common agricultural 
<?notus-xml column=570?>policy and reducing the bureaucratic costs of the European Commission,
we agreed a real-terms cut in the payment limit to €908 billion.
That is €80 billion lower than the original proposal; €35
billion lower than the deal agreed by the last Government, which is
still in operation today; and €60 billion lower than the
emergency arrangements that would have come into place if there were no
seven-year deal. My aim was not simply to cut the credit-card limit; I
wanted to set the limit at a level that would deliver at worst a freeze
and at best a cut in actual spending over the next seven years. That is
what this deal delivers—a real-terms
cut.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1302112000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0001.htm#1302112000176">If
we take the latest complete budget—the one for 2012—and
freeze spending at that level for the next seven years, we would have
spending limits of €932 billion. Our new payments
limit means spending cannot rise above €908 billion, so we have
slashed €24 billion off a real freeze on the last completed
budget. Of course, the budget set in 2012, which Britain voted against,
was unacceptably large, but even against the average of the last two
completed years—2011 and 2012—this deal still delivers a
real-terms cut.</hs_Para>

now, of course, be voted on by the European Parliament, and the
European Council has said it is prepared to accept some flexibilities
about how spending is divided between different budget years and
different areas of spending, but we are absolutely clear that this must

the UK’s contribution, the House will remember how the last

long-term and continuing effect on the UK’s net contributions.
It is worth remembering why. It is because when the European Union
spends money on structural funds and cohesion payments in eastern
European countries, for example, the UK no longer gets a rebate on this
money. As a result, almost whatever budget deal was done, our net
contributions were always likely to go up. As a result of this deal,
however, they will be going up by less. The only two sensible things we
could do to protect the British taxpayer in these negotiations were to
get the overall budget down and to protect what is left of our

there is, although we have taken some steps forward. The common
agricultural policy budget pillar one goes from €320 billion to
€277 billion, which is a significant change. In terms of what
grew in the budget that can help to deliver growth and jobs, we have
the Connecting Europe Facility, which is about energy, transport and
broadband networks. That goes from €8 billion in the last
seven-year period to €19 billion in this period, so I do not
think it is entirely fair to say that the right things were not

Gentleman is wrong to say that the European development fund will go
down; it will go up by €1 billion. On Mali, there was very
little time left at the end of the marathon Council to discuss those
issues, but I took the opportunity to praise the French President for
the brave action that the French have taken, to offer our strong
support, and to say that we would contribute by training troops from
west African nations. I have spoken to the Nigerian President, who is

so I think that answers that question. On EU-US trade, I spoke

troops will replace the French troops. Then two things need  to
happen—a political agreement in Mali that helps to bring that
country together, and the rapid training of Malian forces so that they
can take responsibility for their own security. No one wants foreign

Britain’s place within it. These discussions show that Britain

We have taken some steps forward, but I am not satisfied with where we
have got to with regard to the costs of the Commission or the other

said—we have had this exchange before—I have never
supported Britain’s membership of the euro and never will. We
are better off outside it, but we have to understand the fact that, for
some European leaders and politicians, the euro is an article of faith
and they will do everything they can to save their currency. That is
why I think we should be planning on the basis of change in
Europe; the eurozone requires changes to make sense of its

a danger that the European External Action Service, which was, of

Prime Minister:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman asks an extremely
important question. Over the last MFF, there was something like a 7%
gap, on average, between commitments and payments, so I would argue
that a 5% gap is perfectly safe. I think that what we will see
is lots of efforts by the institutions of the European Union, now that
they are on a tighter budget, to try to spend their money more
effectively and to try to use the headroom available. That
is perfectly understandable and it might lead to better financial
planning, but we can be confident that the ceilings are fixed and that,
as a result, the spending will be
less<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:19:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

difficult to work out exactly how much the rebate will deliver. The
rebate does not operate on the cohesion spending in eastern Europe, but
it does operate on agriculture spending. It is only when we know those
parameters that we can work out the position. I have been
straightforward and said that the British contribution is likely to go
up because of the changes to the rebate agreed by the previous
Government. However, they will go up by less than they would have done,

England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:46:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021116000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0002.htm#13021116000005">As
we get older, none of us can have any way of knowing what care needs we
will eventually face. Some will be blessed with a long and healthy
life, but many others will be less fortunate. Today, many older people
and people with disabilities face paying the limitless, often ruinous
costs of their own care with little or no assistance from the state.
Although those with assets of less than £23,250 receive support,
those with assets above this level receive none. That is desperately
unfair, particularly for those who have worked hard all their lives to
pay off their mortgage, save for their future or have something to pass
on to their loved ones, only to see their property sold and their
savings wiped out. This is something that happens to more than 30,000
people every year or 100 people every
day<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:47:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

system we have also sends out the wrong message: that people are better
off not saving for their future because any savings may only disappear
in a puff of smoke. So today I can announce the Government’s
radical plans to transform the funding of care and support in
England—bringing a new degree of certainty, fairness and peace
of mind to the costs of old age, disability and living with long-term
conditions, while ensuring that the greatest level of financial support
goes to those with the greatest need. We propose to introduce a cap on
an individual’s financial contributions towards the cost of care
and a significant increase in the level of assets a person may hold and
still receive some degree of support from the
state<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:48:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021116000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0002.htm#13021116000007">In
2010, this Government asked economist Andrew Dilnot to look at the
whole issue of funding for care and support. The independent Dilnot
commission published its recommendations in July 2011. In response to
those recommendations and following extensive engagement with the care
and support sector, we published the care and support White Paper and
the progress report on funding reform in July 2012. In the progress
report, we accepted some of Andrew Dilnot’s main
recommendations, including those for a consistent, nationally set
eligibility threshold for care and support, and universal deferred
payments, whereby no one will have to sell their home in their lifetime
to pay for care costs. I would like to take this opportunity to thank
Andrew and his team for their excellent
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:49:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021116000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0002.htm#13021116000008">A
core principle set out by the Dilnot commission was that people should
contribute to the costs of their own care, but those costs should be
limited and protected against the potentially catastrophic costs of
care. That should come through a cap on those costs and an extended
means test. One person in 10 will be faced with care costs in excess of
£100,000, with a small number facing costs significantly higher
still. To give everyone peace of mind, from April 2017, we will
introduce a cap on the amount that someone over state pension age will
be liable to
pay.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021116000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0002.htm#13021116000009">The
Dilnot commission’s original suggestion was for a cap of
£25,000 to £50,000 in 2010-11 prices—the
equivalent of £30,000 to £61,000 in April 2017 prices.
Despite the extremely challenging economic situation  
<?notus-xml column=593?>in which we find ourselves, we have come as close to that range as
possible. The cap will be set at £61,000 in 2010-11 prices or
£75,000 once it is introduced in April
2017.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021116000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0002.htm#13021116000010">The
intention is not that people should have to pay up to £75,000
for their care costs, but that by creating the certainty that this is
the maximum they will have to pay, they can then make provision through
insurance or pension products so that they are covered up to
the value of the cap, thereby reducing the risk of selling their home
or losing an inheritance that they have worked hard to pass on to their
family. Young people who already have care needs when they turn 18 will
now receive free adult care and support when they reach 18. People who
develop a care need after 18 but before state pension age will be
protected by a cap that is below the £75,000
threshold.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021116000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0002.htm#13021116000011">The
other measure we propose is to increase significantly the amount of
assets a person can hold and still receive financial support for their
residential care home costs. Currently, this is set
at £23,250. If a person has assets valued above this level,
including in some circumstances the value of their home, they receive
no support. The Dilnot commission recommended this threshold be raised
dramatically to £100,000 in 2010-11 prices. We accept this
recommendation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021116000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0002.htm#13021116000013">From
April 2017, the threshold will be increased so that those with assets
worth £123,000 or less, equivalent to Dilnot’s
recommended level, will all receive some degree of financial support
for their care costs. People with the fewest assets will receive the
most support. This will, for the first time, provide financial
protection for those with modest wealth, while ensuring that the
poorest continue to have all or the majority of their costs
paid.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021116000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0002.htm#13021116000014">Everyone
will benefit from the peace of mind that a cap will bring. The
introduction of a cap and the extended means-tested support will help
many people in the most challenging circumstances. We expect
up to 16% of older people who need care to face
costs of £75,000 or more—but, of course, none of
us knows whether we will be in that 16%. Everyone will
benefit from the peace of mind that these changes will
bring, and by 2025 up to 100,000 more older people will receive
financial support with their care costs as a
result.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021116000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0002.htm#13021116000015">The
Chancellor and the Treasury have rightly insisted that we identify how
we pay for the additional costs of these proposals. In this day and
age, making promises that cannot be paid for makes those promises
meaningless —so we have identified exactly how to pay for them.
These reforms will cost the Exchequer £1 billion a year by the
end of the next Parliament. With the agreement of the Chancellor, these
will be met in part by freezing the inheritance tax threshold at
£325,000 for a further three years from 2015-16. The Chancellor
and the Chief Secretary have agreed that the remaining costs over the
course of the next Parliament will be met from public and private
sector employer national insurance contributions revenue associated
with the end of contracting out as part of the introduction of the
single-tier pension.</hs_Para>

proposals join others previously announced when we published the draft
care and support White Paper last summer, and they include from 2015
the ability of people to defer the payment of residential care costs so
that no one need sell their own home to pay for them during their
lifetime. Also from 2015, a 
<?notus-xml column=594?>national minimum eligibility threshold will be
introduced to end the lottery of local access that can see support
provided to someone in one area, but not in another. Taken together,
today’s proposals and those already set out in the draft Care
and Support Bill represent a new era of support for the elderly and
disabled in England. Thanks to the certainty these proposals introduce,
rather than people feeling they have to hoard every penny in case the
very worst should happen, or that they are powerless and there is no
point in saving at all, people will be able to plan and prepare
sensibly for the future. They will be supported by a wider range of
financial products becoming available in the market, which will be
designed to help people to plan and prepare for their later years and
to reassure them about how much they will pay. We will work with the
care and support sector—with local authorities, charities, care
providers and individuals—and with the financial services
industry to develop the plans and introduce them
practically.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021116000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0002.htm#13021116000017">Our
society is ageing. By 2030, the number of people over 85 will double,
and the number of people with dementia will exceed 1 million. As the

social care costs as much as they prepare and plan for their pensions.

specifically, there are four problems with what has been announced
today, and I will address each in turn. First, it fails the fairness
test. We will only have a durable solution if it can answer this
question: will it help every person and every couple to protect what
they have worked for, whatever their wealth and savings? I am afraid
that the answer is no. According to Demos, a £35,000 cap would
benefit about 3.2 million pensioners. A per-person cap of
£75,000 will benefit just 1.4 million. For the average couple,
the cap is £150,000. That might be enough to protect detached
houses, but it will not protect the average semi-detached home in large
parts of
England.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021116000026" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0002.htm#13021116000026">As

Secretary of State claims that insurance companies will step in with
new products to help more people to protect their assets, but in
evidence to the Health Committee, the Association of British Insurers
said that it did not believe that the capped cost model would result in

the plan is at best a partial solution. With this decision, the
Government have prioritised the funding of a cap on care costs with new
money, over and above addressing the crisis in council care budgets.
Will the Secretary of State confirm that this was against the advice of
Andrew Dilnot to the cross-party talks? In practice, it will mean that
vulnerable people will continue to face rising charges, as councils put
up fees to cope with the growing shortfall in their budgets, making it
more likely that those people will, in time, have to pay right up to
the new £75,000 cap. To many people, that will not feel like
progress.</hs_Para>

charges are rising above inflation, and councils are warning that, by

of State accept that forecast, and if he does, how will the plans he

the proposal fails to meet the scale of the challenge of the ageing

attitude of the Opposition; they thought it was wishful thinking to try
to solve this problem, whereas we are getting on with a solution. We do
not have those financial products available at the moment, but the
whole point of these structures is that we will help to create a market
in which it is possible to have them. The point of the cap is to allow
the hon. Lady’s constituents, even people on lower incomes, to
plan and make provision, not only for costs of more than
£75,000, but for any costs they have up to £75,000. In
combination with that, we are increasing the threshold for Government

Blears</B> (Salford and Eccles) (Lab):</Member> The Alzheimer’s
Society has said today that capping care costs is a step in the right
direction, but a £75,000 cap is so high that it will
help only the few. The Secretary of State knows that there are 800,000
people in this country living with dementia now, and his announcement
today, however welcome it is, does not deal with the community care
costs that those people face day to day. This costs a billion pounds
in, but there is £1.3 billion out of community costs to local
authorities. How will he fill that

crisis that we face because of dementia, and she has spoken movingly on
the issue. What I would say about what the Alzheimer’s Society
is saying is that to look at the cap in isolation is to misunderstand
these proposals. For many people with dementia, the most significant
thing will be the increase from £23,000 to £123,000 in
the threshold at which they get state support. That is a big step
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021116000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0002.htm#13021116000067">The

which makes it possible for people to make provision in their pensions
and in insurance policies. One in three of us will get dementia, and we
do not know whether we will be among those one in three. This proposal
will allow people to put some certainty in place—to make plans
now, which means that when they are dealing with the nightmare of
either themselves or someone in their family having to cope with
dementia, they will not have the double whammy of having to worry about
losing their house as

conclusion, I want to reiterate that I completely understand why people
are so concerned about this issue. It is unacceptable that they have
been deceived in this way. There appears to have been criminal
activity in an attempt to defraud the consumer. The prime
responsibility for dealing with this lies with retailers and food
producers who need to demonstrate that they have taken all necessary
actions to ensure the integrity of the food chain in this country. I am
in daily contact with the FSA. This week I will be having
further contact with European counterparts and I will be
meeting the food industry again, together with the FSA, tomorrow. I

Friday, the FSA said that the police were involved, so I was reassured.
However, on Friday night the Met police said that they had had talks
with the FSA, but that there was no live criminal investigation. On
Saturday, after a conversation with one of the food industry
representatives, I realised that the Secretary of State had not
revealed the names of those firms to the food industry at the meeting.

his Department has carried out since his Government removed
compositional labelling from the Food Standards Agency in 2010?
He talks about the FSA’s operational independence, but it is not
responsible for the content of our food—he is. When will he stop
hiding behind civil servants and take some responsibility? Does he
think that surveying just 224 products from across the country matches
the scale of this scandal, when he has asked the supermarkets to test
thousands of their products by Friday? Can he confirm today to the

as a precaution. Can he tell the House which members have withdrawn
which products, and whether any of them supplies schools, prisons and
hospitals? The supermarkets have acted with speed and a degree of
transparency on this that puts him to shame. I am disappointed that the

inherited the current system from the last Government. I have no doubt
that there will be lessons to be learnt from this episode, but, as I
said in answer to an earlier question, the area in which I am most
interested in pursuing real progress is the introduction of random
testing. Too much is taken for granted under the present system. Too
often, although the paperwork is supposed to describe what is on the
pallet or the truck, it goes through the system and no one actually
checks. I think that we could make a massive improvement within the
current constraints of European competence and all the other
arrangements, but I think that random testing would make a real
difference. I am pleased that Lord Rooker was so sympathetic to that
idea today, as was Commissioner Borg.</hs_Para>

Second Reading, the Minister expressed the view that we would be able

opportunity to do just that. I want to reassert the concern that I
expressed last week on Second Reading that, although this Government
and this country were always against having such an agency, we are
tremendously relaxed about extending its budget and its range of
activities now that it has been established. There must come a time

what was called a fundamental rights culture within the European Union,

It holds conferences, one of which I have attended. As I said on Second
Reading, it was more a propaganda exercise than anything else. The
agency produces large tomes of documentation relating to what
it describes as fundamental rights in different countries in the

body. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T18:47:25"></hs_TimeCode> hope

to deal with collective rights, rather than individual rights, whereas
the European Court of Human Rights deals with individual rights. That
is a moot point, however. As with so many things, the European Union
comes along and confuses the issue by giving a new institution a very
similar name to that of an existing body. We have a Council
of Europe, and, although we do not have a council of the European
Union, we have a European Union Council. We also have a Commission of
the European Union.

broadcasting exemplifies the problem we have. The Council of Europe set

the European Union has come along and said that the convention cannot
be brought up to date because it cuts across a fundamental competence
of the Union. Therefore, the Council of Europe has been prevented,
amazingly, from updating the convention because the European Union has
said it cannot do so. Of course, because the Union has 27 of the 47
member countries of the Council, if it says, “You cant’
do that”, the Council’s member states collectively have
no option but to obey the Union. This is an example, as

paper tiger when it comes to defending workers’ rights. As I
said when I intervened, I want fundamental rights to be strengthened.
Whether they are strengthened by legislation in this Parliament or at
the European Union level is a matter for debate, but they certainly
need to be strengthened. The rights of trade unionists were weakened

“paper tiger” nature of fundamental rights in the
European Union was shown in the Viking Line case. Industrial action was
taken and, strangely, the fundamental right to take strike action was
overridden in favour of the interests of employers. Profits and the
rights of employers were seen to have primacy over the fundamental
rights of trade unionists. So, I am not impressed by the fundamental
rights guaranteed by the European Union. If they are fundamental, the
trade unionists taking that action should have been found to be in the
right, and the European Court of Justice should not have ruled against
them, finding in favour of employers. There have been two such cases,
major cases, and they have shaken the confidence considerably of many
trade unionists who mistakenly put their faith in the European Union to

Heaton-Harris</B> (Daventry) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to speak
in this debate, and I want to talk about the agency in general terms. I
am very concerned about the growth in the number of agencies at
European level: the European “quangocracy”, as many call
it. As a Member of the European Parliament, I sat on the Committee on
Budgetary Control, whose purview extended to the agencies when we
approved their accounts or gave them a statement of assurance each
year. People always moan about the risk of fraud, mismanagement and
maladministration in the European Commission, but it was fairly obvious
that the further away from the Commission—from the
centre—agencies were, the less the scrutiny of their
accounts.</hs_Para>

that giving the Fundamental Rights Agency a multi-annual financial
framework and such a big budget increase could lead to issues with the
way it runs its accounts. I am not saying it had issues in the

good point in his statement when he said that, in these times of
austerity, we should expect the European institutions to act
appropriately. I am not trying to undermine the work that the
Fundamental Rights Agency does, but I hope that the Minister will talk
about the value for money it gives. The reports from the European Court
of Auditors on the agency’s spending regularly show that it has
come in under budget and has been transferring moneys from different
parts of its budget into either staffing or buildings and rent over the
past few years—in European terms, that is a good way of coming
in slightly under budget rather than having a big surplus. So giving
the agency such a huge amount of money in a multi-annual financial

Connarty</B> (Linlithgow and East Falkirk) (Lab):</Member> I rise to
speak because I am shocked by what the hon. Gentleman has just said.
The European convention on human rights came about at the initiative of
the British Government in the beginning; it was done to bring people
together to find ways of applying common standards across the whole of
Europe in order to prevent what had happened leading up to the
catastrophe of the second world war. Surely he is not saying that he
thinks the UK would have been better off not having taken that
initiative and that Europe should remain a place of conflict where
people do not agree on what human rights everyone deserves in
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:04:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Davies:</Member></B> I know that the hon. Gentleman takes a pride in
living in the past, and that is fine and dandy, but of course he was
talking about what the convention was set up to do in the first place,
many years ago, whereas I am talking about the present. I am sure that
he did not envisage our having to have ridiculous things such a votes
for prisoners as a result of our membership of the European convention
on human rights. I do not want to get sidetracked on to something that
is not, strictly speaking, dealt with in this group of amendments, Mr
Evans. The hon. Gentleman was tempting me down a path that I fear you
might have intervened on had I pursued it any further.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:05:24"></hs_TimeCode>My point is that
whether we are in the convention rightly or wrongly, we are in it and
so it is utterly pointless to have the agency trying to mimic what is
already being done

now have a new term—undocumented migrants. I think my

correct-speak of the EU they are undocumented migrants these days. Of
course what  
<?notus-xml column=634?>the agency is trying to do is encourage all these illegal immigrants to
access health care in countries such as the UK. My constituents are
sick to the back teeth of the national health service being used by
illegal immigrants and rather prefer these people to go back to the
country that they should be in to access the health care in the country
they come from. I hope that the Minister will address the following
question: are the Government really using taxpayers’ money to
fund an agency within the European Union that is actively encouraging
people from within the EU illegally—this discussion was on
illegal immigrants—to access this country and use the services
provided for people in this country? It would be a ridiculous state of

that kind of

right. We certainly need no lectures from other countries in the EU
about how to protect people’s freedoms; this country has a far
better track record than member states of the EU will ever have. I
suspect that the Minister will be trying to defend the indefensible,
but it is a sad state of affairs when it appears that we in this House
are powerless to do anything about these sorts of bureaucracies. We all
know what happens with these types of bureaucracies: they grow and
grow, and they empire build. They will grow their influence and they
will try to do things that they are not supposed to do—things
they were not set up to do. They will grow the number of staff and grow
their budget, and it appears from what I have heard so far that we are
utterly powerless to do anything about it. If the Minister can give me
some comfort that we can and will do something about it, fair enough,

the fact that the EU sometimes asks us to do things that we might not

anything that has happened recently under this Government—human

in other countries by having the EU alongside the Council of

we need to reform many of these agencies, which have unruly-sized

this particular field, we have the Fundamental Rights Agency based in
Vienna, the European Institute for Gender Equality based in Vilnius,
and the European Asylum Support Office based in Valetta. Surely the

first meeting in Brussels, I believe I raised the matter with
UKRep—why did we need a new Commissioner every time we added a
country? Why does every member state have to have an office of some
kind because it does not have an office of some other kind? We did it.
We were fighting over the universal patent recently, and the most
important thing to the UK was where the patent court would be based. It
had to be based in London. It was not about whether the patent was a
good or a bad thing. There is a problem with the EU in that
it sprays benefits around. I believe it has put some institution on
Crete—a wonderful island where I have holidayed often, but I
could not work out why a major institution of the European Union had

has to be looked at fundamentally, but the principle is
correct. If the European Union sets up the agency, it will monitor what

Rights and those who want, as Churchill and many others did after the

of us agree, across the spectrum of views on the European Union, that
because all 27 members of the European Union are members of

human rights, the Fundamental Rights Agency represents unnecessary
duplication. I had rather hoped that in the Council document on the
multi-annual framework that is mentioned in the Bill we would find a
distinction between the legitimate area of activity for European Union
institutions and what is done in the general field of human rights.

European Court of Human Rights means that the majority of the budget
goes towards its operation.
Now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:35:30"></hs_TimeCode> we have
another body, funded by exactly the same taxpayers in the 27 member
states of the European Union, that apparently might not have the same
financial constraints placed on it. Would it not make absolute sense if
we, as the 27 members of the European Union, agreed to chuck the little
packet of money that we are going to give to the Fundamental Rights
Agency into the budget of the Council of Europe to make it the much
more effective body in promoting human rights and respect for all the
rights outlined in article 2 of the document? We could then ensure that

a very wide-ranging debate covering a large number of issues, some of

limited to seeking parliamentary approval for an EU decision to agree

identifies the thematic areas under which the agency will undertake its
tasks. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:37:10"></hs_TimeCode>
amendments—my main contribution to the debate, Mr Evans,
will be to talk about the amendments—have as their common
purpose a desire to remove clause 1(2)(b) from the Bill, the effect of
which would be to withhold parliamentary approval of the draft
decision that seeks to establish the next five-year work programme for
the agency. Without that parliamentary approval, the UK cannot vote in
favour of this measure at EU level. I do not believe that withholding
such approval is the right course of action. I urge my hon. Friend to
withdraw the amendment, or the Committee to vote against it,

reasons.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021141000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0003.htm#13021141000033">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:37:55"></hs_TimeCode>

opportunity to define the focus for the agency’s work for the
next five years, encouraging it to concentrate its resources on a
limited number of areas and to undertake targeted, in-depth research
within the boundaries defined by the framework. The UK has participated
actively in the negotiations that have led to the new draft programme
being drawn up and is satisfied with the results. It is important for
the Committee to be clear that the agreement of a new work programme
does not alter the core tasks of the agency, nor does it change the
agency’s role. The work programme does not set out or define
these elements. They are set out in a completely different
instrument—the agency’s establishing regulation, which is
not under review in the Bill or in the amendments. I hear the
views of many of my hon. Friends about the merits of the
agency’s work, but neither this Bill nor the draft decision that

there was no draft framework, the agency would still be able to
carry out its role. However, its focus would shift to answering
requests for work from other EU institutions. Not supporting the
framework therefore means that member states, including the UK, would
have less influence on the work that the agency does. I do not think

themes set out in the work programme continue those in the current one,

negotiations the UK Government were successful in ensuring that the
themes set out in the work programme should continue to be limited to
Community law. Other member states proposed the inclusion of themes on
police co-operation and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. That
would have been an extension of the agency’s work and
it was successfully resisted by the UK Government. The draft decision
records that we were successful. Agreeing to the draft decision will
ensure that that is a binding decision of the EU institutions. That is

on to some of the specific points that have been raised, the issue of
duplication of the work of the Council of Europe has been a feature of
this debate. The agency’s role is to provide the EU
institutions and member states with independent evidence on how
fundamental rights are respected. It does so through undertaking
research and producing comparative data of the situation of rights
across those member states, and through producing indicators that can
be applied across the EU. Some of my hon. Friends were treating it as
though it were an alternative to either the European Court of Justice
or the European Court of Human Rights. It is, in essence, a data
collection and dissemination agency that does not do any of the work of
the ECJ or the ECHR. I agree that that would be unnecessary
duplication. The same point applies to those in this country who, quite
reasonably, would not want to lectured by the Fundamental Rights Agency
about our performance on human rights. It does not do that sort of
thing—that is not the work that it
does<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:43:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021141000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0003.htm#13021141000040">There

will continue to push for a good deal for UK taxpayers through

rights performance across the European Union is intrinsically useful
for British citizens and, indeed, those of other countries, because it
enables us to assess how one of the basic things that we all wish to

countries—namely a basic commitment to human rights, is actually
happening. It is extremely desirable for the citizens of democratic
countries to enjoy human rights almost as a matter of habit, and it

for responding so frankly. What he has said illustrates the farce we
are in. As a result of the commendable passing of the European Union
Act 2011, we are being asked to approve, among other things, the work
programme of the Fundamental Rights Agency for the next five years. If
we do not approve the programme, we have been told,
“Don’t worry—they’re going to go ahead with
it anyway and choose their own programme.” Similarly, as the
Prime Minister told us earlier with regard to the multi-annual
financial framework—the next seven-year budget for the European
Union—if a real-terms reduction had not been agreed, it would
have carried on spending more than had been agreed anyway. That shows
the extent to which we have been tied up in knots by the European Union
and its institutions.

own eyes that the 27 member countries of the European Union feel that
they can throw money at the gravy train that is the Fundamental Rights
Agency. Sadly, I did not hear an assurance from my right hon. Friend

first like to say a little about clause 1(1), which sets out that when
a decision is reached under article 352 of the treaty on the

connoisseurs of these matters will be aware, article 352 is
quite controversial. It is the so-called flexibility or enabling
clause, which allows decisions to be taken when there is no
legal base for them. Its predecessor was article 308 of the European
Community treaty. When I was a member of the European Scrutiny

308.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021141000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0003.htm#13021141000064">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:55:06"></hs_TimeCode>

was, however, concerned that the former Lord Chancellor, the right hon.
and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke), said last year in
evidence to the European Scrutiny Committee that an Act of Parliament
was not required to enact the decision on the Fundamental Rights Agency
because it satisfied the exemption requirement under section 8(6)(a) of
the 2011 Act. That was rightly questioned by the European Scrutiny
Committee. In a letter to the Committee on 22 November, the Government
stated that they had had second thoughts and that legislation would be
brought forward after all. That is one point to the European Scrutiny

second part of the clause concerns the future thematic areas of work of
the Fundamental Rights Agency. At the Justice and Home Affairs Council
on 31 May last year, nine areas of work were agreed. Since then
the European Parliament has formally approved the text. It will, of
course, have legal effect only once the Council has adopted
it—hence the relevance, once again, of this Bill. The FRA is
limited in its work because it is confined to collecting and analysing
data while providing advice and seeking to raise awareness of
fundamental

we heard this evening and on Second Reading, a number of Conservative
Members have questioned the appropriateness of a body such as the

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T20:01:50"></hs_TimeCode>whether it is
really necessary for the European Union to concern itself with
fundamental rights. Would it not be better, he argued, if we relied
simply on the European convention on human rights and the European
Court of Human Rights? That is not a spurious argument by any means and
the hon. Gentleman put it well this evening. However, I ask Members to
dip into the report by the House of Lords European Union Committee

Member for Wolverhampton North East (Emma Reynolds) gave a good,

Green:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Caerphilly
(Wayne David) for the Opposition’s support for this clause. He
asked a couple of specific questions including why the Government
changed their mind about the applicability of the exemption in the
European Union Act 2011 to these measures. Originally, the Government
thought that section 8 exemptions applied to a decision previously
adopted under article 308 of the treaty. However, having reconsidered
the issue of exemptions, and partly owing to the sterling work
of the European Scrutiny Committee and its equivalent in another place,
the Government concluded that decisions previously adopted under the
legal base of article 308 do not fall within the exemptions in the 2011
Act. Therefore, along with future article 352 decisions that were
previously adopted under article 308, such decisions will require
parliamentary approval through primary legislation.</hs_Para>

They wanted to be guaranteed the right to have a Commissioner and, as
part of the compromise deal that was done to try to win the support of
the Irish people in a referendum, the concession was made. They were

perhaps some countries feel that only if they have a Commissioner of

issues—sometimes the Government and Ministers talk hard on
them—but when we have it in our power to do something about
them, we pull our punches and let the matter slide away. Especially

about these issues, or are we just going through the motions? I look
forward to hearing from a Member of this House who thinks it is wrong
to limit the expenditure of the European Commission to what it is at
the moment so that it cannot be increased. If there are such Members, I
hope that they will have the courage of their convictions and stand up.

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T20:19:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

hon. Gentleman highlighted the fact that there is a live debate on both
the shape or membership of the European Commission and on financing it.
Clause 2 provides for the current formula of one Commissioner per
member state to be maintained at least for the next Commission.
According to the explanatory notes, it also provides for a review of
that decision either before the 2019 European Commission is formed or
before the 30th member state joins the EU, whichever is sooner. We are
having this debate today, we had a debate on it on Second Reading and
it will continue to be debated. I want to highlight some of the
points that were made on Second Reading.</hs_Para>

are two sides to this debate. On the one hand there is a
complaint—one that I think we should listen to, and one I am
sure other hon. Members will make—that the European Commission
College of Commissioners has become too big and unwieldy. As the EU has
grown to 27 member states—soon to be 28—there are simply
too many Commissioners and that has had an effect on how it can take
decisions. The other side of the argument, put powerfully and
effectively by the Irish Government in recent years, is that for small
member states the 
<?notus-xml column=653?>current formula of one Commissioner per member state
guarantees an equality that would not otherwise be secured. That point
has been made in the intergovernmental conference and the convention,
in the constitutional treaty discussions and the Lisbon treaty
negotiations by Ireland and other small member states,
although not all. I mentioned last week that Denmark is of the
opinion that although it does not want to give away that equality, it
is worth giving it away in order to make the European Commission a more
effective decision-making

that is a fluid situation, so it would be unfair to both new and
existing member states. For example, the Polish economy is the only
economy that I can name, certainly in Europe, that did not go into
recession after the global financial crisis hit, and so its trajectory
is healthy. We would do well to remember that the success of the Polish
economy might mean, sooner than the hon. Gentleman might think, that it
will become a net contributor rather than a net

EU budget. According to the comparative table we received following
last Friday’s negotiations, however, that ceiling will increase
by 8% over the MFF period. I do not think that such a big victory. We
heard a lot of cheers earlier during the EU Council statement, but very
little attention was paid to that point, and it is a point worth
considering. That would be a more powerful demand for him to make of
the Government than their writing into this fairly minor Bill the

hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope) as I cannot

there are technical reasons concerning the consequences of my hon.
Friend’s amendment. Secondly, there are certain safeguards
within the current structure of the EU budget that mean that some of
the dangers about which he is concerned ought not to arise. Thirdly, I
hope to give him clear reassurances both about the Government’s
robust commitment to seeking every opportunity to secure greater
economies and efficiencies in EU expenditure and about some of the
negotiations and instruments where those objectives that he and
I share might be achieved.</hs_Para>

completely share my hon. Friend’s concern about the need to
improve efficiency in all EU institutions, including the European
Commission, but we need to be clear about what the consequences would
be were this amendment to be carried. The Bill provides simply for the
approval of the draft EU Council decision on the number of EU
Commissioners. The draft decision provides neither the scope to change
the allocation of resources within the Commission nor the power or
opportunity to influence the overall EU budgetary ceilings, the
individual budget headings, either on a multi-annual or annual
basis, or the allocation of resources within each of those budgetary
headings. Were it to be carried, therefore, the amendment would leave
the UK unable to agree to the change proposed to the number of
Commissioners, but would not provide the means by which to alter EU
expenditure in the way that he is seeking.</hs_Para>

amendment all that would happen is that my right hon. Friend or the

European countries, “I’m afraid we can’t agree to
this unless you agree that you won’t increase expenditure as a

Lidington:</Member></B> That brings me to my second point, which is
that if British Ministers were to open that kind of conversation with
our partners, their immediate response would be to say that such is
already provided for in the European Union’s budgetary set-up.
Even if the number of Commissioners increases to 28 or beyond, that
cannot result in any increase in the ceiling set by the multi-annual
financial framework, which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister
negotiated last week at the European Council; nor can an increase in
the number of Commissioners lead to an increase in annual spending
limits. To paraphrase what I think my hon. Friend said in moving his
amendment, if there has to be additional expenditure to provide for a
new Commissioner and his or her team, it would need to be found from
elsewhere in the European Union budget, subject to the ceilings set
unanimously by the European Council in respect of the multi-annual
framework and, subsequently, each annual budget negotiated and agreed
by qualified majority vote on a 12-monthly basis, so there is a measure
of safeguards already.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T20:31:19"></hs_TimeCode>also make this
point to my hon. Friend. I am the first to agree that when we look for
efficiencies and economies, we should not be shy about looking for
savings in small matters as well as large. However, we also need to be
clear about what an extra Commissioner would entail. It is true that it
would mean providing somewhere in the budget for a salary for that
Commissioner and their immediate cabinet. That money would have to be
found, within the ceilings, by sacrificing spending opportunities
elsewhere, but the process would not mean the creation of
entirely new directorates-general. Indeed, I can tell the House that
the discussions already under way about provision for a
probable new Croatian Commissioner involve the splitting up of existing
directorates-general and parcelling them in a slightly different way,
not adding to the overall number of new people working for the
Commission. We are talking about a redistribution of responsibilities
among a larger number of
Commissioners<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T20:32:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Government are committed at the moment, but it is certainly one idea
that is being discussed in think-tanks and elsewhere as a means of
trying to impose not just greater efficiency, but greater coherence on
the operations of the Commission. If we look at the Commission today,
to provide one illustration, we have a Commissioner for External
Relations, who is the High Representative on foreign policy, and we
have separate Commissioners for international development, for disaster
relief and for European Union enlargement. One conceivable model would
be to see those four portfolios given to a Commissioner who was head of
department and to subordinate Commissioners reporting to that more
senior post holder. That is one way of seeking greater efficiency, but

that reduction was completely impossible as it would lead to the

for Wolverhampton North East (Emma Reynolds) and for Caerphilly (Wayne
David) for the support that the official Opposition have given to the
Bill. It has been a significant piece of legislation on two counts.
First, it has been a useful test of the procedures included in the
European Union Act 2011. In the Act, we committed ourselves to
providing Parliament with more opportunities to scrutinise European
Union business, and the Bill is evidence that we are delivering on that
commitment. The requirement for debate and primary legislation to
govern these decisions has added to Parliament’s hold over EU
business.</hs_Para>

the proceedings on the Bill have shown that the Government have been
prepared to listen carefully to the views of parliamentary Committees.
As was said earlier, the Government originally thought that the
decision about the work programme of the Fundamental Rights Agency was
exempt from the requirement for primary legislation under the 2011 Act.
However, we took careful note of the serious argument put forward by
the European Scrutiny Committee of this House and the European Union
Select Committee of the House of Lords that that was not the
case. Our legal advisers looked again at the matter, and we accepted
that, on this occasion, Parliament was right. We accordingly brought
forward the necessary legislation.</hs_Para>

significance for that reason, even though it is small. When we are
debating European matters in the House, I often look to the other place
for wisdom and learning, but on this occasion, I looked at

one commissioner per member state. As I said on Second Reading and in

about the lack of

persuaded that it is perfectly sensible to allow the electronic version
of the official register to be binding. The multi-annual framework for
the agency is not a financial framework, and therefore is perhaps not
quite as important as the own-resources cap and the need to consider an
EU finance Bill in this Chamber. However, under article 312(4) of the
treaty on the functioning of the European Union, it is far from certain
that, even if the framework were a financial framework, it would enable
the inter-institutional agreement to come into effect and allow
inflation increases in that budget without the proper sanction of this
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021146000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0003.htm#13021146000054">The
debate on the number of commissioners is really significant. The
previous Labour Government entered into a deal at the European Council,
whereby they would agree to a commissioner for every member state and
implementing the necessary legislation at a later point, in order to
try to drive the Lisbon treaty through a second Irish referendum. Had
we known then that we would have this level of scrutiny here
and that the decision would be dependent on a vote in this Chamber,
where a Conservative-led Government have a majority, we could have made

should be rural weighting. We are talking not only about the distances
between villages and hamlets, but the distances between schools and the
number of small schools in rural areas that are the heart of the

that the fact that rural areas have older populations than urban

the costs of domiciliary care, one can feel the immense

has been said, rural areas have been poorly funded for a long time
compared with urban areas, despite the fact that the costs of delivery

urban areas, but pay council tax that is £75 per head higher.
Therefore, rural people, having paid more out of a lower income base,
have a level of spending power for services that is lower than that in
urban areas. There is no evidential base for that fundamentally unfair
situation. That is the point that I hope Ministers will take on
board<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T21:21:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021149000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0004.htm#13021149000006">There

Stuart:</Member></B> I thank my right hon. Friend. I will explain the
position. A year ago, a delegation went to see the Prime Minister to
deal with this issue. In the summer, the Department consulted on a new
way of looking at things that recognised the increased cost of sparsity
in the formula. It came out with a figure that looked very promising in
respect of reducing the 50% rural penalty. It then damped 75% of the
gain away so that there was a 2 percentage point closing of the gap
from a 50% rural penalty to one of merely
48%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021149000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0004.htm#13021149000009">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T21:23:35"></hs_TimeCode>

turned out that 500,000 people had been added to the population of
London. When that information is put in, the 2 percentage point
increase per head turns into a 0.2 percentage point

good news, which I can share with the House, is that the
Government’s settlement takes a 50% rural penalty and reduces it
by 0.2 percentage points to 49.8%. As I understand it, that is why
technically the Government can claim that there has been a narrowing of
the gap. It is pretty minuscule and nothing like the closing of
the gap that we were talking about in the summer, which even then was
derisory. Ministers are right, if they are doing so, to hold their

good enough. There will be a vote on Wednesday, and I hope that those
on the Front Benches will consider carefully the speeches made this
evening. All Government Members support the need for austerity and
strict control of the spending envelope, and we do not argue for
greater Government spending. We are saying, however, that at a time of
limited resources, the allocation of those resources is more, not less,
important. It may be politically more difficult and challenging and
take some courage, but if less resource is around, we cannot afford 
<?notus-xml column=670?>to punish further those who have already put up with too much. That is
our message to those on the Front Benches, and I sincerely hope they

Although West Devon council’s needs assessment was raised by

by 2.5%. Over the next three years it must take out £1.4 million

three are left and they might have a marginal and peripheral effect.
That is why West Devon council—which I use as a case study

clearly the concerns of Purbeck district council, part of which lies in
my constituency. It is obvious that rural councils will be subject to
extra costs when delivering services, but the question is, “How
much extra cost?”</hs_Para>

to make a plea for some work to be done on this question. Presumably,
there was some work done on it, because originally the local government
settlement was looking most promising, with some consideration given to
increasing funding in relation to sparsity, which was
excellent. But then along came damping, followed by the £8.5
million grant, which is positive, but for one year only. I want some
transparency. What is the deficit? If we knew that, and we could all
see what the position was, people would feel happier. Hearing about 1%
and 2%, or that rural councils are really better off, is confusing. Why
cannot we have a clear, pat answer —the position is
this, because of that. I do not see that that should be beyond the
bounds of
possibility.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021149000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0004.htm#13021149000019">While
the average awarded in Government grant per head of population last
year was £487, or £324 for rural areas, Purbeck received
only £215 per head. Average council tax in England is
£398, but in Purbeck it is £594. Everything is
exaggerated as we go through the figures. The pre-damping figure for
Purbeck was £295,000, but post-damping it is £121,000.
Surprise, surprise, when we get the share of the £8.5 million
grant, it is a mere £6,879 for Purbeck, which will not give a
great deal of scope for finding more efficiencies, if indeed there is
any more to
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021149000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0004.htm#13021149000020">We

have implemented so many cuts. We have the battle between the councils,

it.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_11_PT_1/6CDED463B6E81889EDB54AC34E474A7AD2B9B2CC" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 February 2013">Monday

Nokes</B> (Romsey and Southampton North) (Con):</Member> The stark
contrast between rural and urban areas is clearly demonstrated in my
constituency, part of which is drawn from the urban unitary area of
Southampton and the rest from the rural area served by Test Valley
borough council and Hampshire county council. They are good councils
working hard to deliver top-quality services at the most economic cost.
They are rightly proud of their combined record in that regard, but
they face difficult challenges because of the very nature of the
geography they must
cover.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021149000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0004.htm#13021149000022">Hampshire
is a county where town and country often meet, and where it is not
unusual even within boroughs for there to be massive contrasts between
the relatively highly populated urban centres and the vast rural areas
where populations are much more spread out; where schools serve vast
areas but comparatively fewer children; where refuse collection is much
more challenging just because of the sheer miles to be covered; and
where there are real problems in delivering adult social care because
the distances for carers to travel between elderly residents in need of
assistance are significant.</hs_Para>

of us representing rural areas can point to examples, and what we see
as the challenges, but the difficulty is that there is little hard
evidence. Instinctively, we may feel and see differences between rural
and urban, but research by the Department is desperately
needed to assess the extent of the disparity. Rural councils
cannot demand comparative evidence from their urban neighbours in order
to make a proper comparison, but such a comparison is desperately
needed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021149000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0004.htm#13021149000024">In
Hampshire, a population of 1.3 million is spread over 1,400 square
miles—it is the largest county in the south-east of England. But
its size brings about very real challenges. The 5,000 miles of road not
only need to be maintained properly, at a cost of £60 million a
year, including Operation Resilience, which completely resurfaces
Hampshire’s roads, but—as we can see today—those
same roads need to be gritted and
snow-ploughed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021149000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0004.htm#13021149000025">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:54:11"></hs_TimeCode>
course, we cannot guarantee that residents will live in the most
accessible parts of the county. We cannot be assured that schools will
be easy to access. In Hampshire, there are 500 schools varying in size
from just 50 pupils up to 1,800. In small villages in particular,
delivering education presents a challenge and prevents councils from
achieving economies of scale. In the Southampton part of my
constituency, primary schools have an average number on roll of nearly
250, whereas in some of my village schools the figure is only 50.

people require. How can we justify the fact that older patients in
inner-city authorities have three times the amount spent on their
cancer care than those living in a rural authority? For any condition
that we might want to consider—be it diabetes, arthritis or
dementia— 
<?notus-xml column=673?>rural local authorities’ needs will be higher. How do we justify
to our elderly constituents, or to a carer for someone with dementia,
that they are entitled to less? Why do we rate the value of an elderly

do in an inner-city area?</hs_Para>

consider health inequalities, but other parts of the budget are more
appropriately considered as modifiable areas for change. However, many
conditions are not modifiable as health inequality issues. Will the
Minister say what can be done to address health and social care needs?
It is not just about addressing need, but the cost of delivering care.
It might take a care worker in Devon 40 minutes to travel between
appointments, whereas distances and costs will be far less in
inner-city areas. There is also the consideration of whether a care
worker can be found at all in many rural areas. Will those on the Front
Bench consider the challenge of rurality? To be deprived in a rural
area is to be additionally deprived. I hope that Ministers will address
that by distributing funding more equitably to rural

nub of the argument, however, has to be about the communities

first, there will come a time when we treasure the food security
offered by those small farms, which do not exist independent of the
funding that the council is prepared to provide for schools, transport
or housing; secondly, tourism, which is one of the most rapidly growing
sectors in the rural economy, is dependent not on our weather or food,
but on a living landscape of humans; and finally, the fact that this is
something deeply precious to Britain. In this the 21st century, our
country has the privilege of being one of the most advanced developed
countries in the world. We can set an example to other countries of how
an advanced industrial economy should behave, what kind of civilisation
and future we want and what kind of landscape we imagine for our

that: it will determine whether instead of a network of small farms,

the few moments that I have left that the thinking behind this local

managed—although, I recognise, not to the extent that some would
have liked—to reduce the gap between rural and urban. We have
made adjustments to relative needs formulas to reflect the greater cost
of providing services in rural areas. That is one of only three formula
changes in the settlement. We have increased the weight of super-sparse
areas in the formula, doubled the sparsity weight for older
people’s social care, reinstated the sparsity adjustment for
county-level environmental protective and cultural services, and
introduced a sparsity adjustment for fire and rescue. As a result,
funding per head is falling by less in predominantly rural authorities

was said by the Minister, who dealt with us very fairly. However, I ask
him to listen, and to ensure not only that the words with which he is
provided by his civil servants show that money has been given to rural

statistics. This is not about spending power; it is about what the
councils are given in grant. We are seeking a fair share, and Members
across the House have made a powerful case for that tonight. I welcome
the fact that the Minister will look at the funding for 2014-15,

highlight the antisocial and criminal behaviour of a tiny minority of

are blood sports enthusiasts who have been getting away with this

from the mindless yobs that blight some of our urban housing estates,

supporters, and I would like to give the House just one example of an
incident that happened to me. Following a lengthy car chase, my vehicle
was rammed by a supporter of the Quorn Hunt who was driving a Land

cannot understand why some Government Members want to bring back this

blood sports to remain consigned to the dustbin of history. As my hon.

Act should have consigned hunting to the dustbin of history, yet such
is the arrogance of some members of the hunting fraternity that they

nobody in this country is above the law—not even them.
Organisations including the League Against Cruel Sports, Hunt Watch,
Protect Our Wild Animals, the Hunt Saboteurs Association and the
International Fund for Animal Welfare, along with many other
conscientious individuals, have continued to monitor hunt activity.
They all tell a consistent story: hunt violence and hunt havoc continue

have been genuinely shocked by the evidence that has been passed to me
about the behaviour of these common criminals. Antisocial behaviour,
intimidation, harassment and even violence directed towards those
monitoring their activities are all too commonplace. I could not
believe that the violence and intimidation, which I witnessed in the
1970s, is even worse today. The disregard for the wider rural community
is another feature of their selfish, arrogant behaviour, which includes
road blocking; invading and damaging private property; rampaging
hunting dogs killing livestock and beloved pets; causing road traffic
accidents; and recklessly trespassing on railway lines.</hs_Para>

the public must have confidence that the authorities will take action.

police an assault that was captured on film. She was told to attend the
police station with evidence of the assault, but, after reviewing the
DVD, police officers told her that no offences had been committed. They
said that there were just some driving issues that the offenders would

severe distress to many of the cattle. In Somerset, a sheep farmer

unacceptable, whether that is violence towards those who are hunting or
towards those who are protesting against hunts. As with any violent

violence occur at a

hon. Gentleman also said that he wanted me to direct chief constables
to do certain things. I should point out to him as gently as I can that
it is not for Ministers to tell chief constables how to do their job.
One of the things that we most cherish about British policing is that
the police are operationally independent, and when politicians try to

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T22:21:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (Simon Hart)
said, on both sides of the hunting debate it is possible for people to

me turn to the question of policing at hunts very directly. There are
over 325 registered hunts in England and Wales. Together they have
carried out over 70,000 days’ 
<?notus-xml column=687?>hunting since the Hunting Act came into force in 2005. From 2005 to
2011, the latest year for which official figures are available, a total
of 332 individuals were prosecuted under the Hunting Act. Of these, 239
were found
guilty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T22:22:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021151000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0004.htm#13021151000110">The
Association of Chief Police Officers has issued guidance to forces on
the enforcement of the Hunting Act. This guidance reinforces the
general position that the deployment of police officers, including for
enforcement of the Hunting Act, is an operational matter for the police
force concerned. The police, of course, have an important duty to
enforce the law, but this general duty to enforce the law is subject to
the normal discretion of chief constables, who are required to balance
resources and priorities. The Hunting Act is no exception to this
principle. It is up to the police to decide what resources they use to
enforce and prioritise the
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T22:23:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021151000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0004.htm#13021151000111">The
hon. Gentleman indicated that he thought the police were perhaps
neglecting this because of the absence of sufficient resources. The
Government have no choice but to deal with the deficit and that means
that all public services must constrain their spending. Her
Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary has made it clear that
there is no simple link between officer numbers and crime levels,
between numbers and the visibility of the police in the community, or
between numbers and the quality of service provided.</hs_Para>

hope that hon. Members in all parts of the House and on both sides of
this passionate debate would welcome the fact that in the first two
years of this Government, crime fell by 10%. On both measures of crime
it is clearly falling and it is perfectly clear that the police, even
with the constraints on resources, are able to do their job better than
ever before. There is no argument to be made at all that resources are
restricting the police from doing their basic job of cutting crime.
That applies across the
board.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021151000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0004.htm#13021151000113">Let

Williamson:</Member></B> The right to protest is not what I was talking
about in relation to hunt monitors, who are engaged in a perfectly
legal and lawful activity in monitoring the activities of the hunting
fraternity, partly to make sure that they do not transgress the law.
Indeed, evidence garnered by hunt monitors has led to numerous
successful prosecutions. It is not about protest: it is about monitors
being allowed to go about their lawful

Green:</Member></B> Indeed. I have already, I hope, enlightened the
House with the number of prosecutions. If the hon. Gentleman is
arguing that hunts are not being properly policed, I simply point out
that there have been 332 prosecutions and in 239 of those people were
found guilty. Whether he regards monitors as protestors or as something
else, it is clear that the police are doing their job, as is the rest
of the criminal justice system, and people are being prosecuted
successfully.</hs_Para>

monitors, protestors, or whatever we wish to call them need to be
balanced with the rights of others to go about their business without
fear of intimidation or of serious disruption to the community. The
police have a responsibility to assess and manage

protestors, monitors and event organisers to enable peaceful activities
to take place. It is clear that on either side of this debate none of
these rights extends to violent or threatening behaviour. It is not
acceptable for peaceful and law-abiding people to be attacked by others
for expressing their views, and the police will and do act if that
happens.</hs_Para>

Does he agree that that commitment and the rhetoric of senior Ministers
are, as I said in my speech, tantamount to tacit approval for those who
are transgressing the Hunting Act to continue to do so? They may be
misinterpreting them—I am sure that Ministers would not
encourage people to break the law—but does the Minister not
understand how the hunting fraternity might take that as tacit approval
to break the Hunting
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T22:33:27"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021151000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0004.htm#13021151000130"><B><Member ContinuationText="Damian Green" PimsId="3546" UID="13021151000208" xid="236" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0004.htm#13021151000208">Damian

makes promises to change the law. Nobody takes that as tacit approval
to break the law. If they did, no party would, responsibly, ever
promise to change the law at any election and, therefore, there would
be no point in having elections or election manifestos. As I hope the
House will have observed, I am trying to steer a course, but I have to
say to the hon. Gentleman that I absolutely reject his

I have said, the time is not appropriate and we are not prioritising

Violence against those who do or do not support hunting is

identify and prosecute the perpetrators of violent crime, using the

Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
(Michael Fallon):</Member></B> In my written ministerial statement of
17 January 2013, <I>Official Report</I>, column 41WS, I announced that
Ministers reserve the option to award Regional Growth Fund (RGF)
support flexibly. This allows us to respond quickly to specific
economic opportunities or shocks in order to ensure that we do
everything that we can to maximise growth in the most vulnerable parts
of the country. This will be in exceptional circumstances only and will
take place outside the normal bidding process, although detailed due
diligence requirements will still need to be
met.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1302111000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/wmstext/130211m0001.htm#1302111000014">Part
of the Government role in their commitment to growth is to discuss
investment opportunities with private sector organisations and local
bodies. Where a proposal for securing investment, and associated
employment opportunities aligns with the principles of the RGF and
there is no routine chance to bid—either because no bidding
round is open or because an investment decision is needed
imminently—RGF support can and should be possible, to realise
those growth
opportunities.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1302111000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/wmstext/130211m0001.htm#1302111000015">Exceptional
RGF (eRGF) will therefore be considered by Ministers as a way to
support credible proposals for growth by allowing RGF money to be
awarded at any appropriate time. In this way, we continue in our aim to
rebalance the economy and support business
growth.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1302111000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/wmstext/130211m0001.htm#1302111000016">One
of the strengths of the RGF to date has been its competitive nature. In
the absence of an open competition, eRGF cases will be benchmarked
against similar bids from previous rounds to assess their relative
value for money. In each case Ministers will also seek independent
advice before approving eRGF
support.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1302111000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/wmstext/130211m0001.htm#1302111000017">Exceptional
RGF funds will be met from existing budgets by recycling money from
previous RGF rounds where bidders have withdrawn or reduced their grant
amount. In this way, we ensure that RGF funds continue to be spent on
RGF objectives, to enable investment, support growth and create
jobs.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1302111000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/wmstext/130211m0001.htm#1302111000018">As

Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Steve
Webb):</Member></B> I am pleased to announce that later today we intend
to lay regulations to include universal credit in the list of
qualifying benefits that currently act as an initial gateway to the
three regulated social fund schemes (i.e. the Sure Start maternity
grants, funeral payments and cold weather payments). The other
qualifying criteria that also apply to these schemes will continue as
now with some modifications being made to the cold weather payment
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1302111000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/wmstext/130211m0001.htm#1302111000128">As
universal credit is both an in and out of work benefit and does not
exactly mirror the existing income-related benefits, the cold weather
payment scheme has had to be modified. In addition, to ensure that the
underlying principles behind the scheme continue to apply—that
additional support is given to help the most vulnerable with the extra
costs associated with heating the home during severe weather
periods—a further qualifying criterion has been introduced for
recipients of universal credit, which restricts access to those not in
employment. An exception to this criterion has been made for families
with a disabled child or
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1302111000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/wmstext/130211m0001.htm#1302111000129">Two
further changes have been made to the funeral payment scheme. The first
relates to the introduction of universal credit. Because elements for
housing benefit will be included in the universal credit assessment and
payments will be made monthly, changes must be made to prevent any
final benefit arrears owing to the deceased from extinguishing an award
being made to the person taking responsibility for the funeral. The
second change removes council tax benefit from the list of qualifying
benefits that currently act as an initial gateway to the scheme
following the decision to abolish council tax benefit from 1 April 2013
in favour of localised
provision.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1302111000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/wmstext/130211m0001.htm#1302111000130">With
the exception of the cold weather payment scheme, all the changes are
due to come into effect from 1 April 2013 to ensure the changes are in
place for the commencement of the universal credit pathfinder. The
changes relating to cold weather payments will come into
effect from the start of the winter season 1 November

Ministry of Defence (MOD) has explored a number of possibilities to
improve the access of armed forces personnel to financial services and
has considered the concept of a credit union or an armed forces bank.
The current view is that a credit union is likely to be too restrictive
in how it might operate and what it can provide.</hs_Para>

undertaken other work to address concerns about access to credit and
mortgages for service personnel and ways of improving financial
awareness and capability. Working with representative bodies from the
financial sector, charities and other organisations there is a
commitment from the financial sector to raise awareness within their
membership of the unique nature of life in the armed forces. When
considering lending in any form to service personnel the principle
followed will be that those who serve with the armed forces should not
be disadvantaged because of their occupation.</hs_Para>

passing through Parliament. It sets out the new arrangements for the
creation of schemes for the payment of pensions and other benefits. It
also protects the benefits already earned by members of existing

schemes for certain categories of people who are closest to retirement.
The provisions of this Bill, once enacted, will bind any existing law,
including the Prerogative Instruments. In particular, clause 3 of the
Bill permits scheme regulations made under clause 1 to amend, in
certain circumstances, other legislation, and clause 18(8) explicitly

Defence policy on this is entirely consistent with our obligations
under international law and we will continue to operate within the
constraints of such law, namely: distinction, discrimination,
proportionality and necessity. Additionally, prior to carrying out any

casualties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021136000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/text/130211w0001.htm#13021136000066">The

ignoring new information about defence equipment acquisitions. The
policy decision taken in the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review
to purchase the carrier variant of the Joint Strike Fighter was right,
based on the information available at the time. More detailed technical
work subsequently revealed that the costs and risks would be greater,
and delivery timescale for a converted carrier longer than previously
anticipated. In light of that assessment we took the decision to revert
to the Short Take-Off Vertical Landing (STOVL) variant of the Joint
Strike Fighter. This is an example of the Government being prepared to
make difficult decisions, and represents a clear break from the past in
the way the MOD now conducts its business.</hs_Para>

in the UK nuclear market, including from a diverse range of potential
new entrants. We welcome EDF Energy's continued commitment to taking

Phase Two scheme, the noise appraisal has sought only to identify areas
at relatively greater risk of experiencing noise impact. This will help
determine the potential need for, and approximate location of, noise
mitigation. With this mitigation included in the design, the noise
model will be re-run for the preferred scheme to obtain a clearer early
view on where noise impacts are likely to be. An environmental impact
assessment for the scheme taking account of a wide range of
environmental information is proposed to commence in 2015 and will be

advise on the development of fisheries management measures and is
established under the current common fisheries policy (CFP). The
councils are stakeholder-led organisations comprised principally of
fishermen and other representatives of interests affected by the CFP.

advisory councils are likely to play an invaluable role in the
establishment of a more regionalised approach to fisheries management
under CFP reform. I am therefore pleased that advisory councils have
recognised the importance of a strong voice for small-scale fishers and

stakeholders, covering the entire fishing fleet, to include the full

gas unit, which is comprised of four national officers working full
time on the regulation of unconventional gas activities. This unit then
calls in resource from staff in other parts of the organisation, such

substances as well as operational and legal teams, as and when
necessary. The work load fluctuates and these specialists undertake a
wide range 
<?notus-xml column=465?>of regulatory roles so are not solely dedicated to regulating and

pupil premium is a significant Government investment in addition to
mainstream school funding, for which schools are accountable to parents
and to their local communities. The Government is determined to narrow
attainment gaps between disadvantaged pupils and their peers, and that
is why we have introduced the pupil premium. This investment currently
stands at £1.25 billion this year and will rise to £1.875
billion in 2013-14. We believe that head teachers and school leaders
should decide how to use the pupil premium, as they are the
professional experts who know their own pupils' needs. This means that
we also expect schools to take the lead responsibility in assessing and

inspectors look at a wide range of evidence to inform their judgements
about a school. Ofsted uses floor standards to help inspectors
determine the judgement on the achievement of pupils at a school. When
judging achievement, inspectors take account of both pupils' progress
and their attainment. Where attainment is consistently below floor
standards, then achievement is likely to be found to be inadequate. If
pupils are consistently making less than expected progress—a
situation which would apply to a school consistently below the floor
standards for progress—then it is likely that achievement would
be judged inadequate.</hs_brev>

for the humanitarian situation in South Sudan stands at £48

channelled through the Common Humanitarian Fund, World Food Programme
and a £5 million contribution to UN High Commissioner for
Refugees to help, in part, to prepare for additional refugees in 2013.

humanitarian situation in both Sudan and South Sudan. In Sudan we are
particularly concerned for civilians caught up in fighting in the
border states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. We are also deeply
worried about the recent escalation of conflict in North Darfur which
is affecting 100,000 people. South Sudan remains in the grip of a
long-term, complex humanitarian crisis. This has resulted from large
numbers of internally displaced people from conflict and flooding, a
flow of returnees from Sudan, and a general food security problem,
faced by much of the population. The situation has been further
exacerbated by the influx of around 175,000 refugees from Southern
Kordofan and Blue Nile into both Unity and Upper Nile States. I have
visited both Darfur and South Sudan in the last four months to see
first-hand the humanitarian
situation.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_11_PT_1/271FA0370A56AB0E87FA401AF4A6E47D46160886" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="11 February 2013">Monday

that influence the happiness and well-being of UK citizens (142472),

made an official assessment of the top ten issues that influence the
happiness and well-being of UK citizens. The National Well-being
framework that ONS has developed following 
<?notus-xml column=493?>the National Debate on how to measure well-being recognises that
individual's subjective well-being is influenced by a broad range of
factors including: personal relationships, health, what we do, where we
live, personal finance, education and skills, the economy, governance
and the natural environment. Added to this, sustainability, fairness
and equality were also seen as important aspects for consideration when
assessing the nation's well-being.</hs_brev>

specific measures that are related to an individual's subjective
well-being are also related to each other such as age, employment
status, marital status and health. ONS is currently undertaking work to
understand better the drivers of subjective well-being. Preliminary
results suggest that for the measures available, self reported health,
relationship status, employment status and ethnicity are most strongly
related to subjective well-being. ONS plans to publish a report
providing more detailed results in April or May 2013. Subsequent
analysis including income and wealth is also planned.</hs_brev>

published estimates of people's views of their community involvement
and belonging in the ‘Where we live' article in July 2012, but
did not analyse how these are associated with levels of subjective
well-being. However, it does provide estimates of how people's
satisfaction of their local area is associated with life satisfaction.
Of those who reported a medium/high satisfaction (seven to 10 out of
10) with their local area, 19% reported a low satisfaction (zero to six
out of 10) with their life. However, of those who reported a low
satisfaction with their local area, 42% reported a low satisfaction
with their life. It must be noted that 58% who reported a low
satisfaction with their local area also reported a medium/high
satisfaction with life.</hs_brev>

and a guaranteed job interview typically follow pre-employment
training. Given this, pre-employment training will show a higher number

have been clear in public information that 8% is a minimum amount and
we are keen for people to save more if they can. However, our priority
is the successful roll out of automatic enrolment and it is important
to encourage people to start saving before suggesting that they save
more. That is why minimum contributions are being phased in over six
years to help both employers and individuals adjust gradually to the
additional costs of saving. Phasing is not compulsory, and employers
and individuals may contribute more than the minimum requirement at any
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021150000645" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/text/130211w0003.htm#13021150000645">In

Government strongly believes that looking at relative income in

which is why the Government is currently consulting on a measure of
child poverty that will better reflect the reality of living in poverty
in the UK today. More information is provided in the answer given to
the hon. Member for Kingswood (Chris Skidmore) on 15 January
2013, <I>Official Report</I>, columns 715-7W (PQ 137238). In relation
to the Welfare Benefits Up-rating Bill, we have protected disability
and carer benefits wherever possible by ensuring that the 
<?notus-xml column=509?>main rates of disability living allowance, attendance allowance and
carer's allowance will be up-rated in line with inflation. In addition,
the premiums paid to disabled people receiving working-age
income-related benefits, the disability elements in tax credits, and

estimate that around an extra 50,000 disabled individuals will be

0345 prefix. Based on current charging arrangements, our analysis shows
that the impacts of such a change would be increased call costs for
many callers and additional costs to DWP of around £2 million
per annum. There would also be significant operational costs to support
an initial transition to the new numbers. We will review our numbering
strategy on receipt of Ofcom's final report following their
consultation on non-geographic call charges, which is understood to be
due for publication in March. Any changes to the current approach will
need careful consideration given the impacts on costs to the Department

valuable contribution to helping unemployed people back to work through
work clubs and by offering work experience places, internships,

one motivation for employers doing this, but many employers believe it
makes good business sense to offer unemployed people the practical help

the Abortion Act 1967, as amended. Anyone operating outside of the Act
is committing a criminal offence and will be reported to the
appropriate authorities. Ultimately, it is for the Crown Prosecution

have no evidence that doctors are misreporting abortions, and the
discrepancies in the data are in part due to the way the various

their data has been interpreted incorrectly. For example, departmental
statistics on fetal abnormality are compiled and published based on the

Government Department with responsibility for food safety, has drawn
attention to the fact that aluminium is ubiquitous in the environment
and is therefore inherently present in food. While higher levels can
have neurotoxic effects, both the European Food Safety Authority and
the World Health Organisation and Food and Agriculture Organisation
Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives have considered the safety of
aluminium in food and established a Tolerable Weekly Intake. This takes
into account the very low absorption of aluminium from food into the

The Government's independent expert advisory Commission on Human

human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine under continual close monitoring
since it was first used in the UK in September 2008. After the first
two years of the immunisation programme and more recently in September
2012 after the fourth year, the MHRA sought the advice of the CHM on
the safety experience of Cervarix. The CHM advised that after 6 million
doses of the vaccine in the UK the number and nature of adverse
reaction reports was as expected, no serious new risks had been
identified and agreed that the balance of its benefits and risks
remains positive. This report is available on the MHRA

included in the Public Health Outcomes Framework was refined in the
November 2012 refresh of the framework to be a measure of social
isolation. This indicator will be shared with the Adult Social Care
Outcomes Framework. It has been initially established as an interim
measure of social isolation; as current data sources only allow
measurement in adults currently in receipt of social care services and
their carers. However, we are working to develop a broader
population-based measure of loneliness, which would be included in both
the Adult Social Care and Public Health Outcome Frameworks. To ensure
that this measure is helpful to local commissioners, we are working
with key partners—including the Campaign to End
Loneliness—on its development.</hs_Para>

Kingdom has in place a statutory veterinary residue surveillance scheme
in fulfilment of its obligations under council directives 96/22/EC and
96/23/EC and (EC) 854/2004, Annex I, Chapter II, F. This programme
helps to ensure that consumers are protected against potentially
harmful residues of veterinary medicines. The Veterinary Medicines
Directorate (VMD) is responsible for the co-ordination and management
of the UK programme. The FSA undertakes the collection of samples from
approved slaughterhouses under contract to the VMD. In Northern
Ireland, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development carries
out the collection of samples. The scheme is a targeted scheme with no
requirement for the carcases to be held until sample results have been
released.</hs_Para>

the FSA is conducting a 100% survey at approved slaughterhouses for
residues of phenylbutazone in horses submitted for slaughter with
passports confirming they are not exempt from entering the food chain.
The survey currently is not requiring carcases to be held pending test
results but the FSA is finalising arrangements to move to a positive
release scheme whereby the horse carcases will be held pending negative
results at which time the carcases will be released and allowed to
enter the human food chain.</hs_Para>

conversion therapy and it is not a National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence recommended treatment. It is for commissioners of
NHS services to ensure that treatment and care, including therapy, is
provided to every patient without any form of discrimination. Clinical
commissioning groups (CCGs) will in future commission the majority of
health care services. As public sector organisations, they will be
subject to the specific duties of the public sector Equality Duty under
the Equality Act 2010. Therefore CCGs must, in the exercise of their
functions, have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct
prohibited under the Act.</hs_Para>

partnerships funded primarily by the local authority and local

Ministry of Justice contributes funding through the Youth Justice Board
(YJB) in the form of youth justice grants to YOTs.</hs_Para>

2011, the YJB distributed such grants to 158 YOTs. Individual
contributions vary but on average the youth justice grant represents
around a third of a YOT's funding. The following data have been
