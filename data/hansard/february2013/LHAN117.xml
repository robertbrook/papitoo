Deighton:</Member></B> As always, I thank my noble friend for his
important observations. There are, again, several of issues in there.
First, he is absolutely right—Moody’s refers to
this—that two things have caused this downgrade. The first is
the sluggish growth of the global economy, which has slowed down the
British economy; and the second is the very high levels of public and
domestic debt, and the difficulty in driving those
down.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000009">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:10:13"></hs_TimeCode>
the second point, with respect to the credibility of the rating
agencies, there are some very important issues surrounding that,
particularly when one discusses complex securities such as the ones
that we had in the mortgage-backed market. Frankly, with respect to the
sovereign market, all the information used to determine credit
assessments is perfectly visible to everyone, which is why the
markets’ reaction to the downgrade on Friday was so
measured<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:10:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Peston" PimsId="165" UID="13022766000234" xid="1171" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000234">Lord
Peston:</Member></B> My Lords, bearing in mind that these agencies give
the same grade to an enormous and widely different range of borrowers,
leading economists pointed out a long time ago that they cannot be, and
should not be, taken seriously. Also, is the Minister aware that all
the best economic research shows that one major force exacerbating the
economic troubles of the past few years has been the rating agencies?
Would he remind the House who is supposed to be regulating these
agencies and why they have not intervened? If they have not intervened,
is it not about time that someone did something about them? These
agencies are a real danger to the survival of the world economy, and I
am amazed that the Chancellor himself takes them
seriously<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:11:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deighton" PimsId="7002" UID="13022766000235" xid="2168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000235">Lord
Deighton:</Member></B> The noble Lord makes some very important
observations. First, as I am sure he knows, one of the rating agencies
is being sued by the US Government, reflecting the very concerns that
he brings out. With respect to relatively simple credit considerations,
and in terms of the UK economy the information is all out there, the
Chancellor’s economic policy and the performance of the UK
economy is evaluated every second of every day by the financial
markets. The verdict of those markets is reflected in our historically
low gilt yields. This morning we were trading in the 10-year gilt below
2%, which is the most profound commentary on the success of the UK
Government’s current economic
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:12:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Kramer" PimsId="5891" UID="13022766000236" xid="2104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000236">Baroness
Kramer:</Member></B> My Lords, the underlying issue is surely growth.
Yesterday, Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, floated
the idea of levying a penalty on banks that park their money at the
central bank rather than putting it into the real economy. What comment

policy. We have had a number of debates on creativity to restore a
focus on growth and not

and demonstrate the importance of generating growth. We should have the
debate but be very focused on sticking to a monetary policy that

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, I am not sure that I accept the
specific question of my noble friend. It is better to have an entirely
consistent strategy of fiscal consolidation to ensure that we regain
our credibility in the financial markets so that we can continue to
borrow at these historic low rates. If we have a choice between funding
capital spend—let us call it that—and current spend, all
other things being equal, I would choose capital spend. We saw that in
the Autumn Statement, when the Government switched £5.5 billion,
if my memory is correct, into financing capital spending because that
yields better to improve the growth process. However, it all needs to
be done in the context of balancing other important consumer and
political
objectives.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_27_PT_1/7BC39E5049C8587ED1947060BB4C7AD080430C0F" __version__="1.10"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 February 2013">Wednesday,

that in the post-colonial age some of the place names associated with

there is a programme called Livingstone 2013, in which the British High
Commission has been very actively involved. My noble friend also asks
about Scotland. The National Museum of Scotland has a special
commemorative exhibition, which has run since November until April this
year. There will be events on the day. My right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for International Development is planning a flagship
event at Abercrombie House in East Kilbride, the offices of the

this Minister will recognise that tightening the Act in the way that
has been suggested will damage transparency. He will recall that the
previous Government at one point proposed to increase fees for
accessing freedom of information requests and then dropped the proposal
when they realised the damage that that would do to transparency. Are
the Government now downplaying that risk to transparency, and doing so

gone on since the start of the freedom of information debate about
whether, at the very heart of government, a safe space was needed for
genuine discussions. At the moment, I am having discussions with
colleagues about these ideas and principles and in due course I will
inform the House and give it an opportunity to comment on this. It is
always an interesting balance. We have faced this problem for a decade
or more since we debated these principles in this House. Indeed, we had
a very interesting debate a few months ago where a whole clutch of
former mandarins gave their opinions about what is called the
“chilling effect” of freedom of information. I do not
accept that there is such a chilling effect, but I do accept that it is

scaling up their work in fragile and conflict-affected states. We have
committed to spending 30% of official development
assistance—ODA—by 2014-15 to support these countries and
to tackle the drivers of instability. In 2011, £58.7 million of
ODA was spent on multilateral peacekeeping operations. This represented
less than 1 per cent of the UK ODA spend in 2011 and we anticipate that
it will remain at a similar

Northover:</Member></B> I suggest that the noble Baroness reads what
the Prime Minister said. She will find that it is perfectly consistent
with the approach taken by her Government. We work across the MoD, the
FCO and DfID to do what we can to tackle instability in some of the
poorest countries. It is because they are fragile states that there are
such levels of poverty and such a lack of development. That is why it
is extremely important to work to support those countries.
DfID’s conflict pool and the Building Stability Overseas
strategy build on what the previous Government rightly did. This is
controlled by the OECD definition of ODA, which does not allow spending
for military uses. Therefore it could not come out of DfID’s
budget. DfID needs 
<?notus-xml column=1071?>to reach its 0.7% contribution to aid, and we are committed to that. If
this came out of it, it would not reach that
0.7%<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:33:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000049"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Alderdice" PimsId="3622" UID="13022766000272" xid="1044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000272">Lord

are critical not just in fragile states but in the development of all

Northover:</Member></B> My noble friend is right to ask for that. It is
extremely clear that the OECD defines what does and does not count as
overseas development assistance. Most of our peacekeeping, for example,
goes through the UN. Some 6% of that budget counts as ODA, and the rest
does not. With the EU civilian missions, 100% counts under the ODA
rules. This is extremely clearly defined. Where the MoD supports
humanitarian assistance—the Navy, for example, supplies tents,
as it did in Jamaica after the hurricane—that is counted as
assisting and not as providing military equipment. These things are
clearly
defined.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000051"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:34:43"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Collins of Highbury" PimsId="5919" UID="13022766000274" xid="2127" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000274">Lord

trivial matter. It represents a considerable shift in process because
it removes a democratically elected council’s role of having the
first engagement with the planning process. We know that the Government
consulted on the thresholds for poor performance and a failing
authority; that is, 30% or fewer major applications determined within
the statutory period or more than 20% of major decisions overturned on
appeal. The consultation has now ended, although we do not yet have
sight of the full government response. We have just—hot off the
press, I think—received a summary of the consultation responses.
These show that less than half of respondents supported the speed and
quality approach; that less than half of respondents agreed with
assessing major developments within statutory time limits over two
years; that only about a quarter expressed support for quality being
assessed as the proportion of major decisions being overturned on
appeal; and that less than half agreed with the 30%/20% formulation. It
seems that there is a long way to go for there to be good levels of
buy-in to this approach. What are the Government going to do given this
response to the consultation? It is slightly worrying that they are on
record as saying that they will not deliver their response until after
the Bill has received Royal Assent.</hs_para>

Committee, concern was expressed about the need for greater reassurance
and stronger safeguards in relation to the way that this clause could
be used. This was also reflected in the reports of the Delegated Powers
and Regulatory Reform Committee and the Select Committee on the

reassurance by making very clear in the Bill the circumstances in which
this clause may be used and by providing Parliament with an opportunity
to consider the criteria by which planning authorities’
performance would be assessed.</hs_para>

that applications for major development only can be submitted directly
to the Secretary of State. The point was made quite forcefully in
Committee that there should be a determination as to which applications
were caught by these provisions. A number of noble Lords argued for
this, and what we are doing now gives the Secretary of State the power
to prescribe what “major development” means for this
purpose. We intend to use the existing definition found in secondary
legislation; for example, 10 houses or more or an equivalent amount of
commercial space. This approach reflects the change that the noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie, proposed in Amendment 3, and I am grateful to him

could be designated under the clause only if it is not performing

in doing this we are responding positively to the arguments put forward
in Committee. Secondly, it requires that the criteria for designating
authorities—and, indeed, for lifting any designation—must
be laid before both Houses for a period of 40 sitting days before they
come into effect only if there has been no vote in either House to the
effect that the document should not be approved. We will come to what

believe these changes provide a powerful safeguard against any
perceived future misuse of the powers that Clause 1 confers on the
Secretary of State. I do not think there is any need to go further and
require an affirmative procedure for the criteria, as
Amendments 1 and 14 would require, as that would take us
well beyond the sort of safeguards that underpin other performance
regimes. It is also worth noting that where similar powers were taken
by the previous Government in the Local Government Act 1999, the
Education Act 1996 and the National Health Service Act 2006 there is no
parliamentary scrutiny on the criteria that the relevant Secretaries of
State use before exercising their powers. To go further than we propose

amendment is tabled because of a gap in the concept of designation. Of
all the evidence of poor performance by a planning authority, the one
that has a particularly adverse effect on quality of life, as well as
the local economy, is bad design, coupled with lack of sustainability,
but that is not specified in the Bill. That power is open to wide
discretion, whereas, at the other extreme, the consultation’s
proposals for failing authorities are pretty mechanistic and relate to
speed 
<?notus-xml column=1076?>and appeal decisions—not tests of quality
but, rather, tick-box exercises to check compliance. The impact of
designation on local democracy is very powerful, and speed and
compliance with the NPPF with regard to appeal decisions should not, I
submit, be enough to prompt a designation decision. That should be
taken in the round and take full account of the quality of outcomes.
That is particularly important because the broad principles in the NPPF
are themselves open to quite a degree of interpretation.</hs_para>

vague, wide power in the Bill and narrow, mechanistic tests
for failure omit the real point of good planning—to approve
development that is durable and practical, acceptable to residents and
capable of improving their total environment as well
as, in the long term, saving public money. That cannot be
done without an informed approach to design; but design capacity is
still very patchy among planning authorities, and many succumb to the
will or blandishments of developers who may well not
have the long-term interest of the local
community at heart.</hs_para>

amendment makes it necessary for the Secretary of State to consider
what the authority has done by way of contributing to sustainable
development and good design, which complements existing duties in
planning legislation rather than enabling them to be overridden. He has
also to consider, in addition, what the local views are so that, for
instance, if a neighbourhood has developed design criteria but cannot
get the planning authority either to accept them or to draw up its own,
it is not short changed by the process. Finally, he must consider what
any wider public interest might be. That latter obligation enables
discretion to be used when necessary, so that it is not a matter of a
fixed threshold being triggered. Finally, the Secretary of State must
publish his or her reasons for designating according to the criteria in
the amendment, which element of transparency I hope that the noble
Baroness will also
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000076">In
conclusion, the amendment would go a long way to protect residents from
the kind of system failure in design and sustainability which poor
planning authorities all too often let themselves in for. In that way,
growth and infrastructure really could work properly. I commend the

Hanham has tabled to this clause. I have recognised from the beginning
that it has been very controversial, not least among local authorities.
I, too, declare an interest here as a vice-president of the Local
Government Association. I have made it very clear to the association
that I support the main thrust of Clause 1, but equally I recognise its
desire to see the criteria dealt with more formally in the legislation.
The indications that we have had from the Government in this context
have been helpful, as has the Government’s amendment that it
will be subject to regulations under the negative procedure, as my
noble friend has indicated. These amendments are very welcome and take
some of the sting, which local authorities have felt, out of the

authorities need not be so worried about the remarks made by the noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, whose handling of this legislation I have
always admired; he is extremely thorough. He quoted some of the figures
from the summary of the consultation response, which I downloaded on my
computer yesterday and read. The important thing to recognise is that,
in the light of what I have just said about the general attitude of
most local authorities towards this clause, it is hardly surprising
that the response rate was not much more than 40 to 45%. One has to
recognise that of the 227 replies received, 67% were from councils. A
further 12% were from local government, professional or environmental
organisations, and around 12% were from development interests or
business groups. It was a pretty unbalanced response, but that is the
nature of consultation; it is the people who feel strongly about such
matters who respond. I am sure that those in the development industry
look at the clause and say this is a step in the right direction. It is
not surprising, given 
<?notus-xml column=1078?>the figures quoted by the noble Lord, that there
should have been what is, in a sense, a very heavily weighted response
on the part of the local authority world. This does not in any way

True:</Member></B> My Lords, I hesitate to take exception to any remark
made by my noble friend, who I have admired and worked with for so many
years, but local authorities are charged with the responsibility of
administering the planning system and have knowledge of so doing. It is
hardly surprising—in my view, they would be failing in their
professional duty—if they did not respond to a consultation
which affected the rights of planning authorities. In declaring my
interest as leader of a local authority, I confess that my own
authority was probably one among the number that raised a few question
marks about the clause as originally drafted, so I hope that the
Minister will not dismiss the representations made just because they
are made by local authorities.</hs_para>

my noble friend that the changes she has introduced are positive. I was

in her typical way, has listened to those concerns, as the noble Lord,
Lord McKenzie, very generously acknowledged. We have come a very long

I, too, agree with what Mr Boles said on the matter of design. There is
a question of whether that is a matter for the Bill but I agree with
the analysis that planning would be so much easier if design were
better. I would remark only that, as I said at an earlier stage, we
must avoid the risk of any kind of moral hazard in this legislation. In
terms of openness and the way in which designation is made, it is still
not clear to me—it is certainly not inherent in the
Bill—that where a future Secretary of State makes a designation
and takes the game away from a local authority with the view of making
a judgment on a major planning application, it must be the case that
any representations made to the Secretary of State before he makes that
designation become matters of public knowledge, in the same way as
representations in terms of planning are placed on a website.</hs_para>

interest has got at any Government behind the scenes, leading to the
designation of a local authority which may have been a little bit
awkward to somebody who wanted to get a major planning application
through. That is not an obstacle to what my noble friend has put before

both my noble friends who have just spoken; even though they started by
disagreeing with each other, in effect they are saying the same thing.
I recall recognising at Second Reading that the Minister is well known
for listening, and saying that on this occasion I hoped that she would
not only listen, characteristically, but hear and be able to act
accordingly. I am grateful that she has indeed listened and heard and
that we have these welcome amendments. I rather gather that the

saying that, I have had the chance only to have a very quick look at
the consultation results, which we received fairly late yesterday. I am
a little surprised that there is so much support for the proposals in
Clause 1, including from local authorities. I cannot help wondering
whether, if we were to consult now—I am not suggesting that we
should—on Clause 1 as it is likely to read after today, we might
see even better results. With the reassurances that have been, and I
think still will be, given on it, Clause 1 has been made far less
onerous than when we first looked at it. I welcome the movement from
the Government and their amendments before us today. They do not go as
far as some of us would wish but they go considerably further than we
might have hoped at an earlier stage and we on these Benches certainly
welcome them.</hs_para>

remember the whole purpose of this clause, which is to encourage good
and timely decisions from local authorities and to give applicants for
major development the choice of a much better service. There is no
question here that, where the authority is designated, an applicant
cannot still go to them. They are given the choice of being able to go
to a local authority or being able to go immediately to the
planning inspector. At the moment, they can do that after 13 weeks if
an application has not been dealt with, but now they can go right from

good development into account. The noble Lord, Lord Best, pointed out
very clearly what my honourable friend at the other end, Nick Boles,
has said. We believe very strongly in that. The national policy
framework deals with that as well and makes it very clear. However,

12 months and we did not need to argue over that. I have settled on 12

is a slightly different approach towards Clause 1 and

something negative which implies punishment at the end if you do not
comply, whereas I see incentive as encouragement, something positive,
to seek to improve. That is what the Government seek to achieve as
well. They are not out to punish local planning authorities—that

It also gives time for the Government and others to assess
the direction of travel of that local planning authority. If it is
improving at a significant rate, then to designate it at the end of

months. The intention is to give early warning to local authorities, so

thrust of the amendment is entirely reasonable. We suspect that the

time. Designation will be based on two years’ data and

for the end of year 2. Councils will be able to seek to
improve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T16:19:14"></hs_TimeCode>. This

Perhaps 
<?notus-xml column=1083?>the Minister will tell us whether there are any such
developments. In any event, on an ongoing basis, knowing in year 2 that
year 1 criteria have not been met may not give the local planning
authority sufficient time to improve. Improvement may in part depend on
the nature of any new applications. Tardy dealing with the major
development submitted in year 1 may affect the data for year
2. For a small local planning authority, staff sickness and the
timescales to recruit new staff are factors which anyway could mean

Hanham:</Member></B> I thank both noble Lords for these amendments,
which, as I have said, open up the discussions on the criteria and the
means of designation. 
<?notus-xml column=1084?>The noble Lord, Lord Tope, has said that with designation we should be
incentivising and not punishing. From the outset, I want to make it
clear that that is precisely what we are trying to do. While we
designate because of a performance, we are trying to ensure that that
performance improves. If this is an incentive to do that, that is
precisely what we are trying to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T16:24:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000117" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000117">How
the designation process will work is very important. As a matter of
course, we are consulting on it. I think that it would be helpful if I
begin by giving noble Lords an indication of what people have said and
how we intend to respond. The consultation closed on 17 January and, as
noble Lords have said, there were 227 responses, many of them from
planning authorities. There were, inevitably some differences of view
and, having looked carefully at the responses, we are in a position to
confirm how we plan to move forward on some of the key elements of the
proposals. We will of course publish a full response to the
consultation in due course, once the primary powers to be implemented
have been
finalised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000118" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000118">In
the light of the consultation we have concluded that the speed and
quality of decisions on planning applications are the most appropriate
basis for assessing the performance of local planning authorities for
the purpose of implementing this clause. The basis refers to the
specific thresholds where, as the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, rightly
said, 20% were lost on appeal and 30% assessed on speed or lack of
it—applying, in other words, to authorities that have had 20% or
more of their major decisions overturned at appeal, or that have
decided 30% or fewer of their major applications within the statutory
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000119" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000119">It
bears repeating that these are very low thresholds. The intention
behind them is to create a safeguard that encourages—or
incentivises—good performance rather than to see a lot of
designations. We remain of the view that designations should be a last
resort and that these thresholds are in line with that objective. We
will keep them under review—that is our starting point and firm
intention. Through the amendments that we have made to Clause 1,
Parliament will have the opportunity to consider the criteria before
they are
finalised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000120" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000120">There
was considerable support for our proposal to allow extensions of time
agreed between the local authority and the developer to be dealt with
separately from the performance figures that we currently collect. This
was one of the points addressed by the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie; where over time there are difficulties, as long as there is
agreement with the developer for an extension of that time for whatever
reason, that will not become part of the decision-making relating to
the designation. These performance figures are part of promoting a
simpler, more proportionate approach to planning performance
agreements. We will reflect this as quickly as possible in the data
that we collect. We also intend to proceed with our suggestion that any
authorities that fall below the performance thresholds are considered
for designation and dedesignation on an annual
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000121" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000121">In line
with this we have been giving particular thought to how we can put in
place a cycle of support for authorities that are at risk of
designation and have 
<?notus-xml column=1085?>actually been designated. This is important for two reasons.
First, by providing early support we very much hope that we can help
any authorities that may be struggling to improve sufficiently and so
avoid designation. Secondly, for authorities that have been designated
we will want to make sure that they can get out of it as quickly as
they can and that, if possible, designation can be lifted at the end of
a first
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000122">In the
light of the consultation responses, our position is that decisions
about dedesignation should be guided primarily by an assessment of what
the authority has done to address the reasons for underperformance, and
its capacity and capability to deal effectively with major
applications. This will mean reviewing at the time of
designation what the authority needs to do to reach a satisfactory
level of performance and to ensure that it can access whatever help may
be required. To provide that support we have been having helpful
discussions with the Local Government Association about the way that it
can best be provided to those local authorities. We agree with the LGA
that this is appropriately done by support from the sector, and that it
has a vital role to play in driving improvement in planning services

turn to Amendments 2 and 15. We will make sure that an authority has
sufficient advance notice of any designation, but that is not something

designation as soon as the relevant statistics become available. Of

identify those authorities that are at risk of designation in the
following year if their performance fails to recover. Tailored,
sector-led support will then be offered to those
authorities to give them 
<?notus-xml column=1086?>maximum opportunity to improve. So they will not
only have advance warning that they are at risk, but the opportunity to
address that situation. That is a key part of the discussions that we

considering the most appropriate period over which to assess
performance for those first designations. That is one of the points
raised, and we need to come to a decision about it. We are considering
the most appropriate period for that, so that the data which are taken
into account are as up to date as possible and reflect efforts by
authorities to improve their performance since this measure was
announced in September last year. In line with that objective, we will
bring forward the release of planning statistics for the period from
April to June this year so that this information can be taken into
account in assessing performance for those first designations. This
will give authorities more opportunity to improve their average
performance before any decisions are taken. We have also made it clear
that we will give any authorities proposed for designation an
opportunity to correct any errors. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, asked
me about what they will be able to do. They will be able to correct
errors in the data or explain if they present a misleading picture, but
there are limits; we cannot have a subjective process of special
pleading which would be neither fair nor transparent. So authorities
that may be designated will be given an opportunity to tell us if the
data are, for some reason, not representative of their true

have a sector-led approach to help them to improve. We are almost in

True:</Member></B> My Lords, I have an amendment in
this group, which the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, has effectively
summarised in the points made. I do not pretend that the specific
wording or format is necessarily correct, but none the less the broad
principle enshrined in it, and in what the noble Lord has just said, is
important. As this process goes forward there will inevitably be fears
that a Government—not this one necessarily—may in time
use this process to ensure that it is made easier to secure agreement
to major developments against the wishes of the local population. It
might be feared that that could be done either by having a process that
is conducted through written procedures or by a rather cursory
appearance from an inspector for a hearing in the local area. In this
process, a great deal also goes on in the pre-planning stage. Good
developers are these days very active and are often encouraged by local
authorities to meet local populations to discuss and undertake
consultation, perhaps in relation to what might be the specific local
community benefits that come from the development.
All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T16:42:12"></hs_TimeCode> those things
are best conducted locally, in the place and community where the

I said, I do not intend to try to write law that is prescriptive. My
noble friend gave some general reassurances earlier, but in both the
pre-planning stage and the period in which a planning application is
under consideration, it is absolutely essential that the Government
leave no suspicion in the minds of the public about their rights, about
which they feel ever stronger. Those of us who have the honour to
represent people in local authorities know that the people’s
wish to have their voice heard is greater, not less, as time

noble friend that if not the specifics of my amendment, certainly the
spirit of it will be written into whatever provision the Government
might follow up with as they refine secondary
legislation, codes of practice and so on, once the legislation becomes

an interest as someone helping people through a company with
sustainable development. It is on that point that I support what has
been said. It is not just a question of community not feeling that it
is being bypassed, although that is crucial and the gravamen of the
whole discussion. We also want to support those developers who do the

cut.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000178" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000178">One of
the encouraging things of recent years has been the increasing number
of developers who have understood that proper community consultation
early on makes their development not only more likely but probably
better. Many of them are taking seriously the fact that input from the
community can be not an incubus but a considerable advantage.
Therefore, I, too, hope that my noble friend will be able to give us an
assurance—which I am sure she would wish to give—that
this is a mechanism to achieve things which cannot otherwise be
achieved, rather than a mechanism to make easier to achieve things that
should not be achieved and would otherwise be stopped. That is the

less good to triumph over the good. Moreover, as my noble friend Lord
True rightly pointed out, we do not want the public to feel that they
are being railroaded about things in which they are increasingly
interested. We in this House ought to remind people that this is not
some evanescent view that will disappear. People will increasingly want
to have control over what happens in their own area; that is why we had
the Localism Bill. It is also true that, as the world outside becomes
more and more complex and people feel it is more and more difficult to
decide on how they will have some control over energy policy, the
European Union, the work of the United Nations and all the rest of it,
localism—the concept of at least having some real control over
the area around you—becomes a greater demand rather than a
lesser one. This is a crucial moment in this Bill, and the

aspects that have been raised. We are fully aware of the necessity to
ensure that residents and local communities are involved in any
planning application. In any planning application process, effective
community involvement is essential. It is a priority that we have been

Committee, I tried to be clear that we will ensure, through secondary
legislation, that there is no reduction in the rights of communities to
become involved where applications are made directly to the Secretary
of State. Let me go into that a little further. There will be no
dilution of the legislative safeguards to enable communities to become
aware of applications made to the Secretary of State, to comment on
them and to have their views taken into account; nor will any less
weight be given to their views on the planning issues
involved.</hs_para>

the existing primary legislation will require a planning inspector,

The decision would have to be made in accordance with the development
plan unless there are any material considerations that indicate
otherwise. Again, that is 
<?notus-xml column=1091?>no different from the approach that a local planning authority would
have to take. The local authority will, of course, be able to put its

noble friend Lord Tope raised the question of the Mayor of London.
Schedule 1 allows the Mayor of London to retain his ability to call in
any applications of potential strategic importance for the capital
where an application is made directly to the Secretary of State. To
ensure that the mayor is made aware of any such application as swiftly
as possible, the Planning Inspectorate will make an immediate
assessment of whether any application it receives falls into this
category. If it does, it will notify the mayor’s office without
delay and he can then decide whether he needs or wants to call in the
application for his own decision. I hope that addresses the point made
by my noble
friend.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022766000149" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022766000149">The

councils will have to be notified of proposals in their area where they

I do not think that these additional changes are necessary to ensure
that effective community involvement is seriously taken into account

we will ensure that secondary legislation requires the same degree of

remains over whether the Planning Inspectorate’s approach will

happens in practice. The noble Lords, Lord Deben and Lord
True, made a point about the era that we are in. Local
people now have a much greater focus, and the entitlement to engage in
these things is important. However, I do not think that we can

what was said at that stage of our deliberations, it does not seem to
me that the Government tried to refute the case that he put forward so
convincingly. I am not altogether clear about what the rationale is for
the specific exemptions listed in the Bill. Why these alone in the

there are to be exemptions, I believe most strongly that the case of
the national parks is outstanding. Why? Repeatedly since the parks were
originally created in the post-war era, successive Governments of
different persuasions have put on the record their determination that
these parks are very special parts of the United Kingdom. To those who
would say that this is an emotional argument and not a practical one, I
would say—I made this point in Committee—that that is
utter nonsense, because a healthy, effective nation needs space to
regenerate physically and mentally and the parks make a direct
contribution therefore to the well-being and operational efficiency of
the nation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022782000004">We

is important to recognise that we in both Houses of Parliament have had
a very important role as guarantors of this reality. Since the national
parks and the Broads were established, it has been recognised not only
by government but by Parliament repeatedly that they are the most
important areas for natural beauty and for the opportunities they
provide for public understanding of their special qualities. The
Government’s national parks circular of 2010 explains why it is
important for national park authorities to retain a planning function
in order to deliver these statutory functions. The Government’s
<I>National Planning Policy Framework</I> restates that they are to be
afforded the highest levels of protection and that major developments
within or affecting a national park therefore need to be given very
careful
consideration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022782000006">Of
course, a
national<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:03:46"></hs_TimeCode> park
authority is highly likely to receive far fewer major applications for
development than other planning authorities. A consequence of this is
that the percentages for major applications determined within 26 weeks,
and the percentage success rates on appeals—the criteria which
are proposed by the Government for determining poorly performing
authorities—can shift quite markedly from one year to another.
The Government’s <I>Planning Guarantee Monitoring Report,</I>
published in September last year, highlights that six national park
authorities received three or fewer major applications in 2011-12 and
that, of those, two received only one application. This surely
demonstrates that the statistical problem of relying on percentages as
far as they relate to national parks is a dangerous
game<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:04:52"></hs_TimeCode>. I
recognise that the Government have issued a consultation paper that
deliberates on the criteria they will use to determine poorly
performing authorities. Although the period over which this is to be
assessed seeks to address large variations from year to year, it is
important to understand that this potentially raises very serious
considerations for the
parks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:05:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

shall go over the basic statistical realities again. Leaving to one
side the South Downs National Park, which was designated during the
year in question, in the year ending 2012, the eight national park
authorities and the Broads Authority received 5,000 planning
applications. They granted approval for 89% of applications,
which is higher than the English average of 87%. They received 53
applications for major development, of which 91% were granted approval.
For major development, national park authorities compare favourably
with other local planning authorities for speed of
determination. They approved 60% of applications within 13 weeks,
compared with the English average of 57%. It is absolutely clear to
me—and I would have thought to everybody—that the
national park authorities have a good track record in planning
performance and a number are, for example, part of
the Government’s front runner programme for promoting
neighbourhood
planning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:06:59"></hs_TimeCode>. If
there are to be exemptions, I urge the Minister to look seriously at
whether, even at the 
<?notus-xml column=1095?>final stages of consideration of the
Bill, she could include the national park authorities alongside the
other designated authorities, although, as has been said, it would
helpful if we could have a bit more information on the overall

issue. It is important to keep the factual side under consideration all

special character having to justify why they are doing that. When we
introduce legislation of this kind, it is crucial to remember that we
are dealing not only with the Ministers of the day. I am convinced that
the Ministers of the day are quite civilised on these issues. They have
a very enlightened approach. They want to help, I think, in many ways.
That is encouraging, but they might not always be there. Another
Minister coming along could very easily see this as the thin end of the
wedge and that the door was being pushed open, opening up all sorts of
new opportunities which could very easily lead to the complete

Secretary of State responsible for these matters, and I can think of
one national park which ought to have been under this rule for quite
some time, because its planning attitudes at the time were utterly
indefensible. It is no good saying that they are always perfect. If
what the noble Lord, Lord Judd, says, is true—I am sure that it

that it has been a disaster; it is not what should have been done and
it has alienated local authorities in areas where it would be much
better for them to have worked as they had worked before. I think that
the same is true of the New Forest. That was an historic, political
decision to do with the 1930s rather than anything to do with the
2000s, but there we are: we have done it. It has not been as damaging

I do not think that it is necessary to build on greenfield sites. I
happen to think that we can build all the housing we need on brownfield

most issues and I greatly respect his record as a supporter of what one
might call green policy. However, on this occasion, I speak declaring
an interest as a Friend of the Lake District and believing that special
circumstances relate to national parks which make them different from
other local authorities. I saw this first-hand in my capacity as

fundamental differences. First, the people who work on
national parks go into it with a very strong personal
commitment to planning. I found the quality of staff working
for the national park authority to be extremely high. That
was not true of planning in all the other
district councils in the county of Cumbria. I will not name names, but
there were some problems there on the planning side. There were not,
however, problems with economic development with the national park,
which had a very constructive role in sustainable economic
development.</hs_para>

which is a fundamental difference from a local authority and the
question of a Secretary of State’s potential call-in powers, is
that with a national park the Secretary of State nominates quite a high
proportion of the members of the authority. Therefore, if the Secretary
of State believes that the national park is not getting the
balance between 
<?notus-xml column=1097?>development and the environment right, he or she can nominate members.
That is my simple point. I shall give
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022782000018"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deben" PimsId="5754" UID="13022782000370" xid="2031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022782000370">Lord

the opportunity to find a disagreement between us because we are both
singularly embarrassed by the similarity of our views on a whole range
of issues, from Europe to planning. However, if what he says is true,
would it not be very surprising to get rid of people whose normal
attitudes were extremely good but, because of something specific,
things had gone wrong? Surely it would be much more sensible for the
Secretary of State to be able to deal with this with a precise measure,
rather than a sacking. As I understand it, these people are under a
contract for a period of time and the Secretary of State would have to
wait some time to remove them if they were so wrong. However, I

My point was simply that if the Secretary of State felt that the
overall balance of the way a national park was operating was not right,
there is a remedy available to him or her, which is not the case for a
local authority. Anyway, I would urge a special provision for national
parks because, on the whole, they are a very precious element of our

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their
interesting interventions on this interesting amendment, which we
discussed in Committee. I am not going to endear myself to the noble
Lord, Lord Judd, by saying that my answer now is the same as it was
then. My noble friend Lord Deben said that he can see no reason for
excluding national parks from designation just because they are
national parks; nor can we. That also applies to the Broads Authority.
The reason for keeping them included is that they are planning
authorities. If they perform wonderfully and at a standard that I think
the noble Lord said they would, this registration will not matter to
them at all. It would completely leave them out to carry on doing what
they are doing so beautifully. There might be authorities which fall
into this category only if, as my noble friend Lord Deben suggested,
they do not perform to the designated standard. They would then become
involved.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022782000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022782000025">It
is important that national parks are served by an effective planning
service. That applies just as much to them as to any other area. They
are asked from time to time to put in major developments—we call
them major if they are of 10 houses or more—and it is absolutely
essential that there is within those areas a planning authority that
understands what it is doing and makes those decisions carefully. There
are some national parks that deal with a relatively small number of
major applications, but some do not. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, cited
figures, some of which would, I think, fall below the major
applications category. I understand that the Lake District made
decisions on 31 major applications in the past two financial years,
while the New Forest dealt with 23 and the Broads Authority with 18.
For those authorities, those are not inconsiderable numbers.</hs_para>

Judd, asked why national parks and the Broads Authority should not be
included among others which had not been designated, such as the Mayor
of London and the development corporations. However, these are by and
large not normal planning authorities. Certainly, the development
corporations get involved to deal with only very big or complex
proposals and do not deal on a day-to-day basis with some of the
smaller
ones.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022782000027">It is
true that other national parks deal with fewer major applications, but
the two-year assessment period that we have proposed is designed to
even out some of the fluctuations. It is also important to remember
that these authorities will be able to enter into planning performance
agreements or agree an extension of time where there are issues that
will take additional time to resolve, which may be germane only to
their particular type of application. There should be no worries that
if a national park or the Broads Authority were to be designated, that
would result in decisions that pay less regard to their special
qualities. If, in these circumstances, an application for major
development were to be made to the Secretary of State, the decision
would have to be in accordance with the same statutory 
<?notus-xml column=1099?>principles that apply to the designated authority. Indeed, I expect that
they would also be able to access the help of the Local Government
Association.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022782000028">In
other words, there would be the same legal obligation to make decisions
in accordance with the development plan, unless there are material
considerations that indicate otherwise. The Secretary of State will
also be under a statutory duty to have regard to the purposes for which
the national park has been designated in making such decisions. I
listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Liddle. I am enchanted by
the fact that the national parks have such good people, but that is not

Judd:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for the
characteristically friendly candour with which she has replied. I am
sorry that she has replied in the way that she has at this stage; it is
rather disappointing. She referred to the complexity of the issues
facing the bodies that appear in the Bill. However, I would argue that
what faces a national park authority is every bit as complex, every bit
as difficult and sensitive, as what faces these authorities. They are
in a very special category in that context because of these wider
issues of the inheritance, the special role of the parks and all the
rest. Her argument about complexity strengthens the case for the park
authorities being in the Bill.</hs_para>

the contribution by the noble Lord, Lord Deben. I take second place to
no one in my admiration for the tremendous contribution he has made on

doubly disappointing that he said what he said. Why? First, it is not
the first time I have heard, almost word for word, that particular
contribution by the noble Lord, Lord Deben, on national parks. I do not
suppose it is the last time we will hear it, either. He clearly once
had a very bad night with some of the national parks. I am not quite
sure what this bad night was and I would value him putting the story

some that have such

suggestion that we should keep the implementation and impact of this
measure under review, but that is not something for which we need
legislation. We set out in the impact assessment that, as usual, we
will undertake a post-legislative review of the provisions in the Bill
three to five years after Royal Assent. This reflects the Cabinet
Office guidance on post-legislative scrutiny, which requires that three
to five years after Royal Assent the department must submit a
memorandum to the relevant Commons departmental Select Committee,
published as a Command Paper. This will include a preliminary
assessment of the effects of the Bill. Furthermore, the data on local
planning authority performance will be published on a quarterly basis
and an annual basis, in line with our commitment to transparency. This
will allow anyone with an interest to see how planning authorities are
performing and, together with the decisions about dedesignation, it
will form a view of the impact that the measure is having. The noble
Lord’s amendment is not necessary, as this is certainly
something that will be kept under close scrutiny. Under the

Clause 1 from the Bill. I acknowledge that the Government have moved a
little in agreeing to a parliamentary process of designation of a
supposed failing authority, but that does not outweigh the overriding
concerns that remain about the clause. The right for developers to
bypass the local authority planning process when an authority is
designated is a profound one. Not only is it a centralist approach,
quite contrary to the espoused localism of the Government, but it
breaks a major tenet of our planning system that democratically elected

Government seem to intend that the bar will be raised in subsequent

developers, the response times of statutory consultees, the outcome of
consultation, the bunching of applications. Although formal and
informal agreements with developers to extend the timeframe will be
reflected in the designation criteria, it seems there will be room for

way, reluctantly, I have to say that from my feelings at
Second Reading, I think that she would be right to resist his

broadly drafted, and in many areas it threatened to enable a degree of
centralism that was unacceptable and went against what this House had
recently argued for. I always accepted that there should be some kind

Judd:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope that my noble
friend will stand firm. If legislation is important and
necessary, it seems to me a first principle that it is important to get
it as right, sound and well drafted as possible. I honestly
believe that there is room for reflection on how this clause
has been drafted. It is full of lurches in administration which are not
logically followed through and which introduce contradictions between
what is recognised and put on the face of the Bill, and what
is not put on the face of the Bill. That is one area
of
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:42:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022771000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022771000059">A
much deeper area of concern is the contradictions which this Bill
epitomises between the legislation of the Government and their
aspirations as put to the people in the general election and at other
times. The whole thesis of the Conservative position was that power
should be nearer people; that the bodies nearer people should have more
authority than they had before; and that there should be distribution
of power. Phrases such as “Trust the people” are ringing
in my ears. This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:44:15"></hs_TimeCode>
clause is very central to that.</hs_para>

we are moving into an age in which you do not say that ultimately the
state has responsibility in a whole range of administration—of
course it does —or that we therefore want to enhance and improve
the local standards of democracy and the local and more regional ways
in which planning and the rest are working. We are moving into an age
where the state may say, “We concede that you may be able to get
on with the job administratively here but please understand that the
real power lies at the centre, and at any point we can intervene and
call into the centre the responsibility for what is being done”.
How does that add up in terms of the message that was being put to the
British people about the belief in the people and the rejection of the
concept of overcentralised
government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:44:03"></hs_TimeCode>?

the sterling work that she has done to get us into this position and
perhaps in future we can be a little more careful about how we produce

months ago I would have had little, probably no, hesitation in joining
the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie. When first published, this clause was
really the antithesis of localism, which we spend so much time
debating. It was clearly centralist and unsatisfactory. Even
after some welcome reassurances on Report in the other

unacceptable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022771000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022771000065">In
moving his amendment, the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, acknowledged that
the Minister had moved “a little”, I think his precise
words were. That was uncharacteristically ungenerous of him. The
Government have moved very substantially on this clause. I have not
become an enthusiast for it but I acknowledge that pressure from all
sides of this House, some excellent work by the Minister and her
colleagues, and other Ministers who have been prepared to listen and
hear—to echo my earlier words—have made this clause very
much less harmful than it might have been. We have criteria, which will
be subject to parliamentary approval, proposed at a very low threshold
that, as set now, would catch, if that is the right word, few local
planning authorities. We have a process whereby local planning
authorities will have good warning of when they are at risk and ample
opportunity to
improve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022771000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022771000066">We
have heard that that improvement will be sector-led and that the LGA
has been in discussions and is prepared to work with local planning
authorities at risk and to help them reach the necessary improvements
so that they do not become designated. If after all that a local
planning authority is performing so badly, it probably deserves to be
designated. We are looking at an incentive to improve and not a
deterrent to punish. I believe that after the criteria that we have put
in place, and the provisos and reassurances that we have had, very few
local planning authorities will actually get designated. I understand
why the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, fears that, at least in part, that
may in part be because the quality of decision-making is reduced
particularly to meet timescales, or, to be less particular, on
important issues such as
design.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022771000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022771000067">We
will have to see, but given how few local planning authorities
currently would meet the criteria for designation, I am not too worried
about that. If it looks to be the case, we will have to tackle that,
but I am not too worried. As I said previously, if at the end of this
process the local planning authority is still so bad that it meets the
criteria for designation, that may very well be the last resort that
has to be taken, but even when we get to designation we should remember
that major planning applications will not be required to go PINS; that
will be the choice of the developer. The local situation may be so bad
that the developer makes that choice, but my guess
is that in most cases the developer would still
prefer to stay local and stay 
<?notus-xml column=1106?>working with a local planning authority, where by
that stage no doubt the relationship would be far from perfect, but
there would still be a
relationship.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022771000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022771000068">I
start to wonder whether this clause—not that it is
undesirable—may not be necessary and whether the Planning
Minister’s hope and aspiration that it will never be necessary
to use it may well come about. Like my noble friends, I have been
reassured during the process of the Bill and, perhaps unlike the noble
Lord, Lord Deben, I am pleased that we have been able to go through the
process, although I would rather not have been in that place in the
first place. On that basis, I am prepared to accept the
Government’s wish to have this clause as an incentive not a
deterrent to encourage those local planning authorities whose
performance is far from perfect—and we all acknowledge that they
exist—to improve themselves.</hs_para>

the changes that we have been able to make in this Bill. I understand
that there are still real concerns about it, and the noble Lord, Lord
Judd, referred again to localism. This is not an issue of localism but
of ensuring that local people get a proper planning service and that
local developers get a proper result from the applications that they
put

is not a measure that we take lightly. It is something that we are very
serious about because we believe it to be both necessary and
appropriate. We are very clear—and I want to emphasise
this—that planning decisions should continue to be made locally
wherever possible but, as I have emphasised throughout our discussions
on this clause, we should be prepared to act where standards have
fallen to a wholly unacceptable level. Noble Lords will agree that the
criteria that they are working to at the moment would constitute being
at a wholly unacceptable level. That is no different from the approach
that previous Administrations have taken, and I have pointed out how
the criteria were adopted by schools, hospitals and other services
under previous Governments. We should be prepared to do the same for
planning, not least because of the role that it plays in supporting
growth as well as being an important community service in its own
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022771000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022771000071">We
listened carefully to the arguments made in Committee, and the
amendments that we have brought forward put beyond doubt that this
measure can be used only where it is clear that performance is
inadequate and that the ability to apply directly to the Secretary of
State will be open only to those seeking approval for major
development. We have defined that, too. As my noble friend Lord Deben
said, the choice of where this application is heard will still be in
the hands of the developers; it is their option to go to the Planning
Inspectorate if they are not happy having the application heard by a
designated council, but they do not have to. They can leave the
application and have it heard in the normal way by the council, if that
is their choice. I agree, too, that some developers work very closely
in particular areas and therefore have a relationship that is wholly
proper with their local authorities.</hs_para>

Parliament will have the opportunity to consider again the criteria for
designating authorities before they are finalised and before any
changes are made to them in future, if they are to be made. By using
transparent criteria, with data published on a regular basis, planning
authorities will be clear about whether their performance needs to
improve to avoid designation, and through the support package that we
have been discussing with the LGA we hope and expect that the number of
designations in future will be very limited
indeed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022771000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0001.htm#13022771000073">Of
course, we also anticipate that the mere existence of this measure will
encourage timely and well considered decisions by planning authorities
and so avoid the need for designations. I do not accept the argument
that local authorities will now rush around trying to get planning
decisions through in 13 weeks to escape or grind up slightly from the
percentage that might hit the criteria. We have made it clear that they
do not need to rush; they need to make a very focused effort on plans.

the normal timescale, then the planning agreement signed and agreed

of the challenge that we have is that the criteria are not necessarily
a fair determinant of poor performance because so many other factors
influence the timing of approvals and the planning process. If you look
at what has changed since Second Reading when people were so unhappy
with this clause, you will see that we have the term “major
development” in the clause but, at the start of our
consideration of the Bill here, the position was always that major
developments would be caught by this and that was very clear from

extent to which that tightening will take place. It seems to me that
very little has moved on this clause that is positive. I accept that
there have been assurances around sector support, but even that was
promulgated around a concept at the time when we debated this at Second
Reading. From my perspective, very little has changed in practice on
this clause since the Bill arrived in your Lordships’ House. I

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, during the debate in
Committee on permitted development rights, a subject to which we shall
return on day two on Report, concerns were expressed about the
operation of local development orders. In response to those concerns we
have brought forward changes to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990
by proposing the introduction of a new clause to the Bill in respect of
the operation of the powers in England. These are matters which are
devolved in respect of
Wales.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022782000035">The new
clause removes current powers for the Secretary of State to intervene
in and approve local development orders and for local planning
authorities to report on them in England. This will mean local
authorities will be able to consult on and make a local development
order without the need to send a copy to the Secretary of State for his
consideration and approval. Similarly, an authority will not have to
report on the effectiveness of the order. Instead the local authority
will just have to send a copy of the order to the Secretary of State
once
adopted.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13022782000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022782000096">6.15

made clear during previous debates on the planning clauses in the Bill,
we are keen to free the planning system from unnecessary constraints to
ensure that local planning authorities can focus on the most important
planning matters in their area. We welcome that local authorities are
also taking strides in this area and want to ensure that they can use
local development orders to their maximum benefit to remove barriers.
Local development orders provide a quick and simple way to extend
permitted development rights locally. The number being put in place
across the country is booming. More than 30 local development orders
have now been put in place in enterprise zones with more coming through
by the month. These orders are contributing to growth by helping to
speed up the delivery of everything from small domestic alterations to
major industrial development. Having this central knowledge about the
local development orders that have been adopted helps to spread good
practice and promote their potential.</hs_para>

Committee, we welcomed the interest of my noble friends Lord Tope and
Lord Shipley in making the case for greater freedoms for local planning
authorities. We are clear that experience and interest in making local
development orders is growing rapidly and we want to capture this. I
believe that the proposed new clause will both encourage and give
confidence to local authorities to be ambitious and bring forward
greater planning simplification in their areas. I therefore hope that
the House will support its inclusion in the Bill. I beg to
move.</hs_para>

requirements to those that were agreed prior to Royal Assent. That
amendment was tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Best, in Committee, and I
am delighted that he has added his name to it today. I should make it
clear that this is not an attempt to usurp his role in this; nobody
knows the issues better than the noble Lord, but I was not sure whether
he would bring it

these provisions concerning renegotiation of Section 106
agreements are not to be removed from the Bill, they must be
constrained. We will come on to sunset clauses shortly, but we should
note that the Government’s proposition is only one small step
from where the Bill now stands. In Committee, we
acknowledged the significant contribution that Section 106
agreements have made to this country’s need for affordable
housing. We have noted that local authorities have existing powers to
renegotiate Section 106 agreements and that many are using these. We
remain sceptical about the need for these new powers. However,
notwithstanding these concerns, on the basis of the Government’s
own logic, there is no need for the rights in the Bill to carry on for
ever. If the rationale for Clause 6 is that developers entered into
Section 106 affordable housing obligations when economic times were
better, is it the Government’s position that things will
continue to get

the clause is to be brought to an end in three years, unless the

Government argued that there was continuing uncertainty in the market.
That may be the case, but presumably the Minister is not arguing for a
risk-free platform for developers. Clause 6 was, we understand,
supposed to address the substantial change in market circumstances
fuelled by the global financial crisis of 2008. Applicants should not
agree to Section 106 agreements that they consider will render their
development unviable. The use of viability appraisals in negotiations

cut-off point of 
<?notus-xml column=1114?>obligations entered into by about 2014. So far as the
Government’s version of a sunset clause is concerned, this does
not move us much further than the Bill, which already gives the power
to the Secretary of State by order to repeal Sections 106BA
and 106BB of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The
Government’s version of a sunset clause, while repealing those
sections at the end of April 2016, also gives the power to the

Best:</Member></B> My Lords, I have added my name to Amendment 22,
which was prepared by the Local Government Association. I am grateful
to the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, for introducing this amendment and
explaining its purpose and value. My overarching concern is that the
intention of Clause 6, which is to see stalled development up and
running swiftly, will not materialise without substantial changes to
this clause. Indeed, the knowledge that central government may overrule
legal agreements between local government and house builders may
encourage exactly the wrong response from some elements in the house
building industry, and this measure could
backfire<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:22:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

offers relief for house builders where they have paid too much for a
site and now wish to be excused from their obligations
to provide affordable housing. Amendment 22 would mean that
only agreements already made could be addressed by going down this
Clause 6 route. The practice of developers speculatively outbidding
others—including housing associations keen to buy a site and
fulfil the affordable housing obligations on it—would not be
perpetuated into the future. It would no longer be possible for
developers to say, “Let us gamble on house prices rising, but if
they do not do so, we can go to the Planning Inspectorate and secure a
release from our Section 106
agreement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:23:46"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para>

moments, I can feel some sympathy for the small builder who is unable
to work on a swings-and-roundabouts basis of some highly profitable and
some less profitable site purchases and who unwisely paid too much for
a site at the height of the boom some four years ago. The
bigger house builders are currently doing very well. Persimmon and
Bovis have just reported huge increases in profits of more than 50% and
more than 60% respectively. Some smaller developers, however, may have
been caught out in 2008 or 2009, thinking house prices would rise
inexorably when they have been pretty flat outside London and the hot
spots. Nevertheless, surely we do not want to encourage continuing
speculation on the basis that, from now on, the state will bail out
those who bite off more than they can chew. Any developer entering into
a Section 106 negotiation at the current time is clearly doing so with
their eyes open to the economic realities of the day. These
negotiations make use of viability appraisals and the signal must go
out to house builders that they can no longer sign agreements
in the expectation that they will not really be
necessary 
<?notus-xml column=1115?>to honour those agreements because central
government’s planning inspectors will set aside their
obligations if the developers can show that they will not make a profit

line under state intervention in these Section 106 agreements from the
date that the Bill becomes an Act. I strongly support it. Alternative
amendments for a sunset clause three years hence seem to miss the
point. It is now that we want people to get busy and get started on
sites that they own and are currently stalled. Every time a local
agreement to produce more affordable housing is set aside, households
on low incomes waiting for a home are forced to wait longer. We should
ensure that this happens on only the rarest occasions. I strongly
support an amendment that would stop the perpetuation of the

28. I strongly support Amendment 22 and the principle behind it that
only planning obligations agreed prior to Royal Assent should be
included in the Bill. Amendment 28 is a sunset clause, and the
Government have, through their own Amendment 32, accepted the
principles of this. Our view is that no applications should be made
under this section three years after its coming into effect. I accept
that there may be a case to give power to renew or extend a subsection
if economic circumstances demand it. However, I am not convinced that
it should be open-ended and effectively give a power to the
Secretary of State to extend it for as long as he would wish it to be
extended. I am seeking from the Minister some clarification as to what
the Government’s intention actually is with their

will be very precise about the questions to which I think
the House should seek to secure answers. It would be helpful if the
Minister could refine her amendment at Third Reading, so that any
extension to the time limit should be for no more than two years from
the date it is proposed. That would have to be before April 2016, so it
would give an absolute time limit of five years.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:28:38"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly, would
the Minister commit to presenting a report to both Houses before
bringing forward regulations to extend that time limit? Would the
Minister also commit to consulting with social housing providers and
others prior to presenting that report, in order to inform its

Government should still look to extend Clause 6 to include the full
range of planning obligations. Not only would this challenge any
perception that the Government viewed affordable housing as of
secondary importance in planning terms; but if other obligations are
causing the delay, that could remove significant impediments to that
development. We will have a chance in a further amendment to look at
that a little more closely, but I remain concerned that the

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to explain the purpose and
operation of the sun-setting amendment, Amendment 32, in my name in
this group. After careful consideration of the concerns
expressed by noble Lords 
<?notus-xml column=1116?>in Committee, the amendment we propose sunsets Clause 6 on 30 April 2016
unless an affirmative order is made for it to
continue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022782000053">Until
I heard them speak, I thought that this addressed the
amendment proposed by the noble Lords, Lord Shipley, Lord
McKenzie and Lord Tope, and the recommendations of the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. As I made clear in
Committee, the clause is targeted at helping development to get under
way on sites that are being stalled because of the current economic
conditions. We believe it is essential to allow for a review of schemes
where this could bring development back into viability. This would
deliver more private and affordable homes than would otherwise come
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022782000054">The
clause already contains a power for the Secretary of State to switch it
off by order, reflecting our underlying thinking that this is about
addressing current uncertainties. However, we have listened carefully
to the arguments that we should define this more precisely. Arguments
have been made that the clause should reflect the current uncertainty
in the property market and that we should insert a date when the
operation of the clause will cease. We have therefore set the sunset
date for 30 April 2016. That is based on the forecast from the Office
for Budget Responsibility that shows that investment in housing is
expected to stabilise in 2016. I accept what the noble Lord, Lord Best,
said; there is evidence that some of that housing is beginning to move,
which is very welcome. This is reinforced by evidence from the Centre
for Economics and Business Research, which expects house prices to
return to pre-recession levels in
2016.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022782000055">The
amendment will send a clear message to local authorities and house
builders to review their schemes where affordable housing viability is
an issue. None of us can be certain about the future of the property
market—forecasts are not guarantees—and therefore we have
taken a sensible and pragmatic power to extend this date by order
should that prove
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022782000056">The
amendments to Clause 28 will require the order to be made through the
affirmative procedure and both Houses will have an opportunity to vote.
So there is a commitment for it to come back to this House if
necessary. Although the amendment does not limit the time period for
any future extension, I fully anticipate that this would be for a
limited time justified by prevailing market conditions. In taking this
approach, we have again followed the suggestion of the Delegated Powers
and Regulatory Reform Committee when it commented on the Bill ahead of
Committee. The amendment also includes a separate power to make
transitional or transitory provisions related to the sunset of the
clause by
order.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022782000057">Turning
to the amendment tabled by the noble Lords, Lord McKenzie
and Lord Best, this would allow only affordable housing obligations in

viability. As I said in Committee, we are still not in a position of
stability in the market and, therefore, applying such a
limited amendment would not be helpful.</hs_para>

also provided evidence in Committee from the Office for Budget
Responsibility which indicated varied performance across the country.
House price growth 
<?notus-xml column=1117?>remains subdued across much of the United Kingdom, and it is widely
varied. The recently announced 2.5% house price increase in England was
driven by a 5% rise in London and a 3% increase in the south-east.
However, in other parts of the country there is a wide variation in
house price growth. I said earlier that the forecast of the Office for
Budget Responsibility shows house price growth stabilising at 4% by
2016-17.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022782000059">Concerns
have been expressed that a developer could agree a Section 106 next
year knowing that he could apply to renegotiate it. If the local
planning authority has taken account of local economic realities and
negotiates a fair and viable agreement, it is likely that there will be
no case for reopening the agreement within the short-to-medium term and
a developer would not have viability evidence with which to be
successful on appeal. The amendments do not make allowance for current
market uncertainties. We believe that we need three years for the
housing construction market to stabilise. We wish to allow
opportunities for scheme viability to be reviewed, even for
those which may come forward after the Bill is given Royal

Government’s response to this is that unless you have certainty

changed dramatically—but why should there now be this ongoing
facility for people who can make a judgment as to what is happening in
the market? Yes, there will be some uncertainty—there are always
uncertainties in markets—but there is no substantial reason to
prolong this opportunity. A cut-off of those things which will have
happened by the time this Bill comes into effect is entirely
reasonable. In fact, it could be argued that the cut-off should be
earlier than that. Indeed, the changes that the Government are making

designed to assess why only the affordable housing element of a stalled
development should be considered. To make a stalled development
economically viable, it is important to look at the full range of
planning obligations, not just affordable housing. Sometimes it might
be sensible to vary affordable housing obligations, but at other times
other matters, such as the scale of highway contributions or a
developer’s community infrastructure levy liability, might have
a greater impact on a development’s viability. This approach
would reflect the Government’s desire to ensure that planning
applications are not acting as a barrier to new development and would
give much greater flexibility to planning authorities in their
negotiations with
developers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022782000067">I
have read carefully the draft viability guidance on Section 106
affordable housing requirements. It says that the application and

requirements only. It will not reopen any other planning policy
considerations or review the merits of the permitted scheme. I believe
it is very clear that only affordable housing requirements could be
subject to
negotiation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022782000068">However,
it also says at a later point in the draft that the timing and level of
off-site contributions may also be considered. Will the Minister define
an off-site contribution? I take it to be something broader than simply
the affordable housing requirement and might actually include the
community infrastructure levy. I would like clarification of that
because later in the draft viability guidance it says that the relevant
sections, Sections 106BA and 106BB, do not provide an
opportunity to reopen policy considerations or requirements for
planning obligations other than for affordable housing. Again, the
matter is clear. Therefore I am left wondering what an off-site
contribution actually is, as presumably the affordable housing is on
site.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022782000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022782000069">It seems

those other matters, it would enable more affordable housing to be
built as a consequence. For the reassurance of the Minister, I had not
planned to move this to a vote, but I believe that the issue ought to
be explored so that we have clarification of what is actually intended
and why the Government feel that they cannot permit other planning
obligations to be part of the consideration of the renegotiation of a

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My noble friend Lord Shipley has raised
an interesting issue, which has been raised at earlier stages, as to
why only affordable housing is able to be renegotiated. He has also
added to his amendment the question of the community infrastructure
levy. Bearing in the mind the main purpose of the CIL, I
would question whether that would be an appropriate reduction to seek.
The CIL is after all intended to provide local authorities with the
resources to pay for some of the infrastructure that would be necessary
to support the housing requirements. It is true that affordable housing
does not attract the CIL, but the rest of the housing development
would. If one is going to have a community infrastructure levy, I would
be very reluctant to see that negotiated down on the grounds of the
developer saying that their scheme is not viable.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022795000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000003">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:59:31"></hs_TimeCode>
have not had a full explanation of why only affordable housing is able
to be renegotiated, because there may well be other obligations. I,
too, read the sentence in the guidance about the other
“off-site” obligations and I was not quite sure what that
meant. When I first read it, I thought that it meant off-site
affordable housing, but affordable housing is often not immediately on
the same site as the rest of the development; it can be on a different
site, so I do not think that that is what it means. I would welcome an
explanation from my noble friend on the Front Bench as to what is
involved. Hitherto, I have wholly supported the idea of renegotiation.
Indeed, it has been the main burden of complaint of developers that
they have agreed in different circumstances to affordable housing
obligations and that it is that which makes their development unviable.
That is why there has been, as was referred to earlier, a lot of
negotiation going on with local authorities anyway. However, I am not
aware of any local authorities which have negotiated reductions in
other planning requirements that may have been necessary.</hs_para>

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I think that it is explanations that are
asked for rather than anything else. I was asked what
“off-site” provision was. It is exactly what it says. As
noble Lords will know, when an obligation is entered into for
affordable housing, in many cases that affordable housing is not on the
main development site but is being provided elsewhere. All the guidance
says is that any affordable housing that is not on the particular site
can be taken into account. I hope that explains that. We discussed this
quite a bit in Committee but it should be quite clear that this clause
relates only to affordable housing. That is the only element that we
are seeking to address within this Bill.</hs_para>

authorities can voluntarily renegotiate Section 106
agreements already. Under the regulations that have just been laid,
they can be required to look at the whole aspect. Often the affordable
housing is quite a large aspect of the development obligations and it
therefore makes sense not to go through the whole galaxy of
the Section 106 review, but to take account of the affordable housing

usually applied in the context of individual site viability. The effect

subject to viability. Research from 2007-08 found that about 50% of all
planning obligations were for affordable housing so this is quite a
significant area. That is why we have focused on only the affordable

it is predictable. It is set at the local level in accordance with
local viability. Local authorities do not have discretion to waive or

31 and 35. I preface my remarks by thanking the Minister for a really
helpful and lengthy meeting at which a number of my earlier amendments
were discussed. On the basis of that discussion, I have dropped three
of my amendments along the way, either because I have better understood
where the Government were coming from or because I noticed some modest
amendments along the way. I was extremely grateful for that more than

30, 31 and 35 all address the hazards in Clause 6 and are intended to
ensure that the clause achieves what the Government intend: to get
developers on site and building new homes as a quid pro quo for being
able to increase their profits on sites where they have previously
signed up to obligations to allocate some homes for affordable
housing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:15:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022795000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000034">Amendment
30 would protect the local authority, the taxpayer and the people who
need affordable housing from developers being excused from their
obligations on the grounds of expected low house prices today but
making substantial profits in future when house prices have risen
appreciably. The amendment inserts a clawback provision for the local
authority to receive payment in kind if values rise more than expected.
A highly unsatisfactory outcome from the use of Clause 6 by a developer
to secure a reduction in the affordable housing on its site would be
for it simply to await house price increases and make a killing later.
Then, the developer would see bigger gains in the years ahead, but the
whole purpose of the Bill—to get sites developed
today—would be

I brought a similar amendment from the LGA before your Lordships in
Committee, the proposition was that local authorities should share a
proportion of the profit from future sales if they turned out to be at
higher levels than had been expected when the deal was considered by
the Planning Inspectorate. The revised amendment is intended to address
concerns raised by your Lordships that that route would not
be appropriate. The new version would ensure that
the local authority could claw back only a commuted
sum—payment in kind—in the form of finance specifically
to replace some or all of the affordable housing in the original
planning obligation, probably to build offsite. That seems entirely
reasonable and I hope that the revised amendment will be acceptable to
Ministers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:17:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022795000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000036">Amendment
31 takes the story forward. It is intended to address the situation
where, after a Clause 6 negotiation has reduced the previous
requirement for affordable housing, the developer does not, as the
Government hope, start swiftly on site but instead awaits the moment
when the market is more favourable and prices are higher. The primary
reason why sites are stalled is the reluctance of housebuilders to
press forward with developments of homes for sale because the local
market is sluggish and, if they build too quickly, it will be
impossible to achieve the prices they desire.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022795000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000037">Even<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:18:36"></hs_TimeCode>
if they are allowed to produce fewer affordable homes—homes
which are usually transferred to a housing association for rent or

same, and the housebuilder may well prefer to await an upturn rather
than, despite the earnest hopes of the Government, 
<?notus-xml column=1128?>getting going with the building work which is so badly
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:18:15"></hs_TimeCode>.
Amendment 31 would compel the developer to commence construction within
six months if it receives a favourable outcome from invoking the
provisions of Clause 6 and secures a reduction in its legal

is a fundamental point. Unless there is a benefit to society
in the form of a rapid start on site, most people would
surely ask why the state should be intervening retrospectively to
overrule a legal agreement between a local council and a housebuilder
simply to increase the profits of the latter. Why should central
Government step in when a speculative land purchase now means that a
development is not as profitable as the housebuilder had hoped? After
all, no one has suggested that local authorities
should pursue housebuilders for an increase in the quota of affordable
housing when, a year or two after an agreement was signed,
house prices rise dramatically, as they did a few years ago, when
unexpectedly high profits were
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022795000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000039">If the
developer is able to negotiate a reduction in their Section 106
obligations, they will raise the value of the site without laying a
single brick. Amendment 31 is intended to overcome this
major defect in Clause 6 and require housebuilders to
commence construction within six months if they receive a favourable
outcome from their appeal. If the Planning Inspectorate has found the
development would not have been profitable because of the level of
affordable housing required and has reduced that level accordingly,
there should be no good reason why the developer should continue to sit
on their planning approval. Instead of being accused of land banking,
they should then start delivering the homes the UK so badly
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022795000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000040">Finally,
Amendment 35 puts the finishing touches to these proposed changes to
Clause 6 by raising the threshold of what defines commencement of
development on site. Planning permissions do not last indefinitely, and
in considering whether to extend a permission or allow it to expire, a
local authority considers whether the developer has commenced
development, defined as a “material operation” in Section
56 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The Act sets out what a
developer has to do on site to implement a planning permission. The
physical works that make up a “material operation” can be
relatively minimal when compared with the totality of the
development—for example, digging a trench or starting to lay a
road. Case law is clear that it does not matter if the developer
carries out those works simply to keep the planning permission alive,
rather than with a genuine intention to complete the development. If
developers have to start within six months, but simply dig a ditch,
Amendment 31 has not taken us forward.</hs_para>

Committee to enable local authorities and developers to agree at the
outset what the definition of commencement would be. The
Minister’s response, which I fully understand, was that this
would create a postcode lottery, with every council doing things
differently. The problem might be countered with non-statutory guidance
on best practice. However, in recognition of ministerial concerns, I am
now suggesting an amendment that raises the threshold of what is
defined as commencement. This amendment would alter the
current<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:22:26"></hs_TimeCode>
definition of what constitutes a “material 
<?notus-xml column=1129?>operation”. It would require a certain
percentage of, for example, the foundations to be completed to count as
a material operation and thus keep the planning permission alive.
Spelling this out would have the benefit of certainty. It would
encourage developers to move from commencement to completion faster in
the future because a greater proportion of costs would have been
incurred at an earlier stage.</hs_para>

three amendments salvage something sensible from Clause 6 and save the
Government from falling into a trap. The worst possible outcome would
see the clause to reduce the amount of affordable homes that developers
are required to build proceeding, but developers still not getting on

their obligations reduced and waiting until house prices, pressurised
by escalating shortages, rise and bigger profits can be made. I beg to

“Yes, we’ll agree to this, but there are other conditions

that commencement on site must happen within six months or
what commencement on site means, other than within the law. The
agreement has not been, if you like, sharply enough defined, although
it has followed standard practice. The opportunity then exists for the
developer to say, “I don’t wish to proceed on this basis.
I shall use Clause 6 and the Planning Inspectorate to reduce my
obligations. Even though I signed up to that, I don’t want to be
held to it any longer because I have decided that the profitability of
my scheme would be increased if I waited some time and did the
development later”. These amendments put pressure on the

The case law definition of commencement will then be used; it will
enable a whole set of minor things to be done and the developer is

Mackay of Clashfern:</Member></B> My Lords, there is a certain amount
of misunderstanding arising in this situation. As I understand it, if
the new clause is left as it is, on the planning inspector agreeing a
reduction the developer would have no obligation except the statutory
obligation. He could not, or the local authority would not be in a
position to, redefine the commencement of development because the
statutory authority would open the way such that the local authority
could not close it. The view of the noble Lord, Lord Deben, is that it
might be a good idea to permit the local authority to make such an
arrangement. However, that is not provided for as yet and the amendment
tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Best, seems to deal with this. The local
authority might make an even better definition, depending on local
circumstances, but having some power in the local authority to persuade
or force the developer to get on with it in a reasonable time, if he
takes the reduction, seems essential for this to
work.</hs_para>

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, there is an issue here. I do not actually
like the way proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Best, because it seems
too prescriptive as to how it might be done. I am entirely in favour of
this clause. 
<?notus-xml column=1131?>It is very important, in the present circumstances, to find a way of not
insisting upon the kinds of costs which were possible at a time in
which prices were utterly different. I therefore like the clause but I
am concerned that it does not include the possibility of local
authorities saying “Yes, okay, the inspector has said that we
can reduce the number by this level but the deal is that you get
started—and these are the terms of getting started that we
want”. In other words, I am not sure that I want to have
statutory, public, universal terms because it would seem much better to
have it dealt with at local level, and to lay down there which
definition of commencement was necessary in this circumstance by this
particular local authority.</hs_para>

like the answer which the noble Lord, Lord Best, has brought forward
but my noble and learned friend has pointed to the fact that we need
some sort of answer. If we do not have one, people will be getting a

achieve. I do not know whether my noble friend would be right to accept
this amendment, but it would be helpful to us if she were prepared, at
least, to look again at having some kind of mechanism so that this was
not misused, instead of being the very valuable thing which it could so
easily be.</hs_para>

the thrust of Amendment 35 and what the noble Lord is seeking to

it would be a lawyers’ paradise to try to determine

has been laid, for obvious reasons. Would it be cost, width, depth or

more effective than what is there at the moment, so perhaps that is a
task to be done between now and Third

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank noble Lords for that debate. The
noble Lord, Lord Best, explained clearly that his amendments are aimed
at ensuring that development happens. We all want to ensure that
happens, as there is otherwise no purpose in this clause. I understand
the desire that, in return for an adjusted affordable housing
obligation won at appeal, a developer should get on and build. Planning
consent is permission to build; it is not a requirement to build. The
purpose of this clause is to give developers an opportunity to build,
allowing them to review schemes against prevailing market conditions
and secure a viable affordable housing agreement. We should remember
that without this clause many housing sites will not come forward at
all, which is not what we want. Of 
<?notus-xml column=1132?>course, having put in place a revised agreement, we want developers to
build, and that is the purpose of the amendment tabled by the noble
Lord, Lord Best.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022795000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000058">Clause 6 places a
three-year time limit on modified obligations made on appeal. If the
development is not completed within three years, which is the other
side of the coin that the noble Lord referred to—he was talking
about commencement while I am talking about completion—the
original affordable housing requirement will apply to those parts of
the scheme which have not been commenced, so there is a difficulty for
the developer in that. Developers are incentivised to build out as much
of their scheme as possible within those three years. It will not be
sufficient to commence one part of the development to secure the
revised affordable housing obligation for the whole scheme.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022795000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000059">For example, on a
scheme of 100 homes, if 50 units are completed at the end of the three
years and the remaining 50 are not commenced, the appeal decisions
would require that the original obligation would apply to the remaining
50—so we would go back to 100. If developers are concerned about
the viability of their scheme at the end of the three years, they can
seek to modify the agreement again. This could be done through
voluntary renegotiation or by making a new application under this
process.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022795000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000060">We
believe that the clause ensures that we incentivise build-out and
completion. Local authorities are not bound by a three-year decision,
but we are clear in our draft guidance that they can follow similar
time limits prescribed for appeal decisions. We believe that
this decision is best made locally. Where the matter has gone to the
planning inspectors, the local authority can of course put its own
evidence to the Planning Inspectorate, which could include evidence on
commencement of the development. That could become part of the modified
planning obligation if the planning inspectors agree to it.</hs_para>

Lord will take some comfort from our being aware that local authorities
have a wide range of tools and powers to encourage development. Those
may be through the way they use the Section 106 agreements
flexibly or in the way that they support development through investment
in infrastructure or the use of land assets. We are aware of local
authorities which have introduced clawback agreements to incentivise
developments and we understand that those may be appropriate in some
circumstances.</hs_para>

Amendment 31, which prescribes a six-month commencement for appeal
decisions, I said in Committee that I thought setting a six-month
period in primary legislation was too prescriptive. I am particularly
concerned that placing a six-month limit to commence development will
allow little time for developers to get on site—this is the
other side of the coin that we have just been talking about. Not all
schemes will be ready to go when they are renegotiated. Regeneration
schemes where land is in multiple ownership or where planning
conditions need to be met before development can commence could be
excluded from this process by the six-month limit. Sites where
significant work, such as decontamination, needs to be done to prepare
the site for development could be excluded. We want to ensure that we
deliver as many homes as 
<?notus-xml column=1133?>possible through this measure, not through an overly prescriptive
approach, which could be counterproductive and end up with these
measures having no effect.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Best, proposes to require the Planning Inspectorate to
introduce a clawback in appeal cases whereby the local authority
receives increased funds for affordable housing if the market rises. I
oppose this amendment because it requires the Planning Inspectorate to
make provision for a clawback agreement, which would impose a
requirement that will not be appropriate in all cases. I am also
concerned that this amendment might have unintended consequences. In
cases, where a variable agreement would be onerous and unnecessary, the
inclusion of the amendment could discourage developers from appealing.
We need developers to engage in this process and ensure they can secure
viable agreements and we can then secure the affordable
housing.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022795000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000064">I
will now turn to the new clause on redefining commencement. The
definition of commencement and material operation serves a wide range
of purposes in planning law. It triggers the payment of community
infrastructure levy and Section 106 revenues. Perhaps most importantly,
it is used by local authorities to establish whether a
development needs planning permission and can form the basis of
enforcement action if a material operation has taken place without
permission. In short, the amendment would have far-reaching and
fundamental consequences that go far beyond its intention, which is to
prevent developers from doing a minimal amount of work lawfully to
implement a planning permission. The noble Lord spelled that out quite
clearly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022795000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000065">Changing
the commencement threshold in the way envisaged would not have a
substantial effect on the behaviour of developers. Any new
definition of commencement would simply create a new minimum threshold
for such developers to build to. The additional costs for a developer
in doing so would be unlikely to be significant in the context of an
overall construction budget. Furthermore, the complexity of the
threshold proposed would result in uncertainty and confusion that would
affect all parties involved in the planning process, including local
authorities. As the definition of development is a highly contested
part of planning law, it would be likely to result in a significant
rise in legal challenges as the courts interpreted the new definition.
Any legal definition of commencement should be exactly that: the point
at which a development is commenced. It would be counterfactual at best
to say in legislation that a building project where the foundations or
roads are 49% complete or where only 99% of the pipes have been
connected has somehow not legally begun.</hs_para>

recognise the problem, this is not the right solution. It would do very
little to address the problem, while it would have wide-ranging
consequences for other areas of planning practice and have a very
significant adverse impact on local authorities, developers and third
parties. There is already a power available for a local planning
authority to serve a completion notice to deal with uncompleted
development. However, a far more productive approach would be to
address the underlying reasons for developers delaying their 
<?notus-xml column=1134?>schemes. The Government recognise the importance of
this through a number of initiatives, such as the £570 million
Get Britain Building fund to unlock stalled
sites.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022795000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000067">I hope

Best:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful for the debate that
this has stimulated and for the interventions from the noble Lord, Lord
Deben, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay. We have explored
an issue and taken it a little bit further than anyone has
before in these public fora. These ways of trying to persuade the
developer to start building—which is what we are all
about—are quite difficult, and it is quite messy to concentrate
on defining where commencement really lies. Concentrating on
completions of developments which are, obviously, at a later date than
my six months for a start, sounds a much improved way of
looking at this. I had not appreciated—and I am not sure if
others had—that it will be possible for the Planning
Inspectorate to place conditions relating to a timescale and a
definition of starting on more than simply the reduction in the amount
of affordable housing. The assumption has been that it is the reduction
in affordable housing that the planning inspector can talk about, and
these other, more sophisticated, aspects of getting things going have
been beyond the remit of the Planning Inspectorate when these appeals
come forward. We are hearing tonight that the planning inspector could,
in a way, substitute for the negotiation that has failed at the local
authority and developer end. These cases have gone forward only because
earlier negotiations have failed. It could be that the planning
inspector could substitute for that and come up with a set of
requirements that go with the consent to drop the amount of affordable
housing.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022795000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000069">I am

Lord Bishop of Liverpool:</Member></B> My Lords, you
do not need to be a sociologist to know that there are moments in
history that reveal the character of the nation. Such was the public
reaction to the possibility that something might happen to our forests
and woodlands. The people of England discovered a passion for trees
that they hardly knew they had. It was a surprise to some, not least
because our woodland cover hovers around 10%, whereas Europe as a whole
has forests that extend to about 40% of the landscape. Maybe it is
because we are less wooded that the people were even more protective of
the trees that we do have.</hs_para>

pay tribute to local people who emerged as guardians of the forests, to
the 42,000 people who made submissions to the Independent Panel on
Forestry, and to the hundreds of stakeholders who came to our regional
consultations. The panel, set up by the Secretary of State, Caroline
Spelman, was made up of dedicated experts in the field of forestry and
was served by an equally determined and industrious secretariat. Our
report and recommendations were unanimous. They captured the public
mood and, more importantly, interpreted that mood into policy
recommendations. There was robust debate in the panel but never any
acrimony, because we were all united in a determination to lay before
the Government and the people of England the clearest signposts for a
new public policy on forests and woodlands that would serve the country
for whole of the next
century<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:49:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022795000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000076">I
am delighted with the Government's response. Although the panel was
disbanded on completion of its task last July, I shall shortly convene
a meeting of the panel at which members can express directly to the
Secretary of State the full range of their views. However, no one can
deny that the direction of travel in the Government’s response
follows the signposts of the panel’s recommendations, and the
Government are to be congratulated on responding constructively to the
mood of the nation, expressed so vociferously and articulated so
cogently.</hs_para>

disease and pest control are seriously threatening and require research

pests do not respect national boundaries. Each nation must contribute
urgently and generously to this work, and the core expertise available
at the moment through forest services must be expanded.</hs_para>

ecosystem services are, simply, vital. Trees deliver clean water and
clean air. They protect against flooding and contribute to a low-carbon
culture. Speaking very personally now, and without the authority of the
panel, I wish that there were some way of linking payment for such
ecosystem services to our utility bills. That would show the public
their worth and provide money to invest in our ecosystem
infrastructure.</hs_para>

forestry expansion and better management require both public and
private investment. Creating the woodland industry action plan, as the
Government have already done, and renegotiating the rural development

woodland economy, which in itself will help to green the
nation’s economy. Forestry is good value, as the Church
Commissioners’ investment portfolio shows; I declare an
interest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022795000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000083">Seventhly,
guardians will hold the public forest estate in trust for
the nation under a parliamentary charter. The Government’s
response to this recommendation from the panel could not be clearer.
Succeeding the Forestry Commission, this new and evolved body will have
important freedoms. It will be set free from the short-term political
cycle that is so at variance with the lifecycle of trees, and it will
be free to be entrepreneurial, so that within a stated plan of forest
expansion it will be able to maximise the potential of all its assets.
By buying, borrowing, selling and sowing, it will create more woodland

areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022795000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000084">The

Eden of Winton:</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to follow the
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool. I applaud his most
interesting speech and the constructive and comprehensive report of the
panel over which he presided. I want to highlight one or two aspects
that featured in his report. I particularly welcome the emphasis given
to education—the need to involve people and to 
<?notus-xml column=1138?>teach them, as he pointed out, the value of
trees, woods and forests and the importance that they
represent not just for our pleasure but for our survival. However,
I hope that education will not be restricted to visits by
primary school children; older people need to know about the
value of trees just as much as small children
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:57:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022795000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000089">The
second point that the report emphasises is the need for access to
forests for the purposes of leisure, recreation and tourism. Those
activities can be damaging to the very environment that we are seeking
to protect in our forests and woodlands. Many decades ago I wrote a
report for the Council of Europe on sites of national scientific
interest and areas of outstanding natural beauty. I remember that in
preparing the report it was clear that too many people going into
sensitive environments like woodland settings can, as a result
of their footprint and their sheer numbers, cause an
enormous amount of damage. Damage was also caused by other leisure
activities, and I just hope that whoever runs our country’s
forestry activities will recognise the need to control them. Noisy
activities such as motorcycling should not be allowed because woodlands
are places to be enjoyed in quiet and in a degree of silence. People
can absorb what the woods can give to them only if they listen. If they
have ears to hear, they will hear what the woodland has to teach
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022795000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000090">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:49:58"></hs_TimeCode>
third point I want to stress is the value of woodland, of tree
planting, as a role in flood prevention. We have had a lot of
experience of floods—too much recently in some parts of the
country. If trees are planted in the river source, they will not only
stabilise the soil, they will control the tendency of those rivers to
flood<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
most important that we do not look simply at flood barriers at the end
of the river, we look at the flood protection work that tree planting
can achieve at the source of the
river<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:00:18"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:02:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022795000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000091">The
Government have now declared themselves as intent upon nationalising
the public forest estate, or rather, to put it more delicately, keeping
it in the public sector. I hope they will stress the need for the
public forest estate in the public sector to engage as much as possible
in joint venture activity with the private sector. The forest cover of
this country should not be retained solely in the hands of a public
sector organisation. Too often, a public sector organisation becomes
excessively bureaucratic and expensive, and develops its own degree of
inertia<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:01:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022795000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022795000092">I
hope that the Government will press forward vigorously with their own
statement of priorities and principles. Among other things, these are
to reduce Government involvement; minimise the amount of regulation;
encourage local participation and local initiative; and, above all,
work in partnership with other interests. Other interests are well
represented by private landlords; by estate owners; by organisations
such as the Tree Council, the Woodland Trust and the International Tree
Foundation; and also by those who are engaged in wood-working
enterprises and industries of various kinds.

we take this forward is key for the future. I hope that the Minister,

independent panel and the Government see funding through the common
agriculture policy as crucial to deliver on these forestry
goals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:04:04"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government have been making a strong rural development regulation a
priority in the ongoing CAP reform negotiations, pressing for more

the right reverend Prelate, as other noble Lords have done, for
introducing this debate and commend his report for its thoroughness. I
also read with interest my right honourable friend the Secretary of
State<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:08:39"></hs_TimeCode>’s
response to the
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000003">There
are a few points in the right reverend Prelate’s report that I
would like to explore a little further. One of the first matters of
prominence raised was calling on the Government to pioneer a new
approach to valuing and rewarding the management, involvement and
expansion of the woodland ecosystem. The Government referred in their
response to the Rural Development Programme, which the noble Baroness,
Lady Parminter, also mentioned. I am much interested in whether the
Minister can say how this fund could help in those periods where
funding in forestry can be very difficult to
attain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000004">Another
objective was to increase public access to woodland. In the report, the
public estate—in other words, Forestry Commission
land—amounts to around 18% of UK forestry. This is not the whole
story. I should be most interested to know whether the Minister can
give an idea of how much of the remaining part of the forestry estate
UK in public, NGO and private ownership provides some form of public
access. Perhaps it might be easier to say how much of the forestry
estate does not provide any access to the
public<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:10:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022796000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000005">It has also been
proposed and agreed by the Government that there should be more
woodland closer to areas of high population. I do not want to appear
negative on this subject, but in my book woodland areas considered to
be close to urban areas would be within an hour’s travelling.
There is high demand for land close to the urban population. An
illustration of the value of that is a four-acre paddock close to me
for sale at £20,000 an acre. Planting trees on it with
reasonable spacing will cost £1,500 an acre. Once trees 
<?notus-xml column=1141?>are planted, the value will drop to about £8,000 an acre, as can
be seen by the value of forest land already on the market.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022796000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000006">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
big difficulty is that if trees are planted on very high-value land,
there will be an immediate drop in its value. Encouraging people to
plant trees in these areas, whether in the public or the private
sector, will be very
difficult<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:11:46"></hs_TimeCode>.
Following that, there will be about 20 years of high maintenance costs
and very low income before gaining even the lowest amount of income
from thinning or whatever. It will be in the region of just a couple of
hundred pounds an acre.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:12:06"></hs_TimeCode>I of course
recognise the social and environmental reasons for woodland, but if we
are to increase our woodland by a substantial amount—even 1% or
2% is a substantial amount—we will have to get around that
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:12:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

for an increase in the amount of woodland managed to the UK forestry
standard from 50% to 80%. Perhaps the Minister will clarify how much
woodland managed to the UK forestry standard is grant-aided and whether
we have a gap of forestry that has been grant-aided but does not reach
the UK forestry standard. Having entered many forestry holdings in the
past into management agreements, even then I was horrified by the
amount of paperwork involved in the exercise. Last week, having
downloaded all 116 pages of the UK forestry standard, I hope my noble
friend will listen very closely to me when I say that perhaps we could
look at cutting a bit of red
tape<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:13:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000008">I
have also consulted some of my forest manager friends who are very
concerned that if management plans become a key driver in securing
grant assistance for woodland creation and management, it could be a
major disincentive to landowners at large to bring their woodlands into
better management or to plant new woodlands. Recent experience with
linking grant aid to forest certification has had a similar
effect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:14:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000009">Some
planting that we see nowadays, particularly by some non-governmental
organisations, has provided excellent amenity woodland and public
access but has not produced good-quality timber. It is possible to have
good amenity and public access, and still grow quality timber. Some
amenity timber planting has been planted at three-metre spacing. The
outcome of this spacing is poor-quality timber and high maintenance
costs. At three-metre spacing, a forester would have just over 1,200
trees per hectare. If he decreased that spacing to 1.5 metres, he would
have 5,000 trees per hectare. The higher the density, the less
maintenance and the better the quality of the
timber<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:15:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

subject. We have to ensure that we plant the right trees in the right
place. That means not just planting in the countryside but structural
planting and planting on housing estates where we end up planting
enormous trees at great expense. We should look at planting far smaller
trees and letting nature take its course. They will grow far better,
but if they die it would not be that expensive to replace them. I
greatly look forward to hearing from the Minister and other noble
Lords<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:16:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_27_PT_1/70CF1E9AAA1BB4BF33B5B4058373C1BBFEACD054" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 February 2013">Wednesday,

Framlingham:</Member></B> My Lords, I join the congratulations to the
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool on securing this debate
about trees, which are so central to our national welfare. His
panel’s recommendations are excellent, very timely, positive and
forward looking. Like us all, I have a huge affection for trees. I
founded and ran for many years my own forestry company and I was for
some time president of the Arboricultural Association. It is hard to
improve on the description of the value of trees given by the right
reverend Prelate, although I shall try
briefly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000012">It is
hard to believe that trees fulfil so many functions. They take our
waste carbon dioxide and give us their oxygen. They provide us with
timber for so many uses, including construction, housing and flooring.
They provide habitats for birds and insects. They alleviate flooding
and stabilise land, to which reference has already been made. They help
landscape lawns and gardens. Most importantly of all, they are
beautiful to behold.</hs_para>

most important buzzword politically in these days of economic
recession, is growth. Trees cannot by themselves solve our economic
problems, but they can help a little because they grow. Trees have not
heard about AAA rating, the value of the pound, the national debt or
the balance of payments. You plant a tree and, provided you take some
care in doing it, it will grow year on year, increasing your investment
both in timber and in pleasure. We have every reason in the world to
plant more and to look after them.</hs_para>

points. My first point, which has already been touched on, is about the
balance between public and privately owned trees, leaving aside the
question of access, which I acknowledge has to be handled carefully. I
am anxious that there should not be the idea in the mind of the public
that one is more desirable than the other. While it clearly is helpful
and desirable to have public and government involvement in the planting
and maintenance of trees and woodland, I trust it also will always be
acknowledged that private landowners planting and caring for their own
trees on their own land will always have a huge investment in those
trees financially and, more importantly, emotionally.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022796000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000015">My second point is
about the vexed question of chalara fraxinea, ash dieback, its possible
disastrous effect on our landscape and what can be done to prevent
similar outbreaks. I do not want to rehearse all the history of how we
got to where we are. We are all waiting now to see what the new growing
season will bring and then what action, if any, will prove necessary.
My concern is how it got here from Europe and the fact that we are
squandering the priceless asset of being an island nation in terms of
our bio-security.</hs_para>

in ’73 campaign, the demand for trees has increased steadily.
This has coincided with the globalisation of tree diseases as trees are
routinely shipped around the world. As nurserymen have increasingly
imported stock, the situation has been exacerbated by two other
factors. First, to protect themselves against the last-minute
cancellation of orders because of lack of funding or grant withdrawals
many UK growers have used foreign suppliers as a kind of 
<?notus-xml column=1143?>bank to draw on rather than growing the trees.
Secondly, UK seed has been grown abroad and reimported as plants to
preserve its UK provenance. This has resulted in the importation of
trees on a massive scale: 500,000 ash trees alone on an annual basis.
Oliver Rackham, a well-known botanist and ecologist, has
written:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13022796000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000038">“It
seems that any of the world’s plant diseases is at liberty to
enter Britain provided it does so via some other European Union
country. By the time the problem has been detected and the bureaucracy
has clanked into action, it is too late. Once a tree disease has become
established in a country, it is almost unknown for it to be controlled,
let alone
exterminated”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13022796000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000017">It
must be possible with the co-operation of all the organisations
concerned and with the Government to devise a system that allows for
the sensible forecasting of demand, by species, of the number of trees
required nationally in the coming years. Without sacrificing the
competitive tendering process, surely the nurserymen and the
horticultural trade can be given the kind of firm commitment to numbers
required that would allow them to expand and grow the trees that we are
going to need in the years ahead. We could then be more self-sufficient
and reduce our dependency on foreign imports. This would not eliminate
the possibility of importing new diseases—only a complete ban
would do that and we may have to consider that—but such a
commitment would be an enormous step in the right direction, and I urge
the Minister to give it the most serious
consideration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000018">Perhaps
I could give your Lordships’ House two illustrations. If you go
to Christ’s College, Cambridge, and walk through its
fantastically ornate and famous gate to the fellows’ garden you
will see a mulberry tree under which John Milton is supposed to have
sat as he composed <I>Paradise Lost</I>. You could not imagine a more
idyllic situation. If you drove up to Wakefield and got the Home
Office’s permission to go into the top-security prison there,
you would go through a very severe-looking gate into a yard at the
back. There is another mulberry tree, standing in the circular island
in the middle of the yard. This used to be the exercise yard when the
prison was for female inmates. They were allowed to exercise only
around this island that contained the mulberry tree. They were not
allowed to speak, so they had to mime. This of course is from where we
get the mime: here we go round the mulberry bush on a cold and frosty
morning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000019">These
illustrations show the part that trees play in all our lives. We must

Lyell:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by thanking the right reverend
Prelate for instituting the debate tonight. I also have to declare an
interest. If noble Lords glance at the relevant documents, they will
find that I purported to be responsible for some forests in Scotland. I
have enormous interests in Liverpool. In an earlier incarnation, the
right reverend Prelate was once kind enough to bring some wonderful
primary school children to play harp music, which showed us one aspect
of that wonderful 
<?notus-xml column=1144?>city. The right reverend Prelate has spoken broadly. Those of your
Lordships who might go to Liverpool are perhaps not aware of an area
that I tend to go to, Quickswood and Woolton, together with huge areas
of parks. I do not tour round many of the great cities of northern
England. There are certainly lovely parks here in London. What the
right reverend Prelate has in Liverpool is something of which to be
very proud and it is relevant that he has started this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000021">I go
to Liverpool for various activities and have been going there for 45
years. Last night, and all the time, there is a blue glow.
Interestingly, the son-in-law of my great friend at the blue glow
centre—he will be known although he was not on the panel with
the right reverend Prelate—is called Chris Starr, and he
lectures and teaches. Above all your Lordships will be pleased to know
that he put a sharp pin into me and told me to cut down the speech and
just concentrate on what is necessary. From the University of Cumbria
he has taught me a great deal about
forests.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000022">Will
the Minister let me know later—not necessarily
tonight—about item 6 in the Government’s response, which
was referred to by the right reverend Prelate, looking at what is good
for the economy? I understand that the benefit of the forestry industry
in England and Wales is £400 million per annum. That is the net
financial benefit to the nation. There were costs of some £72
million, which have gone out, and at the moment land sales are frozen.
That does not necessarily worry one too much. Above all, can my noble
friend confirm and give us any good news about resilience in the
forestry industry? There is a great partnership of public and private
owners throughout the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000023">Item
6 of the Government’s response states that forestry is good for
people and the right reverend Prelate referred extensively to that.
Every single one of us—the right reverend Prelate has the
figures—sees, enjoys, visits and relaxes in the forests. Here I
may clash ever so lightly with my noble friend Lord Eden, though this
may not be something covered by tonight’s debate. Not 50 miles
from where he and I used to meet in Scotland, one of the most valuable
sources of income for the Forestry Commission, doing minimal damage, on
one day in the year, was car rallies. If my noble friend thinks that
everything is sylvan rural and that you can hear a pin drop, he might
wish to hear some of the forest machinery at work, but he is absolutely
right that a forest should be a place of enjoyment and
relaxation.</hs_para>

above all good for people. I found a headline about a bit of education.
We are lucky that this aspect is in Scotland, and more and more in
England and Wales, and in Liverpool too; it is about encouraging
youngsters and older people of all types to come out and learn to
appreciate trees and forestry that they might not otherwise have looked
at. Stressed in the Government’s reply to the wonderful report
by the right reverend Prelate and his colleagues, and particularly
important, are local participation and the involvement of local
communities for their advice and thoughts. In almost all cases, they
produce very constructive results, especially when foresters
join in. They might come and ask whether you have
tried, for instance, kestrels, on a Lodgepole Pine, which 
<?notus-xml column=1145?>apparently kept the voles down, but until the RSPB came nobody had
necessarily thought of that. Participate as far as you can with local
communities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000025">Perhaps
my noble friend can write to me on this. I understand that
we have seen a figure, and that it is hoped that 12% of
England will be forested by 2060. I am not too sure what the
percentage is as of today, but I know that many years ago I was
catapulted off to Northern Ireland, where I was given the
responsibility of agriculture. Guess what we had there—forestry.
I seem to recall that the figure for England, Scotland and Wales was
something in the region of 10%, but I would be most grateful
if my noble friend could indicate tonight or later how near we are to
that target figure of 12%. In 1984, I noted that in France and what was
then West Germany the relevant figure for land covered by forestry was
22% and 23%. Perhaps it is dangerous to talk of like for like, when
they have different climates and different types of
tree.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000026">The

one main, lasting plea. My kind friend in Temple Sowerby in Cumbria
asked me to ask the Minister to see what his department could do to use

the first step. Then one can expand elsewhere, planting suitable trees

three parts of the Statement that my honourable friend the Minister of
State made on 31 January about the future of forestry. My heart lifted
when I read that the Government are going to review the “wider
forestry functions”. This is a wonderful opportunity to sort out
the Forestry Commission. I have disliked it ever since I started to
learn about forestry; it is judge, jury, prosecution, defence and
practitioner all in one. It is totally inappropriate these days that
all those functions should be held in one body. It plants the wrong
trees in the wrong place and regularly lags behind the pace of change
of the private sector, which is totally in hock to the Forestry
Commission and has to follow its bad practices of even-aged,
single-block woodlands, followed by the dreadful desecration of clear
felling<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:33:16"></hs_TimeCode>. Nothing
could be more unnatural. We are not good at forestry in this country,
but we are very good at growing trees in straight lines, sawing them
flat and bulldozing the remains into piles. That is not what I call
forestry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:33:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

been saying that we should move to mixed, uneven-aged forestry, with no
clear felling. I have advocated that, and I hope that now is the right
time for Her Majesty's Government to insist that at least half the
state forests should be converted to this type of management. That
would require massive retraining and education to make our foresters
proper foresters in this country. We would have to bring in overseas
experts, who do this well, to train them—but if the Forestry
Commission and the state sector were doing this, it would encourage the
private sector to do it and fulfil all the aims of what the right
reverend Prelate is trying to do. You would get better disease control,
better diversity and better wildlife, as well as better economic return
from following that type of management, if done
properly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:34:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000032">I
move on to the future of forestry. To paraphrase part of what my noble
friend Lord Courtown said, “It’s the economics,
stupid”. There is only one tree in this country that is
economically viable, and that is a Sitka spruce. Some 80% of the timber
produced in this country is from that tree. There is a good market for
its timber, and it is producing some 3% to 4% annually biological
growth. That used to be a poor return, but today it is a very good one
when compared to other
investments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:35:08"></hs_TimeCode>. The
land prices continue to rise. As my noble friend Lord Courtown said,
there is a differential between agricultural land and forestry
land<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:35:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000033">So
Sitka spruce is good, but what about the rest? They range from variable
to just acceptable to disastrous, unless one has top quality hardwoods.
Ash and larch are a disaster at the moment because of disease, and oak
might well go that way soon. So let us look at what has happened to
prices. The coniferous standing sales average price index shows that
there has been a 58% decline in real terms since March 1985 to
September 2012. That is a staggering loss for landowners and, until
that situation is rectified, there is only one economic tree
available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:36:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022796000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#13022796000034">With
regard to hardwoods, the right reverend Prelate said that we must have
a plan for the whole of this century. That is about three-quarters of
the time it takes to grow a decent stand of oak, so we are not looking
at a 100-year programme but at one of at least 200 years. Of course,
our hardwoods have been decimated by two world wars. The whole planting
system is out of kilter and we have a lot of catching up to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:36:54"></hs_TimeCode>. Perhaps one
chink of light is thinnings, which have been a disaster area for so
long, but they are beginning to show some sort of return because so
much is now being used for
fuel<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:37:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

we need to plant more land. However, we must plant the right trees in
the right places. The Forestry Commission has planted 72% of its land
with conifers, but in the private sector the figure is only 17%. That
is a much more interesting figure. If we plant 50% more woodland, as
the right reverend Prelate says in his report, what will it mean? He
also wants the land cover to rise from 10% to 15%. That would roughly
take us back to what this country had at the time of the
<I>Dome</I><I>sday Book</I>. To plant that amount of land would require
about 650,000 hectares, which is about the size of Cumbria. For noble
Lords 
<?notus-xml column=1147?>who are not very good on anything north of Watford, that is more than
the size of Kent, Surrey and Sussex put together. It is a fair chunk of
the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:38:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is economic to grow is Sitka spruce, the only land that should be used
is in the north of England. The right reverend Prelate now faces a
dilemma because he wants trees to be planted much closer to the towns,
which is right; there should also be more trees down south. How will
those trees be funded? If they are to be recreational trees, which
people can go out and hug and which make them feel better—I
fully agree that that is essential—who will fund them? Will it
be taxpayers? Have the Government got taxpayers’ money for that?
Unless the Government give considerably more subsidies and good grants
to those landowners who are prepared to use their land for a
loss-making enterprise—they will have to look more than 100
years ahead—with the best will in the world, that will not be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T20:39:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

long-term operation, the dark cloud on the horizon in forestry terms is
climate change. If anything like the worst predictions come about, we
will not be able to grow the kind of trees that we have now and to
decide now about hardwoods, which might not be growing in the same
places in 50 or 60 years’ time, is another disincentive. That
makes it very difficult for the Government to sell that to the private
sector and to their own state arm, but we need to take it into account
because if this country warms up or we get more gales and more wind
blow, we will have to plant different areas with different species. We
have not been good at that in the past and I fear that we might not be
very good at that in the
future.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_27_PT_1/FA69DD1E307109D72C386D23D847957BFCE57CC3" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 February 2013">Wednesday,

more importantly for so brilliantly chairing and guiding the
independent panel on its journey through the challenging but beautiful
landscape and livelihood of our forests and woodlands to a superb
report on their future and the social, environmental and economic
opportunities that they offer. He made a splendid speech
today and I wholeheartedly agree with his ABC, but I also rather like
the idea of linking the benefits of our trees and forests to our
utility bills, and I hope that that can be explored.</hs_para>

welcome the positive tone of the Government’s response to the

public ownership, the rescinding of the policy of disposing of 15% of

have to disagree with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Eden, on the
public forest estate, which I believe 
<?notus-xml column=1148?>is well and sustainably managed and is much more efficient in many ways
in its productivity than the private estates are. To the noble Earl,
Lord Courtown, I say that in the Forest of Dean we have good access, we

answer to some supplementary questions in this House a couple of weeks
ago, the Minister hinted that we might expect a Bill to be announced in

suggest to the noble Lord that such a Bill should be subject to
pre-legislative scrutiny to ensure maximum opportunity for
consultation. I am extremely concerned about the much valued and
multi-expert Forestry Commission, both its future and its current
situation. I do not agree with the comments of the noble Earl, Lord
Caithness, although he was right to point out that our forests were
decimated by two world wars. In the Forest of Dean, our forest was

effect that the cuts will have on the viability of the proposed new
management organisation and the implementation of the proposed policy.
I again ask the Minister for confirmation that there will be no further
redundancies and no further cuts to the budget, and for his assurance
that the Forestry Commission will be adequately funded. Like the noble

recommended that the quantity and quality of access to woods be
increased so that access to woodland should be the norm. I understand
that one way in which the Government are looking to increase access is
through developing rights of way improvement plans. In the light of a
recent Ramblers report showing that nearly 70% of councils have cut
their rights of way budgets over the past three years, will the

his introduction to that report, the right reverend Prelate commented
how, as a society, we had lost sight of the value of trees and
woodlands. The panel’s report challenged all of us—the
Government, the forestry sector and society as a whole—to value
our nation’s woodlands more. We have embraced this challenge
with passion and conviction. Our Forestry and Woodlands Policy
Statement, published on 31 January, addressed all of the issues raised
by the panel, and went further by setting out a new policy approach to
our forestry responsibilities based on the clear priorities of
protecting, improving and expanding our woodland assets. It also
recognised the scope for realising more or our woodlands’ value
through a better understanding of the benefits they provide and the
importance of ensuring that we have the most effective and efficient
delivery arrangements in place. It included over 30 new steps that my
department and the Forestry Commission will be taking and it invited
all stakeholders, including those involved in the panel, to work with
us to deliver the new woodland culture envisaged by the
panel.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130227100000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-0002.htm#130227100000003">At
the heart of this new policy statement is a firm commitment to the
public forest estate. It will remain secure in public ownership for the
people who enjoy it, the businesses that depend on it and the wildlife
that thrives in it. To achieve this, we will set up a new operationally
independent body to manage the estate and hold it in trust for the
nation. It will have greater independence from government, greater
freedom to manage its resources sustainably and a clear remit to
maximise the income it generates from the estate through
entrepreneurial activity. The estate will, however, remain firmly in
public ownership and the right safeguards will be in place for it to
operate for the long-term benefit of people, nature and the economy.
Our statement also recognises that there is an important job for the
Government to do with the wider woodland and forestry sector, providing
it with appropriate leadership and support so that we can grow our
forests and protect what we

there is no effective treatment, we are now focusing our efforts on
minimising the impact of the disease on our economy, environment

other tree diseases. The next step will be the publication of an
updated control plan at the end of March, which will set out our
approach around four key objectives. They are slowing the rate of
spread; developing resistance in the UK ash population; encouraging

further the markets and supply chains that will help them realise an
economic return from their woodlands. We therefore warmly welcome the
initiative to develop the industry’s new action plan under the

introduced the Motor Fuel (Road Vehicle and Mobile Machinery)
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Regulations 2012, to which these
amendments closely relate. The GHG regulations require suppliers to
report on the greenhouse gas intensity of the fossil fuels that they
supply. The Government must obtain this information to meet our
obligations under the FQD but are not able to require it under the RTFO
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022781000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000007">Both
the RTFO and GHG schemes are administered by the same team at the
Department for Transport. The reporting requirements of each align as
closely as possible to minimise potential burdens on suppliers. 
<?notus-xml column=158?>The RTFO obligation is met by redeeming renewable transport fuel

the legislation stands, the obligation would be 5% for 2013-14 and
thereafter. The order would adjust this figure to 4.74% from 2013-14 to
ensure that the proposed expansion of the RTFO scheme does not at this
point result in an increase in the absolute volume of biofuel supplied
in the UK. This is necessary because of concerns about the
sustainability of some biofuels when emissions from indirect land use
change are taken into account. The Commission proposed a directive in
October to address ILUC. Until such time as ILUC is resolved, we are
not in a position to increase the obligation level on suppliers under
the RTFO. We will, however, keep this under
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022781000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000009">In

Berkeley:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a very interesting order and
quite complicated for some people to understand. I have a few questions
for the
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:50:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022781000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000011">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:51:48"></hs_TimeCode>
first question refers to this issue of non-road mobile machinery. The
Minister will be aware that a lot of work and debate took place on this
issue, which has been around for some time. The Commission, after much
persuasion, produced a directive which was published in October or
November 2011 and allowed non-road mobile machinery to continue not to
comply with stage III B or the equivalent for a period of three years.
That would allow the railway industry—I declare an interest as
chairman of the Rail Freight Group—to purchase locomotives which
did not comply with the new directive. There is a good reason for that:
nobody had designed a locomotive that would comply, so it was either no
locomotives or ones which did not
comply<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:51:35"></hs_TimeCode>.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:45:00"></hs_TimeCode> industry
persuaded the Commission of this and since then, surprisingly maybe,
one or two designs have popped up. However, there is still a demand for
this. It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:45:00"></hs_TimeCode> is now
one year and three months since the directive was agreed in Brussels
but it has not yet been converted into British law. So, technically,
although anybody who buys a locomotive—I think that it also
applies to tractors and other things off-road—is compliant with
EU legislation, they can be taken to court and fined in this country
because the Government have not got round to producing these
regulations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:52:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

can therefore answer two questions. First, when are we going to see
these regulations? I hope the answer will not be “soon”,
because in many Governments’ terms “soon” probably
means a year’s time, and by that time they will have run out of
space<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:52:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

what effect will the new regulation converting the directive into UK
law have on this order? It seems to me—I may have got it wrong;
I stand to be corrected—that we are implementing what is not a
very sensible 
<?notus-xml column=159?>scheme from the Commission to add biofuel to existing fuel, especially
when there is a shortage of crop area and crops around the world, which
puts up the cost of fuel. Turning some of those crops into bio seems a
bit perverse to me. Certainly the Renewable Energy Association believes
that this will be a seriously perverse incentive to investment in
renewable fuels and renewable generating capacity. It is talking about
the market size being reduced to 30% or 40%, jeopardising investment of
£1 billion and putting 3,500 jobs at
risk<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:53:59"></hs_TimeCode>. One can

agreement, that there was not much trouble with finding the funds for
investment. The two problems were: first, planning—which is
going on in the Chamber at the moment; and secondly, some kind of
comfort for the investors that the Government are not going to change
their mind and change the ground rules or the buy-in price or whatever

Bradshaw:</Member></B> The question that I wish to address to the
Minister is slightly different from that of the noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley. Making renewable fuels is a very complex and difficult thing,
and we know that there is a lot of tension between the use of land for
agriculture for producing food, and turning that crop into fuel. The
noble Earl will recall that we have had discussions before on the
question of recycling used cooking oil. This used to enjoy a margin of
20 pence over the ordinary cost of fossil fuels. The Government, in
their wisdom, decided to put an end to this and
“generously”—in inverted commas—decided
that when this cooking oil is converted into fuel, it should enjoy a
premium of two renewable fuel
certificates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022781000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000017">I
would like to know, since this has been in place, how much we are
actually paying in the way of money for transport renewable
certificates compared with the 20p which was a very definite sum and
caused investors to really work hard at this particular subject. I am
of the opinion that two renewable fuel certificates do not equal 20
pence, and I would like to know whether they have ever reached that.
The important point is that as well as producing renewable fuels, the
producers of renewable energy from cooking oil are doing a very
important job in removing it from landfill, or stopping it from being
tipped into rivers or drains or whatever they do with it. Unless it is
worth while for people to collect and refine it, it will end up not
being used and being dumped in some form or another on the
landscape<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:58:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

somebody who uses red diesel for heating oil, for tractors and also, at
times, for generating electricity. In the amendment of Article 3(6) it
talks about fuels that do not include a whole lot of additives to
improve the fuel in terms of lubricity and various other things. If the
renewable fuel is added, I wonder if that actually takes the place of
some of these additives, and whether it will lower the freezing point.
One of the problems with red diesel is that when it gets down below
zero degrees centigrade to about minus eight or 10 degrees, it starts
to wax up. I wonder whether the renewable fuel additive will actually
help to prevent the freezing or the
waxing.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13022781000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000110"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T15:59:39"></hs_TimeCode>4

happen to be a great supporter of renewable energy of all forms, and we
as the UK have got challenging, legally binding targets to
significantly increase the amount of renewable energy we use in our
energy systems. These are energy targets, not just electricity targets,
which means that the 15% we have to reach applies to transport, heat
and electricity. Currently we have one policy that supports renewable
fuels in transport and that is the

the RTFO is asking for 5% of the fuel supply to be made up of renewable
sources and the Government have frozen that level. We know that we are
going to need more than 5% in order to hit our targets, yet we have a
policy that is frozen in time, with no longevity or future certainty,
stuck at 5%. Now we have an order in front of us that is reducing this
market further—not increasing it, not providing growth for that
industry, not supporting new jobs, not providing UK farmers with new
opportunities for selling products—no, freezing it and reducing
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022781000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000021">What is
going on? It is almost as if those legal obligations did not exist. Yet
they do, so what are we going to do? We will have to scurry at the end
to try to build an industry which is there at the moment but is at
severe risk of being undermined, of jobs being lost and investors
fleeing, because of this continual undermining through these miserly

has been said before that you have to think of this in terms of volumes
of litres of fuel sold, not just in percentages. Overall, fuel sales in
this country are going down, so the percentage is also going down. So
when the Government say, “We have to reduce this to 4.7% so that
there are not more biofuels being sold”, that is nonsense.
Actually that 5% is less and less every time the total fuel sold in
this country goes down. Can the Government please explain their logic?
They are talking about reducing the size of this market, and I find it
particularly objectionable that they would use so-called green
credentials to do this.</hs_para>

has the best standards for biofuels of any country; they are world
class, yet we are providing only 12% of this

confidence and there is no backing from the Government. This is yet

renewable heat incentive also prevents the use of liquid biofuels for
the gaining of credits in that market. Are the Government seriously
saying that they support this industry? Absolutely not, they are doing

tallow and say, “Okay, all grades of tallow are waste and
therefore will get double certification”. That would look great,
but the only snag is that the better grades of tallow are also used for
making soap. Therefore, there would be less high-grade tallow available
for making soap, the people making soap would have to find something
else with which to make it, and they would go for palm oil. An

they are not listening to its complaints. The Government do not seem to
understand that the industry has had an increase in its market share up

is no future trajectory, no sign of when there will be a future

and impact assessments have demonstrated that some biofuels actually
produce greater carbon emissions than fossil fuels when indirect land
use change is factored in. The UK must in law comply with the EU
renewable energy directive—RED—which contains a target
for the UK to source 15% of its overall energy, and 10% of energy used
in transport, from renewable sources by 2020. However, we are not
prepared to move so fast that we create indirect land use change
problems in the mean time. I am sorry that I have not been able to

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl

the House and in this Committee on the Health and Social Care Act, and
the noble Lord will remember the lengthy debates on the Bill itself. In
this Session debates have taken place on secondary legislation that
puts in place key elements of the new system. Most recently, we debated
the NHS Bodies and Local Authorities (Partnership Arrangements, Care
Trusts, Public Health and Local Healthwatch) Regulations 
<?notus-xml column=166?>on 5 February and the draft Local Authorities (Public Health Functions

draft order, however, is very different from those sets of regulations.

to amend primary legislation, it is right and proper that it is subject
to affirmative resolution. But it is made under a narrow power

the amendments it makes are of significant interest. They are minor
adjustments, needed as a direct consequence of the Health and Social
Care Act 2012. They help to keep the statute book up to date and
coherent, but they involve no new policies. Consistently with this,
neither the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments nor the Secondary
Legislation Scrutiny Committee has seen a need to draw special
attention to the draft order. That confirms that the amendments in the
order are indeed consequential on the Act.</hs_parafo>

brief and amends only a few pieces of legislation, it may be helpful if
I explain the reason for the amendments to each Act in turn. I will
start with the simplest. Section 403 of the Education Act 1996 refers
to an NHS body within the meaning of Section 28(6) of the National
Health Service Act 2006. Following the amendments to the 2006 Act made
by the Health and Social Care Act, this is now Section 275(1). The

accordingly.</hs_para>

5 to the Health and Social Care Act already removes the reference to
“strategic health authority” from the definition of

removes the reference to primary care trust from the Vehicle Excise and

second Act is the Welfare Reform Act 2012. Section 130 of this Act
identifies circumstances in which local authorities may use or disclose
information about certain benefit claimants, including when the
claimant is in hospital accommodation provided by an NHS trust, a
foundation trust or a primary care trust. Again, the draft order
removes the reference to “a primary care trust” without
replacement. The Health 
<?notus-xml column=167?>and Social Care Act creates no new provider bodies, so it is not
necessary to replace this reference to a primary care trust.</hs_para>

turn next to the Audit Commission Act 1998. The amendments to this Act
look more complex because they amend a number of provisions, but their
purpose is very simple. The Audit Commission Act is best known for
setting out the audit framework for local authorities, which also
applies, with some differences, to health service bodies. As matters
currently stand, however, the Health and Social Care Act provides for
clinical commissioning groups’ accounts to be audited by the
Audit Commission in accordance with the Audit Commission Act, but the
Audit Commission Act itself does not apply to clinical commissioning
groups. These are the new bodies that are being established under the
Health and Social Care Act to commission the majority of secondary
healthcare. The draft order therefore amends the Audit Commission Act
to ensure that its requirements for health service bodies apply to
clinical commissioning groups. The amendments also recognise the role
of the NHS Commissioning Board in relation to clinical commissioning
groups. For example, if an auditor of a clinical commissioning group
thinks that there has been unlawful expenditure, the auditor must
notify the Commissioning Board in addition to the Secretary of
State<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T16:27:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

turn now to the amendments to the Local Government Act 2000 and to the
Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, which I
shall refer to as the 2000 Act and the 2007 Act. In both cases, the
draft order removes references to primary care trusts and replaces them
with references to the NHS Commissioning Board and to the relevant
clinical commissioning group. The context here is one of commissioning
services rather than providing them, so it is appropriate to make this
substitution. To explain this in more detail, Section 104 of the 2007
Act sets out persons who are “partner authorities” of
certain local authorities. The list currently includes primary care
trusts. The definition of “partner authority” is relevant
for a number of provisions in both the 2000 Act and the 2007 Act. For
example, Section 9FF of the 2000 Act applies, with some exceptions,
where an overview and scrutiny committee or its sub-committee makes a
report or recommendation to the local authority or its executive on
certain functions of a “relevant partner authority” that
are exercised in relation to the committee’s area or residents
of that area. In such a case, Section 9FF(2) enables the committee to
require the relevant partner
authority,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13022781000104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000104">“to

there is an exclusion, and this brings me to the amendment to Section
9FF(6). The exclusion applies where the relevant partner authority is a
“health service body” and the report or recommendation is
made by an overview and scrutiny committee or sub-committee of a
non-unitary district council. There is also an exclusion where the
report or recommendation is additionally made to a health service body
under regulations under Section 244 of the National Health Service Act;
those regulations, of course, concern review and scrutiny of the health
service by local authorities. The definition of “health service
body” in Section 9FF(6) currently includes a primary
care trust. It makes sense to replace this with references to the NHS
Commissioning Board and clinical commissioning groups because of the
functions that those bodies are taking on from primary care
trusts.</hs_para>

Commission is that the fees it sets help keep audit fees down
generally. My question to the noble Earl is: if clinical commissioning
groups now have to use the big auditing firms, is there not some
concern that fees will rise over time because there is not the
discipline of the Audit Commission being able to provide an audit
service itself? Given that the management costs available to clinical
commissioning groups are quite limited, that would be a concern. Other

Howe:</Member></B> I am grateful to both noble Lords for their comments
and questions. I turn first to the question posed by the noble Lord,
Lord Hunt, around the Audit Commission and its role. The noble Lord is
right: the Government’s intention is to bring forward
legislation, as soon as parliamentary time allows, to replace the Audit
Commission. The legislation will abolish the Audit Commission and
establish a new framework for the audit of local public bodies in
England. The Commons committee that undertook pre-legislative scrutiny
of the Draft Local Audit Bill published its report on 17 January. The
Government are considering the report very carefully and we will
publish a response in due course. I think that that is all I can say in
the context of the noble Lord’s question about fees, but if I
have any further points to add I will, of course, write to
him.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022781000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000071">The noble

to both the letter and the spirit of those undertakings. However, we
understand the concerns that have been raised by noble Lords and

noble Lord asked me about the definition of social care in the context
of this order. I am perhaps not the best person for making up
definitions on my feet. However, in terms of care of the elderly,
social care is that activity which is characterised by the service
provided by local authorities and their contractors to look after
elderly people, both in residential accommodation and in their own
homes by way of domiciliary care. The noble Lord mentioned patients
with Alzheimer’s disease. I would perhaps sound a slight caveat
because people with Alzheimer’s disease can, of course, be
looked after in a variety of settings, including a healthcare setting.
However, there are very many individuals who are looked after in their
own homes and in residential care as well. Social care tends to be
characterised as care that does not involve a specific health input,
but rather the care of an individual for their day-to-day living

Section 73 of the Charities Act 2011 to give effect to the provisions
of a scheme settled by the Charity Commission for England and Wales.
The purpose of the scheme is to amend the existing trusts of the
Incorporated Church Building Society, the ICBS, a charity which gives
grants for the building and repairing of Anglican churches and chapels,
and to simplify its administrative
provisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022781000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000076">The
charity is regulated by the Church Building Society Act 1828 and
therefore this order is needed to give effect to the changes to that
Act contained in the Charity Commission scheme. Because the 1828 Act is
a public general Act, the scheme cannot be made without the draft order
first being approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament, in

2011.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022781000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000077">The ICBS

years, it enjoyed considerable public support and contributed to the
building and repair of Anglican churches and chapels. By 1845, the
society was assisting with the building of more than 50 churches a
year. It was the principal voluntary society for promoting the building
and restoration of Anglican churches in the 19th century, the most
active period of church building since the Middle Ages, and provided
funds via grants and loans.</hs_parafo>

however, public support waned to the extent that by the early 1980s the
society’s activities had shrunk considerably. The then trustees
were concerned that the administrative costs of maintaining it as an
independent charity, though modest, were absorbing an unjustifiable
proportion of its income, 
<?notus-xml column=171?>which by then was derived largely from investments. To improve
efficiency, another charity with similar objects, the Historic Churches
Preservation Trust, now succeeded by the National Churches Trust,
agreed to administer the society’s affairs for a small
fee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022781000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000079">The ICBS
was registered with the Charity Commission in 1962. A commission scheme
is now needed to enable the National Churches Trust to take full
trusteeship of the ICBS. However, due to the statutory basis of the
ICBS, a parliamentary order is required to give effect to the scheme,
which repeals all but the preamble and four sections of the 1828 Act,
and provides for the administration of the
charity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022781000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000080">The
National Churches Trust is the only independent UK-wide charity
supporting and promoting Christian places of worship. It does this
through the provision of grants for repairs and modernisation, and
through the provision of support, advice and information. The general
committee of the ICBS has aligned the use of the remaining funds of the
society with the general aims and objectives of the NCT, subject to
ICBS funds being used to support those buildings with which the society
is associated, namely Church of England buildings constructed from 1818
onwards. To this end, in recent years, and in anticipation of the
implementation of the scheme, the remaining ICBS funds are being used
to provide repair grants to churches that fall within this
criterion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022781000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000081">The
proposed scheme, which is being made at the request of the
charity’s current trustees, sets out the powers of the new
corporate trustee. The 1828 Act specifies that the trustees of the
charity are the management committee. This governing body is more than
80 strong and includes the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, 44
diocesan bishops of the two provinces of Canterbury and York and 36
elected lay members of the charity. Members of the charity

declare what is almost an interest here. I am very conscious that Sir
Titus Salt, who built Saltaire, not only built two churches in Saltaire
for a village with a population of only just over 1,500 people but gave
a very considerable amount of money for the erection and repair not
only of Congregational and Methodist churches but also of Anglican
churches all over the north of England. As I walk around Yorkshire, I
am not entirely sure that the “repair” of a number of 
<?notus-xml column=172?>medieval churches during this period was something of which I entirely
approve, but no doubt at the time it was regarded as entirely
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022781000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000084">The
1828 Act does not set out the charity’s powers explicitly in the
way that modern charity governing documents do, so the scheme also
provides the charity with standard powers, most of which are found in
the model governing documents on the commission’s website. A
significant motivation behind the trustees applying for this scheme was
to modernise the governance and governing document of the charity. The

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
introducing a very welcome statutory instrument. As he indicated, the
National Churches Trust, the only national, independent charity
supporting religious buildings, does a great deal of valuable work. As
he outlined, for two centuries it and its predecessor have been key
players in the construction and maintenance of a great number of
churches and chapels. Its work has provided places for worship, as well
as supporting church buildings of historical and architectural
value<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T16:47:26"></hs_TimeCode>. In recent
years, the charity has given Christian places of worship an average of
£1.5 million a year in grants, allowing them to
conduct vital repairs and modernisation, including increasing access,
which clearly we
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T16:47:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022781000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000087">The
work of the charity goes beyond religion and benefits the whole
community. Every year, millions of people use church buildings for a
range of activities, including classes for art, music and
health—and even Labour Party meetings. The churches are also
spaces for people to seek help. More than half of all Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings take place in churches, as do 40% of Women’s
Institute meetings. I am sure that the Minister, wearing one of his
other hats, knows that one polling station in six at the most recent
general election was in a church building. I fear that, for some of us,
it is the only time we cross the threshold of a church. With pubs,
social clubs and libraries closing, churches are often the last
remaining community buildings. Therefore it is clear that the
Incorporated Church Building Society provides a great deal for people
of all faiths and of
none<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T16:49:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022781000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022781000088">As
the Minister explained, as time rolled on, its constitution sometimes
got in the way of its good work. As he suggested, by the 1980s its
activities had shrunk and the trustees discovered, as had those of many
other charities, that a greater administrative burden and awkward
membership arrangements took up a lot of time as they tried to maintain
it as an independent charity. The cost of administration became
disproportionately high. We hope that the new scheme will address that.
The statutory instrument, drawn up at the request of the current
trustees, will allow the charity to update its structure. Importantly,
as the 
<?notus-xml column=173?>Minister said, it will make the trustees the sole members, as opposed to
the current arrangements which include anyone who donates a guinea.
However, I realise that some people will not have his and my age and I
thought I should explain that that is £1.05p. Or they could make
a single donation of 10 guineas, which I worked out was £10.50p.
The change would modernise the trust’s governance arrangements,
simplify the administrative requirements and help to free up the
charity to concentrate on its core business. I take this opportunity to
congratulate the National Churches Trust on its work. We wish it well

their welcome of the order. I particularly welcome the comments of the
noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, on the translation of churches into spaces
for the local community. I have experienced shock on one or two
occasions when going back to churches in which I had worshipped, or in
whose choirs I had sung as a boy, to discover that all the pews had
been removed, including one very old-fashioned church which we went to
when my father was the local bank manager. The bank manager’s
pew was the second one from the front on the right-hand side, and one
had to sit in the bank manager’s pew. Thankfully, that has now
all gone. The pews have all been removed and it is an open space for
all sorts of purposes. As we know, that has happened all over the
country. I think that that is part of the transformation of the Church

the question of churches in Wales, there is a separate Welsh Religious
Buildings Trust, which was founded in 1996 to care for redundant
historic places of worship of all faiths in Wales. To avoid duplicating
the work of the Friends of Friendless Churches, those of the Church in
Wales are excluded from this. The trust currently cares for six
buildings and is in discussion 
<?notus-xml column=174?>with regard to a seventh, but I am very conscious, as I know the noble
Lord will be, that there are a great many churches and chapels in Wales
which are open to the desirability of assistance. There are other

well because I have good friends in Yorkshire who are actively engaged

answered those questions, I welcome the general acceptance that this is
a desirable and useful adjustment of an early 19th century charity. We
have to modernise charities from time to time and it is entirely within
the principle of the public interest of charities that this amendment

churches, which are often at the historic centre of communities, are
being restored, opened and transformed to provide places where members
of the communities can get together. I commend the order.</hs_para>

Tyler:</Member></B> My Lords, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet seem
to have accepted the case for extending the franchise to 16 and 17
year-olds. They have not just promised to accept the change but have
acted to make it a reality. Before noble Lords express incredulity, let
me add an important caveat. They have indeed done so, but only, of
course, for our fellow citizens in Scotland, and only for the specific
2014 vote on whether Scotland should become independent. It is a matter
of record—I refer noble Lords to the statement made by the
Secretary of State for Scotland on 15 January—that the
Government have accepted that this could happen under the Edinburgh
agreement. The Secretary of State said that,</hs_para>

was in that context that on 24 January, MPs voted by 119 to 46 for a
Motion to rationalise the extension of the franchise in this respect
throughout the United Kingdom. The support was cross-party, just as it
is for my own Voting Age (Comprehensive Reduction) Bill, which has
received support from all parts of your Lordships’ House. In my
view, cross-party support is absolutely critical for an issue of this
sort. Some politicians advocate changes in the electorate, such as
those who advocate the extension to overseas  
<?notus-xml column=175?>voting, because they hope that it is going to be to their political
advantage. But in this case the sole advantage is to the electorate as
a whole and its reconnection with the political process as a whole. I
am therefore delighted that my noble friend Lord Lucas is hoping to be
able to participate in this debate shortly, along with the noble Lord,
Lord Adonis, and the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Hornsey. All three
intend to participate because they have given their support to my Bill.
However, I pay special tribute to my noble friend Lord Lucas because I
have shamelessly plagiarised his Bill of 10 years

inequitable, irrational and absurd to limit this reform of the
franchise to one part of the country for one occasion only. As things
stand, the same cohort of the Scottish population that will be added to
the register for the referendum will then be refused a vote in the
general election a few months later. That makes no sense. What if a
Westminster, Holyrood or local government by-election poll takes place
in Scotland on the same day as the referendum? Are 16 and 17 year-olds
to be issued with only one ballot paper for the referendum, but
excluded from choosing their representative? Would 16 and 17 year-olds
be refused a vote in any subsequent referendum, such as on our
continuing membership of the European

that the Scottish change was agreed only reluctantly because the First

requirements because he anticipated that they would be refused. Some
cynics take pleasure in noting that not only did the Westminster

Speaker’s

franchise must be just as clear. Students of this age cohort are far
better informed about the major issues of our day than I was at that
age. Fifty years ago, most people inherited their opinions and
political allegiances from their parents. This was all too apparent

true that 18 year-olds at present are, on average, unlikely to have the
opportunity to vote in a general election until they are well over 20.
Even if the franchise is extend, 16 and 17 year-olds may not have that
opportunity until they are 18 or more. However, getting on the
electoral register with full entitlement to vote would be a natural end
product of the citizenship course in schools. It would become part of
the normal process towards complete legal maturity, and addressing it
in school would deal with some of the fears about under-registration
that have been expressed in this
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000008">When
the Government bring forward regulations for individual electoral
registration, they could easily stipulate that all 14 and 15 year-olds
in school should be registered in year 10 at school, in readiness for
entitlement to vote, once they turn 16. The Government would, in turn,
have to bring forward the time at which national insurance numbers are
issued, or establish an alternative identifier for this group. That is
not that difficult.</hs_para>

significant change would also help young people to appreciate that
national elections are not the only occasions for democratic influence
on the conditions in which they live. As my honourable friend Stephen
Williams observed when he introduced a successful Motion in the other
place on 24 January, this age group has shown a dramatically increased
awareness of political issues and institutions in recent years. The
audit undertaken by the Hansard Society has shown an increase from 17%
to 31%, in a relatively short number of years, in that age
group’s general knowledge of the working of Parliament, bringing
them into line with the older electorate. It should be a logical
further step in the success of citizenship education to bring them into
the
franchise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000010">I
know that some Conservatives resist the idea that a 16 or 17 year-old
is mature enough to cast a vote in a local or national election.
However, as I noted in the January debate, the Minister responsible,
Chloe Smith, was not able to deny that a 15 year-old can be a voting
member of the of the Conservative Party, and therefore vote for the
election of its leader. What I am asking the Minister to do this

discussed before, as he mentioned, although I am not sure that there
has been that much said recently, here or in the other place, that has
added much to our knowledge on the subject. On my noble friend’s

on the issue appears to stem from a false premise. Voting is a
consequence of political interest, not a cause of it. Lowering the
voting age is not likely to have a positive impact on turnout any more
than it did when it was lowered to 18 in 1969. It did not promote
participation in democracy, but rather served to demonstrate what we
already knew: young people are among the groups least likely to vote.
That is borne out by the data for recent general elections.
One does not change that by further lowering the voting
age.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000017">Focusing

pointed out that more young people will vote for participants in
television programmes such as “X Factor” and
“Britain’s Got Talent” than vote for parties in a
general election. However, that observation rather misses the key
point, which is that nowadays political activity has to contend with a
plethora of competing interests in a way that it did not have to
40 or 50 years ago. Political parties used to hold a more
prominent role in social activity than they do today. Young people are
now able to indulge their passions, which can be instant and transient,
through social media. Political parties are not able to respond
effectively. They cannot offer instant gratification. Neither, I fear,
can elections. We need to be addressing this mismatch. There is no easy
answer, which is all the more reason for addressing the problem. What

to the voting age, what are the arguments for change? Those who favour
lowering the voting age advance the argument that at 16 you can join

You can apply to join the Army, which is not the same thing at all.
Having applied, you have to be selected. What this recognises is that
only certain people in this category have the requisite ability. Even
if you are selected, you are not sent to the front line. You can marry

it to being at 16. Most nations opt for 18. A number do not, and just

position taken on this issue seems to be as much the result of some gut
instinct as anything else. For every argument advanced by one side
there is an equally compelling argument on the
other.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000024">If the
argument for lowering the voting age is that young people should be
considered adults at 16 rather than 18, there are counterarguments that
young people mature at different rates. Whereas some are clearly adults
at 16, others are clearly not, and there is no sensible way of
evaluating this. If the argument is that the law should be consistent
in a way that it is not currently and that there should be one age at
which young people are deemed to have become adults, with all the
rights and responsibilities that follow, there is no particular reason
why it should not be equalised at 16 rather than at 17, when young
people are deemed mature enough to take possession of the lethal weapon
that is a motor car—or at 18, which will soon be the age up to
which young people will be deemed unarguably in need of full-time
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000025">If
the argument is that possession of the vote will engage young people
more in civil society and democracy, there is no evidence—as the
noble Lord, Lord Norton, pointed out—that it has had that effect
on those aged 18 and over. If the argument is the principled
one of no taxation without representation, it will soon be the case,
when the school leaving age becomes 18, that the already very small
number of 16 and 17 year-olds who pay tax will dwindle even
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000026">In
the face of the directly conflicting arguments that have clearly
bedevilled the resolution of this issue for many years, it might be
tempting to fall back on the essentially conservative argument that the

constitutional change is discussed—we have heard it already, and
I am sure we will hear it again from the distinguished speakers who

politicians, the increasing disengagement from formal political,
democratic processes, and how disadvantaged groups and younger people
are increasingly unlikely to vote at elections. One way of helping to
tackle these problems is to develop ways in which the public can be
more directly involved in the formulation of public policy. New methods
of engaging the public in this way through deliberative democracy are
potentially important both in engaging the public in politics between
elections and in improving public
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000028">Such<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:14:28"></hs_TimeCode>
methods would bring together perhaps 500 to 1,000 people to deliberate
on policy, exposing them to a range of opinions and policy options and
allowing them to debate them over a period of time, typically a day or
two, before coming to conclusions. Such exercises 
<?notus-xml column=180?>would enable the public to bring relevant knowledge, experience and

politicians cannot come to any sort of settled agreement on an issue

take place as far as possible on the basis of broad agreement across
Parliament. That is not always possible, but it should always be at
least the starting point. When the change so directly affects our
constitutional arrangements and, therefore, everyone in the country,
such deliberative democratic arrangements could play an important role
in crystallising the issues and helping Parliament to come to a
conclusion, thereby providing an important part of that proper
consideration that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, has so rightly called
for. Those involved in such an exercise would be selected randomly but
filtered to ensure that they are demographically broadly
representative. In this case, they might legitimately include a
significant weighting of 16 and 17 year-olds. Whatever decision this
group arrived at, in keeping with our precious system of representative
democracy, it would still be for Parliament to reach the final

that only 44% of 18 to 29 year-olds voted in the previous general
election, yet many draw the conclusion that to lower the voting age
would pile apathy on apathy. I draw the opposite lesson. Too few young

cannot carry on, as with sex education a generation ago, expecting them

curriculum. It is 
<?notus-xml column=181?>why I strongly support school councils, in primary schools as well as

possible steps, many of which I support. However, I do not understand
the argument made by the noble Lord, Lord Norton, against votes at 16
that because it is only one among several steps needed, and not a

see these things in isolation. Education and democracy need to go
together literally. Most 16 to 18 year-olds are in school or college,
and that is where the polling stations should be as well. Every school
with a sixth form and every further education and sixth-form college
should have a polling station, and young people should be registered to
vote there—instead of there being the perversity that some
schools are actually closed on polling day so that the adults can vote
undisturbed. If we did this, voting would become a semi-obligatory rite
of passage, like taking GCSEs and A-levels; citizenship education in
schools would have a stronger and more urgent focus; candidates and
parties, in local as well as national elections, would regard school
and college students as a key constituency; and mock elections would
lead to real elections within the education system itself, in the same
way that mock exams lead to real exams, and work experience leads, it
is hoped, to real work. All this can and should be

none of those observations applies to people of my own and other age

visiting Parliament, young people know and feel very strongly about key
global issues relating to the environment and poverty, through
connections with schools overseas, the internet, and so on. As the

course, that is not actually true because there is so little
consistency about when we deem a young person to be an adult. In any
case, those kinds of distinctions are very much socially constructed

21, and I am sure that at that time it seemed equally obvious that that
was the magical age at which maturity suddenly dawned. But I would
argue that even in the seven years since the inquiry headed by the

participation, we have seen sufficient changes in society to warrant a

young people have expected to go on to further and higher education and
as a consequence have had to develop skills of intellectual analysis,

question for nearly 40 years as a political philosopher.
Although it is a subject on which it is difficult to take a definite
position, because one can see arguments on both sides, I am
increasingly convinced that the case for a reduction in age from 18 to
16 is very weak and the case against it is fairly
strong<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:26:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to rest on three arguments, which I will call the arguments of
consistency, fairness and democracy. The first argument runs something
like this: reducing the age to 16 will bring it in line with other
areas of life; for example, children can leave school at 16, get
married at 16, can and have to pay tax at 16, join the Armed Forces at
16 and consent to sexual relations at 16. If that is the common age,
why can it not be true of voting as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:26:48"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

right-based, argument is that 16 year-olds these days have the maturity
to form political judgment and it is only right that they should be
able to vote in the same way as 18, 19 or 20 year-olds. The third
argument is that it will increase their interest in politics and
strengthen the foundations of participatory
democracy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:27:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

not persuaded by any of these three arguments. The first, that it will
bring it in line with other areas of life, is a half-truth. There are
several areas of life in which 16 year-olds today cannot do things; for
example, they cannot buy alcohol, they cannot serve on a jury and they
cannot place a bet. If they can join the Armed Forces at 16, it is only
with the consent of their parents, not on their own. Therefore, to say
that it will bring them in line is not
true<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:27:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

bear in mind that, although they pay taxes—the argument being
that there should be no taxation without representation—if a
five year-old or seven year-old goes to a shop to buy a bar of
chocolate, he ends up paying VAT or whatever
indirect  
<?notus-xml column=184?>taxes he is subjected to. It would be wrong to say that a nine year-old
should be able to vote simply because he pays tax; the argument would

that one can acquire the capacity for political judgment on what is the
right thing to do at 16, there is no evidence for this. What kind of
research is this alluding to? I have not seen any here, in the United
States, or in any of our European partners. People having access to
more information on the internet simply means that they have more
information—but information is not knowledge, let alone
judgment. In politics, as a voter one is concerned with a practical
activity that entails a practical judgment about the range of
possibilities that are open to one, and how one should exercise
one’s vote. Practical judgment does not come simply by looking
at Google and the internet. I would say the same of citizenship
classes. One can marshal all kinds of information about various
political ideologies; all the things that we have taught in
universities for years. Does the kind of information that one can
communicate to students in itself give someone the competence to make a
political judgment on the issue of whether they should be voting Labour
or Liberal Democrat, or whether or not they should be supporting the
war in
Iraq?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000052">On the
third argument, that this will increase their interest in politics:
fair enough. However, as my good friend the noble Lord, Lord Norton,
said, that seems to me to be putting the cart before the horse. You
cannot dangle a vote in front of somebody, saying, “We will give
you the vote now in the hope that you will take an interest in
politics”. One would hope that a vote is a reward, not an
incentive. We are reducing a supremely sacred political
activity—the vote, the exercise of highest sovereignty a
community has—to dangling a kind of carrot and asking,
“Look, if we give it to you, will you vote?”. It is
striking that 18 year-olds have had votes for a long time. In the
previous general election, only 39.6% of them voted, compared to the
rest of the population at somewhere in the region of 70%.</hs_para>

suggest that the arguments for are not persuasive; at least I have not
found them persuasive so far, but other arguments could be produced, in
which case I would like to hear them. The arguments against 16
year-olds being allowed to vote seem fairly strong. First, as I say,
voting is an exercise of power. It is a participation in sovereignty.
If you are going to exercise power, you must have a capacity for
judgment of a practical kind. Unless you have had some experience of
life, some independent existence and have broken out of the sheltered
environment of the family and seen the world on your own and made
choices, how will you be able to know what kind of judgment you should
make<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:31:08"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000054">My
other simple fear is that, given low turnout among young people and the
fact that low turnout can be habit-forming, if a 16 year-old gets into
the habit of not voting, he or she might continue that habit until the
end of their lives. There is a danger that if we give 16 year-olds the

Earl of Mar and Kellie:</Member></B> My Lords, with some trepidation I
shall speak in the gap. If I had been the First Minister negotiating
the Edinburgh agreement, I would definitely have traded a second
question for votes for 16 and 17 year-olds—not that I disapprove
of them, but the second question will be much more useful for the whole
of the United
Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:32:11"></hs_TimeCode>. I was
going to say that people under 16 pay VAT, but the noble Lord, Lord
Parekh, has already done that for me. In visits to schools under the
Peers in Schools programme, I always ask pupils, “Do you think
you’re a taxpayer?”. They always say no and I trump them
by asking, “Well, you all pay VAT, don’t you?”.
That is a trivial
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:32:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000056">I
wish to comment on three Scottish matters. Sixteen and 17 year-olds
already vote in health board elections in Scotland. They can also
vote—not that there are very many of them—in the Crofting
Commission elections. As regards marriage, a lot of truth has been
spoken in the past about people hightailing it up to Gretna Green
because the Marriage (Scotland) Act allows them to marry at 16 without
parental consent, whereas in England and Wales you certainly have to be
over 18 to marry without parental
consent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:33:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000057">My
final point is merely anecdotal. I visited various schools in the
autumn and spoke with pupils in the fourth, fifth and sixth years. I
asked them how old they would be in the autumn of 2014, making them
think it out. They discovered, perhaps for the first time, that they
will have the chance to take part in the referendum. When you say,
“How do you think you will vote?”, unfortunately, a
massive number, because they have not thought about the fact that they
will be able to vote, are nowhere near thinking about what their vote
might be. However, I certainly support the idea that we should consider
lowering the voting
age.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:34:26"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords, I add my congratulations
to the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, on securing this debate. It is an issue
that we are happy to support. It is true that in our most recent
manifesto our support was limited to granting a free vote on the issue,
but I am glad to report that we have now moved on. In part this was
because we found that the roof did not fall in when our Scottish
friends gave the referendum vote to those aged 16 and over—and,
as we have heard, to crofters. I hope in part that the amendment I
moved to the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill, to
allow 16 and 17 year-olds to vote in the AV referendum, pushed the
issue up the agenda. I suspect in part it was also because we have a
younger leader than we had at the time of our last manifesto. However,
I think that it was mostly because it is the right thing to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:35:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Society has long argued for this. Unsurprisingly, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Young, said, the UK Youth Parliament supports votes at
16, as did the 2006 Power inquiry. As was said, we allow people at 16
to do other things that are consistent with being an adult such as
consenting to medical treatment and entering work or a civil
partnership—and indeed, joining the Army and paying taxes, so we
do have 
<?notus-xml column=186?>taxation without representation. Perhaps more importantly, these people
cannot vote for the Government that decides which wars to fight. More
than 4,500 16 and 17 year-olds were serving in the Armed
Forces in April 2007. Of the first 100 soldiers killed in Iraq, six
were too young to vote. Do we not owe to their memory the right to vote
at 16<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:36:23"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

takes time to understand that younger people are more capable of doing
things than we thought. In 1918 we gave women the vote—but only
from the age of 30. It took until 1969 to bring that figure down to the
current age of 18. Even in the 1960s when we discussed the issue,
two-thirds of people thought that the voting age should be 21 and not
18. Exactly the same arguments were used in 1968 against lowering the
age from 21. Today, of course, the reduction to 18 is completely
accepted—but that was 40 years
ago.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000061">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:37:18"></hs_TimeCode>
Power inquiry received evidence that 16 to 18
year-olds—and, perhaps more interestingly, their
teachers—were in favour of the change to 16. Those aged between
16 and 24 are increasingly political. In 2011, 63% had some interest in
politics. That figure was up from 56% in 2002. It may be low, but the
trend is in the right direction. Only 12% said that they had no
interest. Therefore, while I absolutely agree with the noble Lord, Lord
Norton, that this is not a way to promote political engagement, that is
not the reason for it. The reason is a democratic one. People of 16
have this right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:37:58"></hs_TimeCode>.
If we are not careful, politics will lag behind other areas. The
Companies Act 2006 allowed 16 year-olds to become company directors,
often with bigger decisions to make than voting. Anyone can join the
Labour Party at 16 and vote for our
leader<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:38:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000062">Turning
to the Government, I congratulate the Liberal Democrats on having this
proposal in their manifesto. When we discussed my amendment to the
Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill that would have
allowed 16 year-olds to vote on AV, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said
only that the Bill was not the right place to do it; now we have the
right

the senior partners in the coalition, unfortunately Chloe Smith in the
other place said that there had to be compelling evidence before any
amendment to the electoral franchise would be made. I do not know
whether she wants demonstrations in the street or, as we near the
centenary in June of Emily Davison’s death, some act of
martyrdom. The Government have to give a better reason for saying no
than simply that there is no evidence in favour of it. I hope that we
will hear from the Minister a more reasoned argument than the one given
by Ms
Smith<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T17:39:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000064">We
have seen youth unemployment rise yet again—up by 11,000 in the

the vote, the Government would take the issue of youth unemployment
much more seriously. Perhaps that is the best of all reasons for giving
young people the

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord,
Lord Tyler, for bringing this debate to the Lords. He started his
speech by referring to a debate in 
<?notus-xml column=187?>the Commons on 24 January, which I read with some interest, and I have
to say that I found the most novel argument to be one that in a sense
complements the argument just made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter,
which is that of the increasing imbalance in the electorate between the
over-65s and young people. That imbalance will grow, and all political
parties know that we are pulled in the direction of those who vote and
thus are pulled towards putting resources into the over-65s and not
into young people. The argument was made in one of the Commons speeches
that this might be one way of beginning to redress the balance and to
encourage political parties and Governments to think more actively
about the needs and interests of young people. It is an argument that I
think we all need to take into account.</hs_para>

Government have no plans to lower the voting age in this Parliament and
that, as has already been mentioned, there is no consensus within the
coalition Government. That in turn reflects the different views held
across society at large and the divergent positions on this topic both
within and across the various political parties. After all, we have
discovered over the course of the past two and a half years just how
difficult political and constitutional change is and how on any
proposals for political and constitutional change there are always at
least 15 different and contradictory arguments for why nothing should
be done, while fewer arguments are made in support of the case for
change. Nevertheless, we welcome the ongoing discussions and debate on
this issue and we would encourage the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and
others to maintain their approach.</hs_para>

age of majority, which was raised by a number of noble Lords, I simply
repeat the comment made by the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, that there is
no standard age of majority within the United Kingdom. The process of
moving from childhood to majority takes place over several years, and
the question of where that should be standardised would itself open up
a very difficult process. However, the question of how to re-engage
young people in our democracy, in citizenship and in local society is
important and we all need to address it. When taking the Electoral
Registration and Administration Bill through the House of Lords, I was
struck by how severe a problem this is becoming. Younger people do not
feel engaged in politics and they are not committed to political
parties. In one way or another, we all have to address that problem.
The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said that providing the vote at the age of
16 is not the answer, but it may be one of the ways of contributing to
an answer. It would certainly mean that schools and parties would pay
much more attention to citizenship education, which is important, and
we would have to think about how else we could hook young people into
their local communities and into wider engagement as a whole.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Norton, pointed out, that young people are already
the least likely to vote. That is the problem, of course, and the
question is how to tackle it. We know that a number of things have
contributed to it: the increasing remoteness of national politics; the
decline in local government 
<?notus-xml column=188?>and local politics; the decline in respect for our political
institutions—above all for Westminster—and the decline of
participation at all levels in intermediate bodies from churches and
chapels to trade unions and social organisations. The question is:
where do we go from here and how can we ensure that engagement in
democracy at all levels from the local to the national does not
continue to decline in the long term? We cannot let this question
go.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000069">Perhaps,
as the noble Lord, Lord Wills, suggests, deliberative democracy on the
Granada 500 model—I think that was what it was called—is
something that we should be experimenting with again in terms of
bridging the gap between the governors and the governed. However, I
suspect that television companies would be less willing to invest in
such activities today as they were 20 or 25 years ago, partly because
they would be less convinced that it would command the sort of audience
that those very interesting experiments did in the
1980s.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000070">We have
a real problem here; we do not yet have a consensus on how we should
move forward, as the debate has again shown. The research that there
has been in a number of different activities is itself inconclusive.
The Government do not disagree with the conclusions of the youth
commission report that the approach of using independent commissions to
review this should not be used again in the near future. However, we
all need to focus. All of us who are committed to democratic politics
and want to see a high level of political engagement have a huge and
rising problem. All the research that went into looking at the shift to
individual electoral registration persuaded me that this is a large and
secular issue to which we do not have much of an answer. In a week in
which the combination of the Eastleigh by-election and the Leveson
report has encouraged the press to throw almost everything it has got
at politicians of one sort or another—and people cheerfully say
“Well don’t worry, they will move on to another set next
week”—we recognise how deep a problem of democratic
disillusionment and disengagement we
have.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000071"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Tyler" PimsId="4859" UID="13022793000233" xid="1879" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000233">Lord
Tyler:</Member></B> I am very grateful to my noble friend the Minister
for giving way. Since we have a few minutes in hand, will he
specifically address the fact that both the Electoral Commission and
the Youth Citizenship Commission have said that there is a real gap in
the research in this area, which has been reflected throughout your
Lordships’ discussion this afternoon? Will the Government at
least give an undertaking today that they will look again at that
lacuna, which has been so clearly identified, and invite the Electoral
Commission to look specifically at this
again?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000072"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13022793000234" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000234">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> I hesitate to make a commitment as
broad as that, but I will certainly feed it back and we will look at
the question of whether there is a substantial lacuna. One of the
issues that we all face here is that we know what the situation is now,
and we know that the evidence of demand from young people for votes at
16 is weak. The question that I take particularly from the speech of
the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, is whether we are happy about that, and 
<?notus-xml column=189?>whether we ought to be getting out there to persuade young people that
they should be interested in having the vote and they should want to be
re-engaged in politics. That is a much larger set of
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000073">The
previous Government, to their great credit, did their best to get at
the question of citizenship. A number of distinguished political
scientists contributed to that with modest success. We all recognise
that schools have all sorts of other priorities, and that PSHE has not
been one of the grandest or most glorious aspects of the secondary
curriculum. There is a large issue out there, and we need much more
public debate on it. This is part of a much larger issue about popular
disillusionment with democratic politics as such, which has to concern
us all. None of us would wish to suggest that lowering the voting age
would begin to solve that; it would be only a small part of a strategy
which I suggest all of us interested in democratic politics, from
whichever point of view, should recognise is a shared problem to which
we all need to find some shared
answers.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_27_PT_1/E69115E18CBA9D489716EDADE304BA68283716BF" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 February 2013">Wednesday,

specifically on the aerial attacks which figure in that letter and
which have so far not been dealt with satisfactorily by the UN Security
Council. The Security Council last passed a resolution on Sudan a
couple of weeks ago. It commended the efforts of UNAMID, the joint
AU/UN mediation, the African Union high-level implementation panel and
leaders in the region, and it reiterated its full support for all those
authorities. But why is the panel of experts, which is mentioned in 13
out of the 18 operative paragraphs of the resolution, omitted from that
list? Why has its report, which is crucial to any understanding of the
reasons these conflicts are continuing indefinitely, not been
published? Perhaps my noble friend can throw some light on that when
she replies. Surely the world is entitled to know which members of the
Security Council are objecting to publication, what in the
panel’s report they do not like, and their reasons for the
objections<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:15:01"></hs_TimeCode>. The

Security Council Resolution 1591 of March 2005, which was reaffirmed in
the latest resolution, the council demanded an immediate cessation of
offensive military flights over the Darfur region and asked the AU
ceasefire commission to share information on this matter with the panel
of experts. However, the panel was not charged with investigating the
aerial attacks in Darfur, nor has it specifically been asked now to
report on the bombing of South Kordofan and Blue Nile. The current
resolution demands in the preamble, but not in the operative paragraphs
that are governed by chapter 7, that aerial bombardments should cease.

attacked Derib al Reih village in South Darfur last Thursday. The
Antonovs are also busy in Blue Nile. Already, more than 200,000
refugees have fled to South Sudan, and the people who remain are
demoralised into inactivity, leading to food shortage and malnutrition.

90 days to include details of every attack by the Sudanese Air Force or
ground forces on civilians in Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile. If

Dr Eric Reeves of Smith College in Massachusetts is that Khartoum
should be warned that every time the bombers kill civilians a drone

protect, which states that when a state fails to protect its citizens
from mass atrocities and, even more so, when the state is committing
crimes against humanity against its own citizens, the international
community should intervene with force after peaceful measures,
including sanctions, have been tried and failed. That norm assumes that
the Security Council would invoke the R2P under chapter 7, as in the
case of Libya.</hs_para>

the use of drones across international frontiers, without the sanction

something must snap. That may be inside the ruling junta. We have to
take into account that the Sudanese temperament may not be suited to
any version of the Arab spring. In my experience, the Sudanese are not
like north Africans. They are an exceptionally tolerant people who have
accepted a low level of freedom and have put up with an unnecessarily
autocratic, bullying and often incompetent regime. It is a vast country
run by about five people.</hs_para>

is hardly possible to conceive of a unified state in Sudan. Instead of
devolution there has been continuous warring between Khartoum and the
regions. The centre’s authority depends entirely on intermittent
military aggression. As we have heard, South Kordofan in particular has
been the victim of constant aerial bombardment, with the Nuba people
suffering untold human rights abuse and near starvation away from the
eyes of the
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000105" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000105">In
Darfur, the Government have carried on with the bombing of villages and
Khartoum has made it a virtual no-go area for NGOs and humanitarian
agencies. 
<?notus-xml column=196?>Another ceasefire was signed in Doha between the Government of Sudan and
the JEM on February l0, and Qatar has announced a donors’
conference in April. But, as always, such deals are as elusive as the
various parties to them and no one believes that peace is around the
corner. The 10-year anniversary, though, must provide a new impetus to
the long-standing campaign to persuade the Sudan Government to
co-operate with repeated UN and AU resolutions, as we have heard from

urgent priority must be the border settlement, with Abyei still a
flashpoint while its boundaries remain uncertain. Concordis
International has been doing valuable preparatory work, as some of us
heard this week, alongside the AU High Level Implementation Panel and
other interested parties. Importantly, this takes account of the
regular seasonal migration across the borders. This work on the
disputed sections is absolutely essential. Reuters has repeated reports
from South Sudan of an incursion earlier this month into Upper Nile by
unknown militia and a troop build-up, again, around the Heglig oil
field close to Unity State, which recalls the brief SPLA occupation of
the oil field last April, which brought the two countries to the brink
of war. The implementation of the various elements of the CPA has been
lamentably neglected, not just by north and south but by the
international community, including ourselves. Seen from the West, Sudan
has remained just below the horizon of the Arab spring. To make up for
this deficit of awareness, there is no doubt in my mind that the UK
must maintain and not downgrade its special relationship with both
Sudan and South
Sudan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000107">Several

staff changes in the unit as a result of the recession and
administrative savings. I hope that the noble Baroness can reassure us
that no such cuts in the unit are forthcoming and that the FCO still
gives the highest possible priority to this work. It is really
important that simply because the CPA has been superseded, the UK, as a

may I ask the Minister, who I know has particular experience of and
interest in Sudan, where Sudan is on the US Government’s world
map—assuming they have moved on from the “axis of
evil”—although we have not heard anything to the
contrary. I notice that Sudan was left out of the Foreign
Secretary’s recent RUSI speech on terrorism, which covered whole
swathes of north Africa, including Mali. Perhaps she could reassure us
that while we need to remain alert on this issue, close intelligence
co-operation with an indicted Sudanese president is not a necessary
prerequisite to security in the UK or the

to the noble Baroness, Lady
Cox<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:26:42"></hs_TimeCode>, for once
again bringing the circumstances of this deeply troubled region to our
attention. Tragically, since our last debate on this subject in
October, the humanitarian 
<?notus-xml column=197?>situation has continued to be a matter of grave concern. I am afraid
that the political deliberations, which the UK Government properly
continues to support, appear to be little more than a smokescreen, as
the Sudanese Government clearly have absolutely no intention of
providing humanitarian access to South Kordofan and Blue Nile states
from the
north.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000110">In
particular, it seems that the vote to create the new state of Southern
Sudan has led the Government of Sudan to make southerners accept the
consequences of their vote: “You wanted your own country, now go
and live in it”. Southerners are being asked to go south. This
is, in one sense, entirely understandable—if not entirely
defensible—in terms of making people accept responsibility for
the choices they have made. However, the human consequences are
appalling. The overall drive seems to be to create a single country
with a single culture and a single religion. This process is enhanced
by the drive to have a single language, Arabic—hence the problem
with the marginalization of the Nuba and the continuing attrition in
the Nuba
mountains.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000111">We
in the church continue to hear from aid agencies and our fellow bishops
in both Sudanese states of continued bombing, targeting civilian homes,
markets, schools, fields and so on. Those stranded, unable or unwilling
to flee their homes to the safety of South Sudan, are left to forage
for food and water under cover from the bombs. It really is a desperate
situation and a tragedy that the international community still appears
to be taking little heed of what is looking increasingly like genocide,
or at the very least, yet another major ethnic cleansing working itself
out. Thousands of people have fled and the humanitarian cost is being
paid for by neighbouring states which are absorbing
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000112">Conditions
in the refugee camps remain poor but stable. There are increasing
reports of disease outbreaks, and overcrowding is becoming a greater
issue in most locations. During the dry season, basic service provision
of food, water and healthcare is present and available to the

facilities to be initiated by international NGOs in, for example, Yida
for fear that it will encourage refugees to
stay.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000113" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000113">In our
debate in October I raised the concern that, although DflD recognises
the role of the church, it is highly unfortunate that UNHCR and other
NGOs do not always adopt the same policy. The churches and other
religious bodies have a key role to play in both delivery and
mediation, but often the UNHCR treats them as special interest groups
without a general humanitarian agenda. In the present context of Sudan,
the churches are doing an heroic job with limited resources. The young
and fast-growing Episcopal Church of Sudan is resilient, but it is
suffering from the forced departure of southerners, many of whom have
exercised key leadership and responsibility in and through the church
and its aid
programmes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:30:18"></hs_TimeCode>. It
is further the case that foreigners with connections to the churches
are being told to leave. Others are being visited by the security
services and feel intimidated. Each of our dioceses in Sudan is facing
the need both to care 
<?notus-xml column=198?>for displaced and often traumatised people at the same time
as losing some of its leading people to the

commitment of Her Majesty’s Government to addressing these
concerns, and the priorities set by DfID for the coming year are to be
applauded. However, I have four specific questions and it would be
helpful if we could have some clear answers to them for the record. The
first question is: what pressure are Her Majesty’s Government
putting on the Government of Sudan to stop the bombing and the violence
in the Nuba mountains? Secondly, what humanitarian provision are Her
Majesty’s Government making for displaced people and refugees,
especially in a context where southerners in Sudan are being pushed out
to the south? Thirdly, although it is hard to work out the specific
strategy or consistency in this, are the UK Government aware of and
responding to the expulsion of expatriates from Sudan after
interrogation and with no reasons being given? Finally, what support
are the Government giving to those being victimised by the Sudanese
Government, including those whose schools and institutions have been
taken over and appropriated by the security services, thus helping to
make an already bad situation even worse?</hs_para>

Sudan during the civil war. More than 2 million people died during that
conflict. In areas like Torit which I visited, I saw at first hand the
terrible carnage that was being inflicted as the result of Antonov
bombers simply pounding away at communities day in and day out. As we
have heard, it is now 10 years since the violence erupted in Darfur.
Since my own visit to Darfur in 2004, and the report which I then
published, <I>If This Isn</I><I>’</I><I>t Genocide, What
Is?</I>, some 2 million people have been displaced. Between 200,000 and
300,000 people have been killed and 90% of the villages have been razed
to the ground. Ten years later, the systematic genocidal campaign of
ethnic cleansing is continuing; those responsible have not been brought
to justice; and the violence for which they are responsible has become
the order of the day in South Kordofan and Blue Nile. This represents
an appalling repetition of history, making these regions dangerous and
lawless places. The Khartoum regime must accept the lion’s share
of the responsibility for unleashing a torrent of violence on its own
people.</hs_para>

rampant, children are malnourished, and even at the height of the
violence, when Darfur 
<?notus-xml column=199?>was in the headlines, aid did not reach two-thirds of the population.
The international community claimed that its aid programme was a
success because the aim was to help those people who had fled to the
camps. But what of the families struggling to survive in the villages
in rural areas? More than half the population of Darfur has no water
source. Almost a quarter of the population, including children, walk
more than six miles to reach water in winter. In the summer
“hungry” months, many walk more than 20 miles. Walking
for water continues to be dangerous, with frequent reports of
attacks.</hs_para>

Triesman:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, pay tribute to the noble
Baroness, Lady Cox, for her unswerving determination, and to other
speakers, including the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Exeter and
the noble Lord, Lord Alton. Indeed, pretty much everybody has once
again gone through the events of the past 10 years: the mass
murders; the ethnic cleansing of black Africans and the attacks on
their culture and language, which is a distinctive part of ethnic
cleansing; the direct attacks, including aerial attacks, on civilians;
the use of Chinese and Iranian munitions; and the displacements of very
large numbers of people. The noble Lords, Lord Alton and Lord Avebury,
the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Exeter, the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, and, indeed, all of us may
feel—I do not mean this in any frivolous sense—a certain
“Groundhog Day” sensation about parts of this debate as
we have been going round these issues for a long
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:48:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000129" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000129">I
sifted out what I thought were the important notes made on visits to
Khartoum, Darfur and Juba. The notes related to the first visits that I
made in November 2005 and to Juba again later that month. With the
exception of one leader of South Sudan, I do not think that I ever saw
the same people twice. The turnover, and hence the difficulty in
dealing with anybody, was absolutely
monumental<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:49:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000130">If
I may say so, the issue is not just about Sudan: it is not that limited
geographically. President Bashir’s impact endangers the entire
region’s security right across a swathe of Africa. John Garang
tried to stabilise the south and his death was a tragedy. The
referendum seemed like a valid mechanism, but we all know that the
outcome was always likely to lead to a further breakdown, whatever our
aspirations for it, because of the contested oil rights and oil wealth
in that
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000131" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000131">One edge
of South Darfur was always impacted, in my experience. Blue Nile was
always a problem. The Ugandans had never managed to successfully deal
with their northern border. The Lord’s Resistance Army and Kony,
its leader, routinely went into Southern Sudan and many other places. I
always believed that President Museveni, for all the talk about what he
would do, made no real attempt to make sure that security was there
either. The people of north Uganda were driven from the land,
frequently by people who were moving backwards and forwards out of
Southern Sudan. The issues spread into the west of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, and into the Central African Republic; it
spreads across borders in as much as there are
borders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:50:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000132">Darfur,
as we have heard today, is experiencing the 10th anniversary of an
appalling war, which spreads across the borders, fairly routinely, into
Chad. There, the Janjaweed gangs have been assisted by the Khartoum
regime and have then gone on to wreak even greater havoc. The aerial
terror that the noble Earl, Lord 
<?notus-xml column=202?>Sandwich, illustrated so clearly is extremely important. I recall the
offer made by Colonel Gaddafi, who said that he could understand the
peoples of that region in a way in which he did not expect us to, and
was perfectly prepared to intervene. I said that I thought it sounded
like an offer to interfere and make things worse. Of course, there was
always the prospect of things spreading across the Maghreb, through the
northern
borders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:51:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000133">The
issues are in some cases realistic and need proper attention. It is not
always about issues of wickedness, although goodness knows there is
enough of that. However, the contestation between agriculturalists and
herders for areas that are in any sense arable, as desertification
becomes a problem of real economic consequence, is very important.
There are many more issues in Darfur: voting rights, security, food and
water have all been mentioned
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:52:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

attempts by the African Union force to secure a degree of peace, which
were fundamentally undermined by President al-Bashir. The Canadians had
provided armoured vehicles to protect the Nigerian peace force, who
were in soft-sided vehicles. While I was there, six Nigerian soldiers
were killed through soft-sided vehicles that were fired upon. Those
armoured vehicles took ages to get into Darfur because they were in
Dakkar and nobody would let them move forward. It took a special
meeting in which Javier Solana, then the High Representative of the EU,
took part to get them in. We got more or less no help from Russia, and
occasionally just a little hint that there might be a more sympathetic
response from some of the Chinese
leadership<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:53:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000135" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000135">These
factors are all important, and are a very diverse set of factors to
introduce at this stage of your Lordships’ debate. However,
there is one constant among all of them: President al-Bashir. The
issues for which he must stand trial, and for which there should be no
impunity, link all the things that pretty much every noble Lord said in
this evening’s
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000136" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000136">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:53:39"></hs_TimeCode>
join others in asking essentially the same questions of the Minister
tonight. The critical things are what we can do in these unpromising
circumstances; whether it is possible to get the United Nations,
through the operation of its committee of inquiry, or the Security
Council to do what needs to be done—the letter should be an
important stimulus to the Security Council in setting those things out;
and whether we believe that we can have a greater impact in those
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000137" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000137">Briefly,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T18:54:08"></hs_TimeCode> role of the
United Kingdom has sometimes been a little confusing. I do not know
whether I should make an apology for it, but it certainly was between
the FCO and DfID over a period of time. I found, quite often, that
because DfID was in control of so much more of the money than the FCO
ever was that DfID officials were the only people to whom anybody
wanted to talk. It often meant that more standard forms of diplomatic
and state intervention became more difficult. It may be that we need to
rethink those things. I do not say this in a way that is at all
aggressive. I just think that when we have indentified things that
really have not worked, it falls to us to 
<?notus-xml column=203?>think—as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, did when he made some
other important suggestions—about how we might
improve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000138" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000138">I
conclude by saying that it seems absolutely clear that we have failed
the people of this war-torn region. The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, made
this point very eloquently as well. What we have to do is identify how
we can help generate the conditions in which there is a Sudan that is
peaceful, democratic and prosperous, which respects human rights and
the rule of law, and whose people share equally in the nation’s
wealth and development, with all Sudanese people being treated equally,
regardless of their race or religion, and in which Sudan is an active
and benign member of the international community. The regional security
issues are far too severe for us to do anything
else.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_27_PT_1/BB669E90DC3F0BFAAC4D2E6EC2A52C3B5C4A53ED" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 February 2013">Wednesday,

the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, for bringing his experience of the
region to this debate and the tone with which he dealt with the debate.
Of course, this is the second time I have had the opportunity to
participate in a debate on Sudan and South Sudan, both of which remain
high foreign policy priorities for this Government, but other Ministers
before me have debated this topic on numerous occasions, in lengthier
debates and in Oral

focus this evening has been on the internal conflicts within Sudan but
I will also take the opportunity to update noble Lords on the broader
context of the relations between the two countries. When I spoke about
this subject in October last year, there was reason for cautious
optimism about relations between Sudan and South Sudan. We and our
international partners welcomed the signing of nine agreements on 27
September, and we made clear that we expected to see their full
implementation, as well as resolution of the remaining disputes between
the two countries. As the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, has said, there
have been many cliff-hangers on this journey, and this appears to be
another one. It is deeply frustrating that since the signing of those
agreements we have seen a lack of progress in their implementation,
despite further negotiations occurring on a number of occasions
thereafter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000142" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000142">At
the start of the year hopes were raised again that we might see
progress when the Presidents of Sudan and South Sudan met on 5 January
and were able to recommit to making rapid progress on implementation.
However, by the time the Presidents met again at the African Union
summit later that month, it appeared that the good faith that had
previously been shown had now gone, leaving no obvious way forward
beyond 
<?notus-xml column=204?>the vague promise of further discussions. Like other noble Lords, I find
that deeply frustrating and
disappointing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000143">It
is now crucial for both countries to take concrete and substantial
steps forward on implementation of those agreements, particularly on
security arrangements, demilitarisation of the border zones and
allowing the export of oil. The UK Government will continue to give
their full support to the African Union high-level implementation panel
as it seeks to find a lasting solution to these issues.</hs_para>

Lady Cox, said, our concern about relations between Sudan and South
Sudan should not lead us to overlook the serious conflict going on
within Sudan’s borders. Ten years after the outbreak of
significant violence, we remain deeply concerned by the continuing
conflict in Darfur and the resulting humanitarian situation. More than
300,000 people have died as a result of the conflict in the past decade
and approximately 2 million have been displaced, the majority of whom
are still reliant on humanitarian
aid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000145" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000145">Recent
clashes in the gold-mining area in North Darfur highlight that the
nature of the conflict may have changed but its effects remain as
concerning as ever. Since the start of this year, more than 100
villages have been destroyed and 100,000 people displaced. That is
already half the total number of people displaced in 2012. We hope to
use this anniversary period in the run-up to the donor conference to
make progress on the ground and ensure that Darfur remains on the
international agenda, including in the UN Security Council. The UK
remains committed to seeing the causes of the conflict addressed. We
will continue to support Darfur by responding to humanitarian needs,
fostering development opportunities and promoting a peaceful political
solution.</hs_para>

support the Doha document for peace in Darfur, which contains welcome
provisions to address the needs of ordinary Darfuris and
bring justice for the crimes committed. However, implementation of the
Doha document has been disappointingly slow and has not focused
sufficiently on areas that will make the most difference to the
security and basic needs of communities. We are pressing the Government
of Sudan to honour their commitments under the agreement, encouraging
rebel groups to end their violence and obstruction of the peace
process, and also working closely with Qatar, which continues to take
an international lead on this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:00:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000147" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000147">We
are deeply concerned by the continuing conflict in South Kordofan and
Blue Nile and the impact that it is having on the communities in those
areas. Some of the consequences of the conflict have been graphically
described this evening. The refusal to allow independent humanitarian
access to civilians in all of these areas, particularly the rebel-held
areas, is of deep concern. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of
Humanitarian Affairs has told the Security Council that it believes
that more than 1 million people have been displaced or severely
affected by the conflict. We are working to ensure that the issue
remains at the top of the international agenda, in particular within
the African Union and the UN Security Council. The situation deserves
the 
<?notus-xml column=205?>full and credible independent investigation that the Foreign Secretary
called for at the start of the conflict, and for those responsible for
abuses or international crimes to be held to account. This remains our

is crucial that the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s
Liberation Movement-North comply with obligations to ensure
humanitarian access and agree a full cessation of hostilities. The
African Union has invited the parties to direct talks on 5 March. We
are encouraging both sides to attend and to engage in serious talks
without preconditions, focusing first on achieving a cessation of
hostilities and full humanitarian access. Until that time, the UK teams
in Juba and Khartoum will continue to work closely with the Office for
the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, other donors and NGOs to
ensure that assistance reaches all those in need who are accessible,
and that we are ready to move rapidly to respond to a broader opening
up of
access<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:02:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000149" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000149">I
will respond to the specific issues that were raised. The noble
Baroness, Lady Cox, asked about the provision of life-saving food and
medical aid to civilians in South Kordofan and Blue Nile. All donors
share the view that negotiated access from within Sudan is the best way
of providing humanitarian assistance. Donors co-ordinate closely, and
many of them are looking carefully at all options for getting aid to
those in need. We currently judge that the risks of cross-border
assistance mean that the UK should not pursue this approach at this
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:02:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000150" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000150">The
noble Baroness also asked what representations the UK had made on
halting aerial bombardments in Darfur. The recent Panel of Experts
report highlighted the Government of Sudan’s use of military
aircraft in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1591. We
condemn such actions and most recently expressed our concerns through
the UN Security Council discussion adopting Resolution 2091, which
extended the panel’s mandate for a further
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:03:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000151" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000151">My
noble friend Lord Avebury asked why the Panel of Experts report had not
been published. I am pleased to inform him that a decision has been
taken to publish the latest report on Darfur from the Panel of Experts.
It has not yet appeared on the United Nations website, but my officials
will pass on a copy to the noble Lord as soon as it becomes available.
He also raised the question of whether the Government should consider
the use of drones against Sudanese aircraft in Darfur. We argue
consistently for the strict enforcement of UN sanctions in Darfur. It
has not been possible to agree measures to toughen the sanctions regime
in the United Nations Security Council, and any actions that we take
must be consistent with existing UN Security Council
resolutions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-27T19:04:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000152" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000152">The
noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, asked for reassurance that FCO resources for
Sudan would not be reduced. I can assure him that Sudan remains a high
priority for the FCO. There are many competing priorities, including in
Africa, but no decision has been taken to reduce FCO resources devoted
to Sudan and South Sudan. The opening of an embassy in Juba has meant
an increase in overall staff resources over the past two
years.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Alton, raised the question of the views of the
Independent Commission for Aid Impact and its criticism of the project
in Darfur. We believe that this report is outdated. The UK has already
transformed our humanitarian response in Sudan to help address the root
causes of conflict rather than simply relying on emergency aid. It is
disappointing not to see this reflected in the ICAI’s report.
Our new programme will help the poorest people become better able to
cope with the impact of conflict or man-made disasters, such as being
able to access local markets and regular food
supplies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000154" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000154">The
noble Lord also asked about the potential denial of diplomatic status
for senior members of the NCP. As we have set out before, at this stage
the UK will maintain a diplomatic relationship with Sudan. We use our
diplomatic relations with Sudan to press for the Government to resolve
conflicts, address humanitarian and development needs and end human
rights abuses. Having a senior ambassador in Khartoum ensures that we
have influence and access to the right levels of government, as well as
to a full range of political opposition and civil society groups. It is
not ideal, but we feel that downgrading our relations would reduce our
ability to achieve our objectives—indeed, any
objectives—in
Sudan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022793000155" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130227-gc0001.htm#13022793000155">The
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Exeter asked some quite specific
questions: what support are we providing to those being victimised by
the Government of Sudan? Our embassy in Sudan monitors the situation
closely and makes regular representations to the Sudanese authorities.
The specific question was raised about the humanitarian situation in
South Sudan. Of course we remain extremely concerned about the refugee
situation in both Unity and Upper Nile states caused by the influx of
almost 180,000 refugees from South Kordofan and Blue Nile, as well as
the wider humanitarian situation in South Sudan. My honourable friend
Lynne Featherstone saw the refugee conditions for herself when she

noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked for a response to the letter to the UN
Security Council; we look forward to receiving that letter and I can
assure him that it will be considered seriously and responded to.
I am acutely aware of the time. I think the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Exeter asked about the expulsion of expatriates
from Sudan. We are aware of a number of expatriates who have been
expelled, in particular those with connections to religious
organisations. We have raised these concerns with the Sudan ministry

conclusion, we have come tantalisingly close to a settlement of the

good faith from both countries to properly and peacefully settle their

policy debate on the review of REACH, the EU’s regulation on
chemicals and their safe use. I and many member states intervened to
stress the importance of adapting the system for SMEs, and the
importance of reducing fees and cost-sharing. I also highlighted a
number of examples where REACH had negatively
impacted UK business. In addition to 
<?notus-xml column=102?>the review of REACH, the council also discussed an
accompanying paper on nanotechnologies. There was general support for
the Commission’s approach to handle nanotechnologies within the
REACH framework, although some countries suggested there might be a

the action plan, with many stressing in particular the importance of
access to finance and encouraging a more entrepreneurial spirit within

those relating to access to finance and digital services, but

lunch discussion focused on state aid modernisation. The discussion
focused on the question of regional aid and on the Commission’s
proposal for a ban on aid to large enterprises in certain disadvantaged
areas (“c” areas) in particular. Most member states,
including myself, argued that a ban was unnecessary and would damage
member states’ ability to promote growth. The Commission
(Almunia) responded that he would no longer pursue a ban but that new
compatibility conditions would have to be rigorously enforced if this
aid was to be allowed to continue. I also expressed concern that the

much-needed government

the UK seat. There was a full table-round on the subject with most
member states (including the UK) focusing on the need for improved
governance of the single market, the full implementation of the
services directive and improved access to finance. The UK highlighted
the creation of a single market centre in the UK to tackle problems
here and also suggested that the Commission define a proportionality

2012 the Government undertook a review of the implementation of the
habitats and wild birds directives. Part of this work looked at whether
the effectiveness of mitigation measures for species licences is
appropriate or takes an excessively or insufficiently precautionary
approach. The review identified that there was scope to improve our
implementation of the habitats directive, and we are currently
developing a range of measures to address this so that local approaches
to protecting European species do not unnecessarily block development
