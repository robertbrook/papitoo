that we have done is launch the world’s first social investment

The Government are doing a great deal to encourage giving in this
country. The Treasury has introduced new tax incentives for giving, and
is working hard to make gift aid work better for the charity sector.
The small donation scheme is looking at how gift aid can work with
digital giving, and we are looking at how we can make payroll giving
work much more effectively. Across a range of areas, the Treasury and

that this is not a tax; it is a benefit. I would make two points in
respect of the specific case that the right hon. Gentleman raises.
First, all the time Labour was in government, if somebody was in a
private sector rented home and were in receipt of housing benefit, they
did not get any benefit for empty rooms. That is important. So it is
only fair that we treat people in social housing the same way. The
second point is that if anyone is away from home, obviously their
earnings are not counted, so the benefits of that person are likely to
go

to Alison why her paying £25 a week more from April is not a tax

protect the most vulnerable. According to the Government’s own

detailed points to him. First of all, there is a £50 million
fund to deal with difficult cases. But let me also make the basic 
<?notus-xml column=270?>argument of fairness that he seems to miss. If someone is in private
rented housing and receives no housing benefit, they do not get money
for an extra room, and if someone is in private housing and do get
housing benefit, they do not get money for an extra room, so there is a
basic argument of fairness. Why should we be doing more for people in
social housing on housing benefit than for people in private housing on
housing benefit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T12:05:19"></hs_TimeCode>?
There is one additional point that, frankly, he has got to engage in.
The housing benefit bill is now £23 billion a year.

Of course councils face difficult spending decisions, but in many cases
the level of spending and grant they are still getting is equivalent to
what they received under the last Government. Obviously, the economy
has declined since then and we have to cut our cloth accordingly.
Councils should be held accountable for the decisions that they make,

budget we have prioritised per pupil funding, so there has not been a
reduction in per pupil funding. It is very important that schools can
see forward to future years to the sorts of budgets that they will
have, given the roll of children coming to their school. The second
thing we have done, through the academy programme, is to encourage the
devolution of more of the schools budget to schools directly, and

happened at Mid Staffordshire NHS foundation Trust between 2005 and

suffered from the most appalling neglect and mistreatment. There were
patients so desperate for water that they were drinking from dirty
flower vases. Many were given the wrong medication, treated roughly or

and management failures at the trust. Even after those reports,

appalling events allowed to happen and to continue for so long? Why
were so many bereaved families and whistleblowers who spoke out ignored
for so long? Could something like this ever happen

way Robert Francis chronicles the evidence of systemic failure means
that we cannot say with confidence that failings of care are limited to
one hospital, but let us also be clear about what the report does not
say. Francis does not blame any specific policy, he does not blame the

scapegoats.</hs_Para>

beyond the specific failures that Francis catalogues so clearly, we can
identify in the report three fundamental problems with the culture of
our NHS. The first is a focus on finance and figures at the expense of
patient care—he says that explicitly—underpinned by a
preoccupation with a narrow set of top-down targets pursued, in the
case of Mid Staffordshire, to the exclusion of patient safety or
listening to what patients, relatives, and indeed many staff members,
were saying. Secondly, there was an attitude that patient care was
always someone else’s problem. In short, no one was
accountable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T12:39:07"></hs_TimeCode>.
Thirdly, he talks about defensiveness and complacency. He finds that,
instead of facing up to and acting on data that should have implied
cause for concern, all too often there is a culture of only explaining
the positives rather than any critical analysis.
Put<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T12:40:00"></hs_TimeCode> simply,
managers were suppressing inconvenient facts in favour of looking for
comfort in positive information. This is one of the most disturbing
findings. It is bad enough that terrible things happened at that
hospital, but what the inquiry is telling us is that there was a
manifest failure to act on the data that were available, not just at
the hospital but more widely. As Francis
says<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T12:39:46"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T12:39:46"></hs_TimeCode>:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13020677000770" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0001.htm#13020677000770">“In

targets and put quality of care on a par with quality of treatment. We
have set this out explicitly in the mandate to the NHS Commissioning
Board, together with a new vision for compassionate nursing. We have
introduced a tough new programme for tracking and eliminating falls,
pressure sores and hospital infections, and we have demanded
nursing rounds, every hour, in every ward of every hospital,

each<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T12:41:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0001.htm#13020677000201">First,
let me address how we put patient care ahead of finances. Today, when a
hospital fails financially, its chair can be dismissed and the board
can be suspended, but failures in care rarely carry such consequences.
That is not right, so we will create a single failure regime, where the
suspension of the board can be triggered by failures in care as well as
failures in finance, and we will put the voice of patients and staff at
the heart of the way in which hospitals go about their work. In Mid
Staffordshire, as far back as 2006, there was a staff survey in which
only around a quarter of staff said they would actually want one of
their own relatives to use the hospital that they worked in. Over the
following two years, bereaved relatives and campaigners produced case
after dreadful case and campaign after chilling campaign, but these
voices and these horrific cases were ignored. Indeed, the hospital was
upgraded to foundation trust status during this period. We need the
words of patients and front-line staff to ring through the boardrooms
of our hospitals and, frankly, right beyond, to the regulators and the
Department of Health itself.</hs_Para>

from this year, every patient, every carer and every member of staff
will be given the opportunity to say whether they would recommend
treatment in their hospital to their friends or family. This will be
published and the board will be held to account for its response. Put
simply, where a significant proportion of patients or staff raise
serious concerns about what is happening in a hospital, immediate
inspection will result and suspension of the hospital board may well
follow. Quality of care means not accepting that bed sores and hospital
infections are somehow occupational hazards—that a little bit of
these things is somehow okay. It is not okay; they are
unacceptable—full stop, end of story. That is what zero
harm—the jargon for this—means. I have therefore asked
Don Berwick, who has advised President Obama on this issue, to make
zero harm a reality in our
NHS<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T12:43:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0001.htm#13020677000203">Francis
makes other recommendations. Today it is possible to give hands-on care
in a hospital with no training at all. Francis says this is wrong and I
agree. There are some simple but quite profound things that need to
happen in our NHS and in our hospitals. Nurses should be hired and
promoted on the basis of having compassion as a vocation, not just
academic qualifications. We need a style of leadership from senior
nurses that means that poor practice is not tolerated and is driven off
the wards. Another issue is whether pay should be linked to quality of
care rather than just to time served at a hospital. I favour this
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T12:44:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

accountability and transparency, the first Francis report set out very
clearly what happened within Stafford hospital, and it should have led
to those responsible being brought to book by the board, by the
regulators, by the professional bodies and by the courts. But that did
not happen. Most people will want to know why on earth not. We expect
hospitals to take disciplinary action against staff who abuse their
patients. We expect the professional bodies—the professional
regulators—to strike off doctors and nurses who seriously breach
their professional codes. And, yes, we expect the justice system to
prosecute those suspected of criminal acts, whether they take place in
a hospital or anywhere
else<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T12:45:18"></hs_TimeCode>. But in
Stafford those expectations were badly let down. The system failed, and
that is one of the main reasons we badly needed this public

that the recommendations about systemic failure are public, the
regulatory bodies in particular are going to have some difficult
questions to answer. The Nursing and Midwifery Council and the General
Medical Council need to explain why, so far, no one has been struck
off. The Secretary of State for Health has today invited them to
explain what steps they will take to strengthen their systems of
accountability in the light of this report, and we are going to ask the
Law Commission to advise on sweeping away the Nursing and Midwifery
Council’s outdated and inflexible decision-making
processes.</hs_Para>

Health and Safety Executive also needs to explain its decisions not to
prosecute in specific cases. Indeed, Robert Francis makes a strong
argument that the Health and Safety Executive is too distant from
hospitals and not the right organisation to be focusing on health care
and criminal prosecutions in such cases. So we will look closely at his
recommendation to transfer the right to conduct criminal prosecutions
away from the HSE to the Care Quality

we must purge the culture of complacency that is undermining the
quality of care in our country. This requires a clear view about what
is acceptable and what is not. In our schools, we have a clear system
of deciding whether a school has the right culture and whether it is
succeeding or failing. It is a system based on the judgment of
independent experts who walk the corridors of the school and analyse
more than just the statistics. The public therefore know which schools
near them are outstanding and which are failing. They have a right to
know exactly the same about our hospitals.</hs_Para>

when our own loved ones—our mother or father, grandmother or
grandfather—go into hospital, we are placing them in the trust
of the NHS and we expect hospitals to be places of utmost compassion
and the highest standards of care. At Stafford, patients became victims

the Prime Minister makes clear, today’s report says that the
primary responsibility for what happened lay with the board of the

Prime Minister says it will take some time to digest the report in
full, so let me ask some specific questions. First, on the patient
voice, effective regulation is essential, but the reality is that
regulators cannot be everywhere spotting every problem. Patients, their
families and staff are everywhere in our NHS, so we must ensure that
they are properly heard.</hs_Para>

challenge is to change the culture of the NHS and to support rather
than shut out people who complain. The NHS constitution offers
protections for whistleblowers, and we support moves to strengthen
that. The Francis report, however, also highlights criticisms and
concerns about both previous and current arrangements for patient
bodies. Does the Prime Minister agree—from something he said
earlier, I think he does—that whatever bodies we choose to
represent patients, they need to be independent and have the powers to
be an effective voice and challenge to the

on staffing, the basic requirements of any NHS hospital are that there
are sufficient staff to look after patients and that they act with
compassion. In too many cases at Stafford, that just did not happen.
Compassion should always be at the heart of nursing, and it needs to be
at the heart of nurse training, so we support the moves that the Prime

earlier. Monitor and the Healthcare Commission should have worked
together much more closely. We will look at the Prime Minister’s
proposals around the chief inspector of nursing care, but does he
support the move to a single regulator, which is in the Francis report?
On health care assistants—the Prime Minister mentioned
them—who do such important work in our hospital wards and

been shared on both sides of this House, and the journey to foundation
trust status has clearly been a beneficial process for many trusts. In

bigger overarching issue here, which applies not just in Stafford, but
elsewhere in our NHS. It is something that my right hon. Friend the

is mildly critical of MPs. Like others in the community, we love our
local hospitals and we always want to stand up for them, but we have to
be careful to look at the results in our local hospitals and work out

important for that to happen. Secondly, as I tried to make clear in my

at Stafford are having a continuing impact on both management and care
at the University hospital of North Staffordshire. A and E closures at
Stafford have  
<?notus-xml column=290?>caused major strains, for example, and our new hospital was already
struggling as a result of bed closures ordered a few years ago by Sir
David Nicholson’s travelling troubleshooter, Antony Sumara. For
reasons of patient safety, our hospital’s chief executive last
year rightly reopened many of those beds to cope with the added A and E
pressures. That has only added to the financial pressures, however.
When rather distant bureaucrats at the Department of Health and the
regional health authority play their part in responding to those
pressures, will the Prime Minister ensure that they do so with sympathy

CQC believes that the hospital is currently providing an adequate

the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, which was supposed to
encourage and protect whistleblowing, has failed in this case when
faced with the culture of the NHS. On the lessons that could be
learned, the Health Committee published a report in 2009 on patient
safety and recommended that the Government should look at how
whistleblowing was handled around the world, particularly in New
Zealand. There, it is handled by an 
<?notus-xml column=295?>independent person, who carries out the inquiry, often anonymously from

My view—we can debate this over the coming weeks—is that
quite a lot of transparent information is available in the NHS, but it
is not properly acted on. What we need from the chief inspector of
hospitals is a sense that, as in schools, you consider the data, walk
the wards, look at the quality of care with a professional team and

they need a judgment. They need to know whether the hospital is okay,

no one magic bullet answer to the whole problem, but if there is a

Members will be aware, LIBOR is a major benchmark reference rate that
is fundamental to the workings of the UK and international financial
markets. Barclays and UBS have previously been fined by the authorities
for attempted rate manipulation. Other financial institutions are

RBS.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000378" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0002.htm#13020677000378">Findings
published today by the FSA show that certain individuals in RBS sought
to manipulate LIBOR submissions. This is an extremely serious matter,
motivated by greed. The FSA found that RBS breached two of its
principles for businesses. First, between October 2006 and November
2010 it repeatedly breached the proper standards of market conduct
required by the FSA’s principle 5. It made LIBOR submissions
that took into account its own derivatives trading positions or took
into account the profit and loss of its money market trading books; and
it sought to manipulate the submissions of others by colluding with
panel banks and broker firms. The breaches of principle 5 relate to
LIBOR rates in three currencies: Japanese yen, Swiss francs and
US
dollars.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000379" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0002.htm#13020677000379">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T14:05:03"></hs_TimeCode>,
from 2006 to as recently as March 2012, RBS failed to have the
necessary risk management systems and controls required by the
FSA’s principle 3. There was a failure to identify and manage
the risks of inappropriate submission, an absence of any
submissions-related systems and controls until March 2011, and
inadequate transaction monitoring systems throughout. Furthermore, in
response to a specific request by the FSA as a result of its inquiries
into LIBOR, RBS attested to the FSA in March 2011 that its
LIBOR-related systems and controls were adequate. It transpires that
RBS’s systems and controls were inadequate, and so RBS’s
statement to the FSA was
incorrect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000380" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0002.htm#13020677000380">These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T14:05:49"></hs_TimeCode>
findings are grave. At least 219 requests for inappropriate submissions
were documented, and at least 21 individuals, including at least one
manager, were involved in the inappropriate conduct. In the light of
these findings, the FSA has rightly imposed a fine of £125
million on RBS, reduced to £87.5 million for early payment. This
figure is less than the £160 million fine imposed on UBS but
greater than the £59.5 million fine imposed on Barclays, in

Government are clear that any organisation or individuals found guilty

the light of the findings at Barclays last year, the Serious Fraud

rightly committing a large amount of resource, including a 40-strong

this action against the perpetrators is clearly not sufficient. It is
right that in the face of misconduct of this scale, responsibility is
taken at senior levels. That is why, although the report clears senior
management of any involvement in, or knowledge of, the misconduct, it
is right that John Hourican, the leader of the investment bank since
2008, will leave RBS after handing over his responsibilities. He will
receive his minimal contractual entitlement of 12 months’ notice
and other contractual entitlements. He will forfeit 100% of his
unvested bonus and his long-term incentive plan awards that are subject
to clawback, totalling some £5 million, as well as, of course,
forfeiting any bonus that he would have received in
2012.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000385" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0002.htm#13020677000385">This
still leaves the question of the very substantial fines that RBS will
have to pay. While it is right that RBS faces the full force of
regulatory action in the light of its misconduct, the Government
believe that it would clearly be wrong for the taxpayer to foot the
bill. In the case of the FSA fines, the Government have changed the
system so that all revenue from fines will be used to the benefit of
taxpayers. In the Financial Services Act 2012, which
received Royal Assent just before Christmas, we have made provision for
all such fines, net of enforcement costs, to go to the Exchequer. So
when RBS pays the FSA £87.5 million in fines, everything after
enforcement costs will flow directly back to the taxpayer. Thanks to
this reform, the Government have been able to announce previously that
£35 million of fines imposed during 2012 will be used to support
Britain’s armed forces community, with an additional £5
million going to the Imperial War
Museum.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_06_PT_1/AC6728AEDC45436D6496862D98B02B6ACE09AB00" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="6 February 2013">Wednesday

say clearly that the misdeeds of the past need to be put right. Where
people or small businesses up and down the country have suffered
detriment, we should not turn a blind eye. We should be rigorous in
holding people to account, and acknowledging the harm done to
businesses that have suffered from past mis-selling, and when we do
that we should look—as in this case—to recover the costs

recommendation of the Wheatley review was that the setting of LIBOR
benchmarks should include objectivity. That will require a reduction in
the number of benchmarks because some do not have the volume of
transactions to establish that, but the new regulated conduct of LIBOR
setting will include a requirement to route the reporting of rates
through transactions that are visible to the Financial Services

particular banks into what is supposed to be an objective rate will
therefore no longer be there.</hs_Para>

that there is a long-established culture of very high fines in the US.
Fines in this country have increased markedly in recent years, although
none of the institutions subject to FSA fines in recent months would
regard them as anything other than exacting. It is right for us to
follow the practice of other jurisdictions, including the US, in having
a more explicit criminal code. Our amendments to the Financial Services

<?notus-xml column=316?>Act 2012 mean that criminal sanctions explicitly for the manipulation of

Clark:</Member></B> There are a number of reasons why I think it is
achievable. The first is the contribution that regulation can make. As
Members have said, it is important to have a more exacting set of
regulatory standards that are intolerant of the kinds of abuses that
have taken place. Secondly, it is in the commercial and strategic
interests of banks to restore the reputation that they used to have for
trust. Financial services depend on trust. If people do not trust the
banks, they will not do business with them. I think the penny has
dropped across the City, and most of the new generation of chief
executives understand the connection between their future profitability
and performance, and the need to provide decent services to their
customers.</hs_Para>

third reason is a matter being investigated by the Treasury Committee
and concerns a failure or subversion of the culture of banking. Banking
was always associated with high standards of probity; it was a vocation
for people who were thought to be of a rather conservative disposition
and inclined not to take excessive risks. That was subverted by
exposure to some of the practices of recent years, and because that was
inadequately regulated it distorted what should be the right culture in
the industry. We need to make changes to all three of those areas, and

deployment of British forces in Mali and other parts of north Africa.
Last weekend, the Prime Minister undertook an arduous visit to the
area, which included serious discussions with the Algerian Government
and others. When the initial statements on Mali were made, we were

Prime Minister is in step with the British public. A referendum is only
right. The EU has fundamentally changed since we first joined in the
early ’70s and it continues to change because of the eurozone
crisis. The answer to the crisis from the eurozone capitals is more
Europe—more political and economic integration. They have
realised somewhat belatedly that they cannot have monetary union and
save the euro without fiscal union, but that is not why we joined the
EU. We joined for trade, not for
politics.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000456" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0002.htm#13020677000456">No
one can deny that the EU’s role in our daily lives, which some
would describe as meddling, has grown over the decades and continues to
grow, and yet we have not stopped to ask the fundamental question of
whether that is in our best interests. The timing of the referendum is
sensible in that it allows for a renegotiation so we can know what the
“in” part of the referendum question is. I wish the Prime
Minister well—it will be a hard road because the direction of
travel is in the other direction—but I hope he can renegotiate a
looser agreement or arrangement with the EU that focuses on trade and
not on politics. He might well be able to do so, which would appeal to
a great number of people in this country. I hope he does more than
Prime Minister Harold Wilson did in 1975. He claimed he had
renegotiated and repatriated a lot of powers, but under close scrutiny,
it appeared to be a thin claim—it did not amount to a tin of

introduced immediately after a Conservative victory, so this has become
a party political issue. As such, many are concerned that there is deep

such that many are critical of the Prime Minister for not delivering on

the fact that the ink on the treaty had dried before he came to power.
Legislation in this Parliament would therefore address the deficit of
trust. A Bill is far more believable than an election manifesto
promise, and a referendum would not be dependent on any one party. Any
incoming Prime Minister would find it difficult—not impossible,

time we had a more positive relationship with our European neighbours.
For too long, it has been a strained relationship. In part, I think
that is because the British people have not been happy with the
EU’s direction of travel, and in part because they have been
frustrated that they have not been able to express their view through

years this subject has been swept under the carpet. I believe it
deserves a mature and thoughtful debate. Suicide is a significant
problem in our society. Its impact is often sudden and shocking. While
we can to some degree prepare ourselves for the death, through ageing,
of elderly parents or the loss of loved ones through chronic illness,
suicide catches us by surprise. Often there is no warning and we are
left with a feeling of utter bewilderment. We ask: was it preventable?
Were there warning signs that we failed to recognise? Was it simply a
cry for help that went wrong? All of those are questions to which we
will, regrettably, never receive an answer.</hs_Para>

can be seen that suicide touches the lives of many people and is, in
every case, a tragedy both for the life that has ended and for the
family, friends and community left behind. We must always remember that
each person who has been lost to suicide has been someone’s
child, someone’s parent, brother, sister or friend. Their
passing leaves a wound that does not easily heal, even with the passing
of time. In addition, those bereaved by suicide have special needs and
require special support, for bereavement by suicide is itself a risk
factor for suicide.</hs_Para>

presents a serious socio-economic issue, as well as a political
challenge. It is a problem that we all have a duty to address. There is
a great need to change public attitudes and to increase awareness and
understanding about suicide as a major public health problem that is
largely preventable. Globally, almost 1 million people die from suicide
every year. In the past 45 years, suicide rates have increased by
60% worldwide. Suicide is one of the three leading causes of
death among those aged 15 to 44 years in many countries. Although

House’s attention, very earnestly and gently, to the fact that
behind every statistic is a personal tragedy—a personal tragedy
that a person reached the point where they felt that there was no other
way to go; a personal tragedy because no one can fully understand the
loneliness or desperation that a person feels trapped by whenever they
reach the point at which they think that the only way out is
suicide.</hs_Para>

is no one reason why people take their own lives. It is often a result
of problems building up to the point where that person can see no way
out to cope with what they are experiencing. Factors that have been
linked with suicide include unemployment; economic decline; personal
debt; painful and disabling illness; heavy use of, or dependency on,
alcohol or other drugs; children and adults dealing with the impact of
family breakdown; the loss or break-up of a close relationship;
depression; social isolation; bullying; and poor educational
attainment. Those experiences have been shown to make people more
susceptible to suicide. It may be that a seemingly minor event becomes
the trigger for them attempting to take their own lives—on many
occasions not to die, but simply to get relief from their unbearable
pain. Low self-esteem, being close to tears and not being able to cope
with small, everyday events are all signs that someone is struggling to
cope with overwhelming feelings. Yet it is often difficult to tell
whether someone is suicidal or depressed, as people in crises react in
different ways. Uncharacteristic behaviour can often be a sign that
something is very wrong.</hs_Para>

of the main problems that I want to address in this debate is: where do
people turn to for support and help? Let me first acknowledge the work
done by our front-line health and social care professionals, and the
effort that has gone into the development and delivery of suicide
prevention strategies, which aim to identify regional risk factors,
establish key objectives via a cross-section of organisations, and seek
ultimately to reduce rates of suicide and self-harm throughout the
United Kingdom. For example, in Northern Ireland, I appreciate our
ministerial co-ordination group in the Northern Ireland Assembly. It
was established in 2006 to ensure that suicide prevention is a priority
across relevant Departments and to enhance cross-departmental
co-operation on the issue. I was delighted by the changes made by
Minister Poots, so that instead of the group meeting on a needs basis,
it meets regularly to provide the sustained effort and leadership
needed to reduce the high rate of suicide in Northern Ireland. I
commend him for taking a long-term, upstream intervention approach to
the
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:17:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

addition to Government-led initiatives in England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland, credit must be given to the agencies and voluntary
organisations working at the heart of our communities to provide a
vital lifeline when one is needed most. I acknowledge the excellent
work done by many Church organisations, which give spiritual
counselling to many who feel that life is so burdensome that it is not
worth the struggle. These organisations—whether Government
agencies, voluntary agencies or Church agencies—have a vital
role to play in complementing local mental and public health services.
This work at the coal face is truly inspirational. I pay tribute to the

said earlier that people needed to know about the availability of those
who are willing to help. I say that because about three weeks ago a
conference was held in my constituency in Antrim after two suicides had
taken place—it was not called by politicians, but by the

delighted and honoured to be part of that occasion, but what I found
out that day was that although a multitude of organisations deal with
the problem, many in the community do not know about them. Many do not

recognise that this is a particularly complex matter and that the
challenges it presents are indeed multiple. None the less, they are
challenges that must be overcome, for children have the right to be
protected from all forms of abuse, violence and harm. Enhanced internet
safety is only part of the solution to the growing problem of suicide
and self-harm. Through a co-ordinated approach, we must effectively
address the issues impacting on emotional health so that we reach a
point where so-called “suicide” sites will no longer be
attractive to vulnerable individuals and will be made naturally
obsolete or unattractive to view. We need to think innovatively about
what more can be done across government and the community to reduce the

on suicide. However, the increase in the suicide rate may be offset by
adequate welfare benefits; their finding was very clear on that. Other
measures likely to reduce the impact of recession included targeted
intervention for the 
<?notus-xml column=339?>unemployed and membership of social organisations. They found that
responsible media reporting was also
important<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.

Nav Kapur of Manchester university on suicide in the armed forces. He
found that the largest number of suicides were by young people leaving
the armed forces, usually without having completed their basic training
or shortly after they had passed it. Further research is needed to
confirm this, but the indications were that there was a feeling of
hopelessness with regard to attempts to build a family in the armed
forces, 
<?notus-xml column=341?>that a sense of success and of identity had been lost, and that that was
perhaps one of the motivations towards suicide. Additional funding is

all-party group has discussed how coroners record suicide and the
importance of accurate suicide reporting. I cannot stress that enough.
One of the problems is narrative verdicts, which were introduced as an
addition to a statutory verdict. If someone died in the custody of the
Crown, for example, they allowed for a narrative of that death to teach
lessons about how it had happened. Instead, however, they have replaced
the verdict and become a verdict in their own right. Often, the death
of someone who takes their own life by tying a ligature around their
neck is not recorded as a suicide, because the appropriate word has not
been used. The Ministry of Justice needs to work on this area. I know
that it is doing so and I hope to meet the chief coroner soon to see

ago by the coroners service not to hold inquests on suicides, but to
just record them and not put the families through an inquest unless the
public interest or another family requirement demands it. That means

That such plans are not a statutory requirement of the new national

for South Antrim (Dr McCrea) and all Democratic Unionist party Members

issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000628" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000628">Yesterday,
I spoke of some of the most difficult times in my life. I was lucky to
have the support of a loving family and great friends, but many
unfortunately do not have that. Before being elected, I worked in the
hospice movement. In that time, I got to know a lot of the patients
well, and, sadly, death became a norm—I did not want to use that
word, but I am sure hon. Members understand what I am getting at.
Bereavement is always difficult, but suicide bereavement is a different
type of bereavement altogether.</hs_Para>

that from personal experience. When I was in the sixth form, I remember
vividly walking in and a friend saying to me, “Have you heard
about that boy?”—I will not mention his name. He had
taken his own life because he had been bullied at school. I remember
all the students sitting in the common room in complete and utter
shock. All I could think about were the questions going around in my
head. What could I have done? Why did I not spot that he was in that
difficult place? If I am honest, those questions still haunt me today.
In more recent times—since I have been elected as a Member of
Parliament—there was the very sad case in my constituency of a
father who killed his entire family and then
himself.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000630" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000630">The
suicides I have seen and experienced have had a tremendous effect on
the people who are left behind. That is why the debate is important,
but more importantly we should act and not just talk about suicide. We
must also start right at the beginning and change people’s
attitudes. How many times have hon. Members been on a train that has
been delayed because somebody has taken their life, and the instinct of
some passengers is to moan about the delay, forgetting that somebody
has lost their
life?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000631" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000631">Hon.

personal battles. As hon. Members have said, however, suicide is a much
wider subject than just mental health; it can be about finance, careers
or family breakdown. It is important that we address all those issues,
which is why I welcome the fact that the suicide prevention strategy is
in place. It is important that the strategy is not just a piece of
paper; it has to be backed up by action, and it is good to see that
happening. Crucially, it is partly about identifying the

is important that the strategy targets specific groups who we know may
be vulnerable. Targeting young people will be important, because we
want to change attitudes 
<?notus-xml column=346?>in the future. We also have to look at why so many young men are
committing suicide. We have been talking about mental health, but let
us face it: men are not very good at talking, and that is part of the
problem. As we move into the digital age and we all spend so much time
on our computers, being used to talking with others will lessen over
time. I fear that we will have a generation who will be even worse than

bullying and violence. We must allow people to talk about the threats
they feel, whether they are sexual abuse or bullying at home. We also

hon. Member for Bridgend that we need to ensure good national
provision. We need to ensure that suicide prevention measures are
available in every part of our country. In particular, bereavement
support needs a suicide angle to it, because it really is very
different. In my time at the hospice, I saw how fragmented bereavement
services were around the country, but specific suicide bereavement
support is even more
fragmented.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000638" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000638">I
hope that as the strategy develops we will continue to work with the
many wonderful organisations we have in this country, many of which
have been mentioned today, such as the Samaritans. The APPG is a great
start, bringing together a coalition of organisations with a wealth of
experience, but it is also important that we listen to family groups
that have been through this dreadful experience. What makes Martin
House children’s hospice such a wonderful organisation is that
it is parent-led. The parents describe the care they need, and that is
why it can offer such wonderful support. In the same way, the best
strategy for dealing with suicide will come from those families who
have experienced it.</hs_Para>

action on cyber-bullying. Bullying has existed in
schools for many years, but it has taken on a different form now.
People can be bullied at school, but when they get home it continues
through the social networking sites and the computers in their

hope that we can offer further training for organisations
and—perhaps—the police in helping them to deliver that
bad news. I have had several constituents tell me that they almost felt
sorry for the police officer delivering the news because it was so
difficult. It is important that these organisations be aware of the
wealth of information out there. I am glad that the “Help is at

conclusion, suicide is tragic in every sense: the loneliness of the
person doing it, the long bereavement for those left behind, the guilt
they suffer for years after and the great risk that they themselves
might go on to commit suicide. It is crucial that we face this risk.
This debate is just the start: let us now address and act on it.

first acquaintance with suicide. At school one day, we discovered that
a chap in my class in the third year had died by suicide. I experienced
feelings of absolute bewilderment and shock that someone who
had been with us only the previous day—playing a normal role in

of suicide and talking about its causes and what prompts people to take
their own lives can we in some way help others not to go down this

want to talk from my perspective as the Member for
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:39:50"></hs_TimeCode>Belfast North,
which has been mentioned a number of times. It has one of the highest
suicide rates of any part of the United Kingdom, with 25.2 deaths per
100,000 in the period 2006 to 2011. In the last five-year period for
which we have figures, from 2007, that figure crept up to 25.9 per
100,000. As has been said, only the constituency
of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:40:23"></hs_TimeCode> Belfast West
has a higher rate. Those rates are high for Northern Ireland, which has
high rates compared with the rest of the United Kingdom. I therefore
know about this issue from my constituency surgeries, as well as from
meetings with the Minister of Health in Northern Ireland, Edwin Poots,
from delegations that I have led of families bereaved by suicide and
from my work with groups such as PIPS, which my hon. Friend the Member
for South Antrim (Dr McCrea) mentioned—I commend 
<?notus-xml column=348?>him on his excellent speech in introducing this debate—and others
that do such tremendous work in Belfast North. They include Lighthouse,
FASA—the Forum for Action on Substance Abuse—and many
other charities and Churches.</hs_Para>

Diane Abbott</B> (Hackney North and Stoke Newington) (Lab):</Member> I
congratulate the hon. Member for South Antrim (Dr McCrea) on opening
the debate so ably. As we have heard, suicide is a particular problem
in Northern Ireland, but the problem exists throughout the British
Isles. I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs

is easy to blanket a debate on suicide in sociology jargon, but the
truth is that, while any death in a family is tragic, there is
something about suicide that is uniquely tragic. I say that as a
mother. It must always leave family members asking themselves,
“Is there something that I could have done? Were there signs
that I could have noticed?” If suicide is a cry for help, family
members must be left asking themselves until the end of their lives,
“Why did I not hear that cry in the first place?” There
is certainly something peculiarly tragic about suicide.</hs_Para>

individual causes of any particular suicide are never straightforward,
and they are certainly not amenable to any top-down, one-size-fits-all,
command-and-control solution, but I think it is agreed across the House
that positive changes in society can make a difference to individual
lives, and that we can offer even better support to bereaved
families.</hs_Para>

suicide is not just a matter of mental health; however, it is related
to mental health issues. I stress that Labour is committed to tackling
the stigma attached to mental illness. One in four of us will suffer a

mental health spending. According to some indicators, it has been cut

prevention strategy unless the basic spending is
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000675" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000675">I
think that, once we have cut through the sociological jargon, it is
clear that the recently rising levels of suicide must be related to the
fragmentation of families and societies. Once upon a time, a generation
ago, young people could reasonably expect to live in the same street as
their mothers and other relatives, or around the corner from them.
Young men growing up could reasonably expect a secure job, probably the
same as that done by their fathers, and perhaps, in some parts of the
country, in the place where many members of their community worked.
That increasing fragmentation of families and societies—which is
not the fault of any political party or any Government, but is partly
due to the nature of the society we live in and to
globalisation—must lead to less resilience in families and
communities, and must make the issue of suicide more
pressing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000676" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000676">As
Members will have heard, the latest suicide figures issued by the
Office for National Statistics for England and Wales show an increase
in the number of people who have taken their own lives. In particular,
there appears to have been a significant increase between 2010 and
2011. As we heard in a number of contributions, historically more men
complete suicide attempts. We have also heard interesting contributions
about the rise of cyber-bullying triggering suicide. There was a very
sad case here in London a few weeks ago. A girl committed suicide
because she was very upset about the pictures of herself in a
compromising position that were going around via mobile phones and on
the internet. We have also heard about the particular problems of
suicide in prisons and young offenders

Members tentatively tried to explore why men are three times more
likely than women to take their own lives. In England, for men under 35

1990s, suicide rates for young men aged 15 to 24 reached an all-time
high. They were at the highest levels since the 1920s. Research by both
the <I>British Medical Journal </I>and Mind found that during times of
recession the mental health of men is put at particular risk.
Mind’s YouGov survey found that almost 40% of men are worried or
low at present, and the top three issues playing on their minds are job
security, work and money. The report identifies unemployment as
increasing the 
<?notus-xml column=353?>risk of suicide among men under 35; young men who took their own lives
often did so in their period of worklessness. The chief executive of

said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13020677000808" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000808">“The
recession is clearly having a detrimental impact on the nation’s
mental health but men in particular are struggling with the emotional
impact. Being a breadwinner is something that is still crucial to the
male psyche so if a man loses his job he loses a large part of his
identity putting his mental wellbeing in jeopardy. The problem is that
too many men wrongly believe that admitting mental distress makes them
weak and this kind of self stigma can cost
lives.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13020677000678" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000678">The
reasons for committing suicide are complex and often very individual,

particularly strongly by young and middle-aged men.

recommendations, so in the reorganised system it will be up to clinical
commissioning groups and local directors of public health to take
action in local areas. I hope this debate will serve to flag up the

me say a few words about Labour’s record on mental health. We
made important progress on mental health, with the national service
framework early on and then the improving access to psychological
therapies programme towards the end of our time in office. Along with
cancer and coronary heart disease, we made mental health one of our top
three clinical priorities, and by 2007 we were spending more than
£1 billion more on mental health services than in 2001, which is
a real-terms increase of 25%. However, we believe there was more we
could have done, which is why
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:04:36"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.

would like to see more work done on internet safety, to bear down both
on internet bullying and on sites that, tragically, help young people
to find out about suicide and may well encourage copycat suicides. We
want to rewrite the NHS constitution to give patients the same legal
rights to therapies for treating mental illnesses as they already have
for drug treatment and treatments for physical illness. We want to
ensure that training for all professional staff in the NHS includes
dealing with mental health issues. If we are to meet the mental health
challenge, and so meet the challenge of 
<?notus-xml column=354?>dealing with increasing levels of suicide, we have to realise that it is
not just an issue for the NHS; we have to bring together public
services, such as education and the police, to work with business and
employers. That is why my right hon. Friend the Leader of the

strategic plan for mental health, which will be chaired by Stephen
O’Brien, a good friend of mine and the chairman of Barts and the

is an individual tragedy. Every person who commits suicide is not
amenable to anything that government might do; we will always find that
two people—two men or two young women—may be

government can do about that, but we can do something about the
therapies and mental health services available. We can do something to
support and sustain families. When I say “families”, I do
not just mean a man and a woman with a certificate and 2.2
children; I mean the many varied patterns of family we find in our
society. We can do more to support families and communities. In
particular, we can do more to support grieving families, and we can do

right hon. and hon. Members about the whole issue of suicide. The
overall figures are a startling reminder of just how serious that
subject is in society today. In the whole of the United
Kingdom—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland—6,045 people died from suicide in 2011. In Northern
Ireland, the level of suicide has increased, with about 4,000 people
having committed suicide between 2000 and the end of 2012. It is
estimated that the final figure for 2012 will show that close to
300 people died last year in Northern Ireland through
suicide. In the first nine months, the figure was 223 and it is
estimated that it will reach 300 when the final analysis has been done.
Those are startling figures.</hs_Para>

awful impact of suicide on families has been mentioned numerous times,
and we cannot mention it enough. It is horrific when we, as elected
Members, have to go to homes and give our sympathy to those who have
lost loved ones—a child or an older person—through
suicide. We mean well as we go to pay our respects, but we can walk out
of the house again and go back to spend time with our families whereas
those people must live with the impact day in, day out. People ask
questions, as we heard earlier, such as, “Why did it happen? Why
did we not see something that would have shown us that there were
problems or that there was an 
<?notus-xml column=355?>issue that we could have dealt with?” Those questions linger for
years; they never leave those people, who think that there must surely
have been something they could have done to prevent the suicide.

Friend the Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds) mentioned that some
£30 million has been given to organisations that deal with the
issues surrounding suicide, and although a large amount of
money has been poured in, the situation is worsening in Northern
Ireland. That is very, very worrying. Reference has been
made to the legacy of the troubles and the difficulties in the
Province. Another generation is emerging that is living with what has
happened in the past. Perhaps their parents died in the same way, and
it is a copycat: people are trying to copy what has happened. That is

believe that counselling is working as it ought to work. Perhaps we
have to think outside the box and come up with more innovative ways of
trying to help people and identify the issues that they face. When he
talks to those people, he finds that they have very low self-esteem.
Men who have worked for 25 or 30 years in one job are paid
off and feel that they are not worth anything. They feel that the
family would be better off without them, then tragedy strikes. That is
the way it happens. When it does, they believe that it will solve an

is not just because the statistics are better collated that we can say
that the problem is growing. There are issues, and people can analyse
and compare the different statistical bases over the years. It is a
problem that has gradually been able to express itself a bit more.
Reference has been made to the fact that it has been a taboo subject.
The first time that I heard of suicide was when I was in primary school
in the late 1960s, and a family friend committed suicide. She was a
great friend of my mother—she was great to all my brothers and
sisters whenever we were in her fruit and vegetable shop—and I
remember that my mother’s distress as a friend was based not
only on all the usual questions that arise from suicide and the loss of
a lovely friend. It was also based on the fact that her friend was
denied a Christian burial and denied the rites of her own Church. That
is what taboo meant then. Luckily, Churches have become more
enlightened and many people have helped them to become more
enlightened. So we can celebrate the fact that spiritual enlightenment
can inform Churches in different ways, and their response to something
that they class as a sin can change and develop. That has been very
positive and has helped all of us as a community in many
ways<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:20:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000695" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000695">I
have found the debate hard. I agreed with many of the points, and I
also felt many of the points. I have experienced suicide in my family
more than once. I also have experience of suicide by people whom I
regard as close—good friends, family friends and so on. All the
things that all the right hon. and hon. Members have said are so, so
true. We are stuck with that—the questions that will never
leave, and the answers that will never come. There are people finding
and developing answers, however. Maybe they are not answers to the
particular suicide that has grieved me or grieves other members of my
family and extended family, but answers as to how we may be able to get
on top of the problem and as to how we can avert such tragedy and
prevent it from afflicting other people as well.</hs_Para>

many cases some of those answers are being driven by the families and
the very people who have experienced suicide, and by the professionals
who have witnessed that, provided support and said, “There has
to be a better way. There has to be more that we can do. There has to
be more that we can do together.”
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:21:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bridgend (Mrs Moon) referred to the work of the all-party group and
the report. I do not speak often at the all-party group, for reasons
that people will understand; I find it hard to contain my emotions on
these things. One thing struck me as I was listening to people give
evidence to the group—people who did not know which area I
represented. A few times when people from parts of England were giving
evidence about their experience and the things that they were trying to
do in their area with their trusts and well-being boards, they referred
to what they called the Derry model, which they wanted to see in their
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:22:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000697" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000697">That
is because in my constituency, in my city of Derry, as other hon.
Members have said, we have grave levels of suicide, but there has been
a strong community response and the local Western Health and Social
Care Trust has tried to engage strongly on it. The trust has a suicide
liaison officer, Barry McGail, who does not just work well locally, but
is globally active and is part of progressive policy-pushing networks
on the subject. When people spoke about the Derry model, part of what
they meant was that suicide liaison service.</hs_Para>

the family and friends. They are able to bring leaflets and draw
attention to other services in a sensitive way, so the issues are
immediately picked up and the people who might be most emotionally
affected or vulnerable after the suicide—other family members,
friends, classmates and so on—can be identified and supported.
That has worked well and has helped families through and has helped
them feel that they are helping others, which is so
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:23:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000699" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000699">More
widely in Northern Ireland, we have a self-harm register, another
positive development. It is run now by the Public Health Agency and is
co-ordinated on a north-south basis. The register provides up-to-date
information on people who may have attempted suicide or have
self-harmed, so that the right services can be in touch with them or
they can at least know that services such as counselling and other
opportunities are available for them. Again, that is important in
prevention. It is also important to learn the lessons of experiences
and making sure that things that are known to one service are not lost
to the knowledge and intelligence of another service that may be the
right one to provide
help.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000700" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000700"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:24:43"></hs_TimeCode>Some
hon. Members have referred to the media in this regard. Of course, the
media have particular responsibilities. They need to be very careful
and sensitive in how they present any film or TV storylines depicting
suicide. If they make suicide simply the natural conclusion to a
narrative, that is completely wrong. Unfortunately, too often in the
media it seems as though the suicide itself makes the statement, and
that is very dangerous. Equally, the media, whether the print media or
any other kind, need to be very sensitive in how they cover deaths by
suicide. If they treat speculation about
clusters—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:25:20"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Bridgend, who is unfortunately no 
<?notus-xml column=358?>longer here, has experienced this directly in her constituency—in
an insensitive, invasive, exploitative and sensational way, that can
add to the problems. It can not only add to the suffering and stress of
families, but put more families at risk of loss and
distress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:25:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000701" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000701">Over
a dozen years ago—this is not a new problem in Northern
Ireland—people like Barry McGail worked on developing guidelines
for the local media to use. One of the guidelines in circumstances
where a suicide took place was for the media not to treat it in a way
that linked it to a single dramatic event. I found myself in a
situation where there was a suicide in another family that followed a
death in my own family. With the support of education professionals,
people like Barry McGail, and other people in the Western health board,
I tried to prevail on the media not to treat the young man’s
suicide as a “Romeo and Juliet”-type story. It was a
struggle to get the media to comply with guidelines that had been drawn
up sensitively with their own co-operation, and unfortunately we did
not succeed in all instances. The media do have
responsibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:27:00"></hs_TimeCode>

there is the new media, with the digital age and all the opportunities
that are there. In relation to the sites that offer methods and
techniques of suicide and appear to be encouraging it, Barry McGail
says that although most young people will engage in social media, most
of them will want to do so positively. As well as trying to police and
shut down all the negative, dark sites, we need to think of more ways
of making sure that there are far more positive connections and real
pathways of assistance and communication. We need to develop new things
such as apps that will be suitable for young people, in particular, who
could be at
risk.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000703" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000703">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:27:55"></hs_TimeCode>
is not to say that only young people are at risk of suicide. In my
constituency and elsewhere, it affects the old and the
young—mothers, fathers, and children. However, one of the things
that gives me heart is that people who have been through these dark
difficulties, and who are still not out of all that darkness, are
desperately trying to remedy the situation through different networks,
charities and support groups. In my town, they are supported by people
such as those at Foyle Search and Rescue, who do such a good job in
helping families who suffer following suicide in the river. When we
were building the new iconic peace bridge in Derry, they worked with us
to prevail on the architects to understand that it needed to be
designed in a particular way with rails shaped so as not to lend
themselves readily to suicide
attempts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000704" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000704">Foyle

HURT (Have Your Tomorrows), which particularly helps people who have
been suffering from addiction or dependency and have specific

to solve the problems, but they constantly come up against funding
difficulties. There is also the issue of making sure that all the

together.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000705" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000705"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:24:42"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:29:23"></hs_TimeCode>Finally,
another positive feature in Northern Ireland is the

model, which has been borrowed from Canada and is working well where
people engage with it. The big problem, however, is getting GPs to
engage with it—they 
<?notus-xml column=359?>are not—because they are the vital cog and the key people. The
issue has come up in the work of the all-party group on suicide and
self-harm prevention. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:30:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bridgend will know, one of the questions that constantly comes up
is: how do we get GPs involved in and engaged with this? Their input is
vital and they are vital channels, but in their absence,
people’s sense of purpose starts to wane and get
weaker.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020677000706" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0003.htm#13020677000706">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:30:43"></hs_TimeCode>
am not blaming GPs. Obviously, there are a lot of pressures and demands
on them, so they need time out of their practice to do this. We need to
see what locum support and other things are available to allow them to
play their part in the very good efforts that are being made and to
make good the investment being provided by the Department of Health,
Social Services and Public Safety. Other Members have been right to
acknowledge the work of that Department, including that of the current

Ministers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:30:57"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
a pity that the ministerial group did not meet for about 18 months, but

reasons for suicide are complex. The question that most families
usually ask is: why? My constituency has a great organisation called If
U Care Share, which was set up by Shirley Smith, whose 19-year-old son,
Daniel, hanged himself a few years ago, having not showed any of the
signs referred to by the right hon. Gentleman. He was, the family
thought, a perfectly happy, contented teenager. The family then
wondered what they could do. They set up If U Care Share, and Shirley,
her husband, Dean, and their children, Ben and Matthew, go into schools
to talk to young people about suicide and people’s feelings.
People should not be ashamed to open up and talk about their feelings.

to ask for help. In my area, the statistics show that an older
generation of men in their 30s and 40s are committing suicide. A reason

complex issue, and there is very rarely a single factor, although
mental health is often a central feature of suicide cases. We need to

for South Antrim said, Google searches on the word
“suicide” will return details of the Samaritans at the
top of the results—a real step forward—and Facebook has
teamed up with the Samaritans to make it easier to report concerns
about a friend who might be considering self-harm or suicide. We must
do more, however. As

for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) mentioned, yesterday
was the 10th safer internet day. I met a group of young people who were
discussing the excellent “Have Your Say” survey. Some
24,000 school-aged children contributed to the largest ever survey
about what they expect online.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T11:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>The thing they
wanted most was to be safe.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T11:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>That is
something we need to deliver for young people, because they are the

thought to be able potentially to obstruct the highway; therefore, the

him for the comprehensive way he set out the amendments in that debate

for the work undertaken in the other place by the noble Lords. They
have thoroughly and efficiently considered all the issues involved in
these Bills. Their noble lordships were not prepared simply to nod
these Bills through, as some might have feared, including—I have
to say, with much regret—myself. One could well have forgiven
their lordships for thinking that as these Bills had been trundling
along the parliamentary legislative pathway for some time—albeit

<?notus-xml column=368?>at the pace of a rather arthritic snail—there could not possibly
be any purpose in subjecting them to further detailed
scrutiny.</hs_Para>

it is, their noble lordships recognised the importance of pedlars in
our society, as those of us who take an interest in these matters in
this place do too. The place of pedlars in the life of our nation dates
back to the time of Chaucer. Their noble lordships considered the
general principles behind the introduction of these Bills and how the
detail of the new proposed laws would operate in practice. Pedlars are
the ultimate in micro-businesses. The ability for someone with a
relatively small amount of capital to start a business travelling from
place to place buying and selling goods has been the starting point for
many of our great businesses, including some household names.</hs_Para>

aware, it was suggested in the other place that these Bills were
seeking to achieve the “total eradication of pedlars”
from the streets of the cities of Canterbury, Leeds and Nottingham and
the borough of Reading. As hon. Members will be aware, there is a great
deal of difference between a pedlar and a street trader. It was
submitted that the reason why it was thought necessary to try to remove
pedlars from those three cities and one borough was to prevent the
streets from being obstructed by pedlars as they stopped to sell their
wares. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:04:16"></hs_TimeCode>Their
lordships did not accept that it was appropriate to remove pedlars
completely, but they did think it appropriate that the size of the
trolley used by pedlars should be limited. Amendment C9 seeks to do
just that. It is worth noting the words used by Baroness Knight of
Collingtree, who chaired the Select Committee established in the other
place to consider the Bills, to justify amendment C9. Referring to the
fact that counsel for the local authorities promoting the Bills had
produced photographs supporting their contention that the pedlars were
causing unacceptable congestion, she

is a most telling statement. I submit that it provides proof to the
House of what my hon. Friends and I have been trying to establish from
the outset—namely, that the Bills are far from straightforward.
It should not be taken for granted that the case for the legislation
has been proven, or that the Bills should simply be nodded through the
House without detailed scrutiny. What has happened in the other place
has largely justified the stance taken by my hon. Friends when the
Bills were previously considered in this House.</hs_Para>

have already seen how, as a result of the first group of amendments,
clauses 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, which deal with seizure, forfeiture and the

They were not amended, or even slightly modified; they were removed in
their entirety. In this group, amendment C8 deletes clause 4 completely
and amendment C9 
<?notus-xml column=369?>deletes clause 5 altogether and replaces it with an entirely new clause

is worth noting the details of the proposed new clause. It sets out in
great detail the nature of the trolley that a pedlar would be permitted
to use. It gives overall dimensions for the trolley when it is being
used, but it also—rather unnecessarily, in my
opinion—gives details of the size of the trolley when empty. I
am not sure what the relevance of that could be. Surely the overall
dimensions set out in proposed new paragraph (2C) would be sufficient.
Provided the trolley did not exceed a width of 0.88 metres, a depth of
0.83 metres or a height of 1.63 metres, I fail to see how it
could be prejudicial to the council or to the users of the highway. I
also fail to see how it would prevent an obstruction from being caused
if the trolley were of a different size from that set out in proposed
new paragraph (2B), which specifically states that it should not exceed
a width of 0.75 metres, a depth of 0.5 metres and a height of 1.25
metres.</hs_Para>

fair to say that we both think that the other place’s debate
took a lot longer than expected. On the basis of the proposed
amendments, we had expected the Bills to go through the other place
relatively quickly but they did not because their lordships decided to
look at them in a lot more detail. As a result, we received a series of
Lords amendments, some of which we discussed earlier, that made a
significant difference to the Bills—not just to the touting
provision, but to the definition of pedlars. Therefore, when I seek the
indulgence of the House, it is in order to ensure that my hon. and

hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope).
Colleagues who have shown a belated interest in this Bill may think
that they have in effect been thwarting my hon. Friend over the past
few minutes. Instead, they have been voting to rubber-stamp amendments
to the Bill for which he argued many years ago but which the Government
of the time, and elements of the Opposition—the Conservative
party was sitting on the other side of the House then—resisted.
It is a measure of my hon. Friend’s success that he has gone
from leading a few of us into the Lobby to support his 
<?notus-xml column=378?>amendment to this red letter day on which 250 people have supported that
amendment. He should be very proud of

my first intervention in this House was during a discussion on this

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:01:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

that so many people have shown a belated interest in this Bill, it
seems only right that before they vote on the Lords amendments they
understand what they have been invited to vote on. In previous
discussions on this matter—as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:03:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Christchurch said, we have been debating these Bills for
around six years—we were, to be perfectly frank, talking to a
small audience. We could therefore, through various nods and winks,
understand each other’s arguments, and the Bill could rapidly
progress and rush to a Division because we all knew what we were
talking about. Tonight we are in a unique position where lots of people
who want to participate in the voting do not know the Bill’s six
years of history as I and my hon. Friend do.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:03:53"></hs_TimeCode> must lay out
exactly what people will be voting for in this group of amendments

hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier). During the passage
of the Bill, he has probably felt a great deal of frustration on
occasion, as have other Members who have sponsored the Bills. In all
fairness to him, he did not sit there in frustration without listening
to the arguments and taking on board what was said. He was good enough
to listen to the force of the argument. We had a long debate on touting
in relation to the Canterbury City Council Bill, and he was good enough
to listen to the arguments. As he made clear in an intervention

because of the hoo-hah going on at the time—the amendment
results from the promise given by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:05:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Canterbury at previous stages. He said it would be a

we cannot leave it at that—the Scrap Metal Dealers Bill is a
precedent—because assurances given in the House on how
legislation will be dealt with in the other place have not always been
kept. We cannot therefore take it as read that their lordships decided
to accept the amendment on the word of my hon. Friend, because they
have decided to ignore the words of other hon. Members in the past. We
must therefore presume not only that their lordships wished to keep to
my hon. Friend’s word, but that they were persuaded by the

both Bills lists the places to which the provisions will apply.

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:07:50"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

a shame that we have not had a great explanation of what their
lordships were thinking when they made the amendment to delete clause

Ipswich<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:15:04"></hs_TimeCode> makes a
good point, however, in that the amendment, which would delete the
clause on touting from the Canterbury Bill, raises the question: what
is so special about Canterbury? If the House agrees to the amendment,
we will remove the restrictions on touting from the Bill. It might well
be that people want controls on touting in Canterbury because of its
particular circumstances. We ought to listen to the remarks of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:15:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Canterbury during an earlier stage of the Bill.
Notwithstanding the offer he eventually made, he made it clear, at that
point, that the restriction on touting was an essential part of the
Canterbury Bill. He said that Canterbury suffered from huge problems,
with which I am not familiar, of people touting for business in
certain—perhaps historic—parts of the city. Perhaps
people felt that touting took something away from the
city<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:16:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

considering whether to support the Lords amendments, it is important
that Members decide whether they think that touting is a perfectly
acceptable practice or an unsavoury practice. Of course, there are some
unsavoury parts of touting—they are not specific to touting
itself, but go along with it. For instance, people associate the
selling of counterfeit tickets with touting. As it happens, however,
that is already a criminal offence. It is not a good excuse for banning
touting anywhere, given that legislation is already in place to deal
with it. It might well be that people feel it clutters up a town or
city and that it would look better without such people making a
nuisance of themselves. It might well be that people think the nuisance
is worth stopping. Perhaps they are being pestered by people handing
out leaflets or trying to drag them into their restaurant against their

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:19:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for The Cotswolds (Geoffrey Clifton-Brown) made about the
touting of tickets for sporting events. Touts mop up tickets for
extremely popular events at a low price or at face value and sell them
on at an inflated price to the general public who could not get their
hands on them because the touts were buying up all the stock. In
effect, the general public—the fan or the person who genuinely
wants to go—end up having to pay above the odds for their
tickets, which people find unsavoury. The Select Committee took a great
deal of evidence on that. Indeed, there has been a great deal of
concern about this issue and interest in it.</hs_Para>

it happens, it was not just the Select Committee that looked into the
issue. The Office of Fair Trading has also investigated whether ticket
touting should be stopped because it acts against the interests of the
consumer. After many months of inquiry, the Office of Fair Trading
found—this was consistent with the evidence it gave us during
our inquiry—that, on the whole, touting acts in the best
interests of the consumer, and it does so on a number of levels. In
many cases, someone who has bought a ticket for an event that they
genuinely hope to go to, but who finds that for some reason they cannot
go, will be refused a refund by those who sold them the ticket because
it is non-returnable. That person is left with a ticket—it could
be an expensive ticket—that they cannot do anything with. What
are they expected 
<?notus-xml column=383?>to do? Their only hope is what is known as the secondary market, which
is what is known colloquially as touting. Indeed, I am rather surprised
that clause 11 is entitled “Touting”. I think that
“Secondary market” would probably be a fairer

stumbles—whether intentionally or not—on to quite an
interesting point about this Bill. In many respects, this part of the
Bill has nothing to do with pedlars, because it need not be a pedlar
who is selling the tickets. The term “pedlar” has a legal
definition—it refers to someone who needs a
licence—whereas the Bill as it stands, if Lords amendment C15

stands out like a sore thumb from the rest of the Bill, whish is pretty
consistent in being about pedlars and street traders, as he rightly
says. I pay tribute to the scrutiny he has given the Bill during its
passage through this House. Clause 11 stands alone in that it can apply
to anybody. It should be an acceptable part of life—it would be
acceptable to me, as well as the Office of Fair Trading and the Select
Committee, which looked at this—for someone in Canterbury who
happened to have purchased a ticket for an event they could no longer
attend to sell their ticket on to somebody else. Once people have
bought their ticket, it is their

the ticket prohibits the purchaser from selling it on, they should be
prohibited from so doing, and if it allows the use of the secondary

interestingly, it is not made clear in the provision that that would be
the case. Many tickets state that they are not to be resold, or that
they are non-transferable. The promoter of an event could take the

the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) suggests. If what
he said were true, there would be no need for any of these provisions
on touting. Clause 11 would be redundant, because an event promoter
could simply take their grievance to the courts. However, if the courts
are not going to help, as I understand is the case at the moment,
clauses such as these need to be incorporated into Bills so that
touting can be dealt with, not because the touts are selling tickets
but because people do not like them and want them to be moved off the

people’s freedoms. People should not be prohibited from touting
per se. As the Office of Fair Trading found, touting acts largely in
the interests of consumers, and if somebody asks a price way in excess

originally adamant about the inclusion of the clause, are now satisfied
that it can be removed as their lordships wish. Earlier, I commended

Davies:</Member></B> I am—I think—grateful to my hon.
Friend. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) may have been
becoming confused, but I am beginning to think that I am becoming
confused as well. I am not aware that the extra description in
subsection (1)(b) has anything to with the fact that this is a city
council Bill, as opposed to a borough council Bill. My understanding
was that this particular difference related only to the different
natures of the places concerned. I presumed that in Reading there was
no promenade, parade or esplanade to which the Bill could apply. I
could be wrong but my hon. Friend seemed to be arguing that, in effect,
it is the same provision but there is a local difference based on the
fact that one is a city council and the other is a borough council. My
understanding, however, is that it is essentially the same, but it
reflects the different nature of the towns and cities concerned. Clause
11 of the Canterbury Bill mentions “parade”, however, and
I find it difficult to imagine that there is not a parade in Reading.
That would lead me to ask why it is so important to ban selling on a
parade in Canterbury, but not on a street in
Reading<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:40:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130206101000730" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0004.htm#130206101000730"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Chope" PimsId="2598" UID="130206101001649" xid="110" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0004.htm#130206101001649">Mr

something about the issue of causing obstructions in the previous group
of amendments. Amendment C9 has been agreed to, and we must consider
clause 11 in relation to provisions already accepted. My hon. Friend
may well be right that that amendment could make clause 11 redundant,
as we have already got the job
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:42:40"></hs_TimeCode>. I am not
entirely sure whether that is the case, but I am not a lawyer, whereas
my hon. Friend has the considerable advantage over me of being a very
distinguished lawyer, so I bow to his superior knowledge. These points

the Lords amendment under

therefore conclude my brief remarks, which took us on a quick canter
around the course on touting in general. My hon. Friend said at the end
of his speech that he was minded to accept this Lords amendment but
would reserve judgment until he had heard what I had to say. Given that
the House may choose to vote on this group of amendments, Members will
be pleased to know that, as far as I can see, it would be sensible for
the House to accept the amendment. It is a sensible amendment and it
defends people’s freedoms. I remain curious, however, as to why
it applies to Canterbury alone, and not to Reading, and I would prefer
it to apply to both, but we will just have to live with that on this
occasion. However, I advise the House to accept this Lords amendment,
as it makes the Bill much
better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:44:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

which he has approached the Bill. We should all be indebted to him for
the work he has carried out, because when we accept the final group of

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills (Jo Swinson):</Member></B> As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:45:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Shipley (Philip Davies) has just said, this Bill has been discussed
over the past six years, although this is the first contribution I have
been able to make to it. Last Thursday,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:45:46"></hs_TimeCode>the
Under-Secretary of State for Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for West
Suffolk (Matthew Hancock) was an able contributor to the debate. As he
said then, the Government do not usually seek to intervene in private
legislation and we have done so on this occasion only in order to
clarify the issues relating to the European services directive. The
Government believe, and have already said to the House, that some
aspects of the Pedlars Act 1871 are inconsistent with that directive.
We therefore launched a consultation on a change in the national law
concerning street trading, and the consultation includes a proposal to
repeal that Act. As my hon. Friend told the House on Thursday, the four
local authorities whose Bills we are discussing—in this group,
this applies to Canterbury in particular—are aware of the
consultation. The House will be interested to know that we have decided
this week to extend the consultation by a month to allow more time for
people to respond, so it will now close on 15 March. The four
authorities are aware that they may need to amend their legislation to
take account of any changes that the Government propose on street
trading. Having provided that useful information to the House, I just
say that the Government are content for the Bills to proceed and for
these Lords amendments to be made.</hs_Para>

do so against the background of the Government’s wanting to
reduce the number of MPs in Wales from 40 to 30 as part of a
broader remapping of boundaries which has, I am delighted to say,
failed in its attempt to reshape the political map, particularly in
Wales but across the country, for party political gain.
One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:09:34"></hs_TimeCode> of the key
problems with that proposal is that it would break the coterminosity in
Wales between MPs and Assembly Members. In the knowledge that they were
doing that, the Government produced a Green Paper that said, in effect,
“Don’t worry about it—we’ll reintroduce the
coterminosity as a sort of Trojan horse to bring about a 30:30
arrangement, reducing the number of democratically elected AMs,
increasing the list numbers, and changing the prospective balance of
power in the Assembly.” That was done without any consultation
or collaboration with the Assembly itself—a complete
disgrace<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:05:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130206101000931" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0004.htm#130206101000931"><Member ContinuationText="Jessica Morden" PimsId="4824" UID="130206101001824" xid="869" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0004.htm#130206101001824"><B>Jessica
Morden</B> (Newport East) (Lab):</Member> I congratulate my hon. Friend
on securing this debate. Does he think that given the Prime
Minister’s assurance to the First Minister that any changes in
Wales should have the consent of the Welsh people, it was pretty

Davies:</Member></B> I will be mild in my criticism, but I thought it
was completely disgraceful. It showed a great lack of respect for the
blossoming new democracy that we have in the nation of Wales, with a
Welsh Government doing very good things and the road of devolution
moving forwards. Where important decisions can be made locally by the
people they affect most, that is what should happen. It was very
unfortunate, to put it mildly, that the Prime Minister showed such
disrespect to the leader of the Welsh Assembly Government.</hs_Para>

other propositions in the Green Paper include the idea of a five-year
cycle for the National Assembly for Wales detached by a year from
Westminster’s five-year cycle. That might be quite sensible on
the grounds that it would be unfortunate to have both elections on the
same day because there could be confusion in Wales as a result of the
media carrying more about UK policies of the Labour party and other
parties that may differ from those in Wales. It is important in the
interests of effective democracy, and effectively communicating
democracy, that the elections do not occur in the same year, and I am
therefore minded to support the idea of moving to a five-year cycle

is about the respect agenda. I think that perhaps the idea came from

whether there was consultation on that part of the Green Paper. My
understanding is that there was no consultation on any of it. Was

the three questions I have highlighted, the most pressing is on the
length of Assembly terms. Hon. Members will be aware that, as a result
of concerns expressed by the Welsh Government during the passage of the
Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, the Assembly election scheduled for
May 2015 was deferred by one year until 2016 to avoid a clash with the
next general election. That is a good example of the UK Government
listening to the concerns raised by the Welsh Government and, to
address another point the hon. Gentleman raised, collaborating with
them. That is a one-off change. The two elections are set to coincide
again in 2020 unless provision is made to prevent
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130206101000975" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0004.htm#130206101000975">A
majority of respondents to our consultation favoured a move to
five-year terms to reduce the likelihood of elections coinciding in
future. The decision is a finely balanced one—good arguments
have been made in support of both options—but however we decide
to proceed, we are mindful that electors in Wales should be clear on
how long they are electing their representatives for. Importantly, all
four political parties in the Assembly favoured a move to five-year
terms. It is worth putting that on the
record.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130206101000976" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0004.htm#130206101000976">In
the Green Paper, the Government set out our intention to repeal the
prohibition on a candidate at an Assembly election standing in both a
constituency and a region. All three Opposition parties in the Assembly
favoured removing the ban, but I acknowledge that, overall, a small
majority favoured retaining the prohibition in their responses to the
consultation. A significant majority of respondents agreed with our

Westminster.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130206101000977" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/debtext/130206-0004.htm#130206101000977">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned competency—that issue was discussed at
length during the debate of 3 July 2012. I should point out that the
Government are simply operating within the framework that the previous
Government set out in the Government of Wales Act 2006. As
he knows, the Act states that competency and responsibility for
electoral arrangements for the Welsh Assembly resides at Westminster.
There is a Silk process—part 2 was launched recently, which
provides a great opportunity for people who have concerns and other
ideas to contribute. The Government have made it clear that we will
listen and read very carefully all submissions to Silk part 2. We will
announce our response in due course. The hon. Gentleman was not in the

appropriate, the fact that 16.4 million people live within 50 miles of

will start with the modest aspirations. SARPA, the
Shrewsbury-Aberystwyth Rail Passengers Association, has called for the
improved utilisation of rolling stock resources, which could bring
improvements to the service at minimal increased cost. Dealing with
commuter trains in and out of Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth would be a
good start. For example, at Shrewsbury, there is an early arrival from
Aberystwyth at 7.11 am, but the next train arrives at 9.25 am, which
does not make sense for the many people who need to get to work or
college by 9 am. There is a lot of demand for travel to and
from Shrewsbury for job opportunities, further education and medical
services that are not readily available in mid-Wales, but the current
timetable does not serve that demand effectively.

Welsh and UK Departments because the Minister convinced me of that when

proposed service would have continued through Banbury, West Ruislip and

people I talk to have a wrong perception that HS2 will directly affect

we get the electrification that we all want in north Wales, it will
have a positive effect on travel. I am dispelling a perception in my
constituency that, somehow, we might step off a slow Arriva Trains
Wales train somewhere in Birmingham and hop on to a fast train and head
off down to London with 40 minutes taken off our journey. Of course,
that is not the reality, which leads me to question the benefits that
will accrue to large parts of Wales.

Morden</B> (Newport East) (Lab):</Member> Well done to the hon. Member
for Ceredigion (Mr Williams) for securing this debate. I am sorry that
I was unable to be on his marathon six-hour train journey, but he has
made a persuasive case for mid-Wales, and I am sure the Minister is
listening. I also thank him for giving us an opportunity to lobby on
other transport matters. As a south Wales MP, I will address the Severn
bridge tolls and rail, which he has already
mentioned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T09:53:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020665000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0001.htm#13020665000048">The
Severn bridge tolls are a thorny issue. A Wales Office Minister
recently told me that reports commissioned on the impact of the tolls
on Wales gave a mixed picture. He may well say that, but constituents
and businesses tell me loud and clear how hard they find absorbing the
increased tolls each year when their pay is frozen, their hours are
reduced and the cost of living is rising. I am aware of their misery,
because it is a major local issue about which I am contacted as an
MP<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T09:53:43"></hs_TimeCode>. Businesses,
particularly those in the haulage industry, say the tolls mean they
bear a cost that competitors across the bridge do not and that they
have to add that cost to their bottom line, which hits their
competitiveness. A Welsh Assembly study, about which the Minister may
be aware, shows that scrapping the tolls altogether would improve the
economic output of south Wales by some £107
million<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T09:54:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020665000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0001.htm#13020665000049">For
many, the light at the end of the tunnel is the end of the concession
in a few years’ time. I say a few years’ time, because
every time someone ventures to say the concession will end on a certain
date, the duration of the concession lengthens, which is worrying to
say the least. That is mild: I think the concession is becoming a
farce. In 2005, the concession would end in 2016; last year, it was
2017; and it now appears to be shifting to the end of 2018. Will the
Minister confirm his current
estimate<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020665000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0001.htm#13020665000050">The
first reason given for extending the concession was reduced traffic due
to the downturn; then it was the cost of installing the card-handling
system, then industrial building allowances and then higher VAT. Now,
because the concession may well extend beyond 2018 into 2020, we have
the mystery debt from the construction of the bridges, about which
another Minister wrote to the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs and
which might push the date further into the future. The announcement in
December obtained by the Chair of the Welsh Affairs Committee,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T09:55:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Monmouth (David  T. C. Davies), was news to all of us on
the Committee. The information was never mentioned in our recently
completed inquiry. Will the Minister explain how the debt came about
and why we were never told of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T09:55:36"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

highlights the problem with the concession. I note that Ministers have
recently been using the Severn bridge concession as an example of why
private companies’ investing to improve our
roads, with motorists paying tolls, is a good idea. I have heard
Ministers say on the radio and on television that there are tolls on
the M6. Well, I think that the Severn bridge concession is a terrible
example. The concession, fixed by law years ago, allows the company to
whack up the tolls every year until it reaches its target. The toll is
completely inflexible, as we saw when there were calls to accept debit
and credit card payments. Help for regular users, off-peak travel for
businesses and the ability for car sharers to share the tab are all too
difficult for the concessionaires who just care about getting the
revenue. Calls from customers for any sort of flexibility fall on deaf
ears, and the motorist yet again gets stung, with no protection when
times are hard, as they are
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T09:56:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020665000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0001.htm#13020665000052">We
need something to look forward to when the concession ends. There is a
niggling fear that the Treasury sees the bridges as a useful revenue
stream after 2017, 2018 or 2019, or whenever the concession ends, and
is looking to bank in advance the anticipated revenue from the bridge
tolls. Will the Minister please tell me that is not the

Obviously, the Welsh Assembly has expressed an interest in running the

successful campaign to bring back many of the services that that

Trains Wales eliminated a service at Severn Tunnel Junction that
connected to the First Great Western service and that STAG had
negotiated and won back only six months earlier. The replacement Arriva
cross-country service leaves Severn Tunnel Junction just minutes before
the First Great Western service arrives, so passengers must wait hours
for connecting trains, as

the Member for Ceredigion (Mr Williams) on securing this debate on a
matter that is of huge interest to me and has been for most of my adult
life. I want to address specifically how we deal with cross-border
links in a devolved United Kingdom. It is not just because my
constituency is Montgomeryshire; I worked for a long time to develop
the economy in mid-Wales with
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T10:01:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams), and one part of
the strategy that we always knew was important was transport links. It
was much more important for mid-Wales to have a link out than it is for
England to have a link in, which lies at the root of the
problem.</hs_Para>

to talk about road links, particularly two specific ones, but as my
hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion mentioned rail links, I should
say how important they are as well. When we discussed the
Aberystwyth-Euston link, it was part of an initiative that we in
mid-Wales developed. We got every organisation there to come together
in a partnership and invest in the Cambrian line, because it was so
important to us. Although we have lost the Aber link, we hope that the
Shrewsbury-Euston link will be restored soon. I hope that the Minister
will reconfirm the position on that; we have been left feeling
optimistic about it.</hs_Para>

service that we all desperately want is now in the lap of the National
Assembly for Wales. The investment in the line has been made; it now
just needs extra investment in the infrastructure—the trains and
the cost of the line. I am hopeful that it will happen at some stage.
It has been delayed, because there is cost pressure on all forms of
Government, including the Welsh Government, but I am hopeful that it
will happen before too long.</hs_Para>

Shrewsbury-Euston line is important. Clearly, we would like the line to
go to Aberystwyth, but the Shrewsbury line is key because Shrewsbury is
so accessible to us. If we were confident in that line, there would be
investment in car parking. Particularly as the prison in Shrewsbury is
closing, I can see opportunities for that station to become a key
station for mid-Wales, but the link to Euston is important. The newly
renegotiated Virgin contract may deliver that.</hs_Para>

are hugely important to us in mid-Wales, and there are two that I want
to speak about. One is called the Middletown bypass; it is actually the
connection between Welshpool and the improved road to Shrewsbury. I am
talking about half the length of that road. The same principle applies

I was involved in developing the economy in mid-Wales in the late 1980s
and early 1990s, the bypass was a key part, and we thought we had
secured it. Then an Act was introduced relating to protecting the
badger population, and it was suddenly found that the agreed line,
which would almost certainly have gone ahead, ran through a badger
sett, which delayed things at a key time in the early 1990s. The
Government then, like the current Government, needed to cut
expenditure, and there was a bit of a fashion to be anti-roads. At that
stage, the scheme slipped back and back, although it has been
resurrected since then.</hs_Para>

Government are enthusiastic to proceed with their part of the scheme,
and would make the commitment. I do not know the exact figures, but the
road scheme would probably cost about £30 million. The Welsh
Government would commit about £25 million, and the Highways
Agency over the border would commit about £5 million. The Welsh
Government want to do it, but the Highways Agency has no priority
whatever to come into Wales. There is no economic benefit, and any
cost-benefit analysis will give it no priority, so the scheme cannot go
ahead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020665000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0001.htm#13020665000069">As
a consequence of devolution, cross-border schemes —not
just in mid-Wales; I think that there are four or five—have
simply been put on the back burner, and there is no prospect that they
will ever proceed. That is a massive blow to mid-Wales, because we need
that road out. Anybody who has travelled from Welshpool to Wollaston
Cross knows that it is the most appalling road. Drivers settle in to
travel at 30 or 40 mph, because that is the way it is; they get stuck
behind lorries they cannot overtake. That is not acceptable. The whole
economy depends on
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020665000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0001.htm#13020665000070">We
need the Government at Westminster to recognise that it is not just the
cost-benefit analysis for the west midlands that counts; Westminster
must consider the impact in Wales. That applies to every single
devolved service. If we do not consider the impact on
Wales,  
<?notus-xml column=83?>although we do not have a direct responsibility, the post-devolution

same issue applies to the Llanymynech-Pant bypass. That scheme is
further down the pecking order, but it has been seriously considered in
the past. The bulk of that scheme is in England, so I can see why the
issue will be much more difficult to resolve. Again, the west midlands
body will consider that scheme, as it has done, and put it right down
the list. There is a big local campaign—I have been to public
meetings—because anyone who travels through Pant and Llanymynech
can see that it is not a modern highway. It attaches to the road to
Manchester and Liverpool and the north of England, which is crucial to
the economy. It is not good enough.</hs_Para>

negatively in terms of cross-border roads. We must address that, not

devolution to work. We want a country whose governance operates well
and efficiently, so that we can feel comfortable with it, but in
mid-Wales—certainly among those who depend on its economy or are
trying to create jobs there—we are furious. It is one of the
biggest negatives about devolution that could possibly be created, and
I think it will get worse. I hope that the Minister has heard the

tables for deprivation. Having said that, in recent years, we have
received investment in major transport projects that have made our
valleys communities much more accessible. For example, considerable
progress has been made in dualling the A465 to improve regional and
national connectivity. The Tredegar to Merthyr section of the A465 is
terrific, and the Cwm bypass is a big success as well. In recent years,
the hourly train service from Ebbw Vale to Cardiff has been a stellar

a two-week period during the Easter holidays, we surveyed 350
passengers and gained in-depth knowledge of their concerns and ideas

electrification. I welcome the Government’s confirmation last

trunk roads are the busiest in my constituency and are managed by the
Welsh Assembly Government through a partnership between Powys and
Ceredigion county councils, but they still require an input and funding
from the English Highways Agency, to maximise the benefits of any
improvements that are to be made. That can be a problem, as I have
highlighted before with my Assembly colleague, Kirsty Williams, because
priorities in England are continually focused on the larger
conurbations. Consequently, priorities do not match up and inputs and
funding are inadequate to make changes that are essential for road
safety and making general improvements to our economic
development.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020665000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0001.htm#13020665000086">The
A483 Pant to Llanymynech bypass scheme was considered by the West
Midlands Regional Transport Board as part of the regional
prioritisation in 2006, in which the region considered the relative
priority of major schemes in the region. The board advised that this
scheme was a low priority due to its low cost-benefit score and the
modest contributions it was thought to make towards economic
development and housing in the area. Following the decision of the West
Midlands Regional Transport Board in 2006, the scheme was reviewed to
assess whether its cost could be reduced while maintaining a
substantial proportion of its benefits. However, due to the
route’s not being deemed a priority, that study concluded that
possible small-scale solutions along the route would still offer poor
value for money. Consequently, the Highways Agency was instructed by
the Minister to stop developing the scheme altogether and that it could
be revisited in future only if the West Midlands Regional Transport
Board decided that it was a priority.
Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T10:16:55"></hs_TimeCode>, in May

I am delighted that Network Rail’s 10-year, £1 billion
modernisation plan for Wales’s somewhat antiquated line is about
to take place, and the £220 million electrification
of the valleys line will bring a lot of benefit, but we need to make a
start on the electrification of the London to Cardiff line, which will
also reduce journey times to Swansea. I am pleased to see the inclusion
of a scheme to re-signal the critical Marches route between Newport and
Shrewsbury, which will provide train companies with the ability to run
more frequent and faster trains between north and south Wales, serving
a number of my

am by no means calling for a reversal of Dr Beeching’s axe of
1963, but the reshaping of the rail network in Wales will still leave
large towns in my constituency, such as Brecon and Ystradgynlais,

rail electrification for north Wales is an important, long-standing
issue, and, to give the Government some credit, the Secretary of State
for Wales is looking at it. My colleague, Carl Sargeant, who represents
Alyn and Deeside in the Assembly and who the
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T10:25:14"></hs_TimeCode> knows
well from previous travel to the area, is now the Welsh Assembly
Transport Minister. He is developing a business case for the
electrification of the north Wales main railway line. It will be a
robust case that emphasises the social, economic and public benefits. I
want the Minister to place on record where the Government are on the
business case for electrification. What is the time scale? What
co-operation and discussions are there with the Welsh Assembly on the
electrification business case? How can we start to put it on the table
as part of the wider discussions of rail development in north
Wales?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020665000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0001.htm#13020665000098">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T10:23:37"></hs_TimeCode>

we have improved the rail service to north Wales, but we still need to
develop electrification to bring tourists and business to north Wales,
and to ensure that we have a better, more environmentally friendly rail

how does rail electrification fit with High Speed 2? I want to place on
the record my support for HS2, which will bring speedier links to the
north as a whole—north-west and north-east. In particular, I
want to hear the Minister’s view on how to ensure connectivity
at Crewe. He is planning, as part of HS2, a development at Crewe, which
will be a major hub for north-west England and will improve links to
Manchester airport. I put it to him that there is also potential to
improve links to north Wales, speeding the traffic there and providing
north Wales with a speedier link to Manchester airport, our nearest
major airport hub. That needs to be looked at as part of the long-term
development of HS2. I would welcome some genuine engagement with the

easily drive to Liverpool on dual carriageway, but there is no
connectivity by rail. The pressure put on previous Governments, and
indeed on this Government, to improve the Wrexham to Bidston line, so
that my part of Wales can have connectivity, is extremely significant.
I hope he responds to that point in his winding-up speech, because
connectivity is important to economics, jobs and our ability to attract

London to Cardiff, which is 150 miles, and a further two hours to
travel the 50 miles from Cardiff to Llanelli. The main reason for that
is the change at Swansea station, which is a lot pleasanter now because

the rail industry, we had more through trains. At the time, I described
it as “the thin end of the wedge”, as we contracted that
service, including the regular service down to the ferry ports in
far-west Wales. It is not a joke when you are travelling there. It is
very picturesque, lovely, and it is great to be on the train enjoying
yourself, but it is a long haul, wearisome and sometimes very
frustrating for people. I do not want them to be left with that
impression of Wales. I want them to have the impression of Wales as a
modern country with a modern infrastructure, so that they will want to
come back.</hs_Para>

is an important debate, as has been said. Transport links and
connectivity are not only a lifeline, but vital for business
investment, thereby improving employment prospects and reducing
poverty.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T10:40:55"></hs_TimeCode>Historically,
Wales has suffered from under-investment, leading to congested road and
rail links between England and Wales. It is suffering from very high
tolls levied on the Severn bridge on passengers travelling into Wales
only, and it continues to suffer from disputes over responsibility and
fragmentation and more distant relationships between Welsh local
authorities and Whitehall than with the Welsh Government.</hs_Para>

are still the main link between England and Wales, but there is heavy
congestion. The M4, which is the main route, is still inadequate at key
points, and it runs close to capacity, with traffic volumes expected to
grow. For example, around Newport, as I am sure
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T10:41:39"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Newport East (Jessica Morden) knows, there are concerns
about capacity, safety and resilience at peak periods. That is not the 
<?notus-xml column=92?>only area by any means, and I welcome the Welsh Assembly consultation on
measures to tackle the shortcomings, and I await with interest the
outcome of its appraisal of possible solutions.</hs_Para>

for Montgomeryshire (Glyn Davies) and for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger

important link, but improvements to the road have only been made on the
English side, so the good road stops at Wales. Co-ordination is needed
on those important issues.</hs_Para>

turn to the Severn bridge, which
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T10:42:30"></hs_TimeCode>my hon. Friend
the Member for Newport East mentioned so ably. It is a vital link, but
the toll has been increased above inflation to £6.20, and it
only applies to traffic entering Wales. Business groups have long said
that that is a barrier to much-needed investment in businesses in
Wales. What are the Government’s proposals to remedy the
situation and what options are they considering when ownership of the
bridge returns to the UK Government? I support my hon. Friend in
wanting certainty over when that will be. I believed that that would
happen in 2018.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire spoke about buses, which are a
lifeline for many people, particularly pensioners, but the two national
concessionary bus passes are not valid for pensioners who wish to cross
the border from either side. They are left to rely on voluntary schemes
provided by local authorities. There is also a lack of awareness about
the convenience of bus routes into Wales from Bristol, despite the fact
that they have a competitive price, due to exemption from tolls. Will
the Minister say what is being done to address both those issues and
how he will promote cross-border bus
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T10:44:31"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020665000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0001.htm#13020665000135">I
turn to rail, where there are significant challenges, as we have heard,
around capacity and infrastructure. I am pleased that the Labour
Administration in Wales is exploring not-for-profit models, including
the co-operative mutual model, when the Wales and Border franchise,
currently operated by Arriva Trains Wales, expires in 2018. I hope that
that will prove a pathfinder for England.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T10:45:01"></hs_TimeCode> major
electrification project for the Great Western railway line to Swansea
was introduced by the previous Labour Government, but put on hold by
the coalition. Despite that delay on the Government line—perhaps
it was caused by the weather, perhaps by leaves—that has now
been reconfirmed, and the journey time from Paddington to Swansea could
be reduced by 20 minutes. However, will the Minister say why the work
is to start in London and not in
Wales<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T10:45:23"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

heard many times, closer co-operation between train companies is vital
if they are to be financially viable. What is the Minister doing to
promote that? Inter-franchise connectivity is a key component, as has
been mentioned, and it is certainly not helpful to have companies such
as Wrexham and Shropshire, which ran the cross-border services between
2008 and 2011, withdraw, as they were not allowed to stop at Virgin-run
stations. It is important that franchises co-operate with each other to
ensure that journeys are made with the minimum disruption and that they
do not have to go through convenient stations, simply because they are
operated by another franchise holder.</hs_Para>

and unfair to the rest of society, because everyone else has to pay
more in taxes to make up for those who do not pay their fair share. We

interest in tackling tax avoidance stems from a meeting I had with
Christian Aid supporters in my constituency last September, when the
“tax justice” bus visited Stevenage. The tax justice
campaigners believe that tax dodging by international companies costs
the UK about £35 billion and developing countries an estimated
$160 billion a year. Many of the FTSE 100 companies that replied to me
questioned the figures, but, in reality, the figures are large,
irrespective of the measure used.

missing billions in tax is not just a problem for the UK; it is

that they have a responsibility to their shareholders, but
shareholders, to push up their returns, are interested only in the
overall amount of tax that they have to pay globally. In their
responses, some companies claimed that their overall tax rate is more
than 45%, while others claim that it is about 25% to 28%. Although they

to strengthening capacity building is ensuring that information is

transparency agenda, and the tax information exchange in particular, is
a key tool in tackling offshore tax evasion, and we are actively

direction in increasing tax transparency and the exchange of tax

ensuring that jurisdictions meet the international standard on tax

mutual administrative assistance to more jurisdictions, we are
providing a mechanism to access the benefits of tax transparency, which
is particularly suited to developing countries. Furthermore, our direct

greater extractives transparency through the accounting directive,
which addresses civil society accountability without imposing
unnecessary burdens on business. Not only do we support EU proposals to
improve transparency in the extractives and forestry sectors, but we

want to address my hon. Friend’s concerns about
country-by-country reporting, which is a somewhat broader approach than
the one that we have been taking on extractives and forestry. The
country-by-country reporting model is currently being considered in the
proposed amendments to the EU accounting and transparency directives.
The UK supports EU requirements for extractives companies to ensure
that they disclose the payments that they make to Governments—as
I said, corruption is a particular concern in this sector—and
that proposal will have an immediate impact on reducing potential
corruption by allowing citizens of resource-rich countries to hold
their Governments to account for their use of the extractives revenue
received. However, we are not yet convinced of the merits of the wider
model of country-by-country reporting proposed by some and neither is
the OECD. We do not believe that the case has been made in terms of the
costs and benefits of extending the proposals for EU mandatory
requirements to report payments to Governments beyond the extractives
sector and forestry. We will of course keep the matter 
<?notus-xml column=104?>under review, and it will be interesting to see how  the

profit shifting, there are international concerns over whether the
current international tax rules manage properly to capture the profits
generated by multinational companies. It is an issue that all countries
face, and we need to work together to develop the appropriate
solutions. As with most major economies, the tax system in the UK is
based on the internationally agreed OECD guidelines that mean that a
multinational company pays corporation tax where it carries out the
economic activity that generates its profits and not on its sales. We
have already reaffirmed our support for the OECD work to address profit
shifting by multinationals and erosion of the corporate tax base at the
global level. At the G20 meeting of Finance Ministers last November,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer issued a joint statement with his
German equivalent calling for concerted international co-operation to
strengthen international tax standards as a first step to promoting a
better way of dealing with profit shifting and base erosion of
corporate tax at the global level. To back that up, the UK, alongside
France and Germany, has offered additional resources to the OECD to
speed up progress. We will hear of that progress at the G20 meeting

hon. Friend asked specifically what we are doing in the UK on the
matter. The problem is essentially international, because the UK
complies with the OECD rules, as do all other major economies. We are,
however, strengthening HMRC’s capacity in the area. In the
autumn statement last year, additional funding for HMRC was announced,
much of which is to be focused on strengthening the transfer pricing
capacity of HMRC, challenging multinationals to ensure that their
arrangements are compliant with the rules that currently exist, and
ensuring that tax is paid in the jurisdiction where economic activity
occurs. I do not want to be drawn into individual cases, but it is
clearly not acceptable for multinationals artificially to inflate the
costs apparently incurred in a low-tax jurisdiction, resulting in tax
not being paid on profits that should, in truth, be attributed to other
jurisdictions. We are determined to give HMRC the capacity to deal with
that. It is worth pointing out that HMRC’s activity on transfer
pricing over the past four years, for example, has brought in some
£4.1 billion. Last month, I visited one of the transfer pricing
teams in HMRC and we should recognise the good work that is being done,
but we want to build on that, which is why we are strengthening
HMRC’s capability in this area, which my hon. Friend will

Met was rightly praised for its work during the Olympics and the
diamond jubilee last year, but its less high-profile work—the
bread and butter of policing work, through its contribution to keeping
our communities safe, pursuing criminals and supporting
victims—remains fundamental, and the overwhelming majority of
its officers do that with considerable skill and dedication.</hs_Para>

the future of policing in London is under scrutiny, and with good
reason. Under the stewardship of the Mayor of London and the
Conservative party, the Metropolitan police have already seen a drop of
more than 4,000 uniformed police—police constables and police
community support officers—on London’s streets since the
general election, a period in which all Members will acknowledge that
there were major riots and growing concern about gang violence. To take
just one borough—my own borough of Harrow—we lost 100 PCs
and PCSOs, a cut in front-line uniformed police officers of 19%, which
is one of the biggest cuts.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T14:31:44"></hs_TimeCode>A cut of almost
20% in the Government’s grant to the Metropolitan police, which
was supported by the Mayor and Conservative Members, is the driving
factor behind the cuts to police funding that are now being debated
across London.</hs_Para>

a choice of statistics that the characters in “The Thick of
It” would have been proud of, the Mayor’s plan promises
more police recruitment. However, the truth is that there will be fewer
police officers and fewer PCSOs by 2015, and that police officers are
likely to be significantly less experienced than
now.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T14:32:24"></hs_TimeCode> That drop
in police numbers is noteworthy of itself, but comparing the number and
percentage of crimes solved reveals that the Metropolitan police saw in
2011-12 a sharp drop in the number, and crucially in the percentage, of
crimes being solved. In 2011-12, 22,600 fewer crimes were solved in
London than in 2009-10, and the percentage of crimes solved dropped to
21.6%.</hs_Para>

figures are perhaps not surprising when cuts to the number of
prosecutors available to the Crown Prosecution Service in London are

the Mayor of London explain how they think that the number and

even fewer

to the figures that the Mayor of London has published, two thirds of
London boroughs will still have fewer police officers by the end of
2015 than they

of PCSOs per borough have not been published, but with further
substantial cuts to PCSO recruitment—some 1,100 will be cut by
2015-16, according to the Greater London assembly’s police and
crime committee—it looks as though every borough will have
significantly fewer uniformed police officers in total patrolling their

people think that PCSOs are an expensive waste of time. I am not one of
them, certainly not after I saw the difference that two PCSOs made to
stopping trouble outside the gates of one of my major secondary
schools. The head teacher said that he and members of his senior team
went from being called out to deal with an incident at school closing
time four afternoons out of every five to just twice in three months,
after PCSOs were stationed outside those gates for the 30 minutes from
the end of lessons. So PCSOs do a vital job, offering a direct
reassuring presence to the public, helping to build the confidence that
is necessary to gain intelligence,

across London.</hs_Para>

2015. Some estimates suggest that 1,300 sergeants will be axed.
Inspectors and chief inspectors are also going, and
superintendents’ numbers are likewise being cut. In short, the
positions occupied by experienced police officers are being axed. The
Mayor’s plan describes those positions as “supervisory
grades”. In truth, those roles, and crucially the experience and
skill mix of the senior staff occupying them, are fundamental to the
effective pursuit of the criminal, the passage of the accused through
the legal process and the sensitive support of the

who are new to the service? I have noticed in my own constituency the
difference that that coaching and support has made, particularly in
areas of Feltham and Heston that suffered a large number of burglaries
before Christmas. The advice that those more experienced officers was

vital.</hs_Para>

Thomas:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point
about the value that experienced police officers bring to the coaching
of new recruits. It is worth noting in passing that the Mayor’s
plan envisages specialist crime squads at borough level—such as
local 
<?notus-xml column=107?>burglary, town centre or robbery squads—essentially being raided
for staff, who will then be redeployed. So we sense that, as my hon.
Friend suggests, a huge amount of vital experience is set to be lost to
the Met when it is still

would be good to hear from the Minister what discussions he has had
with the Mayor and the Association of Chief Police Officers staff in
the Metropolitan police about how the impact of the cuts that I have
described will also impact on national efforts to confront organised
crime, or how cuts in the positions occupied by experienced police
officers and the movement of staff from specialist units will impact,
for example, on the work of Operation Trident. It certainly prompts the
question how cuts in the Met will impact on its ability to support the

illegal

borough. He has not said anything about the changes in the draft crime

However, looking at the figures between March 2010 and April 2012, I
see that Croydon lost 175 PCSOs and police officers, and it experienced
the same percentage cut in police numbers—a cut of 19%—as
Harrow did<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T14:38:11"></hs_TimeCode>.
Moreover, the figures for 2010—just in terms of police officers
for Croydon—compared with the figures for 2015 suggest that
there will be a net increase of just one police officer in Croydon. Add
in the likelihood of further significant cuts to the number of PCSOs,
in the way that I have described, and I suspect that the reality of
police numbers in Croydon will be a significant
fall.</hs_Para>

wards, will go from having 28 uniformed police officers dedicated to
those communities to just eight. Perhaps we should not be surprised.

In an FOI request, I asked for the proportion of safer neighbourhood

answer was just 20%. Response teams were, of course, available, but I
was surprised by how low the figure was. We need to be cautious with
such figures because they offer a one-off snapshot, but that underlines

right hon. Friend just mentioned my own excellent borough commander. He
was one of the Met’s few senior Muslim officers before he

the House of the ongoing need for, in his words, “radical
measures” to boost ethnic minority recruitment into the Met,
into its specialist units—for example, firearms and the criminal
investigation department—and, crucially, into its senior ranks.
During his time in the Metropolitan police, Dal Babu helped repeatedly
to challenge discrimination and bias. Just one example of his work is a
pilot mentoring scheme for talented senior officers. Surprisingly,
however, ACPO rejected the idea of rolling the programme out more
widely, to encourage more black and ethnic minority officers in middle
and senior-ranking posts to be ready for higher
commands<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T14:46:45"></hs_TimeCode>. As
Chief Superintendent Babu points out, there is a significant gap
between our collective ambitions for a representative police force in
our city and the reality. It would be useful to hear the Minister
underline publicly what I believe is a cross-party view, that the
senior ranks of the Met need to be much more representative of the

recently, the Mayor of London announced plans to close some 65 police
stations and sell them off. In my borough, Pinner police station and
the front counter at the civic centre are set for closure, although I
understand that there is now a question whether Pinner will be closed
after all. Given that the civic centre front counter has long been
manned by volunteers, I would be surprised if much in the way of
revenue savings would be generated. What is striking, though, is the
scale of the cuts to police stations in some parts of London. Croydon
will lose five of its six stations. Barking and Dagenham will lose
three of its four. Havering will lose four of its five, and Waltham
Forest is set to lose four of its five. I understand that the police
station in Tottenham—a visible signal of reassurance to a
community devastated by the riots—is set for closure, too. What
is far from clear are the rationale and criteria for each closure,
particularly when the deputy Mayor has promised that, where a
face-to-face service closes, it will be replaced with another such
service. I ask gently, as the Minister can perhaps throw some light on
this: how much money will be saved by that scale of closure, given that
promise of replacement face-to-face
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T14:48:23"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020665000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0001.htm#13020665000239">The
Mayor’s plans create uncertainty about not just police stations;
there has been a sharp reduction in the number of police cars available
to the Metropolitan police. The car is a fairly fundamental bit of
equipment for police work. According to information obtained through
freedom of information requests, almost 200 police response vehicles
were axed across London in the first two years of this
Government—a 16% drop. I am not sure why the Mayor thought that
it would be a good idea to cut by almost a third the number of unmarked
and marked police cars in Haringey, which was a flashpoint of the 2011
riots.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020665000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0001.htm#13020665000240">Gang<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T14:49:37"></hs_TimeCode>

considering the challenges that it faces. Given the sheer expanse of

police service and in policing technology; it is a testament to the
previous Labour Government, who revolutionised neighbourhood policing.
The resulting model for the Met that the previous Mayor and Government
bequeathed to their current Tory masters was defined by three
principles. The first principle was strength in numbers. The number of
officers available to the Metropolitan police broke the
33,000 barrier, complemented by 4,000 police community
support officers and 4,000 special
constables<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T14:53:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020681000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0001.htm#13020681000007">The
second principle is a relentless focus on the local and the very local.
Community relations were forged on the ground, not just over the
airwaves. New sergeants and their teams were embedded in neighbourhoods
and communities, ensuring that they knew not only the faces of people
serving the community, but their first names and
addresses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020681000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0001.htm#13020681000008">The
third principle was an inescapable presence. The Metropolitan police
had a permanent and visible presence in every neighbourhood in the
capital. Whether it was an expensive or expansive police station or a
local shop front, Londoners knew where to find their police on the high
street, and residents and businesses felt safer for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T14:54:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020681000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0001.htm#13020681000009">As
my hon. Friend has outlined so well, that model is now under threat.
Those pillars are slowly being kicked away by the swingeing axe that
this Government and their Mayor have taken to budgets. Where they have
not 
<?notus-xml column=112?>entirely demolished community faith in policing—I shall come to

the Member for Harrow West (Mr Thomas) on initiating this debate and
rightly drawing our attention to some of the ways in which  the
debate on police numbers has been presented by the Mayor’s
office. He is completely right, as he pointed out in his intervention,
that the presentation showing one additional police officer in
Westminster does not tell us the whole truth, and that we are down by
202 police officers since 2010. He is also completely correct 
to draw our attention to the changes in the safer 
<?notus-xml column=115?>neighbourhoods structure, which I think will seriously dilute the
connection between safer neighbourhoods teams and their local ward
areas. Local leadership of safer neighbourhoods teams is what has made
them so important and successful over the past seven or eight years,

changed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020681000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0002.htm#13020681000032">Although
the debate has been framed generally around numbers and premises, one
important thing that we can all agree on is that what really matters is
how the police demonstrate their presence in a community. It is
presence that is significant, not necessarily the bricks and mortar in
which police are housed. Police must be visible and accessible, and
visibility is not the same as audibility. Communities want to know that
their police are present, and not simply as a siren in the
street.</hs_Para>

fact that, under the new proposals, more police officers will be moved
into the safer neighbourhoods pool of police, albeit in larger local
units, but that brings us back to police premises. It is all very well
for the Mayor to make the case that there are 65 stations and counters
with a low footfall for reporting crime, and that they can be closed
without an effect on the community, but we all know that where police
work from matters in terms of how they are perceived by the community.
The withdrawal of police stations, particularly from areas of
deprivation such as the Harrow Road police station in my constituency,
will matter if we are not given a clear indication of the criteria,
budget and structure for the alternative way in which police will
operate.</hs_Para>

consultation has put the cart before the horse. We have been asked to
make our comments on police station closures without having had any
clear indication of what will replace them or, above all, where the

about police presence but to the close relationships between police and
their local communities.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field) is
completely right that one important example is the relationship between

improving that relationship. It is always difficult, but it has
improved, and overall progress has been made on stop-and-search, which
lies at the heart of a lot of the tensions. It is therefore worrying
that young people have come to me who have undergone strip searches for
cannabis possession under the new enforcement regime. It seems to me

neighbourhoods teams have been well documented by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:09:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Harrow West. Safer neighbourhoods teams were piloted in
the Shadwell ward in my constituency before being rolled out to the
rest of Tower Hamlets, the rest of London and then across the country,
so we have seen the value of them for probably longer than anyone. The
evidence in Tower Hamlets is that, for the six years after their
introduction, there was a year-on-year reduction in crime. For the past
two years, however, there has been an increase. There is therefore real
concern about police presence, police visibility, safer neighbourhoods
teams and access to police stations.</hs_Para>

second issue I want to raise is the future of the Wapping marine
policing unit. It is based in the country’s oldest police
station, and it was founded because of the docks in east London. That
was before Peelers were introduced and walked the streets of this great
capital city. It has been suggested that there will be a 40% reduction
in staff, with the loss of night patrols. When I was a Transport
Minister, one of the big security issues was the Thames. The attack in
Mumbai, which came from the sea, adequately demonstrated the risk of
sea-borne attacks. During the Olympics, HMS Ocean was based on the
Thames at Greenwich to support marine units. That demonstrated that the
risk was still there.</hs_Para>

problem for the Minister is that the Mayor of London’s police
and crime plan—MOPAC—does not mention the River Thames or
what will happen to Wapping. The Home Office has ring-fenced funding
for the counter-terrorism unit and SO15, and, given the
counter-terrorism role the Wapping unit performs, this is partly a Home
Office matter. The question for the Minister, therefore, is whether
staff numbers at the marine policing unit will be cut by
40%. That is what is rumoured, but we have no details. Will that result
in there being no night-time patrols at all, which is the word that has
been put out on the river? Where will the metropolitan marine policing
unit be based when Wapping police station closes? Where will the museum
of river police be relocated when the station closes?</hs_Para>

of those matters are for the Home Office and some are clearly for the

I want to put on record my thanks to  the Met for the
extraordinary job it did during the Olympics. I particularly want to
reference the two borough commanders in my area—Matt Bell in
Lambeth and John Sutherland in Southwark. They do their job every
single day of the week, and they would never complain. However, we must
reflect the hollowness of MOPAC’s stated ambition of doing more
with less. We know that the resources available to our communities are
stretched almost to breaking point.</hs_Para>

numbers, despite the commitments made in the heat and passion of the

counter closures, I remind Members that the Mayor promised that no
front counter would be closed without a new, improved facility being

is enormous concern about abstractions on the part of the two borough

Abstractions—the arbitrary withdrawal of police staff to deal
with issues elsewhere—are unpredictable and unplanned, but
absolutely required. Having reviewed the level of abstractions, I am
concerned about the frequency with which police constables are
abstracted from our safer neighbourhoods teams, diminishing
teams’ powers of arrest and enforcement.</hs_Para>

London. I hope the Minister is listening and will reaffirm that in his

first issue I want to raise is diversity. My hon. Friend was right to
highlight the fact that the Metropolitan police, especially at senior
levels, does not look like London, and that is not acceptable. Peter
Fahy, the chief constable of Manchester, suggested that the police
service adopt positive action to get a broader range of officers into
the ranks of chief constable. Whatever method is adopted, the situation
must change. For the six years I have been Chairman of the Select
Committee, senior officers have said they must do more, but that is not
enough. Given the population in London, it is vital that the police
should change at the highest levels.</hs_Para>

I support what the Government are doing to restructure the landscape of
policing, although they must carry the work force with them. That is
not happening at the moment, and it is certainly not happening in the
Met. I would like to hear very clearly where the counter-terrorism
command will rest. Will it go to the National Crime Agency or will it
stay with the Met? Judging from the speeches we have heard so far,
there are a lot of bread-and-butter issues the Met should be
concentrating on. I would like to hear from the Minister whether that
decision has been
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:17:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020681000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0002.htm#13020681000054">Finally,
we are all concerned by the number of historical
investigations—Yewtree, Alice, Elvenden and
Tuleta—occurring at the moment. Yesterday, we heard that
Operation Hearn, which has cost £1.2 million and which has 20 or
so officers working on it, has still not concluded.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:17:47"></hs_TimeCode>At this time, it
is important that the Met is given the resources it needs—not
from its agreed budget, but additional resources—to deal with
some of these cases. In that way, we can deal with issues such as the
one that was raised with the Committee only yesterday: undercover
agents’ use of the identities of dead children in performing
their activities. That is quite wrong, and it is important that the
families are notified immediately. When Pat Gallan gave evidence to us,
she said the issue had to be investigated thoroughly. I urge the
Minister to give the Metropolitan police the resources it needs to
conclude these
inquiries.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_06_PT_1/CFD788DEBE8A535E934B5D2A86C75588CAB50976" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="6 February 2013">Wednesday

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:19:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick) said, police
numbers have gone down and crime has gone up over the same period, and
that is also true in my constituency. There are now 163 fewer uniformed
officers in Tower Hamlets than when the Government came to power in
2010. Over the 
<?notus-xml column=119?>same period, crime has gone up by a dramatic 9% in Tower Hamlets. That
contrasts with six successive years of crime reduction in the borough
under the previous Government. When I raised that issue with the Home
Secretary during Home Office questions on 7 January, as reported in
column 14 of <I>Hansard</I>, she said that the Metropolitan police had
indicated that they wanted to change the number of police community
support officers to increase the number of police constables available.
Yet the evidence shows that Tower Hamlets has 103 fewer police officers
and 58 fewer PCOs than in 2010. I wrote to the Mayor of London to seek
clarification a few weeks ago, soon after that answer, and have yet to
receive a

teams, from six officers to one police officer and one PCSO. As he
said, we were the first to innovate and pilot the safer neighbourhoods
initiative, which has proved extremely successful at reducing crime in
our borough and around the country. It seems bizarre that the
Government and the Mayor of London want to reverse that important
provision, with its proven track record of success. It is dangerous and
simply puts public safety at risk. I therefore appeal to the Minister

constituents do not have confidence in the proposals of the Mayor of
London. They made that clear in a recent consultation led by the deputy
Mayor, who was rather short of facts and unclear about what exactly was
going on. We highlighted the risks and showed the evidence, and asked
him to think again. In particular, it is critical that the Mayor of
London and the Government should consider the matter in the context of
recent risks such as hate crime, which the police dealt with valiantly
and immediately, because they still have some capacity to do
so.</hs_Para>

unrest. That required 7,000 police officers, despite a ban, and it

changed; concern about crime has gone up in Hammersmith and Fulham. The
council spends more than £1 million on publicity, mainly aimed
at telling people what a good job it does on law and order. It is a

invest in policing. That is not the solution to crime in London. The
political leadership—not the police leadership—of

town centre have benefited the community in many ways. More obviously,
they enabled our safer neighbourhoods teams to spend more time in the
community, rather than travelling to and from distant police stations;
but they also represented investment in local neighbourhoods.
Previously, those offices were derelict—empty shops that
attracted antisocial behaviour. Most of all, the new offices were an

is proposing to close every police station in Croydon North and to
leave police numbers below the wholly inadequate level that existed

Mayor’s justification for closing down the police stations is
that it frees up resources to provide additional police on the streets.

is not just about numbers. Ben Bradford, the Oxford criminologist, made
a valid point when speaking to the London assembly. He said that it is

police interact with constituents, to give them confidence, respect and

with years of experience, and that level of supervision is lost for
new, young officers coming in, it undermines the quality of the
policing and the interaction between the police officer and members of

effectively £540 million lost to the Met budget by 2015, or

this half-hour Adjournment debate, I want to highlight the important
part that MOD service personnel are playing in supporting cadet forces
in state schools and, in particular, the involvement of service
personnel in delivering the BTEC in uniformed public services. That
course and well run school cadet forces generally are making a real
difference to the lives of youngsters who attend state schools. Along
with the Department for Education, more than £10 million has
been pledged to expand cadet units into more state schools by 2015. I
understand the budget pressures that the MOD currently faces, but I
want to stress that I believe that is a good use of
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:01:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020681000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0002.htm#13020681000131">Two
state schools in my constituency—Walker technology college and
Heaton Manor school—have cadet forces. The benefits have a real
impact on individuals. Involvement in cadet units and work on the
associated BTEC teaches participants the ethos of public service, as
well as beneficial life skills, such as discipline and organisation.
Not every pupil encounters those virtues outside the school
environment.</hs_Para>

staff and individuals who offer to help with cadet forces and in
teaching the BTEC show great dedication. For many staff, including
Ministry of Defence service personnel, the commitment is purely
voluntary. Without their efforts, many units would not be viable. For
the staff, the benefits are twofold. There is the personal satisfaction
of teaching youngsters—sometimes very disadvantaged
youngsters—and also the personal professional development
through leadership and team-working skills. For the youngsters
themselves, the results are even more marked, although not always easy

declare an interest here, Mr Streeter. I am, and have been since 1980,
a governor of Walker school—now Walker technology college. At
Walker technology college, the uniformed public services BTEC is
delivered as a curricular activity via the cadet unit. The
qualifications gained by the pupils currently count towards the
school’s value-added best eight GCSE or equivalent points score
measure. The way in which Walker technology college has offered the
BTEC course has helped to give it real status, and it has been praised
by the Cadet Vocational Qualification Organisation as an example of
excellent practice. The model has even been adopted by a number of
other schools<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:03:42"></hs_TimeCode>.
The school has seen success with  the qualification, which has
included groundbreaking work with the Ministry of Defence and 15 (North
East) 
<?notus-xml column=132?>Brigade at Catterick. Both the MOD and the school have made significant
financial commitments to the qualification by running the cadet unit as
though it were a full curriculum department. The school also looks to
offer ex-service personnel the opportunity of full-time employment,
helping to staff that
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:04:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020681000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0002.htm#13020681000135">The
crucial point is that Walker technology college relies on the BTEC
qualifications associated with the cadet unit being counted in the
school’s performance indicators to justify its level of
commitment and investment. That arrangement is different to many
schools, including Heaton Manor, where the cadet unit and associated
qualifications are extra-curricular.

again.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:01:07"></hs_TimeCode> Following
the recommendations of the Wolf report and subsequent actions by the
Department for Education, the uniformed public services BTEC has been
removed from counting towards school performance indicators. Schools
must now focus on a narrower range of courses. That puts into jeopardy
the excellent provision at Walker technology college. State schools
must consequently focus their funding towards courses that count
towards pupil and school performance indicators. It is more difficult
to justify spending funds on an activity when it would take place on a
purely extra-curricular basis, as would be the 
<?notus-xml column=133?>case for the cadet unit at Walker technology college from 2014.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:07:39"></hs_TimeCode> is of real
concern to everyone involved and it is counter-productive, given the
Government’s stated commitment in that area.</hs_Para>

we believe in the value of the course, which I do, it must be
recognised for evaluation. If the Prime Minister and the Government
generally want to realise the course’s objectives, they need to
ensure its inclusion in performance indicators. The Wolf report
acknowledged the growing importance of BTECs and states that many who
take BTEC level 3 national qualifications continue on to higher
education. I do not seek to disagree with the recommendations of the
Wolf report or with the efforts of the Secretary of State for Education
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:08:17"></hs_TimeCode> ensure that
significant rigour is present in the education of our children. I am,
however, eager to ensure that courses that provide beneficial skills to
young people are recognised and included. It seems to me that the

of notable merit and should be one of those recognised

Pearson International, the company that owns Edexcel, which runs the
BTEC. Representatives have told me that they are happy to sit down with

the Government’s Positive for Youth agenda, the Departments have
allocated £10.85 million to provide the equipment and training
support needed to ensure that the cadet experience is maintained for
all our cadets, with schools or sponsors then paying the running costs

employers could readily understand. However, it should be recognised
that the BTEC qualification is an outcome of cadet service, not an
output, and the MOD cannot provide funding to pay for an educational
qualification.
Cadet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:16:33"></hs_TimeCode> service

We are all still picking our way through the devolution settlement, and
it adds a level of complexity to discussions of this sort. Although the
MOD has the luxury of dealing with matters that are not devolved, the
Department for Education simply does not. In England, as the CVQO-led
BTEC in public services has been approved by the Secretary of State for
Education under section 96 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, schools
can choose to fund it from within their budgets. Alternatively, I can
confirm that CVQO is funded by the Education Funding Agency, an
executive agency of the Department for Education, to deliver
qualifications for 5,000 English cadets a year aged over 16 and under
19. I am aware that, as a charity, CVQO is raising funds to meet an
ever-growing demand from within the cadet forces and other youth
organisations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020681000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/halltext/130206h0002.htm#13020681000156">As

incentivising schools to offer qualifications that have the greatest
value for the majority of pupils at key stage 4—qualifications
that will best enable them to progress to further study and into

factored into any changes and are not inadvertently overlooked when
mainstream maternity and children’s services are redesigned.

parent is intrinsic to the care of the child, which I believe sets
neonatal care apart from almost every other branch of medicine. We must
therefore consider the needs of the parent alongside those of the
child. It makes good economic sense: babies whose parents are included
in their care grow faster, have less illness, go home sooner and do not
come back; and their parents have less stress and fewer mental problems
later. There is a huge benefit from getting neonatal care right, and if
we can get it right at an early stage of planning service changes, that

December, a baby who was a few days old was flown from Glenfield

it would have taken one hour and 23 minutes for the team to

Although cost should not act as a disincentive to provide quality and

Payment by results, which has been introduced in this area, works for
many other areas of policy where there is a national currency but a
local tariff. However, payment by results takes into account only the
current levels of service provision, rather than the services required
to meet national standards; currently, those standards are not quite
being met. Thus, the current shortfalls that I have outlined will only
be reinforced, rather than addressed, by the payment system. A set
national price would ensure that commissioners can focus on quality and
outcomes of service. However, neonatal care faces a local tariff, where
price invariably is a larger factor, and that equates to variable

is worth highlighting, and I think that I have time to do so, the
different types of neonatal facilities that are available; the
different types of special care baby units, or the level 1, level 2 and
level 3 units. Special care units, traditionally known as level 1
units, provide care effectively just for the local population in the
local area. They provide neonatal services, in general, for singleton
babies born after 31 weeks and six days gestation, provided the birth
weight is above 1,000 grams. For slightly more complicated births or
slightly more premature births, there are level 2 units, which provide
neonatal care for their own local population and for some sicker, or
more premature, babies from elsewhere. They provide neonatal services,
in general, for singleton babies born after 26 weeks and six days
gestation, and for multiple-birth babies born after 27 weeks and six
days gestation, provided the birth weight is above 800 grams. Then we
have level 3 units as they are traditionally known, which are neonatal
intensive care units, and they are sited alongside highly specialist
obstetric and fetomaternal medical services. For example, there is a

hon. Friend the Member for Hexham made it as well—is that when

best example of where service reconfiguration has really benefited
patients that I can think of was in Manchester, which I visited towards
the end of last year. A redesign of the maternity and neonatal
provision in Manchester in a very planned, systemic way resulted in
about 30 babies’ lives being saved every year. When the case for
reconfiguration is made in terms of patient care and not in terms of
cost, as my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:54:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Daventry outlined, that is the right reason to
reconfigure and redesign services. What we cannot have, and what has
been expressly ruled out under the criteria for reconfiguration, is
redesigning services purely on the basis of cost. If we are going to
redesign the way that we deliver care, it must be done in the way that
it was done in Manchester, where—as Mike Farrar, who is now the
chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said—it is about
saving babies’ lives. That service reconfiguration in Manchester
was right, because it  is saving 30 babies’ lives every
year. That is the right reason for
reconfiguration.</hs_Para>

we look at these issues in areas where there are long distances to
travel and considerable rurality, all these factors need to be taken
into account when redesigning services. However, the end result must
always be for the benefit of patients. It may be the case that
sometimes people have to travel a little bit further to get that
high-quality care, but these decisions must be considered in the round
and on the basis of achieving high-quality outcomes and doing the best

conclusion, it might be worth highlighting a few other specific things
about neonatal care that the Government are committed to doing. We now

is properly implemented across the NHS. Some parts of the country are
doing very well in ensuring that the majority of their staff working as
nurses in neonatal units have specialist training, but that is not the

It is vital that whenever there is a discussion with any
patient—in this case, it is a discussion with an expectant woman
about where she should give birth—that an informed choice is
made. That should not just happen initially, but that choice should be
reviewed consistently, according to what the risk factors might be
throughout the pregnancy, and women should be helped and supported into
choosing the most appropriate birth setting for them. And all factors,
such as the woman’s safety or what care might be required
immediately after the birth, are vital ingredients in that
decision-making
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:58:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

to promote, and what we all believe in, is patient choice in the NHS.
One thing that is facilitating patient choice in maternity care is
having a national set of maternity notes now, so that all women
effectively have a transferrable set of notes that they can take from
one unit to another. That is something that is being driven across
maternity care, and I think that it will make a real difference if the

with many having to be kept in kennels before being re-homed. Having a
microchip means they can be reunited quickly with their owners,
reducing the stress for dog and owner alike. It will also lead to
substantial savings for local authorities and welfare charities who
spend some £57 million a year on kennelling costs and will mean
that fewer dogs are destroyed. Some 6,000 dogs have to be

victims were children under the age of four years. Concerns have also
been raised about dog attacks on postal workers and health visitors and
social workers during home visits. People just doing their job should
not be subject to dog attacks. The public agree. The consultation has
shown wide support for the proposal to extend the scope of the offence
in section 3 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 to all places, including
private property. Extending the law will help give protection both to
children in their homes, and to people who have to visit private
properties such as healthcare, postal and utility workers. Postal
workers in particular have suffered some terrible attacks, and the
proposed change to the 1991 Act will close the loophole that has meant
these attacks go unpunished. However, the proposed extension to the
criminal law will not provide protection to trespassers who have
entered a private property whom the householder believes has unlawful
intentions. DEFRA will bring forward amendments to the Dangerous Dogs
Act 1991 as soon as parliamentary time permits to effect this change in

Government are also concerned to ensure that irresponsible dog
ownership is tackled before a serious incident has occurred. As well as
the ban on certain breeds of fighting dog, DEFRA is working closely
with the Home Office and other authorities to introduce new powers to
help frontline professionals tackle anti- social behaviour
involving dogs. The measures proposed in the draft Anti-Social
Behaviour Bill published on 13 December 2012 will provide a set
of flexible, effective tools and powers to enable police and local

outcome of court proceedings where the police do not consider the dog
presents a risk to the public. The police will have discretion to
release a suspected prohibited dog where they are completely satisfied
that it is in the care of a responsible owner. They will be allowed
to put extra restrictions on the owner, for example
requiring the dog to be muzzled and

dog ownership is a complex problem and there is no single solution. The
primary responsibility for ensuring that dogs are kept under proper
control must rest with individual owners who should only acquire a dog
if they are prepared to look after it properly and make sure that it
does not become a nuisance or a danger to others. A key concern of
Government is the ease with which it is possible to buy a dog or other
pet over the internet. There is a rise in the trend for pets to be
advertised for sale in this way, and DEFRA is working closely with the
animal welfare charities to develop codes of conduct for website
operators and to provide guidance for buyers on the potential pitfalls
of buying pets in this way. We look forward to co-operation from the
industry to the benefit of
all.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13020666000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/wmstext/130206m0001.htm#13020666000032">We
consider that education also has a significant role to play in reducing
the problems associated with irresponsible dog ownership. Government
have provided funding of £50,000 shared between the RSPCA,
Battersea Cats and Dogs Home and the Dogs Trust to foster innovative
local community projects to encourage responsible dog ownership in
areas where there are high instances of dog-related problems. The
funding was provided on the basis that the interventions will be
carefully evaluated and the learning disseminated to help others
working with local communities including local authorities. That
evaluation is underway. Funding has been given to the Association of
Chief Police Officers to support the training that they provide for
officers with knowledge of dog control legislation in order to ensure
that there is a centre for such expertise in every police

personnel can volunteer to learn any language essential to a post or
career trade to which they are likely to be assigned. Languages include
most European languages and those required to support operations,
including Pashto, Dari and Arabic. However, training will only be
offered to those actually selected for such assignments and the
selection process will take account of several relevant factors,
including aptitude. There are also opportunities for language training
as part of single service personal development schemes, using standard
and enhanced learning credits.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=228?>regular and volunteer reserve are recorded in selected languages,
whether in date, or out of date, over three years since being examined;
or self-declared. The proficiency Level 1, the lowest level, four the
highest, relates to NATO STANAG 6001. Level 2 is a desirable minimum
level of proficiency, enabling factual communication in most
straightforward contexts and providing a good foundation for
higher-level or refresher training. Level 1 and below is not
sustainable over time without constant use. Figures include all
dialects and, in the case of Nigeria, whose official language is
English, relevant native languages. Serbo-Croat is a language group
that includes Serbian and Bosnian
variants.</hs_Para><TableWrapper Columns="2" Size="8"><table tabstyle="foots"><tgroup cols="10"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="20*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="8*"></colspec><colspec colname="3" colwidth="8*"></colspec><colspec colname="4" colwidth="8*"></colspec><colspec colname="5" colwidth="8*"></colspec><colspec colname="6" colwidth="8*"></colspec><colspec colname="7" colwidth="8*"></colspec><colspec colname="8" colwidth="8*"></colspec><colspec colname="9" colwidth="8*"></colspec><colspec colname="10" colwidth="12*"></colspec><thead><row><entry colsep="0" rowsep="0"></entry><entry colsep="0" nameend="5" namest="2" rowsep="0"><hs_TableHeading Justify="centre"><I>In

am aware that the Community Covenant Grant Scheme recently approved an
application from Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council in late December
2012 to support a 12 week programme to be run from 102 Brigade's REME

people aged between 16 to 19, not in education employment or training
from the local area will be supported by Army engineers to build a
fully-working Go Kart from scratch. They will work towards a series of
accredited qualifications in basic engineering

Barker:</Member></B> A mechanism which makes use of Government data,
providing customer referrals to energy companies participating in the
energy company obligation (ECO), has been operational since 2 January
2013, Under this mechanism, customers who call the Energy Saving Advice
Service (ESAS) and appear eligible for ECO Affordable Warmth assistance
will have their benefit-based eligibility checked with the Department
for Work and Pensions, subject to their consent for this data sharing.
Except for those found to be ineligible, customers are then referred by
ESAS to participating energy suppliers who will offer them a minimum
package of assistance. In January 2013, this mechanism generated over
1,600 referrals to suppliers. Ineligible customers are contacted by
ESAS with details of other energy efficiency
options.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130206110001022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/text/130206w0001.htm#130206110001022">Furthermore,
the operation of the Warm Home Discount scheme provides considerable
opportunities for energy supply companies to identify households for
ECO assistance. This is because Regulations allow the energy supply
companies to use information pertaining to customers in receipt of

environment agencies are statutory consultees in the planning process,

from the Environment Agency is required where fluids containing
pollutants are injected into rock formations that contain groundwater.
A permit may also be needed if the activity poses an unacceptable risk
of mobilising natural substances that could then cause pollution. The
permit will specify any necessary limits on the activity, any
requirements for monitoring, the chemicals which may be used, and any
appropriate limits on permissible concentrations. Regulators will take
a risk based approach, and if the activity poses an unacceptable risk

renewables, we hope that unconventional hydrocarbon resources, such as
shale gas and coal bed methane, might prove to be a useful future
addition to the UK's energy mix. If shale gas is found to be
commercially extractable in the UK, then any development of the
resource (and subsequent increase in hydraulic fracturing onshore)
would have to fit in within the UK's carbon reduction targets and the
goals set out in the EU renewable energy directive. As such it would
have no impact on the £7.6 billion funding already assigned for
supporting low-carbon technologies over the period
2015-20.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="130206110000039" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/text/130206w0001.htm#130206110000039">Government

decrease in the number of businesses served with civil penalties from
2010 can be explained as follows: employers' increased awareness of the
regime together with improved guidance on the UK Border Agency website,
providing clear advice on how to conduct document checks to verify a
person's right to work, has led to an increase in employer compliance.
The Agency's work in summer 2012 under Operation Mayapple targeted
enforcement activity on overstayers, including students whose leave had
been curtailed. This activity drives up compliance across the board.
Robust debt recovery processes have been implemented with employers
becoming increasingly aware that where penalties are not paid debt
recovery enforcement action will commence against
them.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="130206110000058" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/text/130206w0002.htm#130206110000058">Immigration:

Commissioner's Office (ICO), which is an independent regulator and
considers complaints about unsolicited marketing calls, the number of
companies engaged in making such calls is difficult to assess as in
many cases the companies do not provide their names to the consumers.
Therefore, they are unable to provide an estimate, although the ICO

undertaken, as enforcement issues is a matter for the Information
Commissioner's Office (ICO), which is the independent regulator. The
ICO considers complaints about unsolicited marketing calls, regardless
of where they may be made from within the UK. In some cases ICO may be
able to distinguish a particular region from which calls originate, but
not always. ICO considers complaints from consumers regardless of
location and therefore calls in Scotland would not differ from those
made in another part of the UK. In 2012 there were 78,085 complaints in

where a call centre's automated calling system generates more calls
than can be answered by call centre staff, resulting in an abandoned
call. Ofcom is engaged in on-going enforcement action in this area and

for contractors to pay their sub-contractors within 30 days is
specified in contract terms. If a sub contractor on a public contract

credit card for purchasing low value goods and services (£1,500
or less), such as stationery orders for goods not covered by contracted
suppliers, or training course fees. Monthly spending on GPC cards is
reviewed and approved by a designated ‘approver’, in
accordance with Cabinet Office policy and all cards are monitored in
this way. For low value transactions, the GPC speeds up procurement and
reduces process
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130206116000423" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/text/130206w0003.htm#130206116000423">For

Almost all of the overtime in FCO Services is for work completed
overseas, which must be completed outside of normal office hours or at
weekends, to minimise disruption to the FCO's operation. This includes
maintenance of, (and emergency repairs to ) IT systems, office
facilities and the FCO
estate.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>2</Sup> The primary
increase in overtime costs at the British Council for 2012-13 has been
incurred as part of a significant refurbishment and rationalisation of
its London offices enabling them to lease space to the National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and leading to significant
savings in the future. This necessitated a significant amount of
weekend working by estates and IT staff who were involved in
implementing the moves outside of normal working hours. The total cost
of this overtime was in the region of £800,000. The increased
cost was taken into account in the programme business case and approved
by the British Council's Board of
Trustees.</hs_TableFooter></entry></row></tfoot></tgroup></table>

Duncan:</Member></B> DFID's programmes aim to directly reduce the
impact of war on children and provide access to health, education and
opportunity. For example, in Northern Uganda, where the plight of child
soldiers was acute, DFID funds a post-conflict recovery programme that
will provide literacy, training and jobs to over 50,000 young people by
2015. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, DFID will enable 370,000
more children to attend school by 2015. In the long-term, children are
best protected by peaceful, accountable states capable of providing
security and justice for all, access to basic services, and meeting the
needs of vulnerable groups. Together with the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, we also strongly support United Nations efforts to prevent
recruitment of child soldiers and to campaign for their
release.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="130206116000039" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/text/130206w0003.htm#130206116000039">Developing

promotion and protection of the right to freedom of religion or belief
in both the developed and the developing world is one of the
Government's key human rights priorities. We believe that it is a
fundamental freedom which underpins many other human rights. Where
freedom of religion or belief is under attack, often other basic rights
are threatened too. To strengthen our defence of this fundamental
freedom we have developed a strategy, backed up by an ambitious action
plan, which includes (i) work in multilateral
organisations—chiefly the UN, the EU and the Organisation for
Security and Co-operation in Europe, (ii) bilateral contacts, when we
can raise individual cases, or practices or laws that discriminate
against people on the basis of their religion or belief; (iii) project
work with non-government organisations in a range of countries
including Iraq and Kazakhstan on issues such as promoting better
understanding between faiths, bridging sectarian divides, promoting
dialogue between faith groups and government and offering technical
advice on laws that need amendment, and (iv) other initiatives, such as
training Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) officials to better
understand the role of faith in society and in foreign policy. We are
also in close contact with civil society organisations and faith groups
and are keen to continue to work closely with them to promote and
protect the right to freedom of religion or
belief.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130206116000547" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/text/130206w0003.htm#130206116000547">I

Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate
and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have
been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the
courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to
ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are
taken into account when those data are
used.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>3</Sup>
The cautions statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were
the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When an offender
has been cautioned for two or more offences at the same time the
principal offence is the more serious
offence.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>4</Sup>
Penalty Notices for Disorder and formal warnings for cannabis
possession were introduced nationally in
2004.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>5</Sup>
Prior to 2011, cautions administered by the British Transport Police
were not collated centrally by the Ministry of

particular the recording of information on whether or not the offence
was committed while the offender was on bail is known to be incomplete.
This is because the police have available to them a number of ways of
recording the bail status of an offender of which the ‘offence
committed on bail’ field on the PNC is one. For operational
purposes police forces make differing use of these various sources and
as a result figures derived purely from the PNC do not provide a
complete picture of these offences, and therefore changes over time.

employment matters where discrimination is known; for advice and
assistance for welfare benefits appeals on a point of law in the Upper
Tribunal and higher courts, and also for representation for welfare
benefits appeals in the higher courts. Citizens Advice Bureaux (CABx,),
along with other Not for Profit organisations, have been able to bid
for legal aid contracts, subject to the Legal Services Commission
requirements for contract holders. For members of the public with
problems no longer in scope of legal aid, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ)
will put in place a new robust referral process to support relevant
clients to resolve their problems by signposting them to suitable
alternative sources of assistance where they contact the Civil Legal
Advice (CLA) helpline, the planned new online information service or a
partner organisation, such as
CABx.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130206116002914" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/text/130206w0004.htm#130206116002914">Funding
of the Not for Profit advice sector is a cross-Government issue and
substantial funding has already been provided to the sector through
£107 million Transition Fund in 2010 and the £20 million
UK Advice Fund in 2011 to which a number of CABx bid and received
funds. In October 2012, the Cabinet Office published its Review of the
Not for Profit Social Welfare Advice Sector in England which
acknowledged the role of Government in supporting the sector but also
made clear that the sector would need to adopt a more collaborative
approach to working with partner organisations across the sector.
Alongside the review, the Government launched the £65 million
Advice Services Transition Fund, to which CABx have also been able to
apply, to support the sector in making the necessary changes.
Applicants will be informed of the outcome of any bids in
April.</hs_Para>

However, I should emphasise that independent reports are not a
requirement for the tribunal as a medical report from an NHS doctor
will be sufficient. The tribunals are user-friendly and therefore the

the Catering Operating Manual, which requires all prisons to prepare
multi-choice menus that provide a varied, balanced and healthy diet
that meets the nutritional needs of all prisoners. In particular,

and salads. Meals considered healthier are identified on all menus to

pay rises are almost automatic, regardless of merit. Virtually all full
time classroom teachers on the main pay scale automatically progress to
the next pay point each year. Automatic pay progression means that
there can be little correlation between a teacher's pay and their

Laws:</Member></B> For the academic year 2013/14, Initial Teacher
Training (ITT) provision is split between core places allocated to ITT
providers and School Direct places allocated to schools, who work with
a partner ITT provider to deliver teacher training. As School Direct is
driven by schools' staffing needs, it should closely mirror local
demand for places, and will increasingly do so as the programme expands
in future. A guarantee of core ITT places for outstanding ITT providers
is in place to maintain training supply. Trainees are not bound to
teach where they train and there is reasonable mobility among newly
qualified teachers.</hs_Para>

allocations of ITT places for AY 2013/14 were not calculated on a
sub-regional basis. However, the Teaching Agency does monitor the
geographical distribution and take- up of places as part of its
responsibility to ensure there are enough high quality teachers. If
acute training supply problems occur, the Teaching Agency will adjust
allocations as
necessary.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="130206116000083" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/text/130206w0005.htm#130206116000083">Young

Soubry:</Member></B> In 2008 the Organ Donation Taskforce considered
presumed consent in considerable detail looking at the clinical,
communication, cultural, ethical, legal and practical aspects of
opt-out legislation. As part of its evidence gathering for its second
report, ‘The potential impact of an opt-out system for organ
donation’, published in November 2008, the taskforce studied how
an opt-out system would operate in practice in the United Kingdom as
well as the practical issues that would need to be addressed. They
found that, given the lack of awareness among the public about organ
donation, resources would be better prioritised if they were directed
towards raising public awareness and understanding about organ
donation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130206116003425" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/text/130206w0005.htm#130206116003425">The
taskforce also commissioned a systematic literature review from the
University of York to assess the impact of opt-out legislation on organ
donation rates in other countries. Eight studies comparing different
countries were reviewed. It was found that direct comparison between
countries was difficult because of the wide range of other factors that
influence organ donation rates, for example, mortality from road
traffic accidents, religion, education, and transplant infrastructure.
It was found that most countries with successful opt-out transplant
programmes attribute their success to the changes made to
infrastructure, increased financial resources and extensive
communications campaigns that take place at the same time as the change
to the law, not solely the change to the
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130206116003426" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/text/130206w0005.htm#130206116003426">The

Hoban:</Member></B> Underground mining is an intrinsically hazardous
activity given the nature of the working environment and processes
involved. The most significant health hazards are inhalable dusts,
noise, vibration, hot and humid working environments, and diesel
exhaust fumes. Modern working practices have the potential to decrease
some of those and increase others. There is a range of health and
safety law designed to ensure health risks are effectively managed and
controlled. In essence it requires employers to make an adequate
assessment of all such risks to workers' health and take appropriate
precautions to control them. This legislation is enforced by Health and
Safety Executive's (HSE) Mines Inspectorate.</hs_Para>

and the Department for Work and Pensions are working closely with a
group of social landlords on the direct payment demonstration projects,
which are testing the impact of the payment of housing benefit direct
to tenants. A key aim of the demonstration projects is to explore how
we can best protect social landlords, and tenants themselves, from the
risk of increases in rent arrears. We intend to use the evidence
gathered from the projects to inform the design of universal credit,
including the safeguards to be put in place to protect the financial
position of social landlords and prevent tenants from falling into
significant debt. My Department and the Department for Work and

will automatically continue to have their rent paid directly to the
landlord following the introduction of universal credit. To do so would
risk labelling all individuals in these circumstances as being
financially incapable, when they could already have plans in place for
clearing these arrears. However, we do accept that for some claimants
we will pay their housing costs direct to the landlord, this
alternative payment arrangement would be considered on a case by case

universal credit will be a significant change from the way many
benefits are currently paid and we understand that some claimants will
require support to help them manage that change. The Government is
working with the advice sector to ensure that claimants are able to
access appropriate budgeting support services to enable them to manage
their money successfully. We accept that for some claimants an
alternative payment arrangement will be required and this could include
the payment of their housing costs direct to the landlord. In order to
provide greater flexibility, applications will be considered on a case

satisfy the entitlement conditions. To ensure that people who receive
benefit are doing so correctly it is important that they are called for
re-assessment from time to time to make sure that they still meet the
entitlement conditions and, because peoples health conditions can
change, that they remain in the correct group i.e. Work Related
Activity Group or Support Group. This is a normal part of receiving ESA
and is important to ensure that people continue to receive the right
support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130206119000503" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130206/text/130206w0006.htm#130206119000503">As

be able to receive more in benefits than the average weekly wage for
working households. Claimants who move into work, while on the Work
programme and become entitled to working tax credit will be exempt from
the benefit cap. Claimants who are on the Work programme but who
