issue, and there are many factors that contribute to children becoming
obese. We are committed to tackling obesity in children. Our call to
action on obesity sets out the actions that everyone needs to take. For
our part we will continue investing in the Change4Life programme, the

Sharkey:</Member></B> My Lords, one-third of our children are already
obese, and the fact is that cheap fast food can be a major contributor
to obesity. The Government’s responsibility deal for calorie
reduction has signed up 31 companies, which have promised to
reformulate their products to make them less fattening. However,
according to the Department of Health’s website, not one of
these signatories is a fast-food operator. Does this not suggest a
failure of the voluntary approach and that we need regulation, as the
BMA says, to make food companies play their proper part in reducing
obesity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:08:26"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13020674000281" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000281">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend. In fact,
the responsibility deal has led to a number of very important gains and
benefits, not least from food companies: food retailers as well as food
manufacturers. Calorie labelling, for example, has expanded rapidly in
out-of-home settings; we now have labelling in around 9,000 outlets
across the country, which is to be welcomed. As my noble friend said,
31 companies, some of them household names, have signed up
to the responsibility deal calorie reduction pledge. However, this is
an area that we continue to work on, and I think my noble
friend’s comments are well

the figures for childhood obesity in those aged between 2 and 15 are
three percentage points worse than those in England? As responsibility
for some aspects of these matters is devolved and for others is not,

children especially, exercise and sport are vital, which is why there
are a number of initiatives in that area. She asked about media
campaigns. Change4Life continues to support families to make simple

currently planning a summer campaign to encourage physical activity in

Collins of Highbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I am going to take two
bites of the cherry because I shall also briefly address the second
Question. The noble Lord, Lord McColl, constantly reminds me that
eating too many calories, not simply not exercising, is what causes me
to be overweight, although I do exercise. However, when I pick up and
eat a tub of low-fat yoghurt, which I have been doing for the past few
years, thinking that I am eating healthily, I have not been able to
read the very small print that states that this “low-fat,
healthy” tub of yoghurt is packed full of sugars and calories.
Actually, just before Christmas, I stopped eating low-fat yoghurts and
I hope that noble Lords will appreciate the effect it has had on me.
However, my specific question is: when will the noble Earl take the
necessary statutory steps to ensure proper food
labelling<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:13:04"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble Lord will know, food
labelling is largely governed by EU law and, at the moment, the EU
directive is permissive about front-of-pack labelling. However, I take
his point that it is very important that consumers are properly
informed about what they are eating, and we are working with food
manufacturers and retailers to ensure that there is much greater
transparency in this area, across the piece, whether it relates to
sugar, fats or
salt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:13:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Trumpington:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may ask the
Minister two questions. First, does he not agree that cheap food has
become far more delicious than it was in the youth of most people in
this Chamber? Secondly, children like to copy their heroes. Could not
the media be persuaded to make greater use of physical heroes, such as
footballers, tennis players or any kind of sporting hero, in order to

models. To a certain extent, that has been tried and tested in the past
with some success. As regards food and its taste, I would say each to
their own, but she is right that we are encouraged in all sorts of
subtle ways to eat more than we used to in years gone by. The
responsibility deal calorie reduction pledge specifically enables
businesses to contribute to our challenge to the nation in this area,

may be rather higher on very sugary soft drinks, and rather lower on
drinks that are less full of sugar? Does he also think that we may need
to restrict the amount of sugar provided in some products, such as
breakfast cereals targeted at children, so that parents either as
consumers themselves or watching their children can see how many spoons

with the food industry, which, in public health terms, is taking on

My Lords, an organisation must be a charity, under
the law of England and Wales, and meet certain other conditions in
order to qualify for UK charity tax reliefs. Whether an organisation
established in England or Wales is a charity in law is a matter for the
Charity Commission. The Government are considering the proposals of the
noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, on updating charity law following his review
of the Charities Act

Gardner of Parkes:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for that Answer.
I notice that when you complete your tax return, one section asks you
to say whether you are a member of a tax avoidance scheme. I am always
amazed by that. That makes me wonder whether certain tax avoidance
schemes are recognised and approved by the Treasury. Can the noble Lord
tell me whether the Cup Trust, which is the one that has been so widely
accused in the recent press, is known and approved by the Treasury, or
whether it is unknown and that it has come as a shock to the Treasury
to have this revelation in the

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, I cannot comment on the tax affairs of
individual taxpayers but what I can do is speak generally. Schemes that
abuse the gift aid rules with a view to enabling individuals to avoid
tax do fall within the disclosure of tax avoidance schemes rules. That
means that anyone who uses such a scheme must disclose it on their tax
return. HMRC can then identify those individuals and challenge the
reliefs claimed where

Davies of Oldham:</Member></B> My Lords, are not the charities that
most significantly avoid tax on dubious grounds the public schools?
Many of them were granted charitable status when they educated the poor
or those of middling incomes. They now clearly educate, overwhelmingly,

Deighton:</Member></B> As I said in my original Answer, the issue of
whether an organisation qualifies as a charity is for the Charities
Commission. The review of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson,
which reported in the middle of 2012, was given an initial response by
the Government just before Christmas. The Public Administration Select
Committee is also looking at this and will report, I think, in March.
At that point the Government will give their further recommendations on
the regulation of the charities sector. That will deal with the issue
of which organisations qualify as charities, including public
schools.</hs_para>

whether alleged tax avoidance schemes, such as those operated by the

Deighton:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend for giving me the chance
to shed further light on this issue. HMRC is extremely clear that
circular schemes which are designed to exploit gift aid do not work in
tax law. It will challenge and litigate enthusiastically against any
scheme that it believes does not work in tax law. As the schemes do not
work in tax law, the anti-avoidance provisions are not necessary and
the schemes should fall at the first hurdle of not being legally
acceptable. However, I can confirm that it is the Government’s
intention to include the general anti-avoidance rules as part of the
Finance Bill

principle of English law that that which is not forbidden is permitted?
Do not the Government recognise that merely to go on bleating from the
sidelines and telling people that they should not avoid tax will have
absolutely no effect whatever? Clever lawyers will be able to devise
ways of continuing to avoid tax. If the Government want to deal with
tax avoidance, they will have to legislate to deal with tax
avoidance and stop preaching from the

Deighton:</Member></B> The Government are prepared to legislate against
tax avoidance in the area of charities law. In both 2004 and 2010,
Governments legislated to do precisely that. I see this as two distinct
areas. On the one hand, we need to create a tax regime which encourages
an enterprise economy and giving to charity. On the other hand, the
quid pro quo for that kind of positive environment is that people pay
their taxes. I can assure the House that HMRC will pursue diligently

Pannick:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 81D and 92 are in my name
and that of the noble Lord, Lord Adonis. They are in the first of a
series of groups of amendments which address Clause 27. As your
Lordships know, Clause 27 allows employers to buy off employment rights
otherwise enjoyed by employees. Under this clause, employees can agree
to receive shares worth at least £2,000, in return for which
they will lose the right to claim unfair dismissal, the right to claim
statutory redundancy pay, the right to request flexible working and the
right to request time off for
training<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:41:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000064">What
is so objectionable about Clause 27 is that these employment rights
were conferred by Parliament over the past 50 years and have been
protected by Governments—both Conservative and
Labour—precisely because the inequality of bargaining power
between employee and employer means that freedom of contract is quite
insufficient to protect the employee or the prospective employee.
Therefore, to allow these basic employment rights to be traded as some
form of commodity frustrates the very purpose of these entitlements as
an essential protection in the employment
context<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:42:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000065">The
concept contained in Clause 27 is especially bizarre when there appears
to be no demand whatever from employers for such protection and when
responsible employers are introducing genuine share ownership schemes.
I can think of only one precedent for Clause 27. It is in
Genesis, chapter 25, where Jacob refuses to let his famished brother
Esau eat some of the broth he has made until he sells him his rights as
the first born. Esau agrees because he is famished and says,
“What use is my birthright to me?”, compared to the mess
of pottage of which he has immediate
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:43:08"></hs_TimeCode>. Your
Lordships will come in due course to consider whether the correct
response from your Lordships’ House to this mess of pottage is
to reject it in its entirety—for all the reasons so powerfully
outlined at Second Reading by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, in
particular<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:43:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000066">Amendments
81D and 92 seek to ensure that if we are to have Clause 27 at all, the
employee and the prospective employee must at the very least be given
the minimum necessary protection to understand what it is that they are
giving up. The minimum necessary protection that Amendments 81D and 92
would provide is that the statutory rights could be lost only if the
agreement satisfies three essential conditions.</hs_para>

agreement in this context must be in writing and must set out the
rights being traded and the value of the shares that are to be
received. One of the surprising features of Clause 27 is that it does
not even require the agreement to be in writing—an invitation to
subsequent litigation if ever I saw one. Secondly, the individual must
receive legal advice on the consequences of the agreement from an
independent lawyer. These matters are surely too important for
Parliament to allow employees and prospective employees to give up
those basic rights without the legal implications being fully explained
to them. The third essential protection is that the individual must
have received financial advice from an independent adviser—who
must be a regulated person—as to the value and the prospects of
the shares that he or she is about to receive and for which they are
giving up those basic employment rights</hs_para>

92 is modelled on Section 288 of the Trade Union and Labour
Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. Section 288 is a vital provision.
It makes an agreement void if it purports to contract out of the
employment rights that Parliament has conferred. At the moment,
employees and employers simply cannot contract out of employment
rights. Clause 27 conflicts with that basic and fundamental principle.
However, Section 288 allows for compromise agreements to settle
specific employment disputes in individual cases in employment
tribunals. That is a very different concept and entirely acceptable in
principle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000069">Section
288 states that one of those compromise agreements in the context of an
individual employment dispute is valid only if it is in writing and if
the employee who is settling the case has received independent advice
on the terms of the agreement by which he or she is settling the
claim—advice from a lawyer, a trade union official or an advice
centre worker. Clause 27 involves an agreement much more fundamental in
its implications for the individual, who is not just settling an
individual employment claim in the tribunal but is generally giving up
important employment rights for the future. Therefore, in the Clause 27
context—if we are to have Clause 27 at all—the procedural
protection that Parliament confers on the employee must be at least as
strong as that which Parliament itself has conferred on the employee
who is settling a specific employment
claim.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000070">The
Equality and Human Rights Commission has helpfully addressed that very
issue. It has expressed concern that Clause 27 may indirectly and
unlawfully discriminate, contrary to EU law, against those workers and
prospective workers whose first language is not English, those with
learning disabilities or young workers. Therefore, the commission says
that a proper justification is required and that depends, in its view,
on safeguards such as the receipt of informed and independent
advice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000071">I
emphasise that Amendments 81D and 92 would not make Clause 27
acceptable. Clause 27 would remain a provision that knows the price of
statutory employment rights but ignores the value of those rights.
However, because the amendments would make Clause 27 marginally less
objectionable, I beg to
move.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_06_PT_1/D5D9F9C24A73FBA5DCF92908090630D975E55A20" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 February 2013">Wednesday,

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, on Second Reading I expressed my
concerns about the whole concept behind this clause. Various Ministers
have suggested that only a small group of companies are likely to be
interested in these proposals: new, high-technology, rapid-growth,
micro and small companies which might want to encourage employees into
more commitment and endeavour by offering them shares in their company.
So far, so good. However, many employers already do this in this
sector, especially those running fast-growing, leading-edge, high-tech
companies, because they know that they are going to grow much faster
than many other companies and they want to commit their staff to
working for them, to share the benefits in the longer term and the
hardship of trials that most companies face in their start-up
phase.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000073">I
declare two past interests. First, I have a foster son who has recently
been employed by one such firm, joining it from university. He has
received a share package as part of his employment. I have talked to
him and some of his colleagues about the benefits and whether they
would be prepared to talk about giving up their rights. I will come to
that later. My second interest is that I advised St John’s
College, Cambridge, as it created the St John’s Innovation
Centre in the late 1980s and subsequently was a non-executive director
at the centre until 2010. The centre works with entrepreneurs and
academics spinning their ideas out of Cambridge and other universities,
offering them short-term leases and, very specifically, business, legal
and technical advice that is the envy of many other science parks and
innovation centres that have developed in the intervening 25
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000074">These
companies are the exact target audience that Ministers tell us will be
interested in the proposals in Clause 27. Having talked to the
directors of these small but high-growth companies, I know that many
already offer shares, as I mentioned. They, as directors, do not
understand why an employer would want to do so in return for a
reduction in employment rights. One of their key issues as the company
grows is to keep the morale of the staff going during the difficult
times. It is very rare for a new company to have an entirely smooth
journey to success and reward. Proposing that staff should give up
their rights to redundancy pay is an issue, as not all early-stage
companies survive and so redundancy is a real possibility. They are
also concerned about training. This is absolutely vital in the
leading-edge technology sector, where the skills of your workforce are
likely to make all the difference against your competitors,
particularly the business skills that technical staff may
not have had when they arrived at the company. They need those skills
in order to progress in their market. Losing part of
paternal leave is also a concern, as many of their staff are
in exactly the age group likely to be beginning their
families.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000075">So
if the stick—that is, the loss of rights—is not
attractive either to employers or to staff, what about the carrot? The
carrot of capital gains tax exemption sounds very exciting but I do not
believe that the Government have really understood the two likely
outcomes for these high-tech companies. The first, sadly, I
have already alluded to. Not all of these companies 
<?notus-xml column=268?>are a success. Probably one in 100 is. There is a chance that the
company will not succeed and that the shares will be
worthless.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020674000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000076">The second is the
unlikely event that the company will do well enough to make those
shares really worth something in the future. However, even this route
is fraught to those coming in on the ground floor. Let us assume, for
the sake of argument, that the group of employees who joined the
company in its first two years were given shares at the then face
value. It would not be unusual after their issue, as the company grows
and faces all the typical excitements of launching in the market, for
those shares to become worthless. But our fledgling company is taking
off, and in order to become a really effective player, it will have to
take on finance. It often needs to seek that finance when the company
is not attractive. So, some business angels or venture capitalists
invest in the company, and all the original shares are diluted
substantially by this investment. We are only talking about round two
of investment at this stage.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020674000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000077">Well, the rubric goes,
it is better to have a small share of something than a larger share of
nothing at all. Often, though, there are three or four subsequent
rounds of financing, and those employees are likely to find that their
small share becomes a minute one. This is a really risky business.
Would many employees understand the risks that they were taking? Would
they honestly be prepared to wait 10 years or more for the carrot of
the CGT exemption for the one company in 50 to 100 that starts to make
a return for its shareholders? I doubt it. I also doubt that many
employees would understand the nature of the process that I have just
outlined.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020674000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000078">That is why my noble
friend Lord Tope and I have tabled Amendments 82A, 82B and 91 in this
group. For people working in the financial services sector, such as
venture capitalists and bankers, the process of growth and new share
issues, with the consequential dilution for longstanding shareholders,
is common knowledge, but for a young software engineer, perhaps fresh
out of university, it is an area that they are likely to know nothing
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:55:40"></hs_TimeCode> The
amendments in my name and that of my noble friend address this. We
believe that employee shareholders under Clause 27 should have access
to independent legal advice. More than that, we think that the employer
should have a duty to ensure that the employee has a right to receive
the appropriate legal advice and that the employer should make a
contribution towards that legal
advice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:56:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000079">I
am reminded of the small print in the public shares issues of the
1980s: shares can go up as well as down. The noble Baroness, Lady
Thatcher—I am astonished to find myself praying her name in
aid—felt that it was appropriate for the ordinary man or woman
in the street to have that advice then, so I am sure that it is right
to be provided in these circumstances for employees who are unlikely to
have had training in the finer points of share prices and rounds of
investment in high-growth
companies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:56:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000080">Amendment
92, in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Pannick and Lord Adonis,
takes my proposal one stage further, and in a new subsection (12)
demands much more specific types of advice as well as a written 
<?notus-xml column=269?>agreement for individuals being offered the opportunity of employee
shares and specifies the nature of that advice in much more detail. Not
only do I think that is more useful but I am sympathetic to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:57:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000081">Amendment
82B would then put the onus for paying for that advice on to the
employer. I am sure that this is correct and only fair. If you are
giving up your rights as an employee in return for shares that may,
though probably may not, increase in value and will certainly be
diluted out of sight in the future, that is a complex decision that
needs specialist advice and careful consideration by the prospective
employee

we come to discuss clause stand part I will return to some of the
principles of the clause in general, but I want to conclude on these
amendments by saying that all the evidence that I have heard from both
employers and employees, in the sector that Ministers say is the one
most likely to take this up, is that it just will not be attractive. I
hope that the clause will wither on the vine, but if it does not then
we must have protection for the employees who are going to be faced

to the concept of wider share ownership but I am concerned about Clause

about a month after we had floated it and said, “Guvnor, you
just don’t know what it means to me to feel I am part of this

point of wider industrial shareholding is to try to create a sense of

trust rather than increase it. With great reluctance, therefore, I have
to speak against the Government, who I am sure are right to encourage
wider share ownership. If you wrap it up in complexity, cover it in
advisers and make it all too difficult, it simply will not happen, but
it is fundamentally the most attractive and important thing to create a
wider capital-owning society in which everyone feels they have a

with them or do they have to give them up? What happens to
TUPE—the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
Regulations—which gives protection to employees? According to an
opinion provided by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, an
employee shareholder is legally still a worker and therefore
still has employment rights—hence the

of the door with a week’s wages and, if they were lucky, maybe
some holiday pay. It gave dignity to people who were very loyal to
their company that, if they were unfortunate enough to lose their job
after a decent period of time, they at least got something to tide them
over, because redundancy payments are not all that big.</hs_para>

the children of these minorities, who are some of the best educated
children because the families use education, grow up and wish to use
their education to get out of the informal sector into the formal

parents. They want to be workers 
<?notus-xml column=272?>with rights, entitlements and the possibility of
progress. In fact, many of them would work in these new companies
without realising that by doing so they were returning to where their
parents were. That is not because they are not educated but because of
the complexity of the contract. They are happy to have a contract. They
sign it, which means it is formal and official. They do not have a
lawyer at their side to warn them of every point. It would be a matter
of great regret to lose these intelligent people, who, I think, are
footloose and fancy free. They may well move on to other countries
where they are better paid for having poor contracts. We are losing the

joined this House I was a serial entrepreneur. I have started many
businesses from scratch. The most recent one employed 200 staff after
being in business for four years. I am a big fan of giving employees a
stake in the success of the business so that their goals are aligned
with those of the founders. It never crossed my mind that my staff
should need to forfeit their employment rights in exchange. Snatching
these rights is hardly the best way to win their hearts and minds.

get their full commitment to the success of the business are bad

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, when these proposals were announced, I
was somewhat lukewarm towards them, for some of the reasons that other
noble Lords have spoken about today. However, as I thought about the
proposals rather more, it seemed to me that there is some sense to
them. They are not proposals for everybody. They are not for
individuals who work for the public sector or for large companies; they
are relevant to individuals who are by nature high risk-reward in their
approach. They are willing to be high-risk takers to build up capital
for themselves and their families. The proposals are, as has been
articulated, for small and medium businesses, and are certainly not
appropriate for larger businesses.</hs_para>

may be capable of improvement but not, I hope, of too much
embellishment or the whole point of the principle would be undermined.
People have the option whether to participate. If you wish to be an
employee entrepreneur, here is the chance to benefit with equity on an
extremely tax-attractive basis, but you are going to be taking risks
just like the entrepreneur himself. One of the problems with
small-company share schemes, as I have experienced in my own career, is
that they are very limited. Where options have to be used they end up
being taxed at nearly 60% and are not particularly attractive. The
carrot of tax-free capital gains is
attractive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:13:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000103">The
subsequent amendment that I will address shortly suggests a template
for and guidance on the new scheme. Particularly as it is new and
untried, that is needed. The principle of requiring advice I can go
along with to some extent, although requiring barristers seems perhaps
to be jobs for the boys. The principle of 
<?notus-xml column=273?>the scheme seems pretty straightforward. It does not require anyone of

some of the potential problems have already been addressed
via amendments in the other place. There are measures intended to stop
any form of coercion. Employees also retain the great majority of their
employment rights. Partly paid issued shares cannot be used,
so people would not be left with a liability if a company went bust. If
shares are inappropriately valued, the deal returns employees to their
normal employment status. I am not sure how far one should really go to
spoon-feed the principles. If someone is not a natural risk taker, this
is clearly not for them, and they should not look to accept a job with

virtually all the employees having equity in that business. While the
business was being built, we really could not afford to pay people what
I would call full market rates, and because we needed the money to
build the business there was a trade-off there. But those individuals
had to pay capital gains tax on their eventual gains, and some had to
pay income tax because option arrangements were used. In a sense, the
risk-reward tilt of the balance was not ideal at that

assurance of employment, not to legal rights. The other side of the
coin is that when entrepreneurs set up a business, they have to take a
tremendous risk. People never think about that. Many of them have to
put their home and family at risk. If the business fails, there is a
charge on the house and they lose everything. There is a degree of
fairness in the sort of risks that entrepreneurs take and the slightly

view that the objectives of the clause and the conditions attached to
wider share ownership were wrong then and remain wrong. The 
<?notus-xml column=274?>issues that British industry faces today are not to do
with wider share ownership. Of course, it is to be

did not even give the shares a thought. I could not find my share

many words about skills in the clause and do not begin to understand
how it could be deemed necessary to bring it forward to secure the
loyalty and overall commitment that industries need. Indeed, it could
be argued that Clause 27 will have a perverse effect on
employee relationships within the workplace, because if the workplace
is about anything it is about unity, working together and equity of
treatment and approach. What we are doing here will possibly sow the
seeds of a divided workforce operating in small units where some people
are shareholders and some are not. The legislation does not provide
equity of security because at the outset your legal rights have to be
forfeited. I am old fashioned enough to think that workers’

say to the Government that sooner or later we will need to address the

rights because you gave those up at the start point, but do you have
any real security? I do not think so. Therefore, I believe that the
points that were made at Second Reading and the points so ably made
today by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, in respect of the legality of
the issues involved in the different statutes lead to the necessity to
rethink this clause. The clause really needs to get back to considering

the confusion will arise and cause the greatest difficulty. Profit
share is relatively clear, straightforward, simple and very motivating.
I wholly agree with the noble Baroness who talked about that 
<?notus-xml column=275?>earlier. That is fine, but profit share does not carry with it any of
the risks that go with equity. I disagree with the noble Lord; you do
not just buy your shares today and sell them. If you are a locked-in

and worse, I have seen this work to the total detriment of the

straightforward, long-term profit opportunity, so we had a lot of
participation by Scandinavian banks, which would buy a ship and put it
into a purpose-built company. The captain might be offered the
opportunity of 20% of the equity in that company, meaning 20% of
the ship he was going to sail. If that company did not get

coercive in that it in effect requires individuals to accept jobs
without fundamental employment rights. The coercion involved in these
shares-for-rights jobs comes in two ways. First, individuals will in
some cases have no option but to accept such jobs. We will come to that

distinction between the legal advice to be given in the potential sale
of a listed company, where the majority shareholders have a separate
set of interests and the minority shareholders—the working
shareholders possibly have a very different set of interests? Are we to
have two separate and parallel sets of lawyers to avoid a conflict of
interest between those types of shareholders? That would seem
necessary. How is it to be

employees who are seeking to take jobs, which is a different situation
from the one that the noble Lord has described. We are not talking
about the takeover of companies, which is the issue he raised. However,
the noble Lord is right to point out that two different sets of
interests are involved. As the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, said, we have
these rights purely because of an imbalance of power in the
relationship between employers and potential employees. If the noble
Lord is saying that we need two lots of lawyers on the job, I

There is currently no reason to suggest that removal of the statutory
right to request time to train, which at present is available only to
employees of large organisations—that is, those with more than
250 people—would result in employee shareholders being unable to
access training or request it if needed. Larger employers tend to have
established appraisal and development processes. On that basis, we do

question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, concerning TUPE.
She asked whether TUPE will be affected by employee shareholders.
Exactly how TUPE would apply would depend on the precise 
<?notus-xml column=281?>details of the transfer, but there is nothing in the
employee shareholder clause as it stands that would require an
interpretation incompatible with TUPE. It is important to realise that
any employee transferred under TUPE cannot be forced by the transferee
into becoming an employee shareholder. The employee will still have a
right not to be unfairly dismissed or suffer a detriment as a result of
refusing an employee shareholder contract. There is nothing to stop
business arrangements being made in such a way as to provide that a
person who is an employee shareholder in one company becomes an
employee shareholder in another company. It is also possible to agree
that the employee shareholder would no longer have employee shareholder
status and become a full
employee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:44:49"></hs_TimeCode>. I also
want to clarify that if an employee has bought shares privately in a
company, and he has transferred to that company under TUPE, he is not
deemed then to have become an employee shareholder of the company by
virtue of holding shares in that company. That is because the shares
were not given to him as part of the employee agreement to become an
employee

noble Baroness, Lady Turner, also raised the issue of Beecroft. I think
she said that this was Beecroft by the back door. I reiterate that it
is certainly not. The new employee shareholder status is different from
the no-fault dismissal proposal because individuals become shareholders
of the company at the start of the employee relationship. That is an
important benefit conferred by the employee shareholder status. Unlike
no-fault dismissal, the employee shareholder status will be freely
agreed between employers and individuals in contractual negotiations.
Employers will also be free to offer improved contractual terms, such
as contractual redundancy payments, as raised earlier, in an employee
shareholder contract. After reviewing the evidence, the Government

shall conclude by agreeing in part with the noble Lord, Lord Pannick,
on a particular point. There is indeed a large number of sources of
quality legal and financial advice available. The Government do not
need to stipulate where people should seek advice, nor would it be
appropriate to oblige people to seek such advice when they may not need
or want it. The best approach is to provide guidance, which we will do,
to ensure that people enter into contracts with their eyes open. That
is the approach that we are taking. With those reassurances I hope that
the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</hs_para>

Pannick:</Member></B> I am very grateful to the Minister and, indeed,

Minister suggested that Clause 27 simply creates a choice, and asked
what was wrong with creating choice? The whole point of employment
rights is that they are needed because the bargaining power of the
employee is so limited that statutory protection is
required. The noble Lord, Lord Flight, suggested that these proposals
might be appropriate for some types of employee in some types of
employment. There are two difficulties with that defence. First, Clause
27 is entirely general in its terms; it is not confined to
particular types of employment and particular types of
protection. Secondly, the employees and the employers for whom the
noble Lord, Lord Flight, suggests Clause 27 might be
appropriate—entrepreneurial employees in high-tech
companies—are not operating in a context where the
rights to protection against unfair dismissal and redundancy are of
particular significance. It does not inspire a great deal of
confidence in Clause 27 that the best point that can be made in its
defence is that it will not be used very
often.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000166" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000166">This
amendment is about legal and financial advice, particularly legal
advice. The noble Lord, Lord Flight, said that legal advice is not
needed in this context because the legal implications are very clear. I
have to say that they may be clear to the noble Lord, but I can assure
him that the implications of signing away one’s basic employment
law rights, and what one will receive in return, will not be clear to
the ordinary working man and woman who may be invited to sign away
these essential
protections.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000167">The
Minister then said that there was nothing in Clause 27 that would
prevent the employee seeking advice. As a judge said in the 19th
century, it is rather like saying there is nothing to prevent the
employee from staying overnight at the Ritz hotel. Statutory protection
is required to ensure that in reality, advice is made available for
those who will not otherwise obtain it. The Minister did not address
this. I cannot understand why legal advice
is—rightly—required by Section 288 of the Trade Union Act
in the context of a compromise agreement, but is not required under
this clause when the employee gives up his or her employment rights
generally.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000168">I

whom speak from their different perspectives with an enormous range of
experience. The Minister and noble Lords will know that there are many
other noble Lords who are not here today who are equally concerned by
Clause 27. I hope that the Government will listen and do what must be
blindingly obvious that they ought to do, which is to withdraw Clause
27 so that we do not need to spend—I will not say
“waste”, because it is not a waste of time—any
more time on this on Report. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw

in cases where a claimant has failed to accept an appropriate job or

passage of this Bill through the other place and the earlier stages of
our debates in this House that they will amend the guidance so that it
is fair. This revised guidance is vital to understanding what will or
may happen in practice. I have repeatedly asked that noble Lords see
the revised guidance or at the very least a draft of it before we
consider this clause. We cannot properly consider it without the
revised guidance because the issues at stake are so fundamental. For
example, will carers be able to decline to take shares-for-rights jobs,
or to attend interviews for them, because they may want to request
flexible working? Will a youngster with few or no qualifications be

even defending the fact that the guidance was not sent to us before

not had the guidance before us in Committee even though we were given

to know precisely when the guidance will be forthcoming. I give him
notice that if we do not have that guidance by Report there will be
significant arguments about the way in which the Government have
treated the House. I have been on that side of the Dispatch Box and I
regard it as wholly unsatisfactory that we should be expected to debate

We have already discussed, in the previous group, the complex decision
required of an individual being asked to become an
employee-shareholder, who must take account of current employment
rights versus the slim chance of future capital gains. However, there
is a further and even more worrying aspect for one particular group of

the absence of the guidance that the Government are eventually to

in detail the implications of the Government’s proposals. By not
publishing the guidance at this stage, the Government are preventing
the Committee discussing the essential detail of their proposals. For
my part, I do not find it satisfactory, even if the noble Viscount
produces answers this afternoon. It should have been done in time for

the absence of any guidance, we can proceed only on the basis that
Clause 27 does not at all protect the prospective employee from being
denied welfare benefits if he or she refuses to take up a job offer

adequate guidance, I share the view of the noble Baroness, Lady

27 is bad enough in its implications for employees, as we explained in
a previous debate. It is even worse for the prospective employee. Under
Clause 27, the employer can refuse to offer employment to
applicants who decline to enter into one of these agreements giving up
statutory employment rights. The irony is that the worse the job
market, the more willing prospective employees will inevitably be to
take the job, even if employment rights are lost. However, the poorer
the job market, the greater the employee’s need for the
statutory protection against unfair dismissal and redundancy that the
employee will be giving up. It is a vicious circle

82 and the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, each address
a particular vice of Clause 27 in that respect. The vice is clear. It
is that the prospective employee who wishes to maintain his or her
statutory employment rights—during the previous debate, the
noble Viscount emphasised that this is a matter of choice—and
refuses to be bought off, is at risk of losing welfare benefits. That
is indefensible for a simple reason. Clause 27 can only be based on a
theory of equal bargaining power. It is a wholly unrealistic theory,
but that is the theory. That is the fig leaf which shelters the
substance of Clause 27. Even the fig leaf—the theory of equal
bargaining power—is removed by the fact that the prospective
employee’s bargaining power is wholly removed if he or she is
going to lose welfare benefits if he or she does not agree to take the
job in the absence of the statutory protection of employment rights.
Therefore, the absence of protection against losing welfare benefits
for the job applicant inevitably means that, in practice, Clause 27
does not simply provide for a choice, it imposes an
obligation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:10:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_06_PT_1/2F58CC114EBED1AE1DB793EFD086507802652A03" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 February 2013">Wednesday,

few circumstances where a job might not be suitable for an individual:
if a claimant is not capable of doing the job through a lack of
suitable qualifications or experience; if a claimant is not physically
capable of doing the job due to a physical or mental impairment; if a
claimant has an agreed pattern of caring that is not compatible with
the job; if a claimant is unable to get to the place of work by their

mandated to apply for a job by a jobcentre adviser. The decision
whether to mandate claimants will be considered on a case-by-case basis
by jobcentre advisers. Advisers will seek to ensure that the job is
suitable for the claimant; for example, that it fits within the hours a
claimant is available, taking into account any caring responsibilities,

that the Government are reviewing the existing guidance to ascertain
where it needs revisions. This must be done thoroughly and cannot be

having prepared for changes which they are proposing to inflict on the
country and declaring them to Parliament before we change the law. They
say that changing 3,000 pages of guidance is a laborious job. I am sure
that it is: I spent a good part of this morning trying to read the
guidance and to make sense of it. Goodness, even legal eminences of the
height of the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, would struggle with the
complexity of the guidance which the DWP issues. If the Government are
saying that they need more time, your Lordships would be very happy to
give it to them if they wish to withdraw Clause 27 from the Bill and

and the guidance that they wish to make and to present them to the
House before we change the law. The fundamental point is the one that
the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, made—the difference in respect of
these contracts is that employment rights are being withdrawn. The
fundamental question, on which we need to see the guidance, is whether
the withdrawal of these rights is itself a reason why unemployed people
are permitted to decline to attend interviews or accept jobs. If it is
not a reason then nothing has changed. This clause therefore flatly
contradicts the assurances that have been given to Parliament that the
new employee shareholder status is voluntary. I think that that is a
very significant point which your Lordships will wish to take into
account when we get to Report. I beg leave to withdraw the

at the beginning of this debate because I want to comment on the noble
Viscount’s contribution. In the amendments in my name in the
group, I simply specify all the rights that it is proposed should be
withdrawn through the new employee shareholder status so that the
Government will have an opportunity to defend their decision to
withdraw them in each case and also to provide a longer notice period
for early return from maternity and adoption leave. As the noble
Viscount knows, we are opposed to each of the withdrawals of rights in
Clause 27. The Government have not had the opportunity before your
Lordships to explain their justification for the withdrawal of each of
these rights. By putting these amendments down, I am giving the

relatively small business, had five people on maternity leave at the

business that that happened, but it had an impact. It is very hard
indeed for a small business to handle. However, if I were setting up my
business again, I certainly would not do it on this basis. I would not
take on anybody without proper protection. I have always found it
better to be more generous than absolutely necessary by law in the

questions about the benefits of Clause 27. Perhaps I may add to the
burdens on the Minister, who is playing a very straight bat—he
would be a credit to the cricket team of the noble Lord, Lord
Strasburger. I will put these questions to the Minister in the hope
that he can explain whether the Government have taken account of two
very troubling legal consequences that will follow from the current
contents of Clause 27 and which are relevant to the amendments in my
name and that of the noble Lord, Lord
Adonis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:33:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

rights that the employee or prospective employee is being invited to
sell are concerned with issues that are particularly sensitive in
anti-discrimination law. There is the right to request flexible
working, which is obviously of particular importance to working
mothers—as is the eight-week notice period that would be imposed
for the return to work after maternity leave. These are very sensitive
matters. It is inevitable that employers who seek to rely on an
agreement which purports to override rights in this context will face
legal challenges under EU law, the expense of which will far exceed the
amounts that they would pay to employees for giving up those rights.
Have the Government taken that into account in deciding on the merits
or otherwise of Clause
27<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:34:56"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020674000236" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020674000236">I
would be grateful if the Minister would comment also on a second legal
implication. If the law allows for the sale of unfair dismissal and
redundancy rights, it is inevitable that aggrieved employees, when they
are dismissed or made redundant at some stage in future, will not go
quietly. Having sold their unfair dismissal 
<?notus-xml column=295?>and redundancy rights, they will formulate their grievances by reference
to whatever legal avenue has not been sold. Nothing in Clause 27
affects—and because of EU law nothing in Clause 27 could
affect—their rights of protection under anti-discrimination law.
So instead of claiming unfair dismissal, or seeking compensation for
redundancy, the aggrieved employee will contend that the dismissal or
redundancy was based on a prohibited ground. Therefore, my second
question to the Minister is whether the Government have really taken
into account that any employer that enters into one of these
agreements—and it seems highly unlikely that there will be many
of them—will not be protecting themselves against the litigation
that will result when an employee is dismissed or made redundant in

Brinton:</Member></B> Clause 27 requires employees to
give up a range of rights. Many of these rights are ones
that the Beecroft report recommended should be removed from
employees more generally. The Secretary of State, Vince Cable, hit out
at Beecroft’s unfair proposals. He
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13020695000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0001.htm#13020695000087">“One
of Mr Beecroft’s recommendations was a suggestion to bring in

that the clause is in the Growth and Infrastructure Bill and that the

further and do not even provide compensation for no-fault dismissal

Beecroft’s proposals were in the first place, and the Secretary
of State’s protest, does this not give us further
reason for the removal of subsection (2)(c) and (d)?
Beecroft also recommended the removal of the right to request flexible
working—another of his recommendations that the Government are

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 27 is about providing
further choice to the range of employment statuses that employers can
consider and choose. I want to take this opportunity to
explain to the House the difference between “employee

already have a choice in how they wish to work and how they structure
their workforce. The choice is usually between hiring someone as a

provide and carry out work, and the rights associated with the
statuses. I hope that the following explanation goes a little way to

turn to employee shareholders wishing to return to work earlier than
originally planned from maternity, additional paternity or adoption
leave. When returning early from these types of leave, employee
shareholders will need to give 16 weeks’ notice, compared to six
weeks for employees returning from additional paternity leave or eight
weeks for employees returning from maternity leave or adoption leave.
The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, proposes with Amendments 83 to 89 to take
out the employment law references in Clause 27, where it states what
rights the employee shareholder will have that are different from those
of an employee. This includes removing the distinguishing features of
the clause and therefore it will remove choice from the options that
employers can consider when taking on staff. The amendments would
create an employment status that is essentially the same as that of
“employee”, but where the employee shareholder would be
given fully paid-up shares. In effect, we would be regulating for an
additional employment status that essentially already exists in that of
“employee” in order for the individual to be given
shares. As the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, knows—he is supported
in this by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis—employee ownership,
either through direct employee share holdings or shares held in trust
on behalf of and for the benefit of employees, is already a well known

beneficial. Employee shareholders will have a greater interest in the
performance of their employer as it is linked to the value of their

the view that an individual who is an employee shareholder was
nevertheless a worker, so workers’ rights would normally be
applied to that individual. The Government have tried to get over that
by saying that because this is all voluntary, the employee voluntarily
gives up their rights. During the course of our recent discussion, it
has become clear that that is certainly not voluntary. In a situation
in which people face either unemployment or the possibility of loss of

respond to the point about the Beecroft report. The Beecroft report is

understanding of the genesis of this employee shareholder proposal is
that, having sought to implement the Beecroft report and having been
stopped from doing so by our colleagues on the Lib Dem Benches, in
particular by the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills, the Chancellor of the Exchequer then sought to bring back the
proposals in a watered-down form in return for the award of shares
valued between £2,000 and £50,000. Vince Cable probably
now regrets having done that deal, but he did so because he believed it
would be niche and insignificant, although 6,000 is on the large side,

the acute irony of the proposal before the House is the one which the

one of the fundamental rights being withdrawn—the right not to
be unfairly dismissed—the Beecroft proposal for almost all

more generous than the shares for rights proposals encompassed in the

feeling that there is a kind of nastiness abroad on this issue, because
capital gains tax is very much a destroyer of value and of
enterprise. One problem in this country is that many people
do not like other people being wealthy as a result of hard
work and employment. I dislike that kind of attitude very much. If that
is part of the coalition agreement, it is a bad part, because we need a
society in which people are encouraged to put their lives into
businesses and to gain some of the benefits of that. One reason
the United States is so much more successful than other
countries is that it has been more sensible about that bit of its
taxation. It is very stupid about a lot of other taxation, but on that
bit at least it has said that there is a real reason for encouraging
people to create businesses. One way of encouraging them is
by giving them a lower rate of tax on capital
gains and dividends than they would have elsewhere. That

“tax loophole”. This is not a tax loophole; it is a
decision—a mistaken decision, I think—to encourage people
to do something through a tax concession. I repeat: it is not a tax
loophole. I shall tell noble Lords what a tax loophole is. It is Amazon
organising itself so that it runs people out of the high streets of
Britain by ensuring that it does not pay proper taxes. A tax
loophole—I declare an interest as being concerned with the
business of packaging recovery—is when Amazon can put packaging
on the marketplace and not pay the proper price of so doing. That is
what a loophole is. It is not a loophole if the Government specifically
say that in particular circumstances people will pay a lower rate of
tax. That is a proper use of the taxation system. For goodness’
sake, do not let us use the term “loophole” in this
instance. There are some very big loopholes which we ought to be
stopping and, for me, Amazon is the biggest example of a company that
does not pay proper tax wherever it

noble Lord for his contribution. There is absolutely no doubt that we
agree about Amazon. Perhaps I may give an illustration from the early
1990s of the sort of loophole that I was alluding to. The Conservative
Government of the day created generous tax facilities for investors in
the business expansion scheme. When the scheme was originally devised,
it was intended for small high-growth companies—where have I
heard that before in this debate? Investors would get those tax
benefits because they were investing in something that carried a
slightly higher risk. I confess, as the bursar of a
Cambridge college, that within two or three years every Oxbridge
college, and subsequently every university in the country, used the
business expansion scheme, and that tax benefit was quickly closed down
by the Government, who described it as a tax loophole.</hs_para>

should not be misconstrued as encouraging avoidance. Secondly, any rise
towards £1 billion is estimated to occur well beyond the end of
the forecast period—in fact, beyond the 2020s, when national
income is likely to be more than twice as high in today’s money.
Finally, the draft legislation published on 11 December includes a
number of anti-avoidance provisions. If further provisions are needed
to address particular avoidance risks, we will have the opportunity to
include them at a later date with a view to ensuring that this policy
does not become disproportionately costly to the

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> It gives me the
opportunity to answer the noble Lord’s question by saying that
the OBR has stated that in the long term this policy could cost up to
£1 million. That figure relates to the future period beyond the
2020s. However, there are uncertainties associated with costs so far
into the future and I am sure that the noble Lord
will appreciate that. The Government expect that the new employee
shareholder status should help to stimulate business and
entrepreneurial activity by affording businesses greater choice on the
contract 
<?notus-xml column=307?>that they can offer to individuals while ensuring that appropriate
levels of protection are maintained. If the policy achieves this aim,
the cost, which is expected to reach £8 million in 2017-18, is
proportionate. The draft legislation published on 11 December sets out
a number of anti-avoidance provisions to prevent the manipulation of
the capital gains tax exemption on shares received under the status. If
further provisions are needed to address particular avoidance issues,
as mentioned earlier, the Government will have the opportunity to
include these at a later date with a view to ensuring that this policy
does not

noble friend Lady Brinton raised the issue of whether the tax
incentives were in effect a tax avoidance scam, if I can put it
somewhat indelicately. She did not put it in that indelicate way. The
Government have already included provisions to deal with various types
of possible abuse in the draft legislation on capital gains tax
exemption. If other forms of abuse come to light, the Government will
make the necessary changes to combat that with a view to ensuring that
the policy does not become disproportionately costly to the

concern has been raised, notably by my noble friend Lady Brinton about
the capital gains tax exemption. This relates particularly to people
taking up this new employment status, and although I touched on it
slightly earlier, I shall address it directly. We believe that employee
ownership is a good thing. We want people to become employee
shareholders and to benefit from the exemption provided. Where it is
used properly it should be seen as a measure of success and people
should take advantage of this particular exemption. However, the draft
Finance Bill published on 11 December takes a robust line on the
potential misuse of the exemption and provides several measures that
would prevent the misuse of employee shareholder employment status.
There are rules to prevent those who control a company, such as company
directors, holding exempt employee shareholder shares if they control
25% or more of the voting power in the company. Similarly, rules will
prevent people connected to those who control the company, such as
spouses or children, benefiting from the exemption. We will prohibit
employees from benefiting from multiple £50,000 limits by
entering into multiple consecutive employee shareholder contracts with
related companies. Instead when related companies are involved, an
employee will have a single £50,000 limit applying to all shares
received by related companies. We will also ensure that those looking
to get around the limit by using company liquidations to dispose of and
then receive new exempt shares cannot do so. We will require two years
to pass between the liquidation of the company and the employee
receiving further exempt shares. This treatment strikes the right
balance between preventing abuse and ensuring that genuine
entrepreneurs are not unfairly
hit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:23:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020695000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#13020695000071">Finally,
the legislation will prevent the manipulation of share values, for
example, by placing restrictions on them so that an employee can
receive shares that are in fact worth more than £50,000. For the
purposes of the capital gains tax exemption the value of shares will be
based on an unrestricted market share. Taken together the measures and
the safeguards outlined in the draft legislation will ensure that the
tax benefits of a new 
<?notus-xml column=308?>employment status can be misused. I hope that that
goes some way to satisfying the noble Baroness, Lady
Brinton<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:23:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020695000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#13020695000072"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deben" PimsId="5754" UID="13020695000136" xid="2031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#13020695000136">Lord

works, arguing about how much it costs the Treasury is not sensible? If
it works, it will create jobs and make wealth, and the cost to the
Treasury will be nil. If it does not work, nobody will take it up and
the cost to the Treasury will be nil. It seems to me that this is not a
necessary discussion. The only thing that we do not want is for it to
be misused. The noble Viscount has explained how the Government intend
to do that. No doubt they will do their usual thing of bringing in some
more measures to stop it if that were to happen. The real fact is that
this is one part of the argument that really does not hold water. We
have to accept that if it does not work we have wasted a bit of time,
which is not terrible, but if it does work we will have been proved
wrong and I will be happy about it. The Treasury will not lose out

would be helpful to the House to outline the safeguards and to
reiterate that the Government have thought very carefully about these
issues. Taking up some of the comments made by my noble friend Lord
Deben, I emphasise again that it is a risk-reward status as the
employee shareholder. The award is: yes, the opportunity is there to be
given from between £2,000 and £50,000 and to be aware
that if it is £20,000, £30,000, or whatever the figure
might be, and the share price happened to double, the total amount,
including the doubling would be free from capital gains tax. That is
the reward bit, but equally, I am also realistic enough to say that it
is possible that the shares might indeed be worth nothing. That is the
risk, and it is best to be quite straight and open about that
particular issue. With that in mind I hope that the noble Lord is

another part of the Government produces a proposal, which we are

the Government had an official review—the Nuttall

share ownership. That review made some 30 recommendations. I
have the report here. Most of them were excellent recommendations, some
of which the Government accepted and some of which they were unable to
accept. I simply note that not one of those recommendations of the
review that the Government set up specifically to promote wider share
ownership related to the creation of an employee ownership scheme akin
to the one that we are debating today, involved issuing shares in

question I want to ask the noble Viscount is: if this is such a good
idea, why was it not recommended by Nuttall? Secondly, I want to
reiterate all the specific problems relating to the scheme, which have
become very clear in our debates this afternoon. There is the problem
of compulsion in respect of benefit claimants and the opening to
discrimination claims, which the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, highlighted.
That could mean that there will be an explosion of very expensive and
difficult cases before employment tribunals because of the removal of
essential rights that will leave employees with no other recourse than
discrimination when they believe that they have been badly treated.
There is the problem of cost which we have just debated in the previous
group of amendments, and a whole set of issues that we have not debated
but which were debated in the House of Commons about the status of
the shares themselves, such as the voting nature of the
shares and how the shares will be tradable, given that most of them are
intended to be among the 6,000 companies that the noble Viscount has
highlighted. There are start-up companies whose shares will not be
listed, so we must ensure that there is a market in which they can sell
shares and terms under which they sell them, given that they may have
to sell them back to their own companies when those companies are under
some stress. There is a whole set of issues relating to the working of
the scheme which makes it highly problematic and which may leave small
shareholders, in particular, who do have not much money themselves
without resources to take independent financial and legal advice. They
could be very seriously exposed.</hs_para>

Flight, told the Committee earlier that if he was 40 years younger, he
would relish the opportunity to take advantage of the status and that
it would have spurred him to the creation of new companies and new
employment. If they were the groups we are talking about, that would be
one case. But, as legislators, we are concerned that substantial
numbers of employees who do not have access to financial and legal

whole is that almost nobody to whom this proposal is targeted welcomes
it. The Government’s own consultation showed that an
overwhelming majority of those who responded, including those who
responded from within the business community, either thought that this
proposal was irrelevant or were actively hostile to it. The noble
Viscount cited a few instances earlier of individuals who support it.
However, of the 219 consultation responses, only five welcomed the
proposal. Five out of 219 is about the same ratio of supporters to
opponents as we have seen in your Lordships’ House as this
proposal has been debated. That seems to me a compelling reason why the

Pannick:</Member></B> My Lords, I agree with all that has been said by
the noble Lord, Lord Adonis. Clause 27 is wrong in principle. It
contains inadequate safeguards both in relation to the loss of welfare
benefits for those prospective employees who do not wish to give up
their statutory employment rights, and also in respect of the need for
legal and financial advice for those who are prepared to give up those
rights. Clause 27 will also be expensive to the Treasury if there is a
take-up, or there is going to be very limited demand. I note that the
noble Viscount has attempted to provide the evidence on which the
Government estimate that 6,000 companies may be interested in Clause
27. I look forward to seeing that material. I, too, very much hope that
the Government will listen to the debates that we have had this
afternoon, and take the wise step of withdrawing Clause 27 before we

the Chancellor might allow there to be no income tax on grants of up to
£2,000, as I understand it, the spirit of the provision is more
about the go-getter employee shareholders. I would suggest that if
there is income tax on amounts over £2,000, this scheme will not
get anywhere because the amount of tax that people pay will be quite
disproportionate to the risk they are taking on their equity and to the
values—as the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, pointed out—of
what they are giving up. It is important to sort out by the time we

about this clause. The Government are taking this action to offer
flexibility and choice for both companies and people, and this is the
right thing to do. The Government know from their engagement with
employer organisations and business that there is concern
about facing weak or vexatious claims in employment tribunals. This new
employment status will address some of these concerns especially in new
and fast-growing companies. Importantly, this new status gives people
the opportunity to own part of their company and benefit
from any growth with favourable tax treatment, which was mentioned
earlier in our 
<?notus-xml column=312?>debate today. Employee shareholders will receive at least £2,000
of shares in the employing company or its parent company. Gains on the
first £50,000-worth of these shares will not be subject to
capital gains tax. Employee shareholders will have different employment
rights compared to employees and
workers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000011">Before
a company offers a person an employee shareholder contract, they will
need to think carefully about the implications of offering equity in
their company. There are many possible implications, but the current
owners will first need to be comfortable with diluting their
shareholding, an issue which was raised by my noble friend Lady Brinton
earlier. If the shares being offered are part of a fresh issue of
shares, this will result in each existing shareholder holding a smaller
share in the company. This may not be something that the existing
shareholders would be willing to do, particularly if they worked hard
to build the company up and invested time, money and know-how in that
company.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000012">It
is important to recognise that an owner of a company, when giving
shares to an employee shareholder, is giving away not only the value of
the shares issued but possibly a share in the future profits and some
of the control. Offering shares to employee shareholders could in some
circumstances lead to a shift in the balance of power in the company.
Companies will also need to consider if they can afford to issue shares
to potential employee shareholders. If they can, it could impact on the
dividends of existing shareholders or reserves being
reduced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000013">The
rewards for both parties could be significant. Let us remember that
companies will have completed an extensive recruitment and selection
process, ensuring that any new personnel have the right mix of skills
and knowledge. Therefore they will not offer this new status
of employee shareholder lightly. A growing company may consider that by
offering this new status they are demonstrating a long-term commitment
to that person. In turn, the employee shareholder will be able to reap
the rewards of a successful company.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130206108000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000014">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>
reiterate that this status will not be suitable for all, just those
where it makes commercial sense for both parties. We envisage such
companies to be those that want to encourage a culture of engagement
and shared ownership and—this is the most crucial
point—where they expect significant growth and want to use this
incentive to attract and retain high-calibre
individuals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130206108000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000015">Similarly, a person
being offered an employee shareholder contract will need to consider
the implications of being an employee shareholder. This is a most
important point to emphasise. They will need to consider carefully the
terms and conditions of the employment on offer and decide whether it
is suitable for them in both the long and short term, as we all know
that the value of shares can go both up and down. Some potential
employee shareholders may not disclose at interview their long-term
career plans. Perhaps they expect to stay in the role for only a short
time. It may be that they are moving abroad in the future or expect to
undertake further studies—that is their own business—and
they may not want to invest their time in a company to realise
long-term rewards. Equally, someone  
<?notus-xml column=313?>looking only for short-term work may consider that this is exactly the
right kind of contract as they could benefit from any short-term growth
in the share
value<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:40:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000016">To
ensure that this new employment status is suitable for both the company
and employee shareholder, both will need to be confident that the
status is right for them. This means that the company may have to sell
its growth prospects to the potential employee shareholder as both a
viable investment as well as a potential
employer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:41:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000017">It
is important that we take time to understand how this new status will
work in practice and I am sure that doing so will allay some concerns
that have already been raised. Clause 27 establishes three clear
qualifying criteria, all of which must be fulfilled before a person can
be considered an employee shareholder. The first criterion is that the
person must agree to become an employee shareholder—it is their
choice. Secondly, the person must receive at least £2,000-worth
of shares in the employing or parent company that are fully paid up at
the commencement of the employment. This means that these shares will
have no debts attached to them. Finally, the individual must not make
any payment, in money or in other form, for the shares given. If any of
these criteria are not fulfilled and the person is still taken on by
the company, they are likely to be legally considered an employee.
This, again, addresses the question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady
Turner, earlier. This means that they will have all the employment
rights of an
employee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:42:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000018">I
recognise that there have been some concerns that existing employees
will be coerced into accepting a change to their employment contract
that would make them employee shareholders rather than employees. The
Government do not want people to be coerced into the new employment
status. This is why Clause 27 establishes clear protections for
existing
employees<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:42:31"></hs_TimeCode>. The
clause creates two new employment rights—the right not to be
unfairly dismissed and the right not to be subjected to a detriment if
an employee turns down an employee shareholder contract. This means
that if an employee chooses not to sign an employee shareholder
contract and is then overlooked for promotion or disadvantaged in any
other way, that person could present a claim to an employment tribunal.
Secondly, if an employee does not sign an employee shareholder contract
and is dismissed for refusing to do so, it would be automatically
unfair<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:43:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000019">It
is clear that all parties will need to consider carefully whether this
status is right for the company. Giving away equity is not to be done
lightly and many will not think that this is the right course of action
for them. Potential employee shareholders will need to consider whether
they want to have shares in the company. To help both
parties, the Government will be offering guidance on what both
individuals and companies will need to consider before entering into a
contract of this type. The House will not need any reminder that we
discussed guidance earlier
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:43:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000020">Clause
27 stipulates that the minimum value of shares is £2,000 in the
employing or parent company. The clause does not stipulate the type of
shares that a company can issue, nor does it stipulate the type of 
<?notus-xml column=314?>shares issued. We believe that this is best decided by the companies in
order to suit their commercial situation. The shares may have varying
rights, but it is up to them to decide what is right for both parties.
Some companies may want to offer significantly more than the
£2,000 minimum value of shares. In some companies, new employee
shareholders will want to be fully involved as the company grows and
take an active role in the progress of the
company<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:44:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000021">The
Government have considered what happens to the shares when an employee
shareholder leaves the company they work for. We expect that employers
and employee shareholders will agree sensible terms for the disposal
and buyback of shares. These terms should normally be part of the
contract that the employee shareholder signs. However, many different
scenarios might result from an employee shareholder holding shares. The
shares’ value may change; the shares may have been traded; in
other cases, the employee shareholder may want to keep hold of the
shares on leaving the employment and the company may agree to
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:44:53"></hs_TimeCode>.
The Government do not want to make rules that tie the
employers’ hands; they want to give them flexibility in what
they and the employee shareholder decide is the best way to dispose of
shares at the end of the employment
relationship<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:45:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000022">However,
the Government recognise people’s concerns that employee
shareholders could be at a financial disadvantage if companies decide
not to offer a fair way of realising the value of their shares. The
Government amended the clause in the other place to include a provision
to provide power to regulate buyback where the company has undertaken
to buy back
shares<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:45:34"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:45:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="130206108000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000132">6.45

now answer briefly some, if not all, of the questions raised by noble
Lords in this debate on the clause. First, the noble Baroness, Lady
Donaghy, raised the issue of who was supporting this new status. I
could give many quotes but a powerful one has come from the major legal
firm of Freshfields. It
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="130206108000119" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000119">“For
companies whose shares have a real potential for significant growth
over a relatively short period, the free gift of shares combined with
the available capital gains tax relief may assist companies in
attracting and being able to hire, or indeed retain, high calibre or
skilled employees who may be prepared not only to waive the required
employment rights but to accept below market salaries. This may assist
small cash-strapped
enterprises<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:46:28"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="130206108000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000024">The
noble Lord, Lord Adonis, raised the issue of the consultation process.
He said that he thought the consultation responses showed no or very
little support for the measure—in other words, why were we
continuing with it? We consulted on how to implement this option but
not on whether we should proceed in principle. It is a good additional
option for companies and individuals. It adds to the existing status of
employee and worker and provides those taking it up with flexibility as
well as with an opportunity to share the reward and risk that comes
with having an interest in a growing
company<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:47:07"></hs_TimeCode>.
We recognise, again, that not all companies will wish to use this new
status, and that is entirely understandable. What is important is to
give those companies which wish to take people on in this different
way, and to award them share equity, an opportunity to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:47:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Adonis, raised the issue of the Nuttall review and
asked how this fits in with the employee ownership agenda. “Why
was this not recommended by Nuttall”, I think was the
precise question that he asked. It is important not to
confuse employee shareholders with the employee ownership agenda. Some
companies may wish to offer employee shareholder contracts to their
workforce to encourage ownership. It is one of many ways of encouraging
ownership. The employee shareholder status is separate from the Nuttall
review as it is a new employment
status<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:47:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000026">In
conclusion, I return to my opening remarks. The aim of this employment
status is to offer people and companies further flexibility and choice
in the employment contracts they may use. Removing the clause from the
Bill would deny this opportunity to companies and people who have the
appetite to share in the risks and rewards of a growing
company.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="130206108000165" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000165">Clause

Speaker, I have a deep affection for our National Health Service. I
will never forget all of the things doctors and nurses have done for my
family in times of pain and difficulty. I love our NHS. I think it is a
fantastic institution and a great organisation that says a huge amount
about our country and who we are. I always want to think the best about
it. I have huge admiration for the doctors, nurses and other health
workers who dedicate their lives to caring for our loved
ones.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000043">Nevertheless,
we do them—and the whole reputation of our NHS—a grave
disservice if we fail to speak out when things go wrong. What happened
at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust between 2005 and 2009 was not
just wrong, it was truly dreadful. Hundreds of people suffered from the
most appalling neglect and mistreatment. There were patients so
desperate for water that they were drinking from dirty flower vases.
Many were given the wrong medication, treated roughly, or left to wet
themselves and then to lie in urine for days. Relatives were ignored or
even reproached when they pointed out the most basic things which could
have saved their loved ones from horrific pain or even death. We can
only begin to imagine the suffering endured by those whose trust in our
health service was betrayed at their most vulnerable moment. That is
why I believe it is right to make this Statement
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000044">There
was a healthcare commission investigation in 2000; a first independent
inquiry from Robert Francis in February 2010; and, long before that,
the testimony of bereaved relatives such as Julie Bailey and the Cure
the NHS campaign. They all laid bare the most despicable catalogue of
clinical and managerial failures at the 
<?notus-xml column=318?>trust. But<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:56:41"></hs_TimeCode> even
after these reports, some really important questions remained
unanswered. How were these appalling events allowed to happen and how
were they allowed to continue for so long? Why were so many bereaved
families and whistleblowers who spoke out ignored for so long? Could
something like this ever happen again? These were basic questions about
wider failures in the system—not just at the hospital but right
across the NHS, including its regulators and the Department of Health.
That is why the families called for this public inquiry and that is why
this Government granted one. I am sure that the whole House will want
to join with me in expressing our thanks to Robert Francis and his
entire team for all their work over the past three
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000045">The
inquiry finds that the appalling suffering at Mid-Staffordshire
hospital was primarily caused by a “serious failure” on
the part of the trust board, which failed to listen to patients and
staff and failed to tackle what Robert Francis calls
“an insidious negative culture involving a tolerance of poor
standards and a disengagement from managerial and leadership
responsibilities”. But the inquiry finds that the failure went
far wider. The primary care trust assumed that others were taking
responsibility and so made little attempt to collect proper information
on the quality of
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000046">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:58:07"></hs_TimeCode>
strategic health authority was “far too remote from the patients
it was there to serve, and it failed to be sufficiently sensitive to
signs that patients might be at risk”. Regulators, including
Monitor and the then Healthcare Commission, failed to protect patients
from substandard care. Too many doctors “kept their heads
down” instead of speaking out when things went wrong. The Royal
College of Nursing was “ineffective both as a professional
representative organisation and as a trade union”, and the
Department of Health too remote from the reality of the services that
they
oversee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000047">The
way Robert Francis chronicles the evidence of systemic failure means we
cannot say with confidence that failings of care are limited to one
hospital. But let us also be clear about what the report does not say.
Francis does not blame any specific policy; he does not blame the
previous Secretary of State for Health; and he says we should not seek
scapegoats. Looking beyond the specific failures that he catalogues so
clearly, I believe we can identify in the report three fundamental
problems with the culture of our National Health
Service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000048">The
first is a focus on finance and figures at the expense of
patient care; Francis says that explicitly. This was underpinned by a
preoccupation with a narrow set of top-down targets pursued in the case
of Mid Staffordshire to the exclusion of patient safety or listening to
what patients, relatives—and indeed many staff—were
saying.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000049">Secondly,
there was an attitude that patient care was always someone
else’s problem. In short, no one was accountable.
Third<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:09:14"></hs_TimeCode>ly, he
talks about defensiveness and complacency. Instead of facing up to and
acting on data which should have implied a real cause for concern,
Francis finds, all too often, a culture of explaining only the
positives rather than any critical analysis. Put simply, managers were
suppressing inconvenient facts in favour of looking for comfort in
positive information.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=319?><hs_para UID="130206108000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000050">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:35:45"></hs_TimeCode>
is one of the most disturbing findings. It is bad enough that terrible
things happened at that hospital, but this inquiry is telling us is
that there was a manifest failure to act on the data available not just
at the hospital but more widely. As Francis
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="130206108000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000122">“In
the end, the truth was uncovered … mainly because of the
persistent complaints made by a determined group of patients and those
close to
them”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="130206108000108" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000108">The
anger of the families is completely understandable. Every honourable
Member in this House would be angry—furious—if their
mother or father were treated in this way, and rightly
so.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130206108000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000051">The
previous Government commissioned the first report from Robert Francis
and, when he saw that report, the former Secretary of State, now the
shadow Health Secretary, was right to apologise for what went wrong.
This public inquiry not only repeats earlier findings but also shows
wider systemic failings, so I would like to go further as Prime
Minister and apologise to the families of all those who have suffered
for the way that the system allowed such horrific abuse to go unchecked
and unchallenged for so long. On behalf of the Government—and
indeed our country—I am truly
sorry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000052">Since
the problems at Mid Staffordshire Hospital first came to light, a
number of important steps have been taken. The previous Government set
up the National Quality Board and the quality accounts system. This
Government have put compassion ahead of process-driven bureaucratic
targets and put quality of care on a par with quality of treatment. We
have set that out explicitly in the mandate of the NHS Commissioning
Board, together with a new vision for compassionate nursing. We have
introduced a tough new programme for tracking and eliminating falls,
pressure sores and hospital infections, and we have demanded nursing
rounds every hour, in every ward of every
hospital.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000053">However,
it is clear that we need to do more. We will study every one of the 290
recommendations in today’s report and respond in detail next
month, but the recommendations include the three core
areas—patient care, accountability and defeating
complacency—on which I believe we should make more immediate
progress. Let me say a word about
each<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:35:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000054">The
first is how we put patient care ahead of finances. Today, when a
hospital fails financially, its chair can be dismissed and the board
suspended, but failures in care rarely carry such consequences. That is
not right. We will create a single failure regime where the suspension
of the board can be triggered by failures in care as well as failures
in finance, and we will put the voice of patients and staff at the
heart of the way that hospitals go about their
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000055">In Mid
Staffordshire, as far back as 2006, there was a survey in which only
about a quarter of staff said that they would actually want one of
their own relatives to use the hospital they worked in. During the
following two years, bereaved relatives produced case after dreadful
case and campaign after chilling campaign, but those voices and
horrific cases were ignored. Indeed, the hospital was upgraded to
foundation trust status during that period. We need the words of
patients and front-line 
<?notus-xml column=320?>staff to ring through the boardrooms of hospitals and beyond to the
regulators and the Department of Health
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000056">From
this year every patient, every carer, every member of staff will be
given the opportunity to say whether they would recommend their
hospital to their friends or family. This will be published and the
board will be held to account for its response. Put simply, where a
significant proportion of patients or staff raise serious concerns
about what is happening in a hospital, immediate inspection will result
and suspension of the hospital board may well
follow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000057">Quality
of care means not accepting that bed sores and hospital infections are
somehow occupational hazards and that a little of them is
somehow okay. They are not okay. They are unacceptable—full
stop, end of story. That is what zero harm means. I have asked Don
Berwick—who has advised President Obama on this issue—to
make zero harm a reality in our
NHS.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000058">Francis
makes other recommendations. Today, you can give hands-on care in a
hospital ward with no training at all. Francis says that that is wrong,
and I agree. Some simple but profound things need to happen in our NHS
and our hospitals. Nurses should be hired and promoted on the basis of
having compassion as a vocation, not just academic qualifications. We
need a style of leadership from senior nurses which means that poor
practice is not tolerated and is driven off the wards. Another issue is
whether pay should be linked to quality of care rather than just time
served at a hospital. I favour this
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000059">Secondly,
there is accountability and transparency. The first Francis report set
out clearly what happened within Stafford hospital. It should have led
to those responsible being brought to book by the board, the
regulators, the professional bodies—and, yes, even by the
courts. But this did not
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000060">Most
people will want to know why on earth not. We expect hospitals to take
disciplinary action against staff who abuse their patients. We expect
professional regulators to strike off doctors and nurses who seriously
breach their professional codes, and, yes, we expect the justice system
to prosecute those suspected of criminal acts, whether they take place
in a hospital or anywhere else. In Stafford, these expectations were
badly let down. The system failed. That is one of the main reasons we
needed this
inquiry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000061">Now
that the recommendations about systemic failure are public, the
regulatory bodies in particular have difficult questions to answer. The
Nursing and Midwifery Council and the General Medical Council need to
explain why, so far, no one has been struck off. The Secretary of State
for Health has today invited them to explain what steps they will take
to strengthen their systems of accountability in the light of this
report, and we will ask the Law Commission to advise on sweeping away
the Nursing and Midwifery Council’s outdated and inflexible
decision-making
processes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000062">The
Health and Safety Executive also needs to explain its decisions not to
prosecute in specific cases. Indeed, Robert Francis makes a strong
argument that the executive is too distant from hospitals and not the
right organisation to be focusing on healthcare and criminal
prosecutions in such cases. We will look 
<?notus-xml column=321?>closely at his recommendation to transfer the right to conduct criminal
prosecutions from the Health and Safety Executive to the Care Quality
Commission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000063">Thirdly,
we must purge the culture of complacency that is undermining care in
our country. This requires a clear view about what is acceptable and
what is not. In our schools, we have a clear system of deciding whether
a school has the right culture and whether it is succeeding or failing.
It is a system based on the judgment of independent experts, who walk
the corridors of the school and analyse more than just statistics. The
public therefore know which schools near them are outstanding and which
are failing. They have a right to know the same about our hospitals. We
need a hospital inspection regime that does not just look at numerical
targets but examines the quality of care and makes an open, public and
explicit
judgement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000064">So
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:08:07"></hs_TimeCode> have asked the
Care Quality Commission to create a new post—a Chief Inspector
of Hospitals—to take personal responsibility for this task. I
want the new inspections regime to start this autumn. We will look at
the law to make sure that the inspector’s judgment is about
whether a hospital is clean, safe and caring, rather than just an
exercise in bureaucratic box-ticking. In the mean time, I have asked
the NHS Medical Director—Professor Sir Bruce Keogh—to
conduct an immediate investigation into care at hospitals with the
highest mortality rates and to check that urgent remedial action is
being
taken.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000065">Complacency
in the system has meant that all too often, patient complaints have
been ignored. I am today asking the honourable Member for Cynon Valley
and the Chief Executive of South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,
Tricia Hart, specifically to advise how hospitals in the NHS should
handle complaints better in
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000066">I
have talked today about some of the systemic failures, but at the heart
of any system are the people who work in it and the values and vocation
that they hold. As Francis says early on in his report, and it is worth
me quoting in
full:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="130206108000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000123">‘Healthcare
is not an activity short of systems intended to maintain and improve
standards, regulate the conduct of staff, and report and scrutinise
performance. Continuous efforts have been made to refine and improve
the way these work. Yet none of them, from local groups to the national
regulators, from local councillors to the Secretary of State,
appreciated the scale of the deficiencies at Stafford and, therefore,
over a period of years did anything effective to stop
them’.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="130206108000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000067">What
makes our National Health Service special is the very simple principle

happens to someone you love, you know that whoever you are, wherever

there is a place you can go where people will look after you and do
everything they can to make things right again. The shocking truth is
that this precious principle of British life was broken in Mid

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord the
Leader of the House for repeating the Prime Minister’s Statement
and also for the tone that he has adopted in repeating the Statement. I
remind the House of my health interest in the
register.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000071">The
NHS represents the best values of this country, but what happened at
Stafford was an appalling betrayal of those values. We all place trust
in the National Health Service. We expect hospitals to be places of the
utmost compassion and the highest standards of care. However, at
Stafford patients became victims, left lying in soiled sheets, with
untreated bedsores, desperately calling for help, but with no response.
Relatives who pleaded for assistance were ignored or even made to feel
intimidated. I join the noble Lord the Leader of the House in paying
tribute to all those former patients, relatives and staff who came
forward to speak out, including those who gave evidence to this and to
previous inquiries. I also thank Robert Francis for his work on this
and his previous inquiry.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130206108000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000072">What happened at
Stafford was not typical of the NHS. Day in, day out, the vast majority
of those who work in the NHS deliver great care to patients up and down
the country. They are as horrified at all of this as we are. When the
first investigation laid bare the facts in 2009, the then Prime
Minister apologised on behalf of the Government and the NHS to the
patients and families who suffered so badly at Stafford hospital. He
was right to do so. I reaffirm that today and our thoughts are with all
the victims and their families. What happened has no place in any NHS
hospital. We must ensure that it does not and cannot happen
again.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130206108000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000073">Today’s report
makes clear that primary responsibility for what happened lay with the
board of the hospital. However, there are wider lessons that
politicians on all sides must learn, including a lesson for all
parties about the dangers of frequent reorganisations of the
NHS.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130206108000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000074">I
should like to ask the noble Lord the Leader of the House some specific
questions. First, regarding the voice of the patients, effective
regulation is essential, but regulators cannot be everywhere, spotting
every problem. Patients, their families and staff are everywhere, so we
must ensure that they are properly heard. The challenge is to change
the culture of the NHS and to support rather than to shut out people
who complain. The NHS constitution offers protection for whistleblowers
and we support moves to strengthen that. However, the report also
highlights criticisms and concerns about both previous and current
arrangements for patient bodies. Does the noble Lord agree that,
whatever bodies we choose to represent patients, they need to be
independent and to have the powers to be an effective voice and
challenge to the system. I am sure the noble Lord will have had
reported to him last night’s debate on the regulations in
relation to local Healthwatch and concern that, as they were drafted,
they restrict 
<?notus-xml column=323?>the activity of local Healthwatch to campaign. I wonder
whether, as part of the consideration of the recommendations of the
Francis review, the Government would agree to look at the remit and
powers of local Healthwatch in order that we might consider
strengthening
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000075">I move
to the question of staffing. The basic requirements of any NHS hospital
are that there are sufficient staff to look after patients and that
they act with compassion. In too many cases at Stafford, this did not
happen. Compassion should always be at the heart of nursing, and it
needs to be at the heart of nurse training. We support moves to make
this more central to nurse training. As Robert Francis has previously
said in explaining what went
wrong,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="130206108000127" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000127">“the
overwhelmingly prevalent factors were a lack of staff, both in terms of
absolute numbers and appropriate skills”.</hs_quotefo>
<hs_parafo UID="130206108000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000109">Does the noble Lord
accept the report’s point that we need to consider benchmarks on
staff numbers and skills? Can the noble Lord comment on any resource
implications that follow from such agreement? Noble Lords will be aware
that many NHS trusts are facing severe financial challenges at the
moment. Do the Government consider that the NHS has enough resources to
ensure that it has the right number of staff in place? This morning the
Prime Minister assured the other place that funding is there, but I
wonder whether we can be so
confident.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130206108000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000076">My
third question relates to regulation. The problems at Stafford should
have been picked up much earlier. Monitor and the Healthcare Commission
should have worked together much more closely. The Francis report
recommends that the two should come together or evolve into a merger. I
was rather surprised to read on the <I>Health Service
Journal</I> webpage tonight that the Secretary of
State has already rejected this recommendation. I was very surprised
because in the Statement that the noble Lord has just repeated he said
that every recommendation would be studied fully. Can he confirm
whether a decision has been made that a merger of Monitor and CQC will
not take place? That is a very important
matter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000077">In
his Statement the Prime Minister also said that a chief inspector of
hospitals would be appointed in the autumn. Can the noble Lord confirm
that legislation would be required for that, or is there to be an
instruction to CQC to make such an appointment? Is it intended that the
remit of the chief inspector of hospitals should cover other parts of
the National Health Service? Will there be a chief inspector of primary
care? Will there be a chief inspector of social care? Is it intended
that the chief inspector will become in effect the boss of CQC, or is
this to be a separate appointment? If it is to be a separate
appointment, will this person hold independent office, or will he or
she be part of the managerial hierarchy of
CQC?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000078">Robert
Francis rightfully made a great deal of the importance of patient
safety. He also referred to the functions of the former National
Patient Safety Agency with regard to incident reporting. He
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="130206108000124" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000124">“More

noble Lord will be aware that the Health and Social Care Act
abolished the National Patient Safety Agency. As part of
their consideration of the recommendations 
<?notus-xml column=324?>of Francis, I ask that the Government consider re-establishing the
National Patient Safety Agency as a wholly independent
organisation.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130206108000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000079">I
come to the question of healthcare assistants, who do so much important
work in our hospital wards and communities. Does the noble Lord agree
that we need training and registration to improve standards and safety?
In paragraph 1.194 of the summary of Robert Francis’s findings,
he makes the point
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="130206108000128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000128">“healthcare
support workers … are not subject to any system of
registration”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="130206108000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000111">He
says
firmly:</hs_parafo><hs_quote UID="130206108000125" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000125">“A
registration system should be created under which no unregistered
person should be permitted to provide for reward direct physical care
to patients currently under the care and treatment of a registered
nurse or a registered doctor or who are dependent on such care by
reason of disability or infirmity in any hospital or care home
setting”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="130206108000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000112">I
am sure the noble Lord will have been briefed that in our debates on
the Health and Social Care Bill as it went through your
Lordships’ House we argued strongly for there to be regulation
of healthcare assistants. The Government resisted that. In their
consideration of the Francis inquiry recommendations, will they now
give sympathetic consideration to the registration of healthcare
workers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:21:07"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130206108000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000080">I
come to my fourth question, which concerns foundation trusts. I am the
chair of a foundation trust. I am enthusiastic for them, as I think are
many noble Lords on both sides of the House. The journey to foundation
status has been a beneficial process for many trusts, but in the case
of Stafford it was not. Has the noble Lord made any reassessment of the
current timetable for a trust to achieve foundation status and whether
more flexibility is needed? Can he assure me that no pressure will be
put on the NHS Trust Development Authority to speed up the
authorisation of foundation
trusts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:21:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000081">The
original government intention was for all NHS trusts to become
foundation trust by 2014. I understand that that has slipped. I should
be grateful if the noble Lord would confirm that the essential
requirement is that a trust is ready to become a foundation trust, not
having to fit a timetable that would lead to the kind of pressures that
the Mid Staffordshire trust clearly felt itself
under<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:22:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000082">That
brings me to targets. It was suggested, in the briefing before the
report was published, that targets themselves were to blame. However,
today’s report does not support that. It says
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="130206108000129" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000129">“it
is not suggested that properly designed targets, appropriately
monitored, cannot provide considerable benefit to
patients”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="130206108000113" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000113">Does
the noble Lord accept, as Francis’s analysis suggests, that the
problem at Stafford was how the A&amp;E target was managed by the
hospital, and that many hospitals up and down the country have
delivered excellent care while meeting the accident and emergency
target? We must never go back to the bad old days when people were left
waiting for hours on trolleys and 18 months for an
operation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:23:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130206108000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000083">I
turn to integration. The ageing society is bringing a whole new set of
demands on to the NHS: a group of elderly and infirm patients who
require not just  
<?notus-xml column=325?>physical treatment for their immediate illness but much
greater care and attention for their basic needs.
As Francis says, we must address this new challenge that the NHS faces
and ensure that we avoid a repeat of what happened at Stafford. Does
the noble Lord agree that in every hospital we need to put in place the
right support for the whole of a person’s needs, including for
our elderly population? Does he agree that that means breaking down the
barriers between healthcare and social care? Does he also agree that
the cultural change that the Prime Minister referred to in relation to
hospitals applies as much to community, primary and social
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:24:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

number of the noble Lords who are here at this time of night to listen
to the Statement indicates that many noble Lords have a great deal of
interest in this. I ask the noble Lord to pursue through the

debate on the Francis report. That would be very much appreciated by
noble

cannot turn back the clock and undo the damage at Stafford but we owe
it to those who have suffered, to the people of Stafford and to the
country as a whole to work together to act on this report and prevent
a scandal like this from happening elsewhere. We on this
side of the House will play our part in making that
happen.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_06_PT_1/C6977443D0ED9983A2BE9AE31FD270325754012C" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 February 2013">Wednesday,

Hill of Oareford:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful for the way in
which the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, put his questions and
responded. I agree with what he said at the outset about the NHS
representing the best values of our country, his important point that
these awful things are not typical of everything that goes on, and that
there are many hundreds of thousands of people delivering great care.
He is right to remind us of that but also right to be clear, as he was,
that together we need to face up to the problems that this extremely
important report from Mr Francis has uncovered. I also take the noble
Lord’s point, which the Francis report mentions, about the
dangers of over-frequent reorganisation. All parties need to be
conscious of that, and I think that all politicians are sometimes
guilty of it. One of the great lessons of all systems is that the
simpler and more stable one can keep them, the better the framework in
which people have to
operate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:26:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000087">I
agree with the noble Lord about the importance of patients having a
strong and independent voice. I think that is the way he put it. I
certainly know from the world of education that it is hugely important
to find ways to ensure that parents and those who care and have to use
the services can plug into the system and can help to hold those
services to account, and the findings in the Francis report underline
the effort that we need to make to ensure that that
happens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:26:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000088">On
the noble Lord’s specific question about Healthwatch, I know
that my noble friend Lord Howe spoke yesterday evening about some of
the ways in which we are trying to strengthen the role and voice of
patients and the public through local Healthwatch. We are determined to
ensure that local Healthwatch can act as an independent and powerful
voice for  
<?notus-xml column=326?>patients in local areas, and we are creating Healthwatch England so that
there is a national voice for patients as well. I agree with him about
the importance of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:27:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble Lord’s emphasis on having compassion at the heart of
medicine. Again, that point came out of the Francis
report<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:27:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000090">On
the question of skills, numbers and finances, the noble Lord is right
to say that that question was put to my right honourable friend the
Prime Minister by the Leader of the Opposition earlier on. My right
honourable friend said that he believes that the resources that are
going into the health service, which are increasing, are in place. I
agree that we have to ensure that every ward has the right mix and
number of doctors, nurses and healthcare assistants so that staff have
the time and the skills to ensure that they are providing
safe and effective care. I believe that the recent nursing vision,
<I>Compassion </I><I>i</I><I>n Practice</I>, set out new measures to
help to ensure that locally, but I know that my right honourable friend
the Health Secretary will study the report to see whether there are
other steps that may need to be
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:28:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000091">On
the subject of the chief inspector, again there is an analogy with
schools. Having a figure that we can identify as a champion of
standards is going to be a good step forward. He or she will be part of
the CQC. The precise process by which they operate will need to be
sorted out in detail over the days and weeks to come, but obviously we
will share that with the noble Lord and other interested
Peers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:29:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000092">On
the noble Lord’s question about the National Patient Safety

the merging of Monitor and the CQC, another important question, the
noble Lord asked for reassurance that a decision on that has not
already been taken. I can say to him that it has not. We have already
made clear that we aim to create more generally a single failure regime
under which organisations can be held accountable for failures in care,
as well as with their finances. Francis’s recommendation to
merge those two organisations is one that we will consider. There are
clearly questions about the balance between making sure that quality is
high and
money<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000094">On
the noble Lord’s important question about the registration and
training of healthcare assistants, we are certainly committed to
supporting healthcare assistants and support workers to provide proper,
compassionate and safe care. We will take Francis’s
recommendations seriously, but the report in another place also points
out, rightly, that compulsory statutory regulation does not necessarily
prevent poor care, and that cultural issues—one of the recurring
themes of the report—are indeed

noble Lord asked about the effect on the quality of care of the process
of moving to foundation trust status. Like the previous Government, we
believe that foundation trusts can make our hospitals more accountable
and responsible and better able to take decisions. However, the move to
trust status for Mid Staffs was at the expense of patient care, and
that was clearly wrong. I agree with the noble Lord that it is a move
that must not be rushed and that patient care 
<?notus-xml column=327?>must come first. In answer to his question: yes,
there will be no pressure. The essential requirement is that they be
ready<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:32:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000096">In
response to the noble Lord’s question about targets, I
accept—and this is clearly the case in all sorts of
areas—that there is a place for sensible targets. We also know
and accept that if we have the wrong targets, or too many of them,
there is sometimes the danger of perverse incentives and confusion as
well. As the noble Lord said, getting that balance right is extremely
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:32:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206108000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206108000097">On
integrated services, it is important to make sure that we are able to
look across the piece, and that there are not the barriers that he
described. Of course I recognise the amount of interest in the subject.

whether we can find an opportunity for a fuller debate through the

certainly recommended a statutory duty of candour, and my right

to that. So far, he has said that he will work through all 290
recommendations in the report, and that the Government aim to give an
initial response within a month. Precisely what the timeframe will be
on all these elements, I cannot say. As my noble friend will
know, in the interim we created legally binding rules that require the
NHS Commissioning Board to insert a contractual duty of candour into
the NHS standard contract in 2013-14. That means that NHS hospitals
will be required contractually to tell patients when they
have been significantly harmed by a patient-safety incident during
their care. Otherwise, I take my noble friend’s point on

the Mid Staffordshire hospital that was guilty of the kind of
wrongdoing that we have been talking about tonight. My noble friend has
made a wonderful, genuinely caring, speech about what has been
happening and his determination to stop it. However, I feel very
strongly about this, because I have tried for years and years, from

many Members know, I produced a long document of 26 cases of the

absolutely certain that every fact I put forward was correct, and that
each patient for whom I pleaded had given me full permission to raise
his or her case. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, might remember the occasion
when I went to him with a long and detailed dossier of these cases. It
was certainly not his fault, but a number of those 26 cases were never
investigated at all, and I never got an answer. I even tried to get
through this House a parents’ protection Bill, which was quietly
squashed at the time. My plea to my noble friend is that he also lets
Members of Parliament, in one House or the other, be heard. They do not
raise cases for fun but because of their feeling for the patients or

nurses has come together to collect the evidence. The evidence base
determines that safe and cost-effective care is determined by the 
<?notus-xml column=329?>safe levels of trained staff—registered

Harris of Haringey:</Member></B> The noble Lord the Leader of the House
has referred to the fact that there is now to be a contractual
obligation of candour on healthcare organisations. Presumably Robert
Francis was aware of that in framing his recommendations, feels that it
is inadequate and is advocating a statutory duty of candour, which, so
far, the Government have resisted. I hope that policy will change. The
noble Lord the Leader of the House also talked about the importance of
an independent voice for patients. Given the suggestion that has been
made about merging Monitor and the CQC, will he accept that it is
therefore inappropriate that Healthwatch England, the national voice of
patients, should be subordinate to that monster new body? Secondly,
does he also accept that it is inappropriate, if you are to have an
independent voice, that local Healthwatch is subordinate to local
authorities, some of the organisations that they are supposed to

difficulties that have arisen in Mid Staffs. The first is Sir David
Nicholson, the chief executive of the NHS Commissioning Board, who was
present in a very senior capacity. I am not trying to blame him, but to

Williams of Crosby:</B> I have much to
comment about on this front, and I am going to finish my sentence. We
all need to be responsible and accountable for making sure that no Mid
Staffs ever happens again. That means that we may not pass the burden
of responsibility to and fro. We all have to accept our common
responsibility, and if that means abandoning party statements, so much

theme, which I think we have all accepted, that there is a
common responsibility. One of the themes of the report is that we
should not seek to single out individuals or particular organisations

South Staffordshire had good healthcare from Stafford hospitals. It was
only in this very bad period that we had these appalling stories, and
we all feel ashamed. It is important to recognise that there was good
healthcare before, and there must be after. In that context, will my
noble friend assure me that all those appointed to boards of hospitals
will receive adequate training about what their true responsibilities

Patel:</Member></B> My Lords, I have questions relating to two areas in
the Statement on which a decision has already been made. The first
relates to the Prime Minister asking Sir Don Berwick to advise on zero
harm. The noble Lord the Leader of the House did not answer the
question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, about whether it is now
the Government’s intention to re-establish the National Patient
Safety Agency. I declare an interest as I was chairman of the National
Patient Safety Agency for four years. I have worked with Sir Don
Berwick in my hospital. The implementation of zero harm is possible in
patient care in certain areas, but to implement it requires an
organisation in every hospital and a national organisation to monitor
it. How is intended that that will happen? The second decision was to
ask Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director, immediately to investigate
hospitals that have high mortality rates. That implies that we know
which hospitals they are. Will the noble Lord the Leader comment on
that? I hope that investigation will also include all higher mortality
rates including still births, neonatal deaths and infant
deaths<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:49:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

elliptically to the noble Lord’s first point about whether we
had plans to reintroduce the agency by saying that it had been merged.
We do not have plans to reintroduce it. On his second question about
Sir Don Berwick, it is for him now to work out how he will carry out
his 
<?notus-xml column=332?>review and come back to us with his recommendations. On his third
question about the immediate inquiry being carried out by Sir Bruce,
mortality rates are the factor he will take into account in identifying

Francis quite rightly recognises the contribution made by
healthcare support workers. He makes seven recommendations
about how they should be included within a reinvigorated National
Health Service. The report makes the claim that healthcare support
workers have to be properly trained to appropriate standards. I want to
ask the Leader of the House two questions. First, will those standards
be set independently, by the NMC or another body, and not the
department? Secondly, will he guarantee to the House tonight that,
whatever those standards are, the training will be mandatory, not an

of State for Health has to look at all the recommendations, working out
how to respond to them and the most sensible way forward. However, it
is clear that the standards would need to carry weight and be
recognised as doing so. I know my right honourable friend the Secretary

Earl of Dundee:</Member></B> My Lords, in my remarks today I would like
briefly to connect together three themes. The first is the huge
importance of local democracy—its obvious and immediate
relevance; its scope for enhancing national and international
democracy; and conversely regarding the latter, its ability to reduce
or remove what to some extent has lately become alienation or even
mistrust. Secondly, there is the role of the Council of Europe in
promoting local and regional democracy. Thirdly, there is the
opportunity which our Parliament and Government now have to assist, to
guide, to lead initiatives of good practice and to nurture and
encourage
progress.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000039">The
European Court of Human Rights was able to sharpen our focus upon local
democracy. For its recognition of the right to individual petition puts
state and citizen on an equal footing. However, it took the devastation
of two world wars for that notion to be adopted. Previously, it had
been assumed that the state would always come first even if that
precedence infringed the rights of the individual. Then after European
Union expansion in 2004, there was the Warsaw Summit declaration in
2005. This calls for the reinvigoration of democracy, both nationally
and internationally, through its strengthening at local and grass-roots
levels. Not least, therefore, have those two interventions helped to
revise political theory and how we view the Council of Europe’s
affiliation of 47 states. For now we evaluate the worth of political
delivery much more in terms of the well-being of families, communities
and people in their daily lives. To those priorities we believe
governments and institutions should play second fiddle; yet at the same
time we know perfectly well that thereby the role and sovereignty of
nation states need not be in the least undermined or
diminished.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000040">National
democracy is never short-changed by local democracy. In fact, the
reverse is the case. For more often than not its quality and validity
reflect a combination of local results in the first place. It follows
from this that the advance of local democracy or active citizenship is
no longer speculative or part of some new political advocacy. Instead,
it has become a consensual matter for all of us to see how best to put
it into practice within Europe’s present stage of
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000041">This
leads to the role of the Council of Europe. Already that institution
has made a wonderful and unprecedented contribution to stability, human
rights and the rule of law. Its membership now includes most of central
and eastern Europe. We are enormously grateful. However, its current
dealings with local democracy should be changed in certain respects.
Within the Council of Europe itself there should be a common 
<?notus-xml column=334?>agenda. This is lacking. Such a common agenda ought to seek to implement
the Chavez report—agreeing priorities annually, undertaking
activity competently and transparently and adopting administrative
structures which correspond to the new
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000042">Here
I pay tribute to my noble friend Lady Hanham. During the United
Kingdom’s six-month chairmanship of the Council of Europe last
year, she was the Minister responsible for local democracy. A very good
start was made in drawing attention to these prescriptions. As a result
the Committee of Ministers has recently agreed to the case for much
better internal co-ordination and has referred matters arising from the
Chavez report to an expert group. For the reforms he encouraged I also
pay tribute to Keith Whitmore, who retired last year as President of
the Council of Europe’s Congress of Local and Regional
Authorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000043">Yet
the Council of Europe’s two main branches, the congress and the
parliamentary assembly, still do not work enough together. They should
do so, and there ought to be an annual procedure for that. Will the
Committee of Ministers call for this? What predictions this year does
my noble friend make for the progress of the Chavez report itself? In
what ways will she and her department be able to help that
process?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000044">Then,
started in 2006, there is the Council of Europe’s Centre of
Expertise for Local Government Reform. Already to states within central
and eastern Europe it has provided much useful guidance on the nuts and
bolts of local government systems and methods. This year it starts a
new venture and facilitates a working programme between parts of the
United Kingdom and parts of Croatia, a country about to become the 28th
member of the European Union this July. Within the programme certain
regions and cities directly work together. The agenda includes mutual
trade, education and cultural exchanges and those on good practice for
sustaining stable communities. It is a great pleasure for me
to assist this programme as Scottish consul for Croatia, as well as in
my capacity as chairman of this Parliament’s all-party group for
that country. Thereafter, and between different cities and regions
elsewhere in Europe, the centre aims to encourage further working
synergies. Clearly, those expedients serve to strengthen local and
regional democracy. What plans therefore have the Government to support
them?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000045">Germane<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T19:59:55"></hs_TimeCode>
to the quality of local democracy in Europe, there are also inquiries
and policies currently embarked upon by the Government for the benefit
of the United Kingdom. Two such include the well-being of communities
and the promotion of active citizenship. Both considerations lie at the
centre of effective local democracy. What intentions on these subjects
have the Government to use, once information is available, our own
United Kingdom analyses and recommendations to assist Europe? During an
economic crisis some might possibly object that it is wrong to spend
time and effort on local democracy at all. However, the complete
opposite is surely the case. For improved local democracy reduces costs
and facilitates growth, initiative and creativity. At the same time it
is also what is needed to protect values and rights. The United Kingdom
has much experience in this field. Last year, 
<?notus-xml column=335?>our Council of Europe chairmanship pointed the way. That direction we
must now follow with confidence and
vigour.</hs_para><hs_time UID="130206113000139" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000139"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:01:05"></hs_TimeCode></I>8.01

back on my own time, some years ago in the Council of Europe, I am
convinced that it has a potentially huge contribution to make in
strengthening democracy across Europe, not least in some of the former
Soviet bloc countries. At the end of the Second World War, the founders
of the Council of Europe—indeed, those behind the whole European
initiative, including the whole European Union—not only saw
democracy as key to the future stability of the continent but also saw
that if democracy was to work it was not simply parliamentary
institutions and elections but all the other infrastructure that was so
necessary, including the rule of law and, of course, human

a searing experience of a denial of human rights that led to, and was

want to concentrate my short intervention on one very significant
member of the Council of Europe—Russia. The extent of its
pervasive corruption, the weakness of the courts and legal procedures
at national, regional and local level, with a penal system that is
appalling and enshrines some of the most barbaric treatment of
prisoners possible, and the carefully neutered political role of the
Duma itself, have significance for the quality of democracy and, of
course, for the countries on Russia’s borders. Here I turn to
the north Caucasus. I was very much involved there as rapporteur on the
conflict in Chechnya to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of
Europe. Some people say now that things are better because there is
order. We have to understand that, in so far as there is an appearance
of order, it is the order of tyranny, oppression and
fear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:04:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000049">It
is essential to recognise that extrajudicial killing still takes place
on the say-so of those who hold power. Still intimidation of witnesses
happens, and of the relatives of those who are being pursued. There is
harassment across the whole nature of society for those who would wish
to generate independent thinking.</hs_para>

the midst of all this, there are, of course, very brave and courageous
people who are trying to put things right. There are lawyers, academics
and professional people who make their stand. There are, of course,
voluntary and non-governmental organisations—and I think
particularly of Memorial, one of the most courageous organisations that
I have ever encountered, with a tremendous degree of professional
competence and excellence that it has built up over the years. These 
<?notus-xml column=336?>organisations make civil society and are absolutely
essential to a functioning democracy, but they are being deliberately
curbed within Russia and places such as the north
Caucasus<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:05:51"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:05:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000051">With
the quality of democracy at local, national or regional level, it is
terribly important to be able to bring cases before the European Court
of Human Rights. Memorial and others have done this. There are an
impressive number of judgments by the court that uphold the complaints
that have been brought. Those complaints go to the Committee of
Ministers to see to the follow-through and the implementation by Russia
of the findings of the court. For year after year the performance of
the Committee of Ministers has been lamentably weak; it goes through
the formalities of reprimanding or criticising Russia, but it has
really not put the muscle or force of argument as it is essential that
it should have done. I ask the Minister for a specific assurance that,
if we are to make democracy work in these areas, we must recognise the
importance of the European Court of Human Rights, which needs to be
properly resourced for its work, but also make sure that the Committee
of Ministers follows through and does not let Russia off the hook in
its failure to implement what is recommended by the
judges.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_06_PT_1/43324293D9E55741081336215C0847E0C0131781" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 February 2013">Wednesday,

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, I feel a little bit out of place, in
that I am not expert at all in the matters of the Council of Europe and
local and regional government in Europe, or indeed the Congress of
Local and Regional Authorities, although I have spent a lifetime
reading about their activities of interest. I was very grateful for the
extensive briefing from the House of Lords Library, which alerted me to
all kinds of
things<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:07:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000053">I
shall speak very briefly about these matters, to echo the generous
commendation of the noble Earl, Lord Dundee, of my Liberal Democrat
colleague, Keith Whitmore, for the enormous amount of work that he has
done on these areas over many years, and in particular for his work as
chair of the congress last year. I have a note here from the
secretary-general of the congress, which
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="130206113000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000133">“First

may be so. I remember Keith when he was a bright leading light of the
Young Liberals in Manchester, and a very important person in the
resurrection and regeneration of liberalism in that historically very
great Liberal

shall say no more about that, because I am taking part in this debate
as an excuse to say a few words about the north of England as a very
important region in this country and in Europe. In general, the larger
countries of Europe have regional governments. The systems vary a lot.
In Germany, with the very strong länder, there is a fully
fledged federal system entrenched in the constitution of the country.
Spain is constitutionally a unitary state, but it has extensive though
asymmetric devolution to autonomous democratic regions. The strongest
of these, particularly Catalonia and the Basque country, approach
something akin to the status of regions within a federal
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:09:37"></hs_TimeCode>system.</hs_para>

there are democratic regional authorities that are more akin to very
large local authorities in their constitutional status and some of
their functions. Nevertheless, they are important bodies within their
spheres. Here we have a real constitutional mess. We have devolved
elected bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland in
particular, regardless of what happens in the forthcoming referendum,
the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government are approaching the
status and powers that they would have in a fully federal
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:10:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000056">In
the rest of England, apart from Greater London, we have nothing at all.
In Greater London, we have a sort of city region with the Greater
London Authority, the mayor and the London Assembly, but in the rest of
England there is zilch, so our system is a bit like that of Spain
except that throughout England we have nothing at all. I would argue
that the north of England is a distinctive region. Anybody who visits
it knows that it is a distinctive region within both this country
and Europe. Socially, culturally, environmentally and
economically it is regionally distinctive and forms a regional
unit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:11:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000057">In
the three subregions of the north of England—the north-east, the
north-west and Yorkshire, although they may have slightly wonky
boundaries at the moment, but never mind—regional bodies have
developed on an ad hoc basis over the past few decades, which resulted
in the regional development agencies, which had considerable influence
and finance but were not democratically accountable. Regional
assemblies were set up in these regions which, if they were democratic
at all, were not directly democratic. They were indirectly democratic
and they included representatives of business, trade unions and so on.
Nevertheless, they met and they represented the regions, although it is
fair to say that they did so in secrecy—not of their own
volition—because nobody noticed them. I should say that I was a
member of the North West Regional Assembly for a
while<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:12:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000058">In
November 2004, there was a referendum in the north-east to set up a
formally elected north-east regional assembly. The proposal was
thoroughly trounced by some 696,000 votes to 197,000 on an almost 50%
turnout. That really killed off the idea of elected democratic regional
assemblies or government in the north of England for quite some time.
The Conservative spokesman for the regions at that time was Bernard
Jenkin—at least they had a spokesman for the regions at that
time, so they must have recognised that regions existed. He said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="130206113000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000134">“the

that what was being proposed was a “toothless talking
shop”. Both those statements were effectively true. The scheme
that was put forward was flawed, the proposals were feeble and the
Government at the time failed to put it in the context of what they
wanted for the country, or at least for the north of
England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:13:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130206113000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000059">I
argue that it is time to start talking about regionalism again in the
north of England. I remember that back in the 1960s a group of Liberal
candidates in the north-west, of whom a leading light was my
noble friend  
<?notus-xml column=338?>Lord Tordoff, produced a report on regional
government in the north-west. That started the ball rolling as far as

serious debate has to begin again in the north of England. In
particular, we need to think about the future and whether, if Scotland
is to be an autonomous unit—I do not use the word
“independent”—in whatever form, and if it is to
have considerable financial powers and influence, effectively the
people of Scotland will be running their own affairs to a very large
extent. Whatever happens in the referendum, in the coming years it
seems that the north of England will have to look at itself and ask,
“Are we actually three subregions comprising the north-west, the
north-east and Yorkshire, or should we get together as the north of
England and say that we are twice as big as Scotland in population, and
that if Scotland can do this, why cannot we in the north of England do
it?”.</hs_para>

glance at the recent history of the Council of Europe gives an
indication of its place in the scheme of things today. In 1989, which
is going back a bit, President Gorbachev made his first major European
speech. He made the speech in Strasbourg and his theme was that the
Council of Europe could become Europe’s common home. What
prompted him to develop that simply put theme? Europe’s new
democracies were a considerable distance from membership of the
European Union which was, without doubt, their ultimate aim. It still
is, although most have now been able to join. It therefore fell to the
Council of Europe to monitor their political and legal aspirations, to
keep in touch with the new development and to attempt to assess the
legal difficulties some of these new democracies faced, to which end

Council of Europe now finds itself in a position where most of the
aspirant states that were young democracies have now been able to join
the European Union, which was always their principal aim. They are now
much more interested in supporting initiatives of the European Union

role of the Council and its European responsibilities, other than
maintaining and underpinning the court in Strasbourg. It is important
to understand that the Council of Europe today is more criticised,

Sheikh:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Dundee for
securing this debate. Winston Churchill was the first to speak about
the benefits of creating a Council of Europe, so it is fitting that the
Council was established by the treaty of London. The Council of Europe
was founded upon the principles of upholding democracy and civil
liberties. Since its creation, the Council has continued to adapt and
expand as a means of tackling the common challenges facing the
continent. The streamlining of the Council of Europe’s 
<?notus-xml column=341?>activities in support of local and regional democracy was one of the
priorities of our Government’s recent chairmanship. This
included efforts to reach a consensus on the establishment of a single
programme of the Council of Europe’s activity on local and
regional democracy, to be overseen by the Committee of Ministers. The
Congress of Local and Regional Authorities has an important role to
play in achieving this aim. It represents a distinct and unique form of
grass-roots democracy. It also represents local authorities across all
47 member
states.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000075">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:29:14"></hs_TimeCode>

branch of the Council of Europe, in conjunction with increased

improve the lives of citizens in member states. The priorities for each

Prescott:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Earl on
securing this debate on the Council of Europe, in which we have had
some activities in the past.
He<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:34:37"></hs_TimeCode> referred to
his concern about democracy in its national context, and I, as he
knows, have been actively involved in the national democracy in one
particular country, Armenia. He will recall that the elections were
held for the President of that country. I was the leader of the Labour
delegation and appointed to be the rapporteur for Armenia for one of
the committees of the House. I went to that country during those
elections to observe. I have to tell the noble Earl that the result
created a riot; 10 people were killed and 130 were thrown in
jail, under the threat that they were usurping the powers of
the state. I was sent by the Council of Europe to see what had happened
and what we could do about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:35:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000085">My
main influence related to the fact that Armenia had entered into an
obligation under the human rights convention to observe the democratic
process. I could see, on a very quick visit there, that most of those
rights had not been observed. It was an eastern European country coming
out of being a communist state and wanted a kind of social democratic
European stature. It was therefore concerned to make the changes. I
also found that I had to convince the President and the rest of
Armenia’s Parliament to rewrite the laws on public protest. I
got the 130 people out of jail. The election law was rewritten, as were
the laws regarding the press and freedom. Even the judiciary was
changed in that process. I congratulate the Parliament in that country
for seeking to do those things very
quickly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:36:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000086">What
was the power and influence that enabled that to happen? It happened
largely because the country had signed up to an agreement, and I was
able to say, “You have an obligation under your membership of
the Council of Europe, and you must observe them, or I will have to
report back to the Council that you are  
<?notus-xml column=343?>not observing them. The Council of Ministers would have to take some
kind of action”. When European rights were being used to bring
about a more democratic framework, there was a stupid argument going on
in the other House about whether prisoners should have the vote and
whether, therefore, we should withdraw from the convention on human
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000087">What
may be different in this country is certainly different there. Funnily
enough, in Armenia they do not give prisoners the vote, but on the
prisoner issue a number of routes can be pursued. It is the people who
want to make the issue to leave Europe. Most of them thought they were
in the European Union. It had to be pointed out to them in the debate
that this was not the European Union but the Council of Europe, and it
was different. Those circumstances are a very important part of
maintaining democratic
accountability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:37:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000088">What
is the position now? We have gone through all sorts of manoeuvres and
changes and the Court still accepts that we have got it wrong and wants
to hear an alternative from us. What is the alternative? What are the
Government doing? Are they going to observe the convention on human
rights? If not, they can leave the Council of Europe, because the
obligation is on Britain to observe human rights. I do not know where
the Government stand on this at the moment. Perhaps the noble Baroness
can tell
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:37:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000089">Next
week I return to Armenia with a delegation to observe the new
presidential elections. I certainly hope that it will go much better. I
certainly have more confidence that these changes will make the
election more democratic than it was on the last occasion. I am
encouraged by the independent group of observers at last year’s
election, who reported a 62% turnout—a pity we could not get
that here, but let us leave that aside—and a quiet and peaceful,
vibrant election.
Fabulous<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:38:18"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope
that will happen when I observe the presidential election.
Unfortunately, one of the presidential candidates was shot in the
shoulder last week, but he has insisted that the election takes place.
I am waiting to see, since it will be a cold part of the year. I hope
it will be a very colourful and peaceful
election<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:38:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000090">The
Council of Europe can play an important part in the democratic process.
Sometimes we forget that, but they have obligations, particularly in
eastern Europe, to measure up to the democratic accountability that
they promised. Any of us who have had influence and been to these
eastern European countries—I will leave Russia out of it for the
moment—know that accountability is definitely needed. The
Council of Europe can fulfil that role; it is a centre of democratic
accountability. It can be used effectively, as it was in Armenia. There
is still a lot of work to do, but it is not going to phase itself out
and is desperately needed if we want democracy to continue in all parts
of
Europe.</hs_para><hs_time UID="130206113000145" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000145">8.39

Liddle:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a very interesting debate.
It is always an education as well as a pleasure to listen to the noble
Earl, Lord Dundee. This was true on this occasion as it has been on
other occasions when I have heard him speak in this House. I join my
colleague, my noble friend Lord Kirkhill, in commending him for his

is one of the great achievements of the post-war settlement. It was the
first immediate product of Churchill’s great call for Europe to
unite. We have had many references to Churchill in the discussion
tonight. “Europe unite” is still a very relevant call,
not on the basis of conquest, as people such as Hitler and Napoleon had
tried, but on the basis of democracy and human rights. In that cause,
the Council of Europe has played a vital role. I wish the noble
Baroness, Lady Wilcox, well in her new role at the Council. Strasbourg
is a lovely place to go to, but this is also a very important role, as

Council of Europe has gone through several cycles in its life. It was
very important right at the start, in the post-war era, then lost
importance with the process of European integration through the coal
and steel community and then the European Community. At that time a lot
of cynics talked about it as a talking shop for superannuated
politicians, and like all international organisations there are always

its relevance, particularly because of the convention and the European
Court of Human Rights. It is good that all we have heard in this debate
is praise for this role. So often in our national life, all we get are
brickbats thrown at us. It is important that while there is always a

my noble friend Lord Kirkhill reminded us, in the period when communism
was beginning to collapse and Gorbachev made his great speech about the
Council of Europe being Europe’s common
home—incidentally, I do not think my noble friend’s
speech was the speech of a man who does not have a lot more speeches to
make in this House; it was a wonderful speech to listen to—that
was a turning point in the Council’s life. It had a very
important role post the fall of communism. I saw it when I was an
adviser at No. 10 and went to the Baltic states and saw the vital role
that the Council of Europe was playing in helping the Russian
minorities in Latvia and Estonia to establish their human rights.

the enlargement of the European Union, there are questions about what
the Council’s role now is. Of course, even with an enlarged EU,
there is still a lot of Europe beyond the Council, and therefore it has
an important and crucial role for the future. My noble friend Lord Judd
reminded us—this is relevant to the post-communist world in that
part of the globe—that democracy is not just about holding
elections but about human rights and the rule of law. As part of that,

countries, local government is seen not as a democratic organ but as an
instrument of the central state—an instrument of central
administration to keep control, to sustain a political machine with
jobs and favours, and to make sure that, when the elections come round,
they go the right way. I saw that at first hand in some of the
countries that I visited a decade or so

have to be insistent that local government is not
administration; it is about democracy and about communities deciding
their future for themselves. Sometimes, to be frank, I think we should
remember that in our own country as well. Democracy is not just about
majority rule. It is important that the protection of minorities is
pursued. On a visit to Ukraine, I saw the way in which the Tartars are

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and
Local Government (Baroness Hanham):</Member></B> My Lords, I hope that
I shall be able to give your Lordships a reply. I think that I am going
down with a parliamentary bug. I shall do my best but if I squeak at
noble Lords, I hope they will forgive
me<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:48:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Dundee for tabling this
debate. It has, as usual, been a really good debate, with contributions
from people who know what they are talking about and who have been
closely involved in this subject. My noble friend is a significant
member of the Council of Europe and the parliamentary assembly. I am
enormously grateful to him because he provided me with great support
during our chairmanship of the Council of Europe, when I tried to
streamline—as my noble friend Lord Sheikh said—Council of
Europe
elements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000108" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000108">An
effectively operating local democracy is an essential feature of every
modern democratic state. Good democratic governance is a foundation on
which can 
<?notus-xml column=346?>be built prosperous and stable societies where there is respect for
fundamental freedoms, human rights and the rule of law. The issue of
human rights is very germane to the Council of Europe.</hs_para>

is for each individual state to decide its own governance arrangements,
taking into account its own circumstances, traditions and culture.
Across Europe there is, rightly, a wide diversity in the form that
local and regional democratic governance takes, but throughout there
are common principles at heart. This is the context in which states can
work together to improve, strengthen and update their own democratic
governance. All speakers today have demonstrated why that is
important.</hs_para>

noble Lords know, and have said, the Council of Europe is potentially
well placed to provide a framework and mechanisms to support this
development of democracy. We referred to the Government’s
chairmanship of the Council of Europe. There were two main areas in
which we wanted to achieve success. Our top priority was to reform the
European Court of Human Rights, the importance of which we recognise.
We successfully agreed measures to improve the working of the
court.</hs_para>

second was to streamline the Council of Europe’s activities on
local and regional democracy. As the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, said, the
great thing about the Council of Europe is that its three elements
managed to work entirely separately, not coming together at all. In
many cases, these elements were doing exactly the same thing without
joining together. It was becoming really important, to get the best out
of them, to try to bring them together. Their usefulness was seriously
impaired through a lack of co-ordination and collaboration between the
three elements: the Committee of Ministers, the parliamentary assembly
and the
congress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:51:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

heard, these weaknesses were not straightforward. As has been said,
there are now 47 member states in the Council of Europe. To try and get
47 member states to agree wholeheartedly to anything was not the
easiest thing that we have ever done. In fact, the most we could do was
to try and ensure that streamlining took place and that there was far
more co-ordination and co-operation between them. The noble Lord, Lord
Sheikh, made a powerful speech about what we were trying to do to
ensure that everything came
together<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:52:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000113" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000113">Tribute
has been paid to Keith Whitmore, who was president of the congress. He
was particularly well regarded and helpful when we were trying to do
what we wanted to do. Bearing in mind that he was president of the
whole congress, he was not able to do anything politically, but he
helped us sensibly and sensitively with what we were trying to do. We
cannot underestimate what he did. Keith never lost sight of the big
picture and that is very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:52:44"></hs_TimeCode>. I
also want to put on record how we were helped by the UK delegation to
the parliamentary assembly, particularly my noble friend Lord Dundee,
and by the contribution of the honourable Member for Mansfield in the
other
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:53:11"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:53:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000114" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0002.htm#130206113000114">Concerns
were raised by the noble Lords, Lord Prescott and Lord Kirkhill, about
where we go from here. I accept that there is still considerable room
for improvement in the way in which congress and the Council of Europe
work together. All the elements are 
<?notus-xml column=347?>now in place to make things better. The noble Earl asked about the
future. The 47 states, through their ambassadors and after more than a
year of discussion, agreed in November the programme of
intergovernmental work on local and regional democracy. That implements
much of the substance of the Chavez report, which was set in train by
the Council of Europe precisely to see how it could work better. We
have been co-operating with that, and there is now the prospect of
Committee Ministers co-operating better in the future. With our
influence still there in congress, I believe that we can continue to
make
progress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T20:54:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_06_PT_1/D5E90B906FDDFD61B67D55F978133FE271F1CEEF" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 February 2013">Wednesday,

have been so many stirring speeches. The noble Lord, Lord Judd,
strongly drew attention to the lack of democracy in some parts of
eastern Europe. I say to the noble Lord that one of the elements of the
work of the Council of Europe is to educate emerging nations in
democracy. The fact that they are sucked into the Council of Europe is
becoming absolutely essential, because it gives them confidence and
security not to be blown off-course and sucked back into the communist
system. That is really important for us all for the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000116" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0003.htm#130206113000116">The
noble Lord, Lord Liddle, referred to the Baltic states; they all need
their confidence boosted, they all want to be part of Europe, and they
all want to have the same sort of democracy. One of the roles of the
Council of Europe is do just that and to provide that support. Many
things have happened in Europe over the last 50 years which we would
all prefer had not happened, and that we can never forget about. If the
Council of Europe and the European Union help with that, they are
making a major contribution to our
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000117" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0003.htm#130206113000117">We
intend to continue to assist in Europe by supporting the work of the
Council. We are still working with Andorra. The chairmanship passed
from Ukraine to us, and from us to Andorra, and there is a sort of
seamlessness about it which I hope will
continue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000118" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0003.htm#130206113000118">The
new congress president, Mr van Staa, has also decided that he wants a
better arrangement in the congress. One of our Belgian friends, Mr
Lambertz, is committed to improving the structures, but the structures
are only important because of the work that the congress and
the Council of Europe does. That is going to affect all the things that
people have talked about. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkhill, mentioned
President Gorbachev’s role, and he asked about the widening of
the geographical area of Europe. It is probably as wide as it can go
and we cannot take it too much further, but it does not mean that the
Council cannot be
encouraging.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206113000119" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-0003.htm#130206113000119">I
was very interested in the influence of the noble Lord, Lord Prescott,
in Armenia. That is not somewhere I would have connected with him, but
it is good that it was there. He asked for my views on prisoner voting.
It would be fair to say that we are still considering our position on
that, and I am not going to be able to give him a firm answer to that
question

northern part of England is beginning again to become dynamic; there is
plenty going on. I occasionally go to see what is happening up there.

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:45:33"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I am
grateful for the opportunity to debate the proposed regulations to
reform and modernise the system for the registration of company
charges. For many years I worked as a business and finance consultant,
and I cannot stress enough the importance of a clear, transparent
system that enables companies to access the finance they need and
lenders to provide finance with confidence. This is particularly
important in the current economic climate.</hs_para>

regulations intend to modernise the system for the registration of
company charges—a system which is more than 100 years old. The
changes to this system of registration are intended to retain the
fundamental principle of the current system, which is internationally
well regarded, while making those critical changes that will allow this
system to continue in a way that is effective and efficient.</hs_para>

lending is vital to support economic growth. It allows companies to
access the finance they need to grow and enables lenders to invest in a
company with greater confidence. In fact, the World Bank, in its report
<I>Doing Business 2012: Doing Business in a </I><I>M</I><I>ore
</I><I>T</I><I>ransparent </I><I>W</I><I>orld</I>, considered the laws
relating to collateral to be crucial to supporting economic growth and

early 1900s, a system was conceived which required companies to
register debt secured against their assets. This allowed lenders to see
clearly whether assets were already encumbered and to offer finance
with confidence. The fundamentals of this system remain and have been
the subject of further reviews and consultations, including the
Crowther report in 1970, the Diamond report in 1989, the
2001 recommendations of the Company Law Review and the most
recent  
<?notus-xml column=40?>consultation led by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
in 2010 on reforms to the system, based on the considerations of these
earlier reviews.</hs_para>

there has been ongoing engagement with legal practitioners and
academics as well as credit reference agencies and investors to
determine what reforms should be made to this system. These
stakeholders have generously offered their time and expertise to
support our reforms and to test out how these may work in practice.

moments to outline the key elements of the reforms. First, we have
amended the regulations governing the system for the registration of
company charges to take advantage of modern technology. Companies,
legal advisers and accountants will now be able to submit the charge
for filing electronically and will be able to pay their £13
charge electronically too. This has the twin benefit of reducing the
time and bureaucracy of filing a charge, while also allowing the
registrar to operate a more efficient system.</hs_para>

regulations set out a far simpler model for determining whether a
charge is registrable. Lenders and companies want to be able to
register charges so that they can invest or attract investment, but the
complex list of types of registrable charges had led to confusion and
wasted effort in simply ascertaining whether a charge could be
registered. The new regulations place the onus rightly on the
presenters of the charge to make this commercial decision, subject to a
few clear exemptions where the registration of the charge was not in
any way useful to the public, investors or companies.</hs_para>

from my previous point, the system recognises that the incentive on
investors is to register their charge rather than risk it being void
against a liquidator or administrator. In the rare instances where a
company itself registers the charge, it is commonplace for investors to
require the company to submit the charge for registration as part of
the financial agreement. The existing criminal sanction is therefore
entirely unnecessary and these regulations repeal
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:50:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020693000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020693000012">Fourthly,
the system will deliver far greater transparency around financial
arrangements as, due to the technological advances, the whole charge
instrument or deed will now be available electronically in addition to
the summary information. Of course, the regulations also include
sensible safeguards against fraud and allow personal information, bank
account numbers and signatures to be
redacted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:50:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

will for the first time create a system that fits around the different
property laws and processes that operate in different parts of the
United Kingdom. Many lenders and companies operate across the UK and
now they can take the same approach to the registration of the charges,
regardless of where they are. I hope that nobles Lords will support
these important
reforms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:51:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope it is in no way a
measure of the interesting comments made by the Minister in his
introduction that the only other noble Lord who was present has fled
quickly from the room and is therefore not in a position to respond to
his kind invitation to speak, but that leaves the burden on me. I
appreciate the way in which he introduced this change and want to make
it clear from the start that we broadly welcome it. It is a good idea,
but possibly rather later than perhaps it could have been, as the
Minister hinted at in his introductory
comments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:52:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

a troubled background in the sense that, as we discovered, the original
consultation was in March 2010 and had to be reissued for further
consultation a couple of years later before the department was able to
come forward with a modified proposal. Therefore, my first question to
the Minister is whether we ended up with a situation in which we have
the least worst solution rather than the best solution. Just to amplify
that, most people seem to want—and the majority of the responses
within the impact assessment suggest this—a fully operable
system, with all the detail. There were, however, a significant number
of people who felt that that was going to be burdensome and difficult,
so the compromise is neither one thing nor the other. I would be
grateful if he could make a few remarks to illustrate what he thinks is
the end result and how it meets the benefits specified in the
documentation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:53:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

difficulty following the figures, possibly because there were two
different consultations and two different levels of issuing comment.
The summary document which accompanies the impact statement says that
the impact on businesses is expected to be a reduction in the burden on
those filing charges, generating a net savings of £21 million a
year. However, the impact assessment itself says that the net cost to
business will be about £21 million as well; I may have misread
that, but I would like a comment on that from the Minister. It seems
like a modest reduction, given the amount of effort that goes into
registering charges. As the Minister said, this is at the heart of all
business transactions involving inter-business acquisitions and sales;
any lending going on will always require some sort of assessment of the
overall capacity of the organisation to which it is being lent.
Therefore, we are saying that this is a very modest change.</hs_para>

symmetrically based; they will fall on those who have to prepare and
generate the new input documents which the document says will be
recouped through efficiency savings over an estimated period of four
years, but no evidence about that is given. I just want to be sure that
these are really modest savings and would like it on the record that
that is
correct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T15:54:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020693000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020693000018">My
third point is about the costs burden arising from moving to a new
electronic system. We are all sceptical about the claims that are often
made for these systems but this is by all accounts a rather simple one.
It is a register that is not capable of doing very much more than
simply holding data. Can the noble Lord give a bit of context for how
much testing of this new register has been done and whether he is
confident 
<?notus-xml column=42?>that it will be up and running and ready? Quite a lot of time has been
spent preparing for it, after all, so I hope that it will be but I
would like to be confident.</hs_para>

I trained as an accountant in Scotland, where one of the things that
was drummed into me early on in my studies was the difference between
the charging register system in Scotland and that in the rest of the
country. In Scotland, it is not necessary to register all charges.
There is very little mention of that in the Explanatory Memorandum
while there is some comment on it in the impact statement. It would be
for the benefit of the Committee if the Minister could simply mention
what exemptions there are for Scotland and how they will be
accommodated given that the overall aspiration of this move, which I do
not dissent from, is to try to provide a simple system for the whole of
the country despite the differences in responsibilities between the

Popat:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for a number of the issues
that he has raised on these regulations. First, let me explain the cost
versus the benefits side. Currently, to register a charge the fee is
only £13 but there is a huge cost to the businesses and
companies when it comes to dealing with a large number of forms through
their accountants, solicitors or agents for registration. Electronic
transmission will be much easier, as when we do our tax returns and VAT
returns electronically. A company can in fact register electronically a
director or company secretary. Having business knowledge and a business
background, I suppose that this is something that should have been done
many years ago.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020693000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020693000021">This is a welcome move
for a number of organisations, in particular credit reference agencies,
lawyers and accountants but, most importantly, the lenders themselves.
It gives a lot of security to lenders because we can register a charge
electronically within one day. Currently, the system takes as long as
eight days. Lenders will be pretty well secured on day one of release
of the money to the companies to which they are lending, so it is a
much safer system than we have now.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13020693000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020693000022">In the old days, I
remember that we used to rush to Companies House in London. Now,
Companies House is based in Cardiff and there is also a 21-day time
limit, so in that respect the cost saving to the companies is quite
huge. Even if it takes roughly half an hour for the lawyers and their
secretaries to do the necessary paperwork for company registration,
that half an hour is charged as a cost to the client so that will be a
saving. That is what the £21 million saving is all about. With
regard to the cost of putting it in practice, which is something like
£750,000, if you can imagine the time saved by Companies House
staff in Cardiff in processing manual applications compared to
electronic applications, I would guess that that £750,000 will
be recouped in four years’ time. A lot depends on the number of
applications going through electronically, which is currently about
90,000. If the numbers go up, recouping the cost will probably take
less than four years.</hs_para>

compromise on future lenders’ requirements and to simplify the
particular archive held in their own system. I will explain what I mean
by that. When their auditors come, companies are required to do company
registration, with its charges. The auditors can actually get
information electronically 
<?notus-xml column=43?>and that screen saves audit fees for the companies, so there is that
advantage too. I am afraid that it was not a compromise.</hs_para>

Scottish law does not require the automatic registration of all
charges. In England and Wales you have to register them automatically.
Therefore, given the Government’s drive for simplicity, I was
asking whether the Minister could say a little more about how there can
be a very simple and universal system, yet also allow Scotland the
discretion to not register where that is appropriate. For instance,

Popat:</Member></B> My Lords, these regulations give effect to the 2010
parental leave directive. It is a revised directive, which repeals the
1996 parental leave directive. As the UK has fully implemented the 1996
directive, the regulations under consideration today are confined to
giving effect to the changes arising from the revised directive. Before
I elaborate on the legislative effect of 
<?notus-xml column=44?>the Parental Leave (EU Directive) Regulations 2013, let me state the
purpose of the revised directive. It is to lay down minimum

regulations do three things. First, they increase the number of weeks
of parental leave for all parents from the current 13 weeks to 18
weeks. This transposes the requirement in the revised directive that
parental leave should be granted for a period of four months. They make
no other changes to the amount of parental leave available. Parental
leave will continue to be available per parent per child but an
employee will be entitled to 18 weeks rather than 13 weeks. Similarly,
there will be no change to the age limits of a child whose parents are
entitled to take parental leave—that is, five years old or 18
years old for a disabled child.
They<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:04:22"></hs_TimeCode> make no
changes to the arrangements governing the use of parental

November, the Government announced a package of changes to leave for

Government intend that these changes will be introduced in 2015.
However, we are required to increase the number of weeks from 13 to 18
now so as not to be in breach of our EU obligations. We have decided
not to make other changes to the age limit at this time but will raise
the age to 18 years as part of the broader sweep of changes in 2015.
The reason for raising the age later is that we understand from the
business community that having the change in age as part of the
creation of shared parental leave and pay will be easier in terms of
familiarisation costs.</hs_para>

parental leave directive requires that parents returning from parental
leave must have the right to request flexible working. Many employees
who are parents and carers already have this right, but employed agency
workers are currently excluded from the right, and this is not

this proposal. It is exactly what the Government should be doing and
seems to do what is required. As the Minister said, it has been
welcomed by those who have been consulted in the round. However, there
is one caveat. The Minister explained why certain measures had to be
brought forward at this point because of an EU directive requirement,
but the general thrust of the approach to parental leave and to
regularising the broader position is based on doing them at the last
rather than the first possible moment. I do not need a response on that
but I would like to record that it is obviously a matter of some regret
that some of the good things that we see in this change to the

will be affected by

change, whereas 31% called for the age limit to be increased to 18.
There was not much support for eight, 12 or 16 years. We therefore made
the age 18. In order to minimise the cost to business, this change will
only be introduced alongside the other changes in the system for
maternity, paternity and shared parental leave. The change will

Popat:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a short but not insignificant
order that will enable the effective enforcement of the Consumer
Protection (Payment Surcharges) Regulations 2012. The regulations
implement into UK law Article 19 of the European Union consumer rights
directive. They prohibit traders from charging consumers above-cost
payment surcharges. The Government have had concerns about the level of
card surcharges that 
<?notus-xml column=47?>exceed the real costs in several sectors of the economy. Such surcharges
are typically employed as a form of drip pricing, whereby the consumer
does not see the final transaction cost until after completing several
forms. That can make it more difficult for consumers to shop around.
Under the regulations, surcharges for using a particular form of
payment will become
cost-reflective.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020693000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020693000045">The
provisions of the directive need to be implemented in UK legislation by
December 2013 and brought fully into force by June 2014. Given the
concerns that have been raised about these practices—notably by
<I>Which?</I> and in a report made by the Office of Fair
Trading—the Government have decided to implement this part of
the directive early. The payment surcharges regulations were made and
laid before Parliament on 19 December last year under the negative
resolution procedure. As with this order, they come into force on 6
April 2013. They are not of course the subject of the Motion today but
they are directly
related.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020693000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020693000046">Article
2 of the order provides for the enforcement framework in Part 8 of the
Enterprise Act 2002 to apply in relation to the regulations. This
enables the relevant enforcement bodies to apply to the courts for
enforcement orders against traders that have engaged, are engaging or
are likely to engage in conduct that breaches the regulations, if that
conduct harms the collective interests of consumers in the United
Kingdom. Taken together, the regulations and this order will provide an
effective enforcement regime in fulfilment of the directive’s
requirements that adequate and effective means exist in national law to
ensure compliance with the provisions of the directive and that
penalties laid down for breaches of the directive are effective,
proportionate and
dissuasive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020693000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020693000047">Although
the payment surcharges regulations implement an EU directive, Article 2
of the order specifies them as a domestic infringement rather than a
community infringement for the purposes of the 2002 Act. This is
because the obligations in the regulations take effect from April 2013,
whereas the EU directive requires them to take effect only from June
2014. The order does not therefore strictly relate to infringements of
EU law in the period up to June 2014. For this reason, and unlike the
regulations, the order is subject to approval by both Houses of
Parliament. I beg to

side welcome the regulations. They are a good step in a direction that
many noble Lords will recognise has been a source of considerable
annoyance and concern to consumers over many years. In that sense, I
want to understand better the approach that the Minister is taking
here. He quite rightly explained that there are requirements because of
the European Union directive to move in this direction. In many 
<?notus-xml column=48?>senses today is interesting because the earlier order that we considered
also relates to a European Union directive. The choice there was to do
something at the latest possible moment whereas the choice here is to
take forward the timing of the European Union directive and use it to
solve a problem that is, as he said, a domestic rather than a European
one. That aside, it is still a good
decision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020693000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020693000052">Underneath
this is a history that the Minister touched on but is worth recording.
This comes from a civil complaint from <I>Which?</I> that was referred
to the OFT, and the OFT generated the momentum behind this. Yes, it
could have happened because of the European Union directive but there
is sufficient pressure internally. That also shows that the measures
brought forward under the previous Government to try to provide for
more active consumer protection in this area have been successful. As a
result of that, we are seeing these changes
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020693000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020693000053">In
the impact statement, to which the Minister referred, the assertion is
made that these drip-pricing approaches—you do not know the full
cost of what you are buying online until you get to the final screen
and suddenly some additional charges are put in—are, of course,
a frustration and an annoyance. It is interesting, however, that the
impact assessment is quite coy about whether it will be to the
long-term benefit of consumers. It is effectively saying, if you read
between the lines, that while the changes in the regulations and the
consequences of what is being proposed mean that companies will not be
allowed to add these additional charges, or drip charges, to the price
that they are quoting and we will therefore be able to compare prices
better and get more for our money, in fact, the money that is being
taken out of the system through drip pricing will probably re-emerge as
additional charges within the main
cost<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:21:02"></hs_TimeCode>. The impact

getting this right. I wanted to ask one question about the impact
assessment and the opt-out for small businesses. I do not believe in
extra burdens and regulation for businesses, but it seems odd to me
that we seem to be saying that, by allowing business with fewer than 20
people to opt out, they can carry on overcharging customers. It seems
odd and unfair that they will still be able to

this order will prohibit traders from charging consumers above-cost
payments; in other words, the charges will not exceed the real cost of
the goods or services bought from the trader. We are implementing this
in December 2013, largely due to our own research and that of
<I>Which?</I> magazine, which brought this to our attention. The
European directive will be enforced in 2014, so it will be good for
consumers. The European Commission is looking at the payment separately
under the financial services regulations. We will obviously get this
information in due course. It is our policy to exempt microbusinesses

who are brought up with books in the home are lucky and privileged, and
life must be very difficult for those who, in their childhood, never
saw a book in the house. I am reminded of a book which I read many
years ago by Brendan Behan, called <I>Borstal Boy</I>, about a teenager
in a juvenile prison allocated, I believe, two books a fortnight. He
loved books so much—or developed such a liking for books while
he was in jail—that he rationed himself to only so many pages a
day, to make sure that his two books lasted the fortnight before he got
new ones. One day the prisoner allocating books gave him a seed
catalogue as his non-fiction book. As Brendan Behan says, he was almost
in tears, with nothing to read for part of that
period<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:33:20"></hs_TimeCode>. Let us
also remember that in the last century, books were burned by people who
saw books and publishers as the enemies of freedom and
democracy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:33:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020697000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020697000004">Books
and publishing are of enormous value to the UK economy. The publishing
sector is estimated to be worth some £5 billion a year, of which
book sales amount to £3.2 billion. The United Kingdom is one of
four countries that produce 100,000 new and revised titles a year. The
UK book market is the fifth largest in the world, and 41% of the
sector’s sales come from exports; a larger proportion than that
from any other country. Moreover, successful books often lead to film
rights, another benefit to the UK creative industry. However, a large
barrier to growth is the difficulty most authors have in finding a
proper return for their professional work. The figures for what many
authors earn show how little they get in return for their professional
work. One or two authors scoop the pools and make a fortune, but for
many it is a very hard job indeed to make a decent
living<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:34:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020697000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020697000005">I
turn specifically to publishing and the publishing industry. Publishers
are of course the guardians of an author’s copyright, without
which authors would hardly be able to make progress; they invest in
authors, and give advances and royalty payments; they identify
good-quality writing and research; and they help in the distribution of
books. Publishers and retailers work together to encourage reading, for
example in bookshops with World Book Day and many other such
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020697000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020697000006">However,
one of the key factors on the scene is the growth of electronic
publishing. I understand that in 2011 electronic publishing increased
by 366%—an enormous increase. There is no VAT on printed books
but electronic books published in this country attract a VAT rate of
27%. In some of our competitors on the continent, such as France and
Luxembourg, there is a much lower rate of VAT. Britain is at an
economic disadvantage with our e-books, and may well suffer even more
as other countries impose lower rates of tax. If books are more
expensive, Britain will fall behind. We only have to look at the music
industry  
<?notus-xml column=51?>and the recent decline of HMV to see how bits of our economy can fall
behind very rapidly if they are not able to compete in a world
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020697000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020697000007">On the
positive side, digital books help in self-publishing, so they open the
door for some authors. But nobody can predict the way in which e-books
will go. All we can say is that the digital market has grown
dramatically of late and I believe that it now poses a threat. I do not
want to be a Luddite or act like King Canute and say we do not want
e-books because of course they are here. What is important is that
printed books will not fall behind too much and can live in this new
digital age.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020697000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020697000008">I
think it was Jamie Byng, the managing director of Canongate, who said
that one of the things that bookshops do is encourage discovery. The
same applies to libraries. There can be few things more exciting than
for a young person to be let loose in a bookshop or library and see the
wealth of books available there for his or her reading. That applies
entirely to libraries. Yet we have seen recently a dramatic decline in
the number of bookshops. The growth of e-books will encourage that
decline. I really feel that bookshops are one of the values in our
society. If we lose bookshops, something valuable will be
gone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020697000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020697000009">I love
going to book festivals. I have been to the one in Edinburgh
frequently. In the Lake District, there is a superb book festival at
Keswick that I go to most years. Yet, if we all had only digital books,
how could there be book festivals? They would not mean very much if the
output of a book festival was just a pile of Kindles and no books
themselves. Yet the Public Lending Right should be extended to e-books
and audiobooks. That is important to get balance, but we have to be
careful. We have seen the problem with Amazon, which scoops the pool in
terms of electronic books at the moment but is based abroad and pays
very little tax in this country. The whole thing is unbalanced and
makes it very hard for British electronic publishers and above all for
books to
compete.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020697000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020697000010">On
the national curriculum, changes to that are being phased in very
quickly and it is important that the publishing industry is given a
chance to provide the necessary and appropriate books so that the
national curriculum can work. That is one of those areas where more
co-operation between government and the publishing industry would be
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020697000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020697000011">Open
access has been an important point. There was a report by Professor
Finch about open access for future academic publishing. I am not
certain that the Government have responded to that but it would be
useful were they to say where they stand on
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020697000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020697000012">We have
in books and publishing one of the most important creative industries
in the country. We are renowned for having good creative industries. We
are a world leader, as I showed earlier. It is important that, in their
general approach to publishing and books, the Government should be
aware that our leadership cannot be sustained automatically. They need
to make sure that they support
publishing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020697000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020697000013">It
is important in terms of detail that we have a reasonably successful
copyright regime, which should not be weakened in any way. If we do
that, we weaken the economic success of our publishing industry and 
<?notus-xml column=52?>our books. There has been some talk about developing educational
exceptions. However, we have to be careful. If an educational
establishment can photocopy something that is appropriate for teaching
purposes for 50 or 100 students, that of course will
severely impact on the income of authors, which would be a retrograde
step. Of course, one wants educational institutions to be able to work
freely and easily but we also have to protect
copyright<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:40:40"></hs_TimeCode> in
that
respect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020697000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020697000014">I
have already mentioned the difficulties of VAT and electronic books. I
am in two minds about this. It would be fair that VAT on electronic
books should be on a level playing field with printed books. I am also
concerned about the impact of e-books. I should like to repeat what I
have said earlier. I must admit that I have a Kindle, although that was
before I discovered how little tax Amazon is paying. I now feel a
little guilty every time I use my Kindle and it is useful for
travelling. However, we should be careful. Anything we can do to
sustain hardback books, bookshops and the publishing industry can be
only for the
good<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:41:30"></hs_TimeCode>. We have a
vital creative industry in this country, which the Government must
support as fully as they

Black of Brentwood:</Member></B> I declare an interest as a director of
the Telegraph Medium Group. The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, is to be
congratulated on securing this important debate. Publishing is the
lifeblood of a free society. It forms the basis of democracy, our
education system and our creative industries; yet its future is
uncertain because of the massive impact of digital. Every publisher is
faced with the central challenge: adapt your business model or
die.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020697000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020697000016">However,
in order <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:42:03"></hs_TimeCode>to find
time to adapt, traditional publishers need two things; namely, as
little regulation as possible and as much protection for the absolute
right to copyright as possible. Both are under attack. I want to flag
up three ways in which the Government can help. I agree with everything
that the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said about VAT. As printed material in
the UK rightly attracts a zero rate, it is wrong that the electronic
equivalent attracts the full 20% rate, which leaves UK publishers at a
real commercial disadvantage.
Given<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:42:36"></hs_TimeCode> the rapid
development of this market, there is now an urgent need to remove or
reduce VAT on electronic publications. I would ask my noble friend if
he would talk to his very kindly friends at the Treasury on this
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:42:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020697000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020697000017">As
regards music publishers, I should declare an interest as a member of
the Royal College of Music Council. Music publishing is an incredibly
important business because it is at the core of our creative industries
and certainty about copyright is crucial for it to flourish. Of
specific concern therefore is Government’s plan to water down
copyright protection—again, the noble Lord mentioned
it—which is of fundamental importance to its existence through
extending the exceptions for educational use by introducing a so-called
“fair dealing exception” which will be available to
“all organisations and individuals”. This will increase
exemptions in this area to include one-to-one music lessons, Saturday
music services and music clubs, and could lead to a proliferation of
photocopying of sheet 
<?notus-xml column=53?>music, which would be a real loss for the UK music publishing industry
at a time when it is trying to make life easier for schools which want
to copy musical
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:43:35"></hs_TimeCode>. I ask my
noble friend to ensure that any scheme is sufficiently carefully
drafted to protect small, specialist providers of educational material.
Perhaps he could write to me to explain how the fair dealing exception
will
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T16:43:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I come to newspaper and magazine publishing, where the internet has
been fiercest. Here we need to ensure that the press in the UK is not
subject to any form of statutory content controls which would hugely
disadvantage it with global competition. But proposals from the EC
High-Level Group on Media Freedom and Pluralism would usher in a
draconian European system of controls, including proposals to force
media councils to ensure that newspapers comply with European values.
These proposals would push the EU into an information dark age and the
Government must do everything that they can to stop it. I ask my noble
friend for his support on my three points.</hs_para>

writing fiction or non-fiction, rarely, if ever, create on their own in
a garret. They are supported by agents and publishers, all striving
together for that elusive creative and commercial success which
underpins not just publishing but all the creative industries which do
so much for this country. Those support systems depend, above all else,
on effective intellectual property
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020697000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#13020697000030">This
is a complex area of public policy, as the Government have recognised.
Rightly, they are trying to balance the interests of rights holders,
creators, consumers and users, and this has always been a difficult
balance to strike. However, it has been made all the more difficult by
the extraordinary developments in digital technology over recent years.
In the light of this rapid change and the inherent difficulty of the
task, no one can be certain that the Government have got the balance
right. If they have not, there could be serious consequences for
publishing and all the creative industries.</hs_para>

to see the Government reject amendments to the Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Bill in Committee, which unfortunately I was unable
to attend, which sought to provide mechanisms to protect against such
uncertainty—particularly the proposal for a new office to keep
the interests of intellectual property rights holders in the forefront
of public policy which, in such a rapidly changing world, and in which
their importance has been overlooked in the past, seems simply prudent.
To rely, as the Government seem to wish to do, on the existence of, in
Sir Robin Day’s immortal phrase, here-today and gone-tomorrow
Ministers seems to defy all the experience of recent years when the
development of public policy in this area has painfully failed to keep
pace with the implications of rapid technological change. I hope the
noble Lords who proposed these amendments—I am glad to see that
the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, is down to speak in this
debate—will submit them again on Report and that the Government
will then reconsider their

generally, it is likely that the publishing industry will change even
more in the next 10 years than it has done in the previous 10 years.
Its customers—readers—will determine those changes, but
public policy cannot stand aside. I look forward to the Minister

Dobbs:</Member></B> My Lords, I must declare my interest as set out in
the register, which reflects 25 years of earning my living as a writer.
I add to the thanks expressed to the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, not only
for introducing this debate but for doing it so splendidly. He gave us
a fantastic tour
d’horizon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000002">The
publishing industry faces grave difficulties, but I want here to
concentrate on the plight of authors—academic, literary and
others. Without them, there would be no industry. Incomes are falling;
the future is filled with uncertainties; the essential nurturing of
creative talent that allows authorship to reach its peak is
disappearing; and the internet age believes that it has inalienable
right to read everything online and for free. There is an urban myth
that anyone who has ever written a book that anyone else has ever heard
about must be a multimillionaire. The chilling truth is that the
average annual income for a full-time author is around £12,000 a
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000003">I
want to make two specific points. The first echoes the point made by
the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, about the public lending right. It is a
scheme whereby authors get a token payment when their works are lent
out by public libraries. The PLR supports 23,000 authors every year.
Those payments are limited and typically very small, but they are
vital. It is not a subsidy; it is a payment in return for authors and
publishers agreeing to allow their works to be loaned out through the
library system. Yet the Treasury has cut PLR. It amounts to less than
£7 million a year, but it has been cut. Still worse, it is
refusing to extend PLR to audiobooks and e-books. It is a little like
the Government commandeering a taxi and then refusing the
fare.</hs_para>

intellectual property rights, has also been referred to by the noble
Lord, Lord Dubs, as it was by the noble Lord, Lord Wills. The
Government are preparing to move us into the digital age by making it
easier to access and copy authors’ works, particularly in
schools. Cut through the language and what that means is that schools
will be able to copy an increasing amount of work without paying the
authors. It is of course vital that we support education, but I do not
see the Government asking dinner ladies or the suppliers of desks and
dusters to come to their rescue. But authors are, sadly, easy
targets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000005">I
trust, and I am sure, that the Minister will go away and think about
all these matters. I do not need to bore him any more than I bore him
in the Bishops’ Bar about some of these issues and I know that
he is well aware of them. I hope that he will take on board, if not
always necessarily agree with, the advice of the Society of Authors,
the Publishers Association and other relevant bodies. It would take
very little to correct some of the problems that have arisen—a
little more care, a little more understanding and a little more vigour
in protecting authors’ intellectual property rights. If that is
not done, I fear that there is a real possibility that we will turn
around in 20 years’ time to discover that those who should have
been the cream of our literary talent, the lifeblood of British
creativity, have cast their pens aside and found themselves other
jobs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000006">Shakespeare

by saying that it would be a terrible pity if the book industry were to

Rendell of Babergh:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord
Dubs for introducing this much needed debate on the future of the
publishing industry. I declare an interest as someone who next year
will have been a published author for the past 50 years. The publishing
industry is a vital component of the creative economy and employs
33,000 people across 2,500 companies. In addition, there are a large
number of professional writers working full or part-time who create
works on which the industry relies. The quality and range of British
writers is recognised around the world, and 40% of publishing industry
revenues are derived from exports—a bigger proportion than in
any other country. The UK book market is the fifth largest in the world
and the largest e-book market in Europe. Despite this, the Society of
Authors is concerned that several of the Government’s current
policies are creating barriers to growth and hindering the development
of the publishing industry.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=57?><hs_para UID="130206114000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000010">The largest obstacle to
growth for most authors in financial. In a 2006 survey, the
Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society concluded that writing
was a very risky profession, with median earnings of around
£4,000 for all authors. Most authors earn very little and cannot
live by their profession alone. In principle, the public lending right
increases their income. The Digital Economy Act 2010 extends PLR to
audiobooks and e-books, but these payments have never been implemented.
This is patently unjust. That provision should be brought into force
and extra funds should be made available to cover PLR payments for such
lending.</hs_para>

zero rate of VAT, but their electronic equivalents are subject to a
rate of 20% in the UK. Some other EU countries have reduced the VAT
rate on e-books, so that the UK is now at a competitive disadvantage,
as my noble friend Lord Dubs pointed out, as e-books sold in the UK are
more costly than those sold elsewhere, making it doubtful that they
have ousted printed books as reading matter. The <I>Spectator</I><I>
</I>recently carried a cartoon in which two women and a child are
sitting on a park bench. One of the women is reading. The mother says
to her little girl, “Look darling, she’s holding
something called a book”. I hope we have not got to that point
yet. I have a Kindle but do not much like it. There is an urgent need
for removing VAT on e-books to avoid the UK falling behind European
competitors.</hs_para>

enormously from an educational and general environment from primary
level upwards that emphasises the value of culture and the importance
of copyright. Intellectual property rights are lucrative to the UK
economy. Knowing that they own copyright in what they have written and
what that means can be a cause of excitement and pride in students and
generate an understanding of the harm done by
piracy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000013">School
libraries should be compulsory, and reading and writing for pleasure
encouraged; but in general, they are not. How many times have I been
told, “I do not have time for reading”? How many homes
have I been in, often beautifully furnished and decorated, but where
there are no books? High street bookshops, local theatres and libraries
all underline the importance of books, culture and learning and should
be supported. The habit of culture should be as much a fundamental
aspect of the environment as, for example, the country’s
architectural and historical heritage.</hs_para>

optimistic note for the publishing industry. When I was first
published, there were only two or three literary festivals a year in
this country. Now, every county, city and town holds one. The large
number of books sold at these events and the enthusiasm shown for
reading by those who attend them must be a sight for sore eyes for
publishers. The Edinburgh Festival is a large bookstore in itself, and
the village of Hay-on-Wye has more bookstores in its streets than
anywhere else in the world.</hs_para>

Smith of Clifton:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord,
Lord Dubs, for this timely debate. Over the years, I have had a range
of experiences in the 
<?notus-xml column=58?>world of publishing. I was on the board of the weekly magazines<I>
</I><I>New Society</I> and, later, the <I>New Statesman</I>, and was

must declare an interest in that I am currently on the editorial boards
of two learned journals—<I>Government and Opposition</I> and
<I>Public Policy and Administration</I><I>, </I>both of which posts are
unpaid. The introduction of open access, as recommended by the Finch
report and aggressively promoted by the advocates of STEM subjects,
raises serious concerns in academia among specialists in the arts,
humanities and social sciences. Both the Royal Historical Society, of
which I am a fellow, and the Political Studies Association, of which I
am vice-president, have made representations to BIS and its
Universities Minister, David Willetts, and to the House of Commons
Science and Technology Select Committee.</hs_para>

access will require authors to pay fees of up to $1,000 to the
publishers of learned journals to cover the costs of expert reviews as
to worthiness and also of editing, which will have to come from already
squeezed research budgets. This will have a deleterious effect on
young, aspiring academics. In the arts and social sciences, articles
are usually single-authored. By contrast, STEM articles are almost
always multiauthored and half the average length of those in the
humanities and social sciences. Up front publishers’ fees will
be cheaper and more widely spread for STEM authors. The effect of this
differential costing may well influence university departmental heads
to allocate publishers’ fees disproportionately to senior,
already tried and tested, academic authors rather than to risk the
possibility of greater rejection of younger
ones.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000019">Secondly,
there is the whole question of copyright, to which other noble Lords
have alluded, and ownership of intellectual property. Open access will
accord free use of UK research that has been funded by the UK taxpayer
to all and sundry all over the world. Thirdly, it adds to the operating
profits of publishers of learned journals, who make no
financial contribution to sustaining scholarship and research; they
simply enjoy harvesting
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000019">Those who
undertake research in the humanities and social sciences are not
opposed to some form of open access. However, they are concerned that
the proposed scheme is being adopted without full consultation, is too
STEM-compliant and will enable scholarly intellectual property to be
plundered. Her Majesty’s Government and, particularly, Mr David
Willetts need to think again. It seems that Mr Willetts and Dame Janet
Finch, a distinguished social scientist, have been too easily seduced
by the blandishments of STEM interests and forgotten those of their
original university training. In winding up, will the Minister say
whether Her Majesty’s Government are open to further
consideration?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_06_PT_1/3512151F15C42D45D29E678211EC56A45E162CFA" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 February 2013">Wednesday,

monopsony in its growth phase. It is using extremely low margins to
drive market share. It is using aggressive tax avoidance to afford
those low margins. It is not just us that it does not pay tax to; it
does not pay tax to anybody. It is being allowed by Governments to do
this because it is seen as a nice, friendly company to consumers.
Indeed, in the days when I shopped with Amazon, I found it a
comfortable place to shop but it is coming to dominate the book
industry. It is clear that it will soon have over half of all the book
trade, physical and virtual. It is causing taxpaying businesses to die.
One has just to look at what happened to HMV, which has died largely
because of tax competition. A lot of that came from the likes of TheHut
out of the Channel Islands but a good deal of it was mediated by
Amazon. We now have nowhere to shop on a large scale. The internet
retailers have control and the internet retailer that will have control

will then become dependent on the one retailer. It is clear where
Amazon intends to go after that: it intends to take out the publishers.
It is already doing that in the States, forming its own relationships
with authors and publishing its own exclusive-to-Amazon books. At the
end of the day, what need has a company with three-quarters of the book
trade of independent publishers? It can do everything
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000023">It
will continue to use a wide range of predatory tactics to do that.
Amazon trawls the web to make sure that it always offers the lowest
price on anything. It compels suppliers to charge it less than they do
anybody else, on pain of being dropped—either individual
projects or entirely. It runs this thing called Amazon Marketplace,
where little traders can go, but it knows everything that happens in
that marketplace: all communications between a business and its
customers, what is being sold and at what price. When it sees a good
opportunity, it goes to the supplier and undercuts the
trader.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000024">If you use Amazon
fulfilment, it will clean up your complaints file so that bad notices
will not remain for others to see. If you do not use Amazon fulfilment,
it will not. It provides a home for people who are breaching copyright
by importing books from outside the appropriate area. It provides a
home for people who are running VAT scams. In one way or another,
if we do not do something as a Government to remove
the tax bias that benefits it, to enforce our existing laws
and to put it through the Competition Commission, we will find that we
have been steamrollered by Amazon.</hs_para>

intertwining factors in the transformation of the publishing industry.
First, as has been said by other noble Lords, e-books have arrived with
a bang after several years in which they made little or no headway. It
is important to recognise how massively popular they are in some
sectors. In the United States, for example, among more popular titles,
more than 60% are now produced as e-books. Will the traditional book
survive? Will the e-book survive? One should not think that the e-book
is the cutting edge here. E-books themselves are being transformed by
all sorts of multilayered devices; you can hold conversations with
authors and so forth. The e-book is certainly not the end of the

publishing industry here and in many countries is becoming hollowed
out, with ever fewer large conglomerates at the top and an array of
small publishers at the bottom—all of them, in a way, following
a precarious existence. The rise and rise of Amazon, as has been
mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is one main factor in this.
Publishing is not really about the production of books but about
marketing and distribution. Because of its massive size, and its mainly
automated warehouse and delivery system, Amazon absolutely cuts prices
to the
bone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:07:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000029">Thirdly,
a trend which overlaps with these is the emergence of self-publishing
on the internet, where an orthodox publisher might not be needed at
all. There is lots of experimentation going on here. For example, one
publisher invites prospective authors to pitch their book proposals on
its website. If sufficient people pledge to buy it, the author can then
go ahead and write it, reversing the traditional relationship. It is
not clear that this will
succeed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:08:30"></hs_TimeCode>. These
are overlapping trends, but they are creating something fundamentally
new after centuries of domination by traditional book

questions for the Minister. Often, technological innovation is followed
by a “back to the future” reaction; for example, when
nylon was invented, people went back to wool and cotton. The same thing
might happen to traditional books. For this reason, I hope that the
Government will not take too big a scythe to public

as other noble Lords have asked, what is the latest position on

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend Lord Dubs
for initiating this debate and all noble Lords for their contributions,
which have been of a very high standard indeed. As my noble friend Lady
Rendell said, this is a very timely debate, and we appreciate that. My
noble friend Lord Giddens warned 
<?notus-xml column=61?>us that this is an industry in which conditions are worse than we think.
They may get much worse before they get better, if indeed they do. We
need to bear in mind also that this is a complex industry, like all
creative industries. With some notable exceptions, we have focused
today mainly on the creative side—the agents and
publishers—but we also have to think about the retailing end:
the designers, the marketers, the logistics and, of course, the concept
of electronic publishing, which is an underlying thread here.</hs_para>

been about whether the current leadership that this country’s
publishing industry deservedly has can be sustained and whether there
will be growth. There have been a very large number of questions for
the Minister and I do not intend to cover them all. I hope that he will
be able to give a particular mention to them all but, if not, that he
will write to us about them. I think that there will be too many, even
for the time that he has been allocated. However, from the questions
that were raised, the first was on this vexing question of the public
lending right, which is so important to authors and publishers. Of
course, it does a much wider job by raising people’s interest in
books and writing and, more generally, in education. Will and can that
be extended to e-books?</hs_para>

differential between the printed and electronic versions is obviously a
major issue. What approach are the Government taking on this? I know
that the Minister will say the usual thing when he comes to reply: that
taxation is a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Of course it
is but, six weeks out from the Budget, surely budget submissions will
have been made. Can the Minister confirm that DCMS has raised this
issue with the Chancellor and is making the right sort of noises, along
the lines that he has heard today?</hs_para>

issue that comes up time and again is whether the Government have got
their approach right, along with the question of who is actually in the
lead on this issue. In debate on the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform
Bill, the noble Viscount, Lord Younger, confirmed that he was the
Minister for Intellectual Property and therefore has, within
BIS,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="130206114000148" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000148">“a

felt that that solved the problem. However, what then is the role of
DCMS in relation to copyright? Perhaps the Minister could say a few
things about the approach that he is taking in this matter and how the
department gets its point of view, which we note to be significantly
different in terms of discourse from that which is currently being led
by the IPO. There is much more sympathy with some of the points that
have been made today. It would be a pity if that was being boxed out by
government structures.</hs_parafo>

education and the circularity of the approach that has to be taken
across libraries and supportive reading, and about the role of English
more generally—but particularly on reading and writing and on
creative work in the EBacc—it would again be  
<?notus-xml column=62?>useful if the Minister could explain what DCMS’s role in that has
been, whether meetings have been taken and whether it is making
progress.</hs_para>

Minister say a bit more about the general role of the DCMS in this
industry? Many of the issues that we have discussed today are, as I
have said, largely in the gift of BIS and not that of DCMS. Can he
therefore explain a bit more what its role
is?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_06_PT_1/CCEDFA811213231DB38DF7400FCAB057DE3907D7" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 February 2013">Wednesday,

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble
Lord, Lord Dubs, for securing this debate. It is certainly true to say
that I have learnt a great deal today from the expertise of all your
Lordships. I have listened and it is indeed a privilege to reply.
Perhaps I might say that there were quite a number of questions and I
hope that noble Lords will be tolerant if I write a general reply
wherever I have not dealt adequately, as I would believe, with their
questions.</hs_para>

UK’s creative industries make a vital contribution to national
life but they also have a key role to fulfil in helping our economy to
grow and helping the people of the UK to compete globally. Employment
in the creative industries has grown at double the rate of the economy
as a whole, and 1.5 million people are currently involved in
creative employment. They are, in many respects, British culture and I
was very much taken by what the noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport,
said about culture. I am sure that the Prime Minister is very keen and
that he champions British culture too.</hs_para>

sector is the largest of our creative industries. It contributes
£11.6 billion a year to the UK economy and employs some 244,000
people across 9,700 companies, which cover books, e-books, academic
journals, national and local newspapers, magazines and print music, to
name a few. Our publishers are the largest exporters of all the
creative industries. With 40% of the sector’s revenues coming
from export—the noble Lords, Lord Dubs and Lord Howarth of
Newport, referred to this—that is a bigger proportion than in
any other country.</hs_para>

Lords have mentioned, it is not limited to print alone. UK consumer
e-book sales grew by some 366% in 2011, as the noble Lords, Lord Dubs
and Lord Giddens, referred to, making the UK the largest e-book market
in Europe. The UK is a market of early adopters. Consumers in this
country are quick to take up new products, services and channels,
particularly in entertainment. In publishing, this appetite on the part
of consumers has been matched by the willingness of publishers to
explore new opportunities, in spite of the challenges that new
technologies undoubtedly present, as the noble Lords, Lord Wills and
Lord Giddens, referred to. I reaffirm my personal support for bookshops
and the many happy hours I continue to spend in them. I have to admit
that I have never bought a book from

Government are committed to fostering an environment that will
stimulate world-class content creation. We want the current level of
success and investment not just to continue but to increase. I am very
conscious of course that the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, and my noble

<?notus-xml column=63?>work is so widely admired at home and abroad, are in their places.

raised by my noble friend Lord Black, the noble Lords, Lord Dubs and
Lord Stevenson, and the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell. As has been
pointed out, Luxembourg and France at present operate a reduced rate of
VAT on e-books. Under existing law, e-books are electronically supplied
services and therefore should be taxed at the standard rate. The
European Commission has launched infraction proceedings at the European
Court of Justice against Luxembourg and France on this matter, the
outcome of which is awaited.</hs_para>

Black of Brentwood raised a point about the recent EC report on
pan-European press regulation. The Government have noted the contents
of the report on media freedom and pluralism and await with interest
any resulting debate and the response from the European Union. However,
the Government have no intention of allowing European institutions to
regulate the British press. The Government believe that this is a

noble Lords referred to copyright, including my noble friend Lord
Lucas, the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, and the noble Lords, Lord Dubs
and Lord Howarth. It is vital that the publishing industry is supported
in addressing copyright issues. I am mindful of the difficulties the
music industry has suffered in its own digital transition, which my
noble friend Lord Lucas specifically referred to. The Government are
acting in a number of areas to ensure that the UK copyright framework
meets the demands of the digital environment while continuing to
maintain the success of sectors such as publishing. An appropriate
regime is vital for copyright in the UK. The Government are very well
aware of the range and strength of views and interests, which is why
the Hargreaves review of intellectual property and the development of
government policy since then have included broad and deep
consultation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000048">Last<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:19:09"></hs_TimeCode>
December, the Government outlined a number of ways to support efforts
by creative industries to protect copyright, in particular: action to
educate consumers about the importance of respecting copyright and
paying creators; launching a superfast patent processing service; a
campaign for smaller businesses; and looking at enforcement. The
Government are exploring with the City of London Police and the content
industries what more can be done to bring to book the criminals who
make a living from counterfeiting and piracy, particularly online.
Protections for the interests of property rights owners and creators
must be built into the revised framework. The noble Lord, Lord Dubs,
mentioned that in
particular.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000049">The
Government have sought to increase the number of options available to
rights holders looking to protect their intellectual property
online—the noble Lord, Lord Wills, referred to that—in
particular, by ensuring proportionate responses are available at every
level, from court action to a voluntary response. The Government have
supported collaboration between 
<?notus-xml column=64?>industry and law enforcement and a regular round table for those
involved is now held at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport
under the chairmanship of my honourable friend the Minister for
Culture, Communications and Creative Industries. The noble Lord, Lord
Stevenson, in particular raised that. The round table has seen several
successes, including an agreement with internet advertisers to cut off
payments and advertising to illegal
sites.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000050">On
exceptions, noble Lords raised in that connection the potential impact
of changes to copyright law on business, for example the impact on
exceptions to copyright rules on music publishing for educational use.
The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and my noble friends Lord Black of Brentwood
and Lord Dobbs mentioned that. I will write to my noble friend Lord
Black about the particular matter he raised. The Government want
teachers to be able to use creative materials in the classroom without
copyright being an obstacle but—I emphasise
“but”—this should not be done at the expense of
our educational publishing sector, on which our schools depend. We will
give teachers more flexibility to use copyright works in new and
creative ways but they will not be given a free pass. It is important
that we strike the right balance. Copyright is the means to reward
creativity; it generates investment, stimulates wider dissemination and
delivers
balance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000051">The
noble Lord, Lord Dubs, mentioned the national curriculum. The Secretary
of State for Education is due to announce the statutory consultation on
the new national curriculum shortly. Publishers will therefore be able
to consider the proposals for all national curriculum subjects. Again,
the matter of young people was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth
of Newport. I entirely agree that reading and libraries are a great
source of inspiration for young people—and adults. Next week, I
am due to answer a Question in the Chamber on libraries. Libraries come
under the budgets of local authorities and I am sure that we will have
a full discussion in the seven minutes permissible on that next week.
Again, I am personally a staunch supporter of open access to libraries.
There are many exciting opportunities. New libraries are being opened
and communities are coming together to ensure that reading and the
opportunities that it provides to young children are well understood
and recognised.</hs_para>

recognise that there are significant potential threats and
opportunities with regard to how, for instance, text and data mining
may be affected and how these technologies are used. I think we would
all agree that the priority must be to develop the best environment for
scientific and medical research. That has to include a successful
research publishing sector. I am very mindful of what my noble friend
Lord Smith of Clifton and the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, said. I will

chairman of Forward-ME, a vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary
Group on ME and a patron of a number of ME charities. The PACE trial
was funded by the MRC, the Department of Health, the Scottish Chief
Scientist Office and the Department for Work and Pensions to the tune
of £5 million. The researchers, led by chief principal
investigator, Professor Peter White, have consistently and confidently
advised medical professionals and the Government of the success of
cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, and graded exercise therapy, or
GET. The PIs’—the principal
investigators’—objective was to reverse the behavioural
and cognitive factors which they believe to be responsible for the
perpetuation of symptoms and disability. Despite the extensive
biomedical evidence base of peer-reviewed papers which undermines their
belief and despite the fact that the MRC now states that there is
evidence

the history of medicine there has been a predominance of doctrine over
science and currently there is a similar conflict between the doctrine,
which asserts that CFS/ME results from a disordered psyche, and the

Dr Ben Goldacre, known for his “Bad Science” column in
the <I>Guardian</I>, has initiated a campaign calling for publication
of all results of all trials, not just selective results. Already more
than 7,000 signatures have been collected, including from high-profile
organisations such as the MRC, the Cochrane Collaboration, the Public
Library of Science and the BMJ. It calls for all universities, ethics
committees and medical bodies to recognise that under-reporting of

define their primary outcomes before a trial begins and abide by them,
not define recovery based on the trial data. Once the PACE trial was
under way, the PIs changed the outcome measures so that the very same
score on physical functioning—the SF-36 scale—represented
both eligibility to enter the trial and “normal” function
at the end of it. Indeed, according to the<I> Lancet</I>, a participant
could have achieved a worse score at the end of the trial yet still be
classed as
“recovered”.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130206114000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000061">When

score 85 to be considered recovered but by the time of publication in

60, which was five points lower than that required to enter the study.
This illogical situation resulted from departure from the published
protocol. To overcome this, the chief PI created his own
meaning of terms; for example “recovery” does not mean
recovery as the world understands it, and a return to
“normal” does not mean a return to normal health. The

do not know how many patients reached the initial target for recovery

they introduced significantly lower measures of improvement and
abandoned an objective measure, the wearing of an actometer. The
results of the subjective reporting in the six-minute walking test
after graded exercise therapy were very poor, placing participants
below the performance of patients awaiting heart or lung transplant.

leaving 85% with no benefit from those interventions. Furthermore, of
the combined CBT/GET groups of 321 people, 91% experienced adverse
events, and only those who were well enough to attend regular hospital
appointments were included in the trial; the severely affected and

comprehensive, so there are very good data. It looked at a series of
issues about treatment and it seems pretty clear to me that cognitive
behavioural therapy is effective in something like one-fifth of
patients, which is a bit more successful than the noble Baroness
claims. I do not think we should underestimate that. They go some way
to explaining that were cognitive behavioural therapy to be used
perhaps on a slightly more financially secure footing with rather more

issue is that far too frequently, we see that many of our colleagues

depressed and I cannot get out of bed”. I would say,
“Look, I know that you don’t feel like it, but please try
to get out of bed, structure some activity for the day, do it on an
hourly basis and let’s see how you are”. Hey presto, when
they did that, the thing that they felt would not make them better
actually did. They were surprised about

dilemmas about what patients think will help. Sometimes they are
intuitively right and sometimes they are intuitively mistaken. The only
way that you can understand this is to do some work in a scientific

of them will have had particular notions about etiologies, but the
point is that they were simply looking at what worked and what did not.

me, that is good news because it gives us some indication of things

<?notus-xml column=71?>should treat them in such and such a way, and the cause is this”,
we would say, “Yes, that is true but there is a difference

is really important that when people give themselves to scientific

idea that often people would rather have a physical explanation for
things than a psychological one. It is dreadful if we encourage that by
saying, “Well, of course it is not psychological”, as
though somehow it is a smear on a patient to have psychological
difficulties. We must be very careful about that. I do not suggest that
Members of your Lordships’ House would do that but it is
something that happens out there in the community and about which we

encourage people to get into the research work, not just for the

Meacher:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady Mar for
tabling this Question for Short Debate concerning the PACE trial. I

Trust. Professor White, a leading researcher in the PACE trial, works
as a consultant in that trust in addition to his research post at Queen
Mary, University of

can be a seriously disabling syndrome. I like to refer to it as a
syndrome because it seems to be not one but a number of diseases. NICE
compares the physical symptoms of CFS/ME with those of multiple
sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus—if I can pronounce that
correctly—and rheumatoid arthritis, probably three of the most
fearsome illnesses one can think of. To make matters worse for
sufferers, as the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, so rightly said, the
causes and disease processes of CFS/ME are not yet understood. That
must be a deeply frightening thing for any
patient.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000090">Doctors
can misdiagnose sufferers or, worse still, dismiss them as not really
physically ill at all. I understand that for some, some psychological
aspects may be important and for others they may not. I am aware of
people who have had major viruses and suddenly been struck down, having
led very active lives, getting on with things and being fine. We have
to be very careful about any assumptions, whether physical,
psychological or
whatever.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000091">CFS/ME
is all too real. Of course we need much more research. I await the
outcome of Professor White’s cytokine research later this year,
for example. We look to the MRC and others to prioritise this
distressing 
<?notus-xml column=72?>syndrome. Thankfully, the MRC has two boards—it probably has
others, too. One funds studies such as PACE and the other funds studies
into the immune system, and viral and genetic considerations. The PACE
study did not in any way affect funding for organic CFS/ME research.
That is terribly important because there are fears that it may have
done.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130206114000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000092">As the
noble Lord said, the experts believe that in time a number of distinct
diseases will be identified that currently fall within the CFS/ME
label. In the mean time, NICE recommends CBT and/or graded exercise
therapy for people with mild or moderate CFS/ME because these are the
interventions for which there is the clearest evidence of benefit to
patients. No doubt in time treatments that attack the causes and
achieve better and faster results will be developed but in the mean
time it is a great step forward that, as in the PACE trial, 22% of
patients recover—I agree that there is debate about the word
“recovery”—after only 13 sessions of CBT or graded
exercise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000093" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000093"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:49:59"></hs_TimeCode>Meanwhile,
60% of patients achieve significant improvements in both fatigue and
exercise levels after the same period, according to the PACE study,
which certainly fits with my experience of the limited number of
people—about half a dozen—who I know. A meta-analysis
showed a 50% recovery rate after one year. These results are very
significantly better than spontaneous recovery rates or those following
alternative available treatments. From our most helpful discussion on
Monday, I understand that my noble friend Lady Mar respects the PACE
study but, very reasonably in my view, has grave concerns about the
spin put upon the results. People have to be very careful. We all know
what happens once things get into the media but the spin that is put on
these things is really important for patients. Things can be very
hurtful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000094">I
understand that the DWP may treat people as workshy if they have not
undergone a CBT/GET treatment regime. At least a quarter of PCT areas
do not have any specialist services for these patients. Others have
nothing but grossly inadequate services at a pathetic level. It is
essential that the DWP and, indeed, insurance companies take account of
the non-availability of such services in many areas. Will the Minister
pass on this concern to the noble Lord, Lord Freud? The DWP also needs
to be aware that CFS/ME patients can take time to improve. I am not an
expert but out of the people I know, several have needed much longer
than one year to recover acceptable levels of
functioning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000095">In
terms of returning to work, the PACE trial had no effect whatever on
the numbers of CFS/ME patients in work. I would not expect it to have
done. These people have been, on average, out of work for two and a
half years before they entered the trial, and from all the work that
numbers of us have done over many years, we know that it is incredibly
difficult to get people back into work if they have been out of work
for two and a half or three and a half years. However, the social care
costs and the need for family support were reduced. People were much
better—not necessarily completely better but an awful lot of
them were much better.</hs_para>

few other issues arising from the PACE study, including the fact that
10% of patients deteriorated during the trial. I understand that all
these deteriorations resulted from life events or other infections
during the trial period. We know well that serious life events or
further infections do—or can—cause relapses in this
horrible set of illnesses or this syndrome.
Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T17:53:01"></hs_TimeCode>, there
is the question of whether ME patients benefited from the PACE trial. I
am reliably informed that 51% of the patients in the PACE trial had
been defined as having ME. I know there are all sorts of debates about
that definition, but there was no significant difference in the outcome
of treatment for patients who had been deemed to be suffering from ME
relative to patients who had been given the CFS label.</hs_para>

have been expressed about the 11 serious adverse reactions to
treatment. The 10 “possible” adverse reactions were
equally distributed across the four treatment types. There is no
indication that CBT or GET caused any problems. There was one
“probable” serious adverse reaction, which was in the
medical treatment group and was a reaction to an anti-depressant. Some
of us are very familiar with the fact that people can have reactions to
anti-depressants, but there is no evidence that CBT or GET can be
dangerous.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000098">The

Layard:</Member></B> My Lords, I too greatly welcome this debate. This
is a terrible condition and we are talking about hundreds of thousands
of people who are suffering from it. While it is clear that although
there have been many studies relative to the seriousness and
pervasiveness of this condition, there is far too little research into
what is causing it. I want to focus on treatment, as there have been
terrible misunderstandings and misconceptions put about on that
score.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130206114000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000101">I
want to make just four points. First, the issue of what causes the
condition is often quite different from how we can best treat it. This
is such a basic point but it is not fully understood by many of the
people suffering from this condition. Coronary heart disease may be
caused by cholesterol but we treat it with a stent. In the same way,
chronic fatigue may be caused 
<?notus-xml column=74?>by a virus yet the best treatment available at the moment may include
psychological therapy. This form of treatment implies nothing about
what we believe to be the cause. People who suffer from CFS, and who in
almost all cases feel that it is not psychological in origin, are
surely making a mistake when they reject psychological support for
their condition on the grounds that this implies something about its
cause. In their own interest, they should focus on what is the best
possible treatment available on the evidence.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130206114000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000102">Secondly, we have
quite a lot of evidence about which treatments work. More will surely
be discovered in future and some of them will surely be biological. In
the mean time, we have a large amount of evidence that both CBT and
graded exercise therapy enable many more people to recover than if the
only treatment they have is standard medical care. My main point here
is that this is so, whatever the definition of recovery. It is wrong to
suggest that this all depends upon that definition; you can put the
cut-off for recovery in many different places and you will always find
that people who get CBT and graded exercise therapy do better than
people who have only standard medical care. There are many studies
preceding PACE to show this. Of course, that is the main finding of
PACE, which I would say is a fine piece of work by all normal
standards. Some of the criticisms are really misleading but some of
them have been answered
already.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000103">I
come back to this question of the change in the protocol to stress that
this was made before any analysis was done of the results. It was not
that they looked at the results and said, “Let’s change
the recovery criteria”. The changes were made because of
discussions affecting the whole research world and agreed by the trial
steering committee. What is very interesting is that a separate paper
has been written simply on the recovery issue, which uses five or six
different criteria of recovery. Again, in the PACE study it is shown
that whatever cut-off you use, you get the same difference between the
outcome of CBT and graded exercise therapy. There really is not a
conjuring trick going on here and it is wrong for this impression to be
given to the community of people who are suffering, if that leads to
them not receiving help which they could really benefit from. Instead
of criticising the study, we should be rejoicing that we again have
more evidence that something can be done which is better than standard
medical care.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130206114000104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000104">My third point has, in
a way, been made before but given the strength of this evidence that we
have these treatments which work, it is shocking that they are so
little available. This is part of a wider story of the non-availability
of psychological therapy. The survey that was done by Action for M.E.
found that a large number of PCTs were providing no specialist
treatment clinics for this condition—or were not providing any
kind of care, let alone this most evidence-based care. That is a
disgrace and I hope that the Minister can say something about
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130206114000105" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000105">The
treatments are not unsafe, a claim that is often put about due to the
fact that, of course, some people get worse during treatment. The only
argument against the treatment, if it were the case, would be if people

<?notus-xml column=75?>who did not receive it were less likely to get worse. Again, the
statistics are absolutely clear: the proportion of people who get worse
in treatment is no higher than that for people who get worse who are
not in treatment. There is no argument whatever that this is
unsafe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:00:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000106">My
fourth point is about how we can get a better deal for this large group
of sufferers. Obviously, the worst possible way to get it is to turn
the area into a battleground. It gives the commissioners the perfect
excuse for doing nothing and gives people of good will, who might come
in and try to help people with this condition, a serious disincentive
for getting into this field. As we know, and has already been said,
many—or certainly some—of the people who work in this
area have received repeated insults and even death threats. I pay
particular tribute to Sir Simon Wessely at King’s College
London, who has led the field for many years in this area and has stuck
to it, despite all this harassment. He and his

know that some patients who develop symptoms of CFS/ME will recover
fully but that the majority go on to have a fluctuating long-term
condition. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, that there is
no single cause for this condition. Some 10% to 12% of people who have
glandular fever develop the symptoms of CFS/ME, but there are many
other precipitants, too. It is a very distressing condition for people
to have and is confusing and difficult for families, friends and
employers, particularly because the condition may fluctuate in its
effects so dramatically and vary in its severity. It is not surprising
that people with CFS/ME may feel that they are not believed and that
their family and friends are unsympathetic at times. Imagine living
with an illness that fluctuates, recurs after mild exertion and is
associated with what people describe as brain fog? As it stands, a very
limited range of therapies are available and, understandably, this
patient group has ended up feeling overlooked and
neglected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000111">The
greatest weapon against illness and disease is robust, peer-reviewed
research. Research into both causation and the factors that sustain
symptoms is important, as is research into effective interventions. I
am particularly pleased that current biomedical research funded by the

by looking at mitochondrial function, autonomic dysfunction and sleep
disturbance. It is essential that we continue to look at the best
possible
treatments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000112">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:03:44"></hs_TimeCode>
will speak briefly about the PACE trial, which of course most noble
Lords have spoken about and which enrolled 640 participants. Just last
week, the follow-up 
<?notus-xml column=76?>study, looking at recovery after one year, was published in the journal
<I>Psychological Medicine</I>. Noble Lords may know that the trial
showed that an average of only 13 sessions of CBT or graded exercise
therapy, over just six months and as a supplement to good specialist
medical care, had rates of recovery of 22%. My understanding is that,
by “recovery”, the researchers included the fact that
after a year these patients no longer met the criteria for CFS/ME. This
would be heralded as a fantastic outcome for the treatment of MS,
Parkinson’s disease or cancer. Only 8% of those receiving
adaptive pacing therapy and 7% of those receiving just specialist
medical care achieved the same degree of recovery. In other words, the
successful treatments were three times more likely to lead to recovery
than the comparison treatments. Of course, that was after just one
year, but follow-up is continuing, and I look forward to hearing

outcomes are achieved for all illnesses, from heart disease and cancer
to schizophrenia and depression, when the overall well-being of the
patient—biological, psychological and social—is taken
into account. That is not to say that there is no physical reason
behind the onset of illness, or that physiological effects are not
continuing to maintain or modify the disease process. My noble
friend’s debate today is concerned with both health and care,
including access to benefits. It is yet another reminder of the
importance of a holistic approach to care, an intertwining of body and
mind. This complex interaction has been acknowledged since ancient
times but somehow, over the past 100 years, with the elucidation of
many physical causes for illness, the mind-body connection has been
somewhat forgotten. Thankfully, this connection has again been brought
to the fore by the Government’s welcome commitment to parity of
esteem between physical and mental health. The Royal College of
Psychiatrists, of which I am a former president, has long been
concerned about the physical effects of psychological stress and the
psychological effects of physical stress. Interdisciplinary
research—which brings together, for example, the
neuropsychiatrist with the immunologist—is vitally
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000114" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000114">Could
the Minister clarify whether the arrangements being made to ensure that
evidence-based treatments, such as those tested in the PACE trial and
recommended by NICE, are commissioned and that they do not fall through
any gaps caused by what has been called an orphan status for this
condition? To explain what I mean, CFS/ME can be classified under both
neurological and psychiatric disorders for clinical purposes; it is not
clearly claimed by any one specialist group as being its primary
responsibility. This means that many people diagnosed with CFS/ME will
not be referred to a specialist centre and that the treatment they need
will just not be available. Research will shine more light on this
condition and begin to distinguish whether subgroups of patients will
be more responsive to different new treatments being evidenced and
introduced.</hs_para>

illness such as, for example, major life events, which are known to

the past underinvestment in this poorly understood condition—or
set of conditions—by highlighting it as a priority area for

the CFS/ME research collaborative mentioned by my noble friend will be

I have participated in, most recently our extensive debate last
November on neurological diseases, initiated by my noble friend
Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:09:17"></hs_TimeCode> Ford. What
is new to me is the focus on the PACE trial and the opportunity to hear
from our expert medical and psychiatrist colleagues about the wider
issues and perspectives, and about the trial itself: what it covered,
who was involved, its findings and results and the wider, extensive
research that is currently being undertaken across the

PACE trial was the largest-ever randomised controlled trial of
treatments of CFS/ME, primarily funded by the Medical Research Council
following competitive peer review, with its main findings concerning
efficacy and safety published in the<I> Lancet</I>. It was designed to
compare improvements in safety after CBT and GET with outcomes after
ADP and SMC. The patients were recruited from hospital clinics in
England and Scotland, and were able to travel to clinics to receive
treatment. The trial was not designed to test treatments in patients
with severely disabling illness. As a non-expert, it seems to me that
some of the criticisms and disappointments levelled at PACE do not
fully recognise

noble Lords in this debate, the trial provided clear evidence that both
CBT and GET were better than ADP or SMC in improving both symptoms and
disability. In fact, all the treatments were found to be safe without
any serious reactions to treatments in any of the treatment groups. I
understand that a paper published last week showed that CBT and GET are

November, the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, assured the House that
all the neurological and specialist conditions would have

outline the steps that the Government are taking to ensure that the
commissioning arrangements provide appropriate and adequate specialist
care for patients suffering from illnesses such as CFS and ME which are
not easily classified under normal commissioning arrangements? To help
this, will the Government give CCGs guidance on which illnesses should

pay tribute to the way in which she continues to raise issues of
concern in your Lordships’ House, as well as her unswerving
commitment to improving the experience of people living with CFS/ME. I
recognise how distressing and debilitating the condition can be for
individuals, their carers and their families. Equally, I recognise the
difficulties that many patients face in getting the treatment and care
they need to help them manage their illness and, where they can, make a
recovery; we have heard that this afternoon. I am sure that we all

worth acknowledging that, while many patients feel let down by the
system, many patients have had a positive experience and have worked
with health and social care professionals to manage their care
effectively. It is also important to acknowledge that doctors and other
professionals working in this field are highly committed to providing
the best possible care for their patients. We want to see people with
CFS/ME being listened to when it comes to decisions about what type of
treatment and care may best meet their individual needs and, across the
country, many doctors are working with their patients to achieve this.

there is widespread uncertainty surrounding this condition; that has
shone through in this debate. There is controversy, disagreement and
divided and often polarised opinion about its causes and the best way

research—the noble Lord, Lord Winston, made clear how extensive
this is—we do not yet know 
<?notus-xml column=79?>definitively the cause or causes of CFS/ME: whether it is a disease; a
condition, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollins, described it; or a
syndrome, as the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, described it. The noble
Lords, Lord Winston and Lord Layard, surely are right that it is

is not alone in being mystifying. We do not know the causes of most
cancers and other diseases such as Alzheimer’s. That lack of
knowledge, however, has not stopped us from seeking the best forms of
treatment. Many of these diseases are treated well even though we do
not know their causes. I quite agree that more research is needed. In

available. So<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:15:32"></hs_TimeCode>

brings me to the PACE trial that has prompted today’s debate.
The MRC’s decision to fund this trial was based on the fact that
there was a lack of high-quality evidence to inform the treatment of
CFS/ME and, in particular, on the need to evaluate the treatments that
were already in use and for which there was insufficiently strong
evidence from randomised controlled trials to support their
effectiveness. The decision to fund this trial was based on the
MRC’s usual rigorous peer review process for clinical trials, as
noble Lords have emphasised. The experts who reviewed the application
were satisfied that the design put forward was of high quality, would
provide useful evidence to help doctors and patients decide whether any
of the four treatments to be evaluated was likely to be worth pursuing,
and would help inform decisions on the provision of treatment by the
NHS<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:16:41"></hs_TimeCode>. The noble
Lord, Lord Winston, and others argued that this was a controlled and
rigorous study. All agree that research is

the challenges that were raised by the noble Countess, Lady Mar. She
expressed concern about the selection method for participants. I assure
her that having neurological symptoms, such as memory difficulties or
muscle weakness, did not exclude anyone from taking part in the trial
since these symptoms were medically recognised symptoms of the
condition. While researchers used the Oxford definition to define the
condition in the PACE trial, participants were also assessed to see
whether they met the international Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention criteria to see whether the effects of treatments were
different in those who met this alternative definition.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:17:34"></hs_TimeCode> independent
members of the trial steering committee reviewed and agreed the plans

Lady Mar, also expressed concern about the recovery statistics and
other areas in relation to the protocol. As for all MRC-funded studies,
it is the responsibility of the investigators and the relevant
journals, guided by peer reviewers, to determine how findings are
published and when. The investigators’ first paper on the
outcomes of the PACE study was published in the <I>Lancet</I> in March
2011. A later paper was published in August 2012, which dealt with the
cost-effectiveness of the interventions. Further papers will be
published, including papers showing a long-term 
<?notus-xml column=80?>follow-up after two-and-a-half years. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollins,
made a very important point about follow-up, and no doubt the MRC will
bear that in mind and will look at this debate. Follow-up in all these
trials is very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:18:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000130">The
noble Countess, Lady Mar, asked about severely disabled patients being
excluded from the trial. Patients had to be able to attend hospital for
treatment, but a number needed mobility aids and others received
treatment by telephone when they were too unwell to attend a clinic
once they had been
recruited<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:18:59"></hs_TimeCode>. She
also asked whether the trial data could be reanalysed. As she will
know, there are ethical and legal barriers to releasing data to a
member of the public without consent when these data contain medical
information that might identify the patient. The main outcome data have
already been independently analysed by a Cochrane Collaboration group
and a paper is being prepared for publication. I know that she will
look at that with
interest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-06T18:19:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000131" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000131">An
often voiced criticism is that the money spent on the PACE trial would
have been better spent on research into causes. As the noble Baroness,
Lady Meacher, indicated, the two are not mutually exclusive. While
understanding the cause of the condition is obviously important, if
potential treatments are available, it is equally important to test
their effectiveness so that they can be introduced into service. Of
relevance to this is that the PACE trial tested adaptive pacing
therapy, which had not previously been tested in a large trial and
which is supported by patient organisations. Various noble Lords have
paid tribute to the quality of the research, even though the noble
Countess, Lady Mar, was more
sceptical.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000132">As
the noble Countess is aware, the findings of the PACE study reflect the
recommendations in current NICE guidance. I understand that concerns
have been expressed that patients may have their choices about care
restricted because the PACE trial supports their non-recommendation by
NICE or that patients may be forced into treatments they do not want
because they are recommended. I assure noble Lords that clinical
guidelines published by NICE help to promote consistency but recognise
that patients are individuals who may require different forms of
management. Clinicians are therefore free to adapt the guidelines when
deciding, in consultation with their patients, the most appropriate
treatment. NICE routinely reviews the need to update its guidance in
order to take account of the latest available evidence. As the noble
Countess is aware, CFS/ME is currently a highlighted area and a high
priority for the MRC. The high-quality research stimulated by the
MRC’s recent call will add to the future evidence
base.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000133">Concern
has been expressed that the findings of the trial will be used to
reduce the number of people with CFS/ME on state benefits. That was
flagged up briefly by noble Lords. I should like to dispel straight
away the idea that CFS/ME is not recognised by the Department for Work
and Pensions as a potentially serious condition. For example, there are
no targets for finding individuals fit for work in the work capability
assessment process. The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, raised this
particular issue and asked whether patients who do not comply 
<?notus-xml column=81?>with the CBT or take the treatment recommended to them might have their
benefits withdrawn. I can assure her that that is not the case.
Entitlement to employment support allowance is not based on compliance
with specific treatments and anyone claiming ESA will undergo the work
capability assessment. That assessment is founded on the premise that
eligibility should not be based on a person’s condition or the
treatment regime for it but rather on the way that that condition
limits their functional capability. I am happy to flag this debate to
the DWP, as the noble Baroness asked me to, in regard to the
availability of
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000134">The
noble Baroness also asked me about the NHS Commissioning Board and
whether it would give equal weight to a number of other diseases. I can
assure her that the mandate to the NHS Commissioning Board will ensure
that improvements are made to the quality of life for all people living
with long-term conditions including this

noble Lord, Lord Layard, asked me about specialist treatment provided
by PCTs. In the new system, clinical commissioning groups will be
responsible for commissioning specialist CFS/ME services. As he knows,
they comprise front-line clinicians. We certainly hope that they will
therefore have a good understanding of their local communities,
including patients with these problems. The NHS Commissioning Board
will hold those CCGs accountable for the services that they commission,
as well as providing support, for 
<?notus-xml column=82?>example through the development of commissioning guides. I understand
that Martin McShane, long-term conditions lead at the NHS Commissioning
Board, has already met with the CFS/ME patient groups to discuss their
concerns. Those discussions will inform the board’s work as
things move
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000136" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000136">The
Government’s aim is to help individuals who are suffering from
these problems both to receive appropriate treatment and to get back to
work where they can do so. They also seek a better understanding of the
situation that these individuals are in. The PACE trial was funded to
respond to the concerns of patients, carers and doctors that more
research into CFS/ME was required. Of course, we all hope that health
research results in people becoming healthier and fewer suffering from
these kinds of problems. This is obviously a major focus for the MRC in
making its individual funding
decisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130206114000137" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-gc0001.htm#130206114000137">In
conclusion, I hope that the noble Countess will agree that we are
sympathetic to the needs of patients with CFS/ME. I appreciate, as do
other noble Lords, her many concerns. I hope that I have reassured her
that we are investing in improved services for CFS/ME patients and in
an expanded research programme—noble Lords have emphasised the
importance of research moving forward in this area—and that this
should make a difference to the lives of the many people affected by

responses to the consultation show there is overwhelming support, from
some 96% of respondents, for some form of compulsory microchipping of
all dogs. Microchipping makes a clear link between a dog and its owner.
Over 100,000 dogs either stray, are lost or stolen each year with many
having to be kept in kennels before being re-homed. Having a microchip
means they can be reunited quickly with their owners, reducing the
stress for dog and owner alike. It will also lead to substantial
savings for local authorities and welfare charities who spend some
£57 million a year on kennelling costs and will mean that fewer
dogs are destroyed. Some 6,000 dogs have to be put down each year,
because their owner cannot be
found.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020667000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-wms0001.htm#13020667000012">We have
listened to the views of those who responded to the consultation
particularly on the question of practicality for owners and those
dealing with stray or lost dogs. Only 10% favoured the option of
microchipping puppies. The 10 to 12 year delay before all dogs would be
microchipped is considered too long to wait to get the benefits and the
police and others did not feel it was practical.</hs_para>

regulations to require the microchipping of all dogs in England from 6
April 2016. From that date owners will need to have their
dog microchipped and registered on one of the authorised commercial
databases available; and they will have to register the details
of any new owner before they sell or give the dog away. Owners will be
required to keep their contact details up to date on the microchip
databases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020667000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-wms0001.htm#13020667000014">Defra
is now working with database providers and microchip suppliers to
ensure minimum standards of service for commercial databases and
standards of microchips, and that there is updated implantation
guidance and training available as well as a one-stop 24-hour enquiry

to thank the Dogs Trust for its very generous support which means a
free microchip will be available for all unchipped dogs throughout
England. The Government are working with the Dogs Trust to ensure that
free microchips will be offered by the Dogs Trust to local authorities,
housing associations and veterinary surgeries. A number of other animal
welfare charities are offering free microchipping at their centres
including Battersea Dogs and Cats Home and Blue
Cross.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020667000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-wms0001.htm#13020667000016">We

dangerous and out of control dogs was an important part of the measures
put forward by Defra last year. The Government have decided to toughen
up the existing law. The ban on owning or selling some types of dogs
bred for fighting will remain for public safety reasons. We agree with
advice from the police that the ban on the Pit Bull Terrier, Japanese
Tosa, Dogo Argentino and Fila Braziliero should remain in place
to protect the public and to help deal with potentially dangerous dogs.
However, we also accept that any dog can become dangerous and that
owners 
<?notus-xml column=15?>are ultimately responsible for the behaviour of
their dogs. The Government’s approach is one of tackling both
deed and
breed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020667000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-wms0001.htm#13020667000019">Incidents
involving dangerous dogs are on the rise, and it is wrong that the
police cannot investigate offences and put them forward for prosecution
simply because a dog attack occurred on private property. Eight
children and six adults have been killed in dog attacks since 2005,
with many of these attacks taking place in the home; five of the
victims were children under the age of four years. Concerns have also
been raised about dog attacks on postal workers and health visitors and
social workers during home visits. People just doing their job should
not be subject to dog attacks. The public agree. The consultation has
shown wide support for the proposal to extend the scope of the offence
in Section 3 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 to all places, including
private property. Extending the law will help give protection both to
children in their homes, and to people who have to visit private
properties such as healthcare, postal and utility workers. Postal
workers in particular have suffered some terrible attacks, and the
proposed change to the 1991 Act will close the loophole that has meant
these attacks go unpunished. However, the proposed extension to the
criminal law will not provide protection to trespassers who have
entered a private property whom the householder believes has unlawful
intentions. Defra will bring forward amendments to the Dangerous Dogs
Act 1991 as soon as parliamentary time permits to effect this change in
the law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020667000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-wms0001.htm#13020667000020">The
Government are also concerned to ensure that irresponsible dog
ownership is tackled before a serious incident has occurred. As well as
the ban on certain breeds of fighting dog, Defra is working closely
with the Home Office and other authorities to introduce new powers to
help front-line professionals tackle anti-social behaviour involving
dogs. The measures proposed in the draft Anti-Social Behaviour Bill
published on 13 December 2012 will provide a set of flexible, effective
tools and powers to enable police and local authorities to tackle a
wide range of anti-social behaviour including dog-related
incidents.</hs_para>

ensure the welfare of suspected prohibited dogs that have become the
subject of court proceedings and to ease the substantial costs to the
police service, Government have also decided that it should no longer
be necessary for the police to seize and kennel such dogs pending the
outcome of court proceedings where the police do not consider the dog
presents a risk to the public. The police will have discretion to
release a suspected prohibited dog where they are completely satisfied
that it is in the care of a responsible owner. They will be allowed to
put extra restrictions on the owner, eg requiring the dog to be muzzled
and on a lead when in public. These changes will be made by way of
amendments to the exemption scheme and can be made through secondary
legislation.</hs_para>

allowing suspected prohibited dogs to be exempted from seizure in these

propose to raise the fee payable by the owner for placing prohibited
dogs on the index of exempted dogs to £77 plus VAT from the

involved in administering these dogs for their lifetime better and
thereby reduce the burden on the taxpayer.</hs_para>

dog ownership is a complex problem and there is no single solution. The
primary responsibility for ensuring that dogs are kept under proper
control must rest with individual owners who should only acquire a dog
if they are prepared to look after it properly and make sure that it
does not become a nuisance or a danger to others. A key concern of
Government is the ease with which it is possible to buy a dog or other
pet over the internet. There is a rise in the trend for pets to be
advertised for sale in this way, and Defra is working closely with the
animal welfare charities to develop codes of conduct for website
operators and to provide guidance for buyers on the potential pitfalls
of buying pets in this way. We look forward to co-operation from the
industry to the benefit of
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020667000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206-wms0001.htm#13020667000028">We
consider that education also has a significant role to play in reducing
the problems associated with irresponsible dog ownership. Government
have provided funding of £50,000 shared between the RSPCA,
Battersea Cats and Dogs Home and the Dogs Trust to foster innovative
local community projects to encourage responsible dog ownership in
areas where there are high instances of dog-related problems. The
funding was provided on the basis that the interventions will be
carefully evaluated and the learning disseminated to help others
working with local communities including local authorities. That
evaluation is under way. Funding has been given to the Association of
Chief Police Officers to support the training that they provide for
officers with knowledge of dog control legislation in order to ensure
that there is a centre for such expertise in every police
force.</hs_para>

Expenditure on the new homes bonus in 2013-14 will be
£668.3 million. As the bonus is paid for six years,
£668.3 million is therefore already committed to be spent in
both 2014-15 and 2015-16, to which will be added an additional amount
reflecting increases in effective housing stock for those years. Actual
figures will depend on delivery in increasing housing stock, the
council tax banding of new stock, and decisions on council
tax levels made by local authorities. It is not therefore possible to
make an assessment of expenditure on new homes bonus for those
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020694000184" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130206w0001.htm#13020694000184">In the

fund the new homes bonus. This amount was funded from within my

beyond that amount is taken from the local government settlement. The

further consequential allocations are
