that competition should never be deployed for competition’s sake
but only in the interests of patients. Furthermore, competition should
be on the basis of quality and not price. The answer to the noble
Lord’s question is that we need to arrive progressively at a
system of tariffs that fairly reflect the value and cost of the work
that providers do, and that all providers should compete equally on
that

Howe:</Member></B> My noble friend is absolutely right. Various
contracts have been criticised for being too long: PFI is perhaps a
good example. Other types of contract have been criticised for being
too short because they do not enable providers to invest on a
sufficient timescale in order to be able confidently to bid for work. I
have little doubt, once again, that this is an area that Monitor will
look at and make recommendations

national tariffs if there is a good reason to do so on the grounds of
local variation in costs. There is some flexibility in the system, but

the eurozone crisis, increasing competitiveness and taking steps to

Morgan of Ely:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for that reply. I am
sure that most member states would agree on the need to reform some
aspects of the EU, but for the UK to develop a different relationship
with the EU, every member state would have to agree. Any country could
say no, and that would be the end of the story. That would leave this
country in a very precarious position, particularly given that the
Prime Minister has promised a referendum. Does the Minister therefore
agree that the fate of the future relationship with the UK with its
main trading partner is too serious a matter to gamble on the whim of
any single country, particularly in the light of the fact that the

in Europe at the moment are too serious to ignore. As the noble
Baroness herself says, there is a need for reform. There are some
serious challenges in relation to competitiveness, the changes that
have come about because of the eurozone and the most serious issue of
improving democratic legitimacy. There is a real disconnect between the
citizens of the European Union and what they feel that the European

original Question, although there is sympathy among several member
states with some of the themes of the Prime Minister’s speech,
and although there is widespread agreement on the need for reform,
surely that is seen to be reform that affects the whole of the EU. What
is the position if there is no treaty that reforms the whole EU by
2017? Will the British

likely at the moment that some reform will be required to meet the
needs of the eurozone. As the noble Lord, Lord Owen, powerfully
reminded us in the debate on the Queen’s Speech at the opening
of this Session, that requires the United Kingdom to have a position
about what the situation should be because it is not in the eurozone.
It is bound to affect the whole European Union. Surely it is better to
think about it now than to wait until a decision that we have not had
time to think about is suddenly required.</hs_para>

a breach of an authority’s duty to provide a
comprehensive and efficient service. Library services are adapting to
changing needs. The Government have appointed a specialist libraries

much aware of the points of view and their importance to communities.
To come to the Question, clearly it is important that the local
authorities reflect on the local need. That is precisely why there is a
specialist libraries adviser, as I particularly mentioned, whose job it
is to work with the local authorities where there is a question of

this is about a comprehensive and efficient system. I shall expand
quickly and briefly on the fact that we have heard about closures but
there are in  fact some incredibly good success stories of
openings and relocations. One of the key challenges for public library
provision is where we locate them so that they can be an even greater
part of the modernised situations—for instance, new libraries
alongside cafes and adult learning classes. These are areas where we
can have new openings in urban and rural areas and expansions in
certain areas. There will be cases where they will be rationalisation
but there is a responsibility to ensure that it is a comprehensive

Trust, two very important charities in that sector; indeed, the Book
Trust is involved with book-giving for children. One of the key points
that I identified on my visit to these libraries is that we are going
through a technological revolution in terms of libraries. The number of
e-books that are loaned has risen in two years from 100,000 to nearly
600,000. We are going to have to deal with those new technologies and
how we encourage young people and the community to be involved. Among
the key pilot schemes are  the 22 schemes for automatically
joining primary schoolchildren—I am told that in Norfolk they
will be joined at birth—and the children will encourage their
parents to come to the libraries as
well.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_11_PT_1/93E08F52A5107DAC32010C59C815344E0AD9C381" __version__="1.12"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 February 2013">Monday,

based on multiple hypotheticals and intangible variables. I will do my
best to deliver my response with a touch of realism. The
Government’s policy on the EU is clear. It was set out most
recently in the mid-term review and was confirmed in the Prime
Minister’s speech, so no analysis has been made at this time of
the number of jobs that might be created or, indeed, lost as a result
of a UK exit.</hs_para>

Davies of </B><B>Stamford</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, I am afraid
that the Minister’s bureaucratic evasion cannot avoid the bare
fact that no one has ever suggested that leaving the European Union
would create a single job, but everybody knows that doing so would put
at risk many jobs, both present and future, depending on future
decisions about the location of investment. Against that background,
why are the Government gratuitously creating this uncertainty for
investors and employers? Can we have an explanation for why over the
past few weeks several Cabinet Ministers have openly been talking about
their willingness to leave the European
Union?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000054"><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="1302113000364" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000364"><B>Viscount
Younger of </B><B>Leckie</B><B>:</B></Member><B> </B>The noble Lord is
right in saying that we were right to stay within the European Union.
The reason that decisions have been made to get rid of the uncertainty
is because questions are 
<?notus-xml column=455?>being asked, not only within the UK but within Europe, about our future,
and it is right to settle that now. I stress that the
noble Lord is right in saying that it is very
important that we stay in the EU. The single market provides UK
businesses with access to a market of 500 million customers worth
around £11 trillion in 2011. Between 1992 and 2008, the single
market is estimated to have raised EU GDP by 2.13% and to have created
2.77 million new jobs. It is estimated that those benefits could be
doubled with the removal of the remaining trade
barriers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000055"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Pearson of Rannoch" PimsId="136" UID="1302113000365" xid="1385" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000365"><B>Lord
Pearson of </B><B>Rannoch</B><B>:</B></Member><B> </B>My Lords, given
that only 9% of our GDP exports to the European Union, declining and in
deficit, that 11% of our GDP exports to the markets of the future,
rising and in surplus, and that 80% stays in our domestic economy, is
it not obvious that that 91% of our GDP, which is made up of our non-EU
exports and our domestic economy, would generate several million new
jobs if they were freed from the stifling overregulation from
Brussels?</hs_para>

Younger of </B><B>Leckie</B><B>:</B></Member> It may not surprise the
noble Lord that I do not agree with his approach. It is estimated that
around 3.5 million jobs in the UK are dependent on trade with the EU.
The UK exports a wide range of goods and services to other European
member states, everything from cars, worth more than £13 billion
in 2011, through music, which represents £1 billion and even
more once related services, royalties and licences are included, to a
wide variety of food and drink products, worth close to £10.5
billion. There is much to be lost if we leave the
EU.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000057"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Razzall" PimsId="320" UID="1302113000367" xid="1405" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000367"><B>Lord

noble friend, but I stress again that it is right to end the
uncertainty of the questions that are persistently asked. My noble
friend mentioned UK car manufacturers. They effectively saved
£0.9 billion in 2009 by not having to pay the common external
tariff to export to the EU. This equates to a saving of £1,100
per vehicle exported in 2009 to the EU. I stress that there are large
figures involved in needing to settle the
uncertainty.</hs_para>

in 2010, we were borrowing £1 in every £4 that we spent,
and interest payments were costing us £85 million a day. We have
begun to make progress on that deficit—it has since reduced by a
quarter. But there are still difficult decisions to be taken if we want
a stronger economy that delivers a better future for everyone. Let me
be clear about that: everyone, all of us, whoever we are, deserves the
chance to do the best for ourselves and our
families.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000072">Several<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T15:10:15"></hs_TimeCode>
commentators have said that we should look first to make savings from
those with the broadest shoulders—the richest in
society—and I am proud to say that we are. This
Government’s plans increase the total tax contribution from the
most well off. As a result of our actions, the richest pay more tax on
capital gains, more stamp duty on their homes, more tax on their
pensions and are less able to avoid or evade tax.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T15:10:47"></hs_TimeCode> top 20% of
households continue to make the greatest contribution towards reducing
the deficit. The Autumn Statement raises more than £1
billion pounds a year from the richest and more than
£8.5 billion over the forecast period. Overall, the
richest will pay more in tax during this Parliament than under the
previous Government’s tax plans.</hs_para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T15:11:03"></hs_TimeCode>as we seek to
reduce the deficit and retain credibility with financial markets, we

£1 in every £8 that the Government spend. The Institute

Bill provides for most working-age benefits, tax credits and statutory
payments to be subject to a 1% increase in 2014-15 and 2015-16. I will
not go through the full list but it is set out in the Schedule to the
Bill and the Explanatory Notes. As a result of this, the Bill will save
£1.9 billion in 2015-16. We have also retained safeguards for a
number of key benefits, which will not be subject to the provisions in
the Bill.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1302113000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000076">For
pensioners, we<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T15:12:26"></hs_TimeCode>
are maintaining our commitment to the triple lock, a commitment which
will see the basic state pension rise by earnings, prices, or 2.5%,
whichever is highest. In 2013-14, when both prices and earnings growth
are below 2.5%, we will ensure that the poorest pensioners will see the
same cash increase by over-indexing the guarantee element in pension
credit, which would normally rise with earnings. In addition, for
disabled people and carers, we have 
<?notus-xml column=459?>committed to uprating benefits covering additional needs to the costs
that they incur because of their disabilities in line with inflation.
The protection applies to disability living allowance, attendance
allowance, carers allowance, the disability premiums in working age
benefits, the disability elements in tax credits, the carer premium and
the support component of the employment and support allowance. Those
are not included in this Bill: they are protected.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T15:13:33"></hs_TimeCode>We have sought
to find a balance between making necessary savings and protecting those
who are least able to increase their spending power.</hs_para>

strike a balance between supporting those on benefits while containing
the costs of the welfare system. Let us not forget that most people
have faced significant pay restraint in recent years. Looking at
average incomes over the past five years, including those in low-paid
jobs, those in work saw their incomes rise half as quickly as those on
out-of-work benefits, at a rate of 10% compared to 20%. Let us not
forget that public sector workers have had their pay frozen and then
increased by just 1%. Indeed, even with the 1% increase on these
benefits, on current projections out-of-work benefits will still be at
a higher level in 2015-16 than if they had been uprated by average
earnings growth since the financial crisis began. While people want to
know that the welfare system is there for them in hard times, when they
need to draw on it, they also want to be confident that it reflects the
budgeting decisions that people have to take in work and that it
incentivises people to find and take

to taxpayers and to the markets, that this Government are committed to
securing fiscal credibility in the years ahead, and it is “the
years ahead” that I am particularly concerned with. Investing in
credibility and stability is an investment for the long term, and it
is, of course, a means to an end. Yes, we have to rebalance the public

my eyes, the real end is ensuring that the next generation can benefit

look far for reassurance that this Government’s approach is the
right one. In Spain and Greece, one in every two young people in the
labour force is unemployed. Italy and Portugal are not far behind. I do
not pretend that unemployment is not a problem in this country, but the
decisions that we have taken to restore the public finances and the
credibility and stability we have secured with the financial markets
have been key to securing the stability of our own labour market. Over

Employment in the private sector is up by more than 1 million since the
election, while the last quarter saw further improvement in youth
unemployment, a fall in long-term unemployment and a fall in
unemployment overall. For me, this underlines the 
<?notus-xml column=460?>critical importance of the Government’s fiscal plans. We are
trying to repair a damaged economy so that we can secure something that
makes a real difference to people’s lives—a sound economy

a sound economy has to go hand in hand with a strong social settlement.
We can get the economy going again, but we will have failed if we still
have a welfare system which does not make work worth while. So at the
same time as we are restoring the public finances, I would ask your
Lordships to remember that we are working to restore the welfare system
as well. This year will see the introduction of universal credit, an
historic change that will create a welfare system that is simpler, more
effective, and designed to ensure that work pays. We expect some 3.1
million households to gain from the move to universal credit, on
average by £168 per month. This is a progressive reform. Around
75% of the households that gain are in the bottom 40% of the income
distribution. Overall, we believe that universal credit could lead to
the equivalent of up to 300,000 additional people in work through
improved financial incentives

and to maintaining our credibility with the financial markets while
protecting those on fixed incomes or with additional needs. But at its
heart it is a Bill for the long term, one that plays a crucial role in
repairing the public finances, and so one that is an investment in a
sound and stable economy in the future, and a future that is better for
everyone. It is on that basis that I commend this Bill to your

the Government still will not change course. Nothing in this Bill will
help growth and jobs. Nothing in this Bill will help build a stronger
economy. Everything in this Bill will contribute to depressing demand
and putting more pressure on hard-pressed public services. There is no
recognition that low-income families have high marginal consumption
rates, so restricting their income will impact very directly on demand
in our economy. Therefore, the poorest are being asked again to bear
more of the burden. The IFS says that this will include 7 million
working households, who it calculates will lose on average £165

put it in its briefing, this Bill is another blow to working families.
Compared with a CPI uprating, the Bill will cost a working family on a
modest income nearly £800 a year. We know from the Minister

extra 200,000 children being pushed into poverty on top of
the 800,000 the IFS already estimates have entered that state due to

1% increase—a maximum of 1%—for the prospect of a fair

is placing inflation risks with the most vulnerable members of society.
Inflation just three years out is difficult to predict, and should it,
contrary to current expectations, dip below 1%, the Government can
pocket the benefit. Are the Government really
saying that whatever the level of inflation, say in year three, they
will allow any level of cut to be visited on the nation’s
strivers? The justification for the 1% is that benefits have been
rising at a faster rate than earnings over the past few years—we
heard that from the Minister—but this means that the families
receiving in-work benefit are getting a double blow from the Bill. If
you look at the longer trend—the DWP gave us the figures just

the reality is that this Bill is not about shoring up the markets. It

be restricted. We will seek, in Committee, to reverse the real-terms

German:</Member></B> My Lords, it will not surprise the
House that I start from a different
place from  the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie. I will refer
later to the use of the word “language”. I
hope that your Lordships’  
<?notus-xml column=464?>House will join us in saying that we should not use language that tries
to segregate different groups of people. I shall illustrate that later.
My starting point in examining this Bill is to ask whether it meets the
policy objectives that it sets for itself and whether it is a
proportionate response to the problem that it attempts to solve. As the
principal policy objective that it seeks to fulfil is to make an impact
on the underlying structural deficit that this country faces, it is an
impossible analysis if we do not start with an examination of that
factor.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000105" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000105">In
2010, the Government set themselves the objective of eliminating the
inherited structural budget deficit by the end of this
Parliament—that is, by 2015. However, external circumstances,
such as the problems within the eurozone, intervened which made that a
much more difficult task to accomplish. So the Government took the
decision to slow down the elimination of the structural deficit from
five years to seven years, to 2017-18. Of course, they could have
chosen to meet their original target date by imposing even more
challenges to government expenditure—by increasing the tax take
and by digging deep into the health and education budgets, and
presumably further into the welfare budget as well. They chose not to
do so. The consequence of that is a need to take further steps in
budget reduction and this measure does that. It is aimed at 2015-16,
the last of the financial years that will be determined before the next
general
election.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000106">My
first point is that sticking to the original timescale for deficit
reduction would have meant a much more challenging debate than the one
we are having today. Clearly, many noble Lords are concerned about the
welfare budget reductions contained in the Bill. I can understand that
concern. It is never easy reducing welfare payments; it is very
uncomfortable and something which gives me concern as well. However, it
would have been a lot worse if the Government had not slowed down the
deficit reduction
programme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000107">There
are, and will continue to be, very difficult decisions to be made, and
this Bill is one of them. However, those who object to the budget
reductions in the Bill must say whether they are in favour of either a
further extension of the already extended deficit reduction
programme—slowing it down even further, going beyond the planned
seven years and increasing the level of borrowing
substantially—or taking money from some other source. It would
be helpful to know where noble Lords stand on this matter. I listened
very carefully, but I was unable to detect where that money might come
from. The Bill cannot stand alone in some sort of splendid financial
isolation. When there are hard choices to be made, it is important to
know whether others are prepared to face up to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T15:34:42"></hs_TimeCode>. There are

find work again within three to six months. Also, the Government have
capped public sector increases at 1%, so there is also an element of
fairness to the measure. Besides, the shadow Secretary of State for

child poverty—according to the international measure—fell
substantially in the United Kingdom. That is because the median is used

we want to see what is happening in respect of children in poverty in

Crisis, an organisation that is well respected across the House. It
gave me an example of a young man called Russell, who had been urgently
looking for a shared property in London since September, but did not
have the deposit that nearly all landlords require. His rent for a
small studio flat was, until September, paid by housing benefit.
However, when the changes to the shared accommodation rate kicked in,
his housing benefit was slashed from the £180 a week he required
to £86 a week. As a result, he had to drop out of his computer
course to look for somewhere to live and has accumulated nearly
£3,000 in arrears and been served an eviction notice.
Homelessness was a real threat for Russell. I am really pleased to

Bill has been described as a real-terms cut with the IFS estimating
that, given the current forecasts for inflation, it could amount to a

about fairness, which is a big part of their motivation for reform. The
debate about skivers versus strivers has been played out a lot
recently, and whether it is helpful or it contributes towards
polarising opinion and increasing stigma is perhaps a matter for
another discussion. Still, the employed and the unemployed cannot be
compared with one another so simply. For a start, many working people
are in receipt of benefits. We know from recent data that households
with at least one employed adult have accounted for 93% of the increase
in the number of housing benefit claims in the past two years and that
there are around 3.6 million working households already living on an
economic “cliff edge” who could be squeezed further by
this Bill. The Children’s Society has calculated that the Bill
will mean that by 2015, a 
<?notus-xml column=468?>lone parent with two children on a weekly income  of £530

attitudes to welfare spending are often impacted. I think that the
prejudices which have been mentioned by contributors to this debate are
based on the fact that the public do not often understand what the
actual impact of this Bill will be on individuals. An argument used in
favour of reform is that the welfare bill accounts for a quarter of
total government spending. Last year’s data show that the DWP
does indeed account for 23% of all public spending, or
£166.98 billion. However, of the £159 billion
of that sum which went on benefits, 47%, or around £74 billion,
went on state pensions compared with JSA and incapacity benefit, which
saw spending of approximately £4.9 billion each. Despite this, a
YouGov poll recently commissioned by the TUC has found that on average,
people think that 41% of the entire welfare budget goes on benefits to
unemployed people. The same poll also suggests that support for this
Bill actually depends on the level of understanding of it, as I have
already mentioned. The Government have a duty to educate the public on
the realities of welfare benefits and the impact on the poorest in
society as opposed to being tempted to take advantage of ignorance of
this matter.</hs_para>

Government want to improve fairness and incentivise work, but welfare
reform cannot be tackled in isolation from other factors such as the
labour market and current inequalities. Despite it being a commonly
held view, it is difficult confidently to identify evidence of
widespread welfare dependency and intergenerational worklessness. The
Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the University of Bristol recently found
that only a very small minority of households, some 15,350, have had
two or more generations who have “never worked” and of

that change behaviour are a risk when the roots of the problem go
beyond behaviour. Just one worrying trend is the 109% rise in the
number of people being helped by food banks, as reported recently by
the Trussell Trust. While some people think that food banks are a good
idea, research in Canada seems to indicate that the level of nutrition
provided by such food is very low compared with the ability to choose
your own produce. I am worried that the impact of welfare changes,
spending cuts to services and rising living costs could contribute to a
further increase in the use of food banks. It would be interesting to

seems to me that, from time to time, it falls to these Benches to raise
questions about the moral responsibility of this House and perhaps
today is one such occasion. I want to ask what is the fundamental
purpose of the Bill before us. The Minister has asserted that it is to
achieve a stronger economy for the future. If that is the case,
presumably it is designed to achieve short-term savings in response to
a present budget deficit. However, because of its long-term effects, it
looks like part of an ideologically motivated attempt to alter the very
nature of the welfare state. If that is the case, we must ask ourselves
what is the limit of our collective responsibility for the poorest in
our society. I believe that there is confusion in this Bill about that
limit in at least three key
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T15:51:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000130">First,
there is impact of the Bill on working families. One of the main
arguments used to justify the Bill is that it is unfair that
out-of-work families should see their benefits rise at a faster rate
than hard-working families who are facing a squeeze in their wages.
Others have made this point already. However, this claim is both
inaccurate and unhelpful. It is inaccurate because the fact is that
working families, and low earners in particular, are among those worst
affected by this Bill, as we know. Working tax credit, one of the
benefits included within the cap, is only available to working
households. Other benefits that are also included, such as child
benefit and child tax credit, are available to both working and
non-working families. The House of Commons Library has estimated that
if only out-of-work benefits were subjected to the 1% cap, 80% of the
proposed savings would disappear. According to the Resolution
Foundation, 60% of the impact of the Bill will fall on working
households. In 2015-16, the 1% uprating policy will take a total of
£2.8 billion out of the pockets of the very people who the
Government should be seeking to support. More than at any other time,
these families are relying on tax credits and  other benefits
to help compensate for the squeeze in their earnings and the rising
prices of
essentials.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000131" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000131">As
other noble Lords have mentioned, it is also unhelpful to set up a
false distinction between in-work “strivers” and
out-of-work “shirkers”. All of us who are actually in
touch with the effects of this Bill in local communities know that many
are losing their jobs through no fault of their own. Contrary to
ministerial rhetoric, the vast majority of unemployed people want to
work: 70% of unemployed people find work again within a year and only a
tiny minority of workless households contain two generations who have
never worked. As if it is not enough to lose your job, some of these
people are now being vilified and
impoverished<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T15:53:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000132">Secondly,
the Bill will have an adverse impact on the population at large. In
total, it is estimated that  6.4 million families with children
will be affected. That is 87% of all families with children and 95% of
lone-parent families with children. While nearly all families will be
affected by this policy, it is the poorest families who 
<?notus-xml column=470?>will bear the disproportionate share of the burden. The
Government’s own impact analysis reveals that two-thirds of the
cost of this measure is from the bottom third of the income
distribution; only 3% is from the top third. Surely this is completely
inconsistent with the Prime Minister’s statement
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="1302113000277" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000277">“those

comes on top of all the other welfare cuts that are disproportionately
affecting low-income families, such as cuts in disability benefits and
in the local housing allowance. I see at first hand the effects of
these in my own city of Leicester, where the bedroom tax will affect
13% of tenanted households; the benefit cap will affect 585 households;
and cuts in council tax support will affect 16,000 households, which
will have to pay some element of council tax for the first
time.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1302113000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000134">The
Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that the combined effect of all
the tax and benefit changes introduced between 2010 and April 2015 is
to reduce the incomes of the poorest fifth of families with children by
about 7%. As others have said, the inevitable impact of this policy
will be a further increase in child poverty. The Government’s
own estimates are that this Bill will push 200,000 more children into
poverty. Even before this measure was announced, the Institute for
Fiscal Studies was already estimating that relative child poverty was
set to increase by about 400,000 between 2010 and 2015. In
Leicester, 32% of children are already in poverty, well above the 21%
national average. This policy will substantially increase that number.

on these 200,000
children?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000135" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000135">Finally,
I fear for the long-term implications of this policy. This Bill breaks
the historic link between benefits and price inflation, which will have
implications not just over the next three years but in 10 and 20
years’ time. We have not had enough public and political debate
about this. The cumulative impact of this policy is a substantial
erosion in the real value of benefits for the poorest working-age
households, which is already considerably below what most people agree
is necessary to achieve an adequate standard of living. Families that
are already in a financially precarious position due to debt problems,
lack of family support and so on will be particularly vulnerable,
pushing many into unmanageable debt and triggering mental health
problems, homelessness and family breakdown.</hs_para>

appear to have been adequately considered by the Government. Every
unexpected increase in food prices or fuel costs will hit the pockets
of those least able to bear the cost. What flexibility will there be to

Higher-rate taxpayers will pay more tax to the Government in every
single year of this Parliament than they paid in any single year of the
previous Parliament. The increase of the higher rate of tax to 50p in
the pound came into effect on 6 April 2010. If ever there was deathbed
conversion on the part of the previous Government, that was it. In 13
years, they did not put up the higher rate of tax; it came into effect
two days before the Dissolution of the previous Parliament. We are
moving forward and saying that you will pay more through capital gains
tax, more through the reduction in the pension tax relief threshold,
more through the freezing of inheritance tax, which will come later,

of welfare.</hs_para>

friends on the Front Bench a little further. Given the opportunity, I
will return to it in Committee. With the introduction of universal
credit, we will have a system where, no matter what the salary of the
job, you will always be better off in work by a straight line table of
65p in the £1. It is very important that people should always be
better off in work. That is one of the principles at the heart of this
reform. However, in the debate on 17 January led by the noble Baroness,
Lady Hollis, which I guess was a bit of a forerunner of this debate,
one of the issues that I raised was the living wage. I should like to
explore it further.</hs_para>

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, normally one can say
something halfway decent about some aspect of any social security Bill.
I think that for the first time in 20 years in your Lordships’
House, I can find nothing good to say about this Bill at
all—nothing. It is simply a lock-in cuts Bill which, to save
£3 billion, will send 1 million poor children into deeper
poverty by 2020 so that the better off among us, including myself, are
spared a tax rise while millionaire earners have a hefty tax cut that
is, curiously, also worth  £3 billion.</hs_para>

Bill? It is simple, really. First, as my noble friend Lord McKenzie
said, it is entirely unnecessary. We have always had annual up-ratings
to respond to inflation; we now have a 1% rise for the forthcoming year
and a Bill, costing many hours of parliamentary time, continuing it for
a further two years. Why? The only defence offered by the rather
fragile impact analysis is “certainty” for the financial
markets, the public, and recipients themselves. Certainty, my Lords?
Even if the Government cruelly ignore inflation, which the OBR believes
will hit nearly 4% by 2015-16, benefit spend will still depend on the
future number of claimants as well as on the level of their benefit.
Exactly how can the Government give certainty to the markets and, that
nice touch, certainty for the recipients, who will no doubt be grateful
to learn that their benefit cuts are guaranteed for the next three
years? No, the Bill is to lock in these benefit cuts for the
poorest—to take it off the agenda, so to speak—in
preparation, I do not doubt, for further cuts still to
follow.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1302113000153" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000153">After
all, if our solicitous concern for the markets and the public was
driving this Bill, we would offer the same certainty to taxpayers for
the next three years. There would be frozen tax
allowances, so no more  
<?notus-xml column=474?>Lib Dem raising of the thresholds with the very real uncertainty that
causes for NEST, auto-enrolment and, no doubt, the markets. There would
be frozen tax rates, so no pre-election handouts. No, the Chancellor
wants to lock the poor into their cuts, while being free in an election
year to adjust the taxes that fall on the rest of us.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1302113000154" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000154">Secondly, the spin
surrounding this Bill is deliberately and unpleasantly misleading,
suggesting that these cuts fall on the undeserving poor, so that is all
right then—the ones with closed curtains. It is not all right
but, in any case, it is completely untrue. We had the distinctly ugly
spectacle of the Iain Duncan Smith press releases while this Bill
progressed through the other place, implying that these cuts were
morally as well as financially desirable because they would help to
wean the poor off benefit dependency, which the noble Lord, Lord Bates,
cited today, as though the recipients were addicts waiting for their
next benefit fix rather than loving and responsible parents trying
desperately to feed their children. That was while IDS knew, as we all
know, that two-thirds of these capped benefits are going to people in
work on low pay with children to support. IDS smeared every poor family
in this land, and I had thought better of
him.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000155" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000155">Why do we
need these top-up benefits, such as housing benefit and tax credits for
people in work? We all know why, don’t we? It was because while
a wage may be acceptable for a single man in a full-time job on minimum
wage, that wage will be hopelessly inadequate for a family man with two
or three children to support unless it is topped up by tax credits. So
unless employers raise wages substantially not to a living wage but to
double the current pay to make good—to something like £10
or £12 an hour, which is not going to happen—their
children will now become poorer still. That of course is why the
argument that because pay is being capped to 1% so benefits must be is
utterly fake, because Iain Duncan Smith—Mr Smith—knows
perfectly well that they are largely the same group of people, their
low but capped pay being topped up by low and, in future, artificially
capped and lowered benefits.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1302113000156" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000156">It is precisely because
earnings have fallen below inflation over the past few years during the
recession that the tax credit bill has risen to compensate for 
that shortfall. Firms have also cut hours rather than  sack
staff; 3.5 million people are now involuntarily underemployed. As one
family man in Norwich said to me not long ago, at least tax credits
help to make up the
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:15:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000157">So
instead of the Government explaining and accepting, as they should,
that the increase in tax credits is due to falling wages and that it
helps to protect families, we are instead told that as wages have
fallen, so must benefits, thus ensuring that the working poor face a
double lock on pay and tax credits—and of course the universal
credit, when it comes in, will no longer take the
strain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000158" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000158">Nevertheless,
the Government claim that we cannot afford not to cut benefits, an
argument that has been run today. Benefit expenditure overall has
grown, partly because tax credits help to offset low pay and lowered
hours of work but mainly because pensioners are protected from any
cuts, their pensions are rising and 
<?notus-xml column=475?>more of them are living longer. That is good news. However, the dirty
news is that the unemployed and the low-paid, and their children, are
now being blamed by IDS for what his colleague, Steve Webb, is rightly
doing for pensioners. How cynical can you
get<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:16:26"></hs_TimeCode>? Pensioners
get a triple lock into greater comfort, which I welcome, while the poor

us be clear, and I make this point again: this is about policy choices.
As my noble friend Lord McKenzie has said, the Government have
show<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:16:41"></hs_TimeCode>n that they
are on the side of millionaires, who are receiving a tax cut worth
£3 billion, rather than 1 million poor children who will see
their parents made poorer still by around £3 billion.</hs_para>

its impact analysis
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:17:00"></hs_TimeCode>cheat. They both
treat these cuts as though they were freestanding—one-off, so to
speak—and apparently not so very large. Around 30% of households
will see an average cut of £3 through this policy, according to
the impact analysis documents, when actually those cuts are a further
slice off income on top of the myriad other cuts since 2010 that are
already damaging poor families. We have heard nothing about those
today, even from those who sit on the coalition Benches. In that
regard, I say, “Shame on you”, because they are deleting
what is clearly absolutely central to this
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:17:48"></hs_TimeCode>. We have
been offered no assessment of the cumulative impact of these
cuts—£18 billion of cuts and no public analysis of how
they build up or of whom  they
hit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:18:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000161" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000161">We
had a debate on this a couple of weeks ago. I hope that noble Lords
will forgive me if I repeat the broadest of statistics; as the
Government will not, I will try. With the invaluable help of CAB and
Landesman economics, we tracked the cumulative effects of all the cuts
since 2010 on one family: a couple with two young children, he a
security guard in full-time work on minimum wage, living in a
£100 per week council house and, obviously, entitled to pay
council tax. He gained £1.71 per week from the raising of the
tax threshold and then went on to lose £30 to £35 per
week in benefit cuts. If one of his children is disabled, say, he will
lose over £40 per week. Under the universal credit, the cuts
increase to £50 per week if he is in work or £65 per week
if he is unemployed. It gives a new meaning to the slogan that the
universal credit will make work pay—yes, by reducing the benefit
floor underneath
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:19:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000162" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000162">Those
statistics were the result of a weekend’s work. With more time,
I would have tracked the cumulative effect not only on the security
guard’s family but on  a lone-parent family, on a
childless couple and on a single person, because they all share the
cuts. It is not rocket science; it is standard policy analysis on
standard family types, as they are called, and yet we are told that the
DWP and HMRC with, what, 60 professional analysts, powerful computer
modelling and a couple of months in hand to do the work are unable tell
us what the total effect of these cuts will be, which some of us were
able to work out in a weekend? I really cannot believe that they do not
know what the impact of their policy initiatives is and who bears the
bill. They still will not or cannot tell us. If they do not 
<?notus-xml column=476?>know, it is an utter dereliction of social duty, it really is—you
cannot develop policy and be indifferent to its effects—but if,
however, they do know and are not telling us, it is a deceit that I
cannot believe my former department would stoop
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000163">Finally,
what makes me angriest of all—the right reverend Prelate the
Bishop of Leicester powerfully focused on this—it that this Bill
is grotesquely unfair on whom it falls, on poor children above all.
Since when, as we talk about us all being in this together, do we
include poor children in the we, but exclude comfortably off pensioners
like me, who have experienced not a penny of cuts? What sort of we is
that? The noble Lord, Lord Bates, said nobody was telling him where to
find the money. I urge him and the noble Lord, Lord German, to accept
that we are today making policy choices, not following financial
imperatives. It really is about choices about who pays and, ultimately,
who gains. It really is. With £32 billion spent on pension tax
relief still untouched, although two-thirds goes on the better off, and
what is happening on tax reductions for millionaires, these are
political policy choices.</hs_para>

different and in the process saved the situation that poor children
will fall into, stumble into, as a result of what we are doing today.
These cuts will fall on those in rented housing who rightly fear losing
their home, rather than on those who have two, three or, as the papers
have recently told us, even eight homes. They fall on those who go to
food banks, not to foodie restaurants. They fall on separated loving
dads who have their children stay over at week-ends, rather than on
fathers who lose contact and refuse them. They fall on families with a
wheelchair user rather than a Ferrari driver. These cuts fall on the
vulnerable but voiceless, rather than on those of us with resilience
and resources, but who, of course, are more likely to vote. It is a
shameful little Bill. As Hobbes might have said, it is nasty, brutish

miserable little Bill is not only mean-spirited and out of touch; it,
or rather the spin surrounding it, is misleading, not to say dishonest.
Moreover, the whole enterprise is misconceived. It is out of touch in
the way it perpetuates the relentless attack on welfare, which is
depicted as an aberration in social policy, to put it no higher, that
needs to be reversed instead of as a mark of a civilised society
acknowledging its obligation with increasing prosperity to look after
its less fortunate members. Recipients of welfare are demonised as
battening on society, and crude cutting is mystified in the rhetoric of
helping people off benefits and into

Bill’s justifications are misleading in their use, not to say
their creation, of five myths. First is the myth that there is a
radical separation between those on welfare and those in work, but many
of the benefits that will be pegged by this Bill go equally to those on
welfare and those in work: tax credits, for example. The second is that
benefits have risen twice as fast as 
<?notus-xml column=477?>pay. They may have if you pick your dates correctly, but everyone knows
that historically wages have risen considerably faster than benefits,
which are pegged to the rate of
inflation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:25:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

percentage, as opposed to cash, increases are a fair reflection of
these things. I think that a caller to “Any Answers?” on
the radio got this right when he pointed out that a 1% increase on the
national average wage of £500 a week amounts to £5: a
worthwhile sum. However, a 1% on jobseeker’s allowance of
£71 amounts to only 71p. That is as much of an insult as Gordon
Brown’s 75p increase in the old age

myth that any shortfall in benefits is made up for by the increase in
personal tax allowance. This applies only to those in work, of course.
Anyway, as Citizens Advice has shown, capping the uprating of benefits
will swamp any gain from the increase in the personal tax allowance,
certainly for low-income households.</hs_para>

fifth myth is that the most vulnerable are protected, but you do not
protect the poor by cutting welfare since it is the poor who rely on
welfare. You only have to look at the treatment of disabled people,
whom the Government maintain they are protecting under the Bill, to see
the essential dishonesty of the Government’s propaganda. Here, I
declare my interest as having a connection with a number of disabled
people’s organisations, which are mentioned in the

people are certainly vulnerable. They have experienced a drop in income
of £500 million since the emergency Budget of 2010. The
Government have already reduced the measure by which benefits are
uprated from the higher RPI to the lower consumer prices index. Some
benefits for disabled people and carers, such as disability living
allowance, the support group component of employment and support
allowance and disability-related tax credits are exempted from the
reduced uprating. This acknowledgment that disabled people need
additional protection is welcome. However, notwithstanding the
Government’s claims, the Bill will still mean a real-terms cut
in vital support for many disabled people. DLA will continue to rise by
inflation, but this is not the case with employment and support

capability assessment, people who are unable to work can be placed in
either the support group or the work-related activity group. Many
disabled people are being placed in the work-related activity group.
For them, the Bill will cap the uprating of this benefit to 1%. This
will mean in effect that households in the work-related activity group
receiving ESA will be £87.65 a year worse off. Furthermore,
disabled people who are placed in the support group, meaning that their
impairment or condition is such that they are not expected to look for
work, have been given only limited protection from the reduced rate of
uprating. The ESA that disabled people in the support group receive is
made up of a core payment with an additional support group component.
Only this additional component will continue to rise by inflation, with
the  
<?notus-xml column=478?>core element rising by only 1%. This means that, overall, disabled
people in the support group will see their ESA payments rise by just
1.4% rather than inflation. This will mean that a disabled person in

off.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1302113000173" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000173">The
real-terms loss of financial support that disabled people receiving ESA
will face compounds a situation where disabled people are
disproportionately more likely to live in poverty than non-disabled
people. The problems of living on a low income are then compounded by
the extra disability-related costs. When these are included in the
measurement of poverty, the proportion of households with a disabled
member living in poverty doubles to almost
50<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:30:10"></hs_TimeCode>%. The
Government’s impact assessment recognises that the Bill will
impact on disabled people. It states that households where someone
describes themselves as disabled are more likely to be affected than

UK are already disproportionately likely to live in poverty.
Approximately 40% of all disabled children—about

across all children. Nearly one-third live in severe poverty, where a
family’s income is less than 40% of the national average. Under
universal credit, which will begin to come into effect later this year,
parents of disabled children can receive a benefit called the disabled

the House knows, the EU budget is negotiated annually, so what we were
negotiating, initially at the Council last November and again last
week, was not the individual annual budgets but rather the overall

the previous negotiation, which covered the period 2007-13, the
previous Government agreed to an increase in the payments ceiling of 8%
to €943 billion. Put simply, this gave the EU a
credit card with a higher limit, and we are still living with the
results of allowing the EU’s big spenders to push for more and
more spending each year. In fact, only last year, while member states
had to make tough decisions to tighten their belts at home, the big
spenders succeeded in increasing the 2012 European budget by another 5%
compared with the previous year. If no deal had been reached, the
existing ceilings would have been rolled over and annual budgets could
have continued to soar for the next seven years. Because annual budgets
are negotiated by qualified majority voting, it can be difficult to
constrain spending in these annual negotiations. By contrast, the
seven-year limits are agreed by unanimity. So this was our chance to
get the ceilings down in line with what could be
afforded.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000187" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000187">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:38:37"></hs_TimeCode>

strongly supported by a number of member states. The first negotiation
took place at the Council in November and, although the President did
then reduce this during the Council itself, it was still some way short
of the real-terms cut we were looking for. Together with like-minded
allies from a number of countries, including Germany, Sweden, the

this Council, we made further progress. Together with like-minded
allies—many of whom, like Britain, actually write the
cheques—we achieved a proper look across all the areas where
spending in the Commission proposal could be cut. While there are areas
where we could and should go further, not least on reforming the common
agricultural policy and reducing the bureaucratic costs of the European
Commission, we agreed a real-terms cut in the payment limit to
€908
billion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:39:45"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
€80 billion lower than the original proposal. It is €35

simply to cut the credit card limit. I wanted to set the limit at a
level that would deliver at worst a freeze and at best a cut in the
actual spending over the next seven years, and this is indeed what this
deal delivers: a real-terms cut. If you take the latest complete
budget—the one for 2012—and freeze spending at that level
for the next seven years, you would have spending of €932
billion. Our new payments limit means spending cannot rise above
€908 billion, so we have slashed €24 billion off a real
freeze on the last completed budget. Of course, the budget set in 2012,
which Britain voted against, was unacceptably large, but even against
the average of the past two completed years—2011 and
2012—this deal still delivers a real-terms

now be voted on by the European Parliament. The European Council has
said that it is prepared to accept some flexibilities about how
spending is divided between different budget years and different areas
of spending, but we are absolutely clear that this must be within the
framework that the member states have now agreed. The EU’s
seven-year budget will now cost less than 1% of Europe’s gross

me say a word about how this deal is likely to affect the UK’s
contribution; a word about how it is likely to affect what the UK
receives from the EU for research, for our regions, and for our
farmers; and a word about what this means for growth and
competitiveness across the European Union as a whole. On the
UK’s contribution, the House will remember how the previous
Government gave away almost half of our rebate. This has had a
long-term and continuing effect on the UK’s net contributions.
It is worth remembering why. When the European Union spends money on,
for example, structural funds and cohesion payments in eastern European
countries, the UK no longer gets a rebate on this money. As a result,
almost whatever budget deal was done, our net contributions were always
likely to go up, but as a result of this deal, they will be going up by
less<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:42:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000192" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000192">The
only two sensible things we could do to protect the British taxpayer in
these negotiations were to get the overall budget down and to protect
what is left of our rebate, and that is exactly what we have done.
While the actual amount that the UK contributes will depend on
technical factors such as the size of the annual budgets, economic
performance and exchange rates, as a result of this deal we now expect
the UK’s contribution to the EU to fall as a share of our gross
national income. As for the rebate this Government inherited, it is
completely untouched. As ever, throughout these negotiations, the
rebate was attacked repeatedly, but I successfully rejected all the
calls for change. Under this Government, the British rebate is
safe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T16:45:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000193" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000193">In
terms of what the UK receives, I wanted to make sure that our
universities are well placed to receive research work, our less
well-off regions are treated fairly compared with others and our
farmers continue to receive support for the environment schemes they
put in place. On these points, the section of the budget that includes
spending on research, innovation and university funding is up by a
third, and this money is handed out on the basis of quality, so
Britain’s universities are particularly well placed to benefit.
We have ensured that structural funds will continue to flow to our less
well-off regions. Britain’s share will remain broadly the same,
at around €11 billion. And while we have cut spending on the
common agricultural policy overall, we have protected the flexibility
which will allow us to direct funds to support both the environment and
the livelihoods of our farming

this is a better framed budget in terms of growth, jobs and
competitiveness. It is disappointing that administrative costs are
still around 6% of the total, but overall spending on the common
agricultural policy will fall by 13% compared with the previous
seven-year budget. Research and development and other pro-growth
investment will now account for 
<?notus-xml column=482?>13% rather than 9% of the total budget. Reform of EU spending is a
long-term project, but this deal does deliver important progress.
Working with allies, we took real steps towards reform in the European
Union. It is a good deal for Britain, a good deal for Europe and, above
all, a good deal for all our taxpayers. That is what we have delivered,
and I commend this Statement to the

time when so many budgets are being cut at home, last October the other
place voted for a real-terms cut in the EU budget, and it was right to
do so. That is what my party argued for in the debate. In the resulting
vote, the Prime Minister was given a strong negotiating mandate for a
real-terms cut in the budget. We are therefore glad to see the
agreement reached at the European Council. However, as well as
restraint in the budget, we needed reform—prioritising growth
within a smaller budget by cutting back even further on wasteful
spending.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000198" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000198">First,

2020. The Leader was right to say that there is further to go in this

made the point that this negotiation demonstrated, as I believe it
did,  that the EU is capable of change. It was not that long
ago that some in the party opposite were saying that my right
honourable friend the Prime Minister was isolated in Europe. The deal
that he managed to strike demonstrated that, by working closely with
our  allies, particularly with the Nordics, he has been able to
secure a good deal and a deal which, overall, will lead to savings, so
we are far from being isolated. That is absolutely right in the current

credit card limit and ceiling, which we have achieved. Some steps were
taken and the CAP budget

Mali, at the European Council the contribution made by the French was
praised and the United Kingdom gave them strong support. We will

the Statement in your Lordships’ House. Perhaps I may say how
much we welcome the Statement, and in particular the fact that research
and university budgets have not been affected. At a time of economic
recession, when national and household budgets are shrinking, it is
right that the European budget should reflect the gravity of the
situation. However, two elements have been preserved: growth and jobs.

growth and jobs resulting from the reduced European Union

specific calculation of what the contribution of a
smaller budget is likely to be to jobs and growth, because so many
variables are in play: what happens in the eurozone, what happens to
trade, how far we get with these talks and so on. What I am able to say
is that the increased line on research and development should be of
particular benefit to British universities, given that the money is

that they go to the least well-off regions in the European Union. With
the accession of new countries to the east, it is important that they
should have those funds. On the noble Lord’s specific question,
we currently expect that the overall receipts will be broadly

in my place for the first two minutes of my noble friend’s

negotiation, on which my right honourable friend the Prime Minister
should certainly be congratulated, the fact that it demonstrates that
when we go for constructive reform in the European Union, we are not
without friends—and indeed, that we are gathering an increasing
number of allies? Will my noble friend point out to those who keep
talking about Britain being isolated and marginalised that the opposite

I might add a second question. I read in the papers this morning that
up to 20% of the entire EU budget will now be spent on climate-related

question, I will need to see whether I can provide better particulars
on how the figures break down, and what the basis is for the
speculation that my noble friend saw—whether it is to do with
the energy elements of environment funds through the CAP, for example.
I am not sure about that, so I will see what I can do. On his general
point, I could not agree more. This outcome 
<?notus-xml column=486?>shows that Britain was far from marginalised and isolated in the
negotiations. It also shows that the pessimistic
view held by some that Britain is doomed to fail and therefore should
not go into negotiations with a strong position trying to win others
round to our point of view, is entirely wrong.</hs_para>

remember that many years ago when I was working for the then Prime
Minister, John Major, there were similar views to the effect that
Britain would never be able to win an opt-out of the single currency or
an opt-out of the Social Chapter, but in fact those were both
successfully achieved. Similarly on this occasion, there were people
looking forward with eager anticipation in the expectation that my
right honourable friend the Prime Minister would not be able to secure
Britain’s interests. In fact, he has; I agree with my noble
friend that by being clear in one’s objectives and by assembling
alliances—in this case, with the Germans, the Swedes, the Dutch
and the Danish—it is perfectly possible for Britain to secure
its objectives, and it will continue to be

Pearson of Rannoch:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope it will not ruin the
Prime Minister’s day if I offer congratulations on a small step
in the right direction. However, I think he is going a bit far when he
describes the present situation as “a good deal for
taxpayers”. Could the noble Lord tell us what this
country’s gross and  net contributions now become? In
2012, our gross contribution was some £22 billion, of which we
got back around £11 billion, so our net contribution was
£11 billion a year. That represents the salaries of
1,000 nurses at £30,000 a year every day, which we
never see again. Therefore, I still have to query whether this whole
arrangement is anything but a disastrous deal for British
taxpayers.</hs_para>

the cost to the British taxpayer, clearly, so far as the negotiation
was concerned, the fact that the Prime Minister managed to end up with
a credit card limit that was so many billions of euros lower than had
been initially proposed is a cause of some modest satisfaction to the
British taxpayer. That cost would have been lower if a chunk of our
rebate had not unfortunately been surrendered in those negotiations in
2005 in the hope, as I understand it, that there would then be a deal
on the CAP: a deal that has not been forthcoming. That explains why,
although the overall figures are considerably lower—and they do

repeat a Statement made earlier today in another place by my right
honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health, on the funding of
care and support in England. The Statement is as
follows:</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000246" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000246">“With
permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on the funding
of care and support in England. As we get older, none of us can have
any way of knowing what care needs we will eventually face. Some will
be blessed with a long and healthy life, but many others will be less
fortunate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000247" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000247">Today
many older people and people with disabilities face paying the
limitless—often ruinous—costs of their care, with little
or no assistance from the state. While those with assets of less than
£23,250 do receive support, those with assets above this level
receive none. This is desperately unfair, particularly for those who
have worked hard all their lives to pay off their mortgage, to save for
their future or to have something to pass on to their loved ones, only
to see their property sold and their savings wiped out—something
that happens to more than 30,000 people every year or 100 people every
day. The system we have also sends out the wrong message: that you are
better off not saving for your future because any savings will only
disappear in a puff of
smoke.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000248" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000248">Today I
can announce this Government’s radical plans to transform the
funding of care and support in England, bringing a new degree of
certainty, fairness and peace of mind to the costs of old age,
disability and living with long-term conditions, while ensuring that
the greatest level of financial support goes to those with the greatest
need. We propose to introduce a cap on an individual’s financial
contributions towards the cost of care, and a significant increase in
the level of assets a person may hold and still receive some degree of
support from the
state.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000249" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000249">In 2010
this Government asked the economist Andrew Dilnot to look at the whole
issue of funding for care and support. The independent Dilnot
commission published its recommendations in July 2011. In response to
those recommendations, and following extensive engagement with the care
and support sector, we published the Care and Support White Paper and
the progress report on funding reform in July 2012.</hs_para>

we accepted some of Andrew Dilnot’s main recommendations,
including those around a consistent, nationally set eligibility
threshold for care and support, and universal deferred
payments—whereby no one will have to sell their home in their
lifetime to pay for care costs. I would like to take this opportunity
to thank Mr Dilnot and his team for their excellent
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000251" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000251">A core
principle set out by the Dilnot commission was that people should
contribute to the costs of their own care but that those costs should
be limited and people should be protected against the potentially
catastrophic costs of care. This should come through a cap on those
costs, and an extended means test. One 
<?notus-xml column=491?>person in 10 will be faced with care costs in excess of £100,000,
with a small number facing costs significantly higher still.</hs_para>

of mind, from April 2017 we will introduce a cap on the amount that
someone over state pension age will be liable to pay. The Dilnot
commission’s original suggestion was for a cap of between
£25,000 and £50,000 in 2010-11 prices, which is the
equivalent of between £30,700 and £61,500 in April 2017
prices. Despite the extremely challenging economic situation we find
ourselves in, we have come as close to this range as
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000253" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000253">The
cap will be set at £61,000 in 2010-11 prices, or £75,000
once it is introduced in April 2017. The intention is not that people
should have to pay up to £75,000 for their care costs. But by
creating certainty that this is the maximum they will have to pay, they
can then make provision through insurance or pension products so that
they are covered up to the value of the cap, thereby reducing the risk
of selling their home or losing an inheritance they have worked hard to
pass on to their
family.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000254" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000254">Young
people who already have care needs when they turn 18 will now receive
free adult care and support when they reach 18. People who develop a

cap that is below the £75,000
threshold.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000255" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000255">The
other measure that we propose is significantly to increase the amount
of assets that a person can hold and still receive financial support
for their residential care- home costs. Currently, this is set at
£23,250. If a person has assets valued above this level,
including, in some circumstances, the value of their home, they receive
no support. The Dilnot commission recommended that this threshold be
raised dramatically to £100,000 in 2010-11 prices. We accept
this
recommendation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000256" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000256">From
April 2017, the threshold will be increased so that those with assets
worth £123,000 or less, equivalent to Dilnot’s
recommended level, will all receive some degree of financial support
for their care costs. People with the fewest assets will receive the
most support. This will, for the first time, provide financial
protection for those with modest wealth, while ensuring that the
poorest continue to have all or the majority of their costs
paid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000257" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000257">Everyone
will benefit from the peace of mind that a cap brings. The introduction
of a cap and the extended means-tested support will help many people in
the most challenging circumstances—we expect up to 16% of older
people who need care to face costs of £75,000 or more. But, of
course, none of us knows whether we will be one of that 16%. Everyone
will benefit from the peace of mind that these changes bring and, by
2025, up to 100,000 more older people will receive financial support
for their care costs as a
result.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000258" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000258">My
right honourable friend the Chancellor and the Treasury have rightly
insisted that we identify how we pay for the additional costs of these
proposals. In this day and age, making promises that you cannot pay for
makes those promises meaningless. We have therefore identified exactly
how to pay for them. These reforms will cost the Exchequer £1
billion a year by the end of the next Parliament. With the agreement of
the Chancellor, they will be met in part by freezing the inheritance
tax

The Chancellor and the Chief Secretary to the

two new proposals join with others previously announced when we
published the draft care and support White Paper last summer. They
include, from 2015, the ability of people to defer the payment of
residential care costs so that no one needs sell their own home to pay
for them during their lifetime. Also from 2015, a national minimum
eligibility threshold will be introduced to end the lottery of local
access that can see support provided to someone in one area but not in
another. Taken together, today’s proposals and those already set
out in the draft care and support Bill represent a new era of support
for the elderly and disabled in
England.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1302113000260" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0001.htm#1302113000260">Thanks
to the certainty that these proposals will introduce, people should no
longer feel that they have to hoard every penny in case the very worst
happens or feel that they are powerless and that there is no point in
saving at all. Rather, they will be able to plan and prepare sensibly
for their future. This will be supported by a wider range of financial
products becoming available in the market designed to help people to
plan and prepare for their later years and to reassure them about how
much they will pay. We will work with the care and support
sector—with local authorities, charities, care providers and
individuals, and with the financial services industry—to develop
these plans and to introduce them

for their social care costs as much as they prepare and plan for their

is accepted on all sides of the House that our current social care
system is living through the worst of all possible worlds: a cruel
lottery in which people who go into later life with everything for
which they have worked so hard on a roulette table and the most
vulnerable are always the biggest losers. So it needs to change.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T17:28:06"></hs_TimeCode> Secretary of
State has today published a modest plan that will make the system
fairer than it is today, and he is to be congratulated on that. We
welcome elements of what he has announced. A cap of £75,000 is
certainly better than no cap at all. Raising the means-test threshold
will help more people on lower incomes to get some help with their
charges. It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T17:28:06"></hs_TimeCode> is a
step forward, but it is a faltering one, and only one of a series of

week, the Francis inquiry exposed some very serious issues within the
National Health Service which impact on the quality of care for a
growing number of older people in our hospitals, often with several
different illnesses. The NHS is overwhelmed with the demands being made
on it, the tightening of its finances and the rightful emphasis on
safety and quality. The changes being made by the Health and Social
Care Act focus on the commissioning responsibility of general
practitioners but, overwhelmingly, the real need for GPs is to focus on
improvements in primary care, including accessibility and support for
older people in their homes. Just when local authorities are needed to
do so much more to help prevent admissions to hospital and to have much
faster and more sensitive support for people discharged from hospital,
they are having to cope with huge reductions in
expenditure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021123000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021123000010">It
is hard not to feel a sense of disappointment when listening to the
noble Earl— first, because a Statement on a subject of such
importance was briefed to the media before Parliament; because the
Government have abandoned any efforts to build a cross-party consensus
before rushing to announce their proposals; and because they have
chosen to rewrite the Dilnot report with figures of their own, breaking

are four problems with what has been announced today, which I will
address in turn. First, it fails the fairness test. We will have a
durable solution to the problem only if we can answer this question:
will it help every person and every couple to protect what they have
worked for, whatever their wealth and savings? This package falls way
short. According to Demos, the £35,000 cap, as recommended by
Dilnot, would benefit about 3.2 million pensioners. A per person cap of
£75,000 will benefit only 1.4 million. For the average couple,
the cap is £150,000. That might be enough to protect detached
houses, but it will not protect the average semi-detached home in large
parts of
England.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021123000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021123000012">The

confirm that people with modest to average homes and savings are not
protected under this plan? The Secretary of State claimed that
insurance companies will step in with new products so that more people
can protect their assets but, in oral evidence to the Health Committee,
the Association of British Insurers said that it did not believe that
the capped-cost model would result in a market for pre-funded care
assurance. I would be grateful if the noble Earl could say what
confidence he can give the House that a market will emerge. What
discussions have been held recently with the insurance
market?</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="13021123000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021123000013">The
second issue that I am concerned about is that this addresses only a
small part of the overall social care funding problem. With this
decision, the Government have prioritised the funding of a cap on care
costs with new money, over and above addressing the crisis in council
social care budgets. Will the noble Earl confirm that this was against
the advice of Andrew Dilnot to the cross-party talks? What it means in
practice is that vulnerable people will continue to face rising charges
as councils put up fees to cope with the growing shortfall in their
budgets. This is the effect of the Government’s care policy in
practice: they are asking people to make up the councils’
shortfall, making it more likely that they will have to pay right up to
the new £75,000 cap. To many people, that will not feel like
progress.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021123000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021123000014">More
than £1.3 billion has been cut from local authority budgets for
older people’s social care since the coalition came to power.
Care charges are rising well above inflation and councils are warning
that by 2024, they will be overwhelmed by the cost of care. Does the
noble Earl accept that forecast and, if he does, how will the plans
announced today help to address it? It is true that the Government have
raised the capital threshold to £123,000, and we welcome that,
but can the noble Earl give the House any confidence that the extra
support people will receive through a more generous means test will not
be more than offset by increasing care charges, caused by collapsing
council budgets? Many people may not know that the cap does not reflect
what people actually pay for care but a local authority average, and
does not include accommodation costs. As the noble Earl will know,
accommodation costs can be considerable. Do the Government have any
proposals at all to cap those costs, given the risk that they might
rise as care home owners take advantage of additional state
support?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13021123000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021123000015">The
third element relates to inheritance tax. In 2007, a flagship pledge
was made to increase the inheritance tax threshold to £1 million
by the party to which the noble Earl has the honour to
belong. Just eight weeks ago, the Chancellor said that he
would increase the threshold in two years’ time, so what has
happened in the past two months to make the Chancellor changed his
mind? The irony will not be lost that they are now increasing death
taxes to pay for their plan. The noble Earl has said that the rest will
be made up from national insurance. Does he think it is fair to ask the
working-age population to pay for something else, rather than older
people? Also, what safeguards will be available for people who have
paid 
<?notus-xml column=495?>for their own care costs up to the cap and then have responsibility
taken over by the local authority? What happens when the
fees paid by that person are more than the local authority is willing
to pay? Would that mean the person having to move from the home they
are in to another and, if so, is the noble Earl aware of the risks
involved in moving frail, elderly people from the environment that they
have become used to?</hs_para>

parliamentary process will be arranged for their scrutiny? I should
also like to ask the noble Earl whether, through the usual channels, we
might have an early opportunity to debate this announcement. The noble
Lord the Leader of the House was very kind last week, when the Francis
inquiry Statement was made. He said that he would see whether a debate
on the Francis report could be arranged and, to his great credit, my
understanding is that a Question for Short Debate tabled by the noble
Lord, Lord Patel, has been prioritised for debate. I think it will be

conclusion, up to a point we of course welcome what has been announced
today. It is a start but it will not lead to more integration of care.
Indeed, it may well entrench the separation between two systems: of

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hunt
of Kings Heath, for his positive welcome for at least some elements of
the Statement, which I know reflect the view of his own party on some
of the principles enunciated by Dilnot and which have not been a matter
of disagreement between us. I am very pleased that those principles are

saying that we needed a holistic approach to the funding and delivery
of social care. I could not agree with him more but it is important to
remember that the remit given to the Dilnot commission focused on one
particular aspect of social care funding. It never pretended to give it
an instruction to solve every problem that faces us over the next 10 to
20 years in funding social care, or indeed to tell us how we
raise the quality of social care or give life to the prevention agenda,
which I know is as close to the noble Lord’s heart as it is to
mine. He rightly said that the NHS has an important part to play in
that.</hs_para>

not duck that and I would of course welcome cross-party consensus on
that issue, if it can be reached. However, reading some of the

they have been on the whole very measured. While some regret that we
were not able to conform precisely to the parameters that Dilnot
recommended in terms of the cap, nevertheless we have got reasonably
close to them given the current economic circumstances that we
face.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021123000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021123000021">The
noble Lord asked me whether the announcement we have made passed a key
test, which is: will these arrangements help every person in the
country? My answer is: yes indeed they will, because everybody in the
country will now get the reassurance that, whatever their
circumstances, they will get the long-term care and support that they
need without facing financial ruin. People will benefit wherever they
receive care, be that in a care home or in their own home, and they
will be more in control—they will be more easily able to plan

in future.</hs_para>

that score, the noble Lord asked me about products that may be
developed by the financial services sector. We have engaged very fully
with the sector, and we are under no misapprehension that it has been
as keen as anyone to see this announcement. The certainty that it gives
firms in that sector will enable them to develop products that they can
market to those who would like to provide for their old age and their
care costs in an affordable way, and we are now giving them the freedom
and scope to do that.</hs_para>

noble Lord asked how the cap will actually work. It will cover eligible
social care costs that the local authority assesses that it would meet
at a price that the local authority would pay. Individuals would be
responsible for meeting their eligibility care costs up to the cap.
Where they cannot afford to do so, the local authority will provide
financial support, as I have said, to those with less than
£100,000 of assets in 2010-11 prices who are in residential
care. This will rise to around £123,000 at implementation. The
cap would cover the cost of social care. Someone in residential care
will always be responsible for a contribution to their general living
costs—that is, their heat, food and light—as they would
when living at home. That amount would be set nationally at around
£10,000 in 2010-11 prices, as recommended by Dilnot, but anyone
who is unable to afford that will be helped by the local authority. We
view that flat contribution to hotel costs, if I can describe them that
way, as a fair way of implementing a rule around the country that is
easy for everyone to understand and does not involve massive
bureaucracy.
Altogether<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T17:42:08"></hs_TimeCode>, the

Oppenheim-Barnes:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend may recall
that when we previously discussed this problem on the Floor of your
Lordships’ House, I voiced the very strong concerns that I have
held for a long time. That is because when I was in another place, I
faced a number of constituents in my surgery saying,
“We’ve worked hard all our lives, we’ve done
everything that we can do and we’ve paid for everything, and now
they’re going to sell my house, whereas someone who has done
nothing and saved nothing is going to get their treatment for

the other hand, when I raised these points with previous Governments,
their reply was, “Well, the British taxpayer should not be asked
to subsidise the inheritance of their future children”. I felt
that that was a very harsh view to be taken, and my noble friend has
put that right. This is an important step in the right direction. It

minimum eligibility will be set to make access to care more consistent
around the country. In addition, carers will have a legal right to an
assessment to care for the first time. I take his point about trying to
achieve cross-party consensus on social care funding.</hs_para>

for funding in the existing system, in the last spending review we
made, as he knows, an additional £7.2 billion over four years
available for care and support. Since then, we have provided local

challenge creates an opportunity for local authorities to innovate and
to explore new ways of working better to meet the needs of their local

obtained on this subject, so that old people know the background they

will he meet one of the points made by my noble friend Lord Hunt by
trying to make this package slightly more favourable to the less well

with him in spirit. I say that because not only do I believe in
cross-party consensus on a matter as important as this, but I hope he
will accept from me that the way we have tried to structure this
package, taking the cap and the means test in combination, has
precisely been to target those of more modest means. Currently only
those with assets of less than £23,250 and a low income receive
help from the state with their care costs. Our changes will mean that
those with property value and savings of £100,000 or less in
2010 prices will start to receive financial support. That means that
the most support will go to those in greatest need. I am advised that
had we, for example, opted for a higher means-test threshold, it would
not in practice have brought into the net that many more people. We
felt that the fairest way of cutting the cake was to try to concentrate
the benefit on those of lowest means while also removing the fear of
catastrophic care costs from everybody in the
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021123000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021123000040"><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Jolly" PimsId="5895" UID="13021123000137" xid="2109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021123000137"><B>Baroness

said. First, there is not enough money in the system, and secondly,
people do not know about it. They do not know that they have to pay for
social care, never mind up to £75,000. Is the Minister confident

what they may not be entitled to. Collectively, we need to put that

particularly, when they become in need of social care. When we have a
Budget, newspapers often produce ready reckoners, showing the impact of
tax rises, reductions or whatever is being introduced on people in
particular circumstances. Will the Minister encourage his department,

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I absolutely agree with the noble Baroness
on how important this is. It is quite complex to explain the whole
system in words. The system will depend on the operation of a sliding
scale which, by its nature, is difficult to describe other than
pictorially. Nevertheless, the basics of the rules of these funding
arrangements are straightforward and can be described. They are, as the
Statement described, two essential elements, being the maximum level
that people have to pay for their care—which we are setting at
£61,000 in 2010 prices; £75,000 in 2017—and the
means test, which is
£100,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T18:02:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

nuances around that, such as around couples and how the system will
work for them. That is a question that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked
me which I did not answer. At present, a couple could potentially face
two sets of unlimited care costs. By protecting them from these costs,
the reforms offer them significant benefits which need to be spelt out.
In most circumstances, even if a couple both had care costs at
£75,000, the level of the cap, they would contribute less than
this because housing assets do not count towards the means test if one
of the partners remains resident in the home. All those sorts of things
need to be made clear. We will do our very best to work with others to

bute or other medicines consumed by horses entering the food chain. In
2012, the Food Standards Agency found eight instances where UK

passports, making it easier to produce forgeries. Last May, a truck was

tests are of retail, wholesale and catering premises. Are the councils
concerned being reimbursed for the cost of this work? The tests being

we have to get the results right, but will the Minister consider
releasing the results on a weekly basis as they come in, as part of his
commitment to transparency? Can we also get a cast iron guarantee that
schools and hospitals will be tested across the country? The Secretary

Clark of Windermere:</Member></B> My Lords, there are clearly various
aspects to this problem—the criminality, misleading of the
general public and the issue of food safety. The Minister has given us
an assurance today that there is no risk to food safety. May I press
him on this issue and ask him a question? I understand that the science
of veterinary medicine as it might pass on to food consumption for
humans is based on minimum residue levels, but there are a number of
veterinary medicines that do not subject themselves to that
classification, such as phenylbutazone, which he mentioned, and many
others. These medicines pose a risk to human health. We have a very
elaborate and rigorous system of testing for those medicines, but this
problem has emanated, as I understand it, not primarily from the United
Kingdom but from other parts of Europe. Do other European countries

reminding public bodies of their responsibility for their own food

back to the BSE crisis, the French unilaterally imposed a ban on
Scottish grass-fed beef, which lasted for several years and did
enormous damage. My right honourable friend is to be congratulated on

said that there is no evidence of a threat to food safety, which is
obviously welcome news. However, he glossed over an answer to the
question asked by my noble friend Lady Crawley. There have been massive

<?notus-xml column=511?>reductions in the resources available to local Trading Standards to
pursue proper food safety tests. Further, the number of food inspectors
has been reduced. This clearly poses a risk. If there is potentially
criminal fraudulent activity involving the substitution of one form of
meat for another, could there not also be criminal activity involving
cavalierly ignoring hygiene regulations or the rules on additives? What
assurances can the Minister give us that those matters will be

not dropped its guard. As my noble friend Lord Forsyth, said, it has
been doing an extremely good job in very difficult circumstances and
the Government are supporting it in that. As I explained earlier, the
nature of sampling is risk based and focused on protecting consumers.
Staff reductions have not affected the level of testing carried out on
meat. Meat produced in UK approved slaughterhouses is inspected by
official veterinarians and meat inspectors working under their

enough cricketer to have played all-day cricket before I was 20 but,
thereafter, I played it for another 40 years, and I can still recall
vividly how being the first batsman to face the bowling after the lunch
interval was always a tribulation. On this occasion, I am conscious
that it was the close of the innings of the noble Lord, Lord Low of
Dalston, that occasioned 
<?notus-xml column=514?>the interval, but it remains very much a privilege to share membership
of your Lordships’ House with him. On any matter, I should, in
cricketing terms, always give him the benefit of the doubt. In the mean

the Bill is a new wicket for me to play on. I do not think that it is
mandatory for me to declare an interest but, once upon a time, I was a
Treasury Minister for nearly four years. Among the seven Treasury
colleagues with whom I shared the ministerial
responsibilities in those years, I was the only one who had never
worked in the City, although I was, for 24 years, its MP. My noble
friend Lord Lawson of Blaby was generous in involving us all in the
gestation of Budgets but, in practical terms, my direct
responsibilities might have been described as Treasury housekeeping,
with all three main subjects being housekeeping oriented, and I had up
to a dozen minor ones, including—perhaps unexpectedly—the
Central Office of Information. It is quite possible that no one else in
your Lordships’ House knows the origin of the ministerial
concept of “the line to take”, except the noble Lord,
Lord Hennessy of Nympsfield—and he knows only because I told

some of the poorest people in our country. In short, it will widen the

particular concern widely held among the organisations working to

are being made. This Bill cannot and should not be considered in
isolation; it comes as yet another blow to the poorest people, in a
long line of already devastating cuts. Perhaps most worryingly, it
comes at a stage when many key provisions of the Welfare Reform Act
have yet to be implemented, including the capping of household
benefits; cuts to council tax benefit; and new penalties for those
deemed to be under-occupying social housing. The cumulative effect of
these measures, which are being simultaneously thrust upon families
this year, will create significant reductions to household incomes that
are already under immense strain for many families. With such a
widespread change under way, it is important that time is allowed for
proper assessment and appropriate adjustments to be
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021129000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021129000034">However,
the Government are already committed to further real-terms benefit cuts
both for the immediate future and the next three years. It is
irresponsible to legislate for a fixed annual increase of 1% when there
can be no guarantee of how the rate of inflation will change between
now and 2015. It is very possible that we will see families eventually
facing an even bigger gap between incomes and prices in the years to
come.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021129000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021129000035">This
rush to make short-term savings is not only unjust but economically
unwise. It will inevitably increase homelessness, cause mental health

the cost of more family poverty will ultimately fall back on the
taxpayer. This is not some Dickensian tale. In Britain in the 21st
century, some 200,000 children will be pushed into poverty, growing up
in unheated households or going to school hungry. They will face real
risks to their education and health, which apart from the devastating
human cost will almost certainly require expensive interventions by the
state further down the

particularly unpalatable aspect of the debate surrounding this
legislation has been the rhetoric contributing to the isolation and
stigmatisation of the vulnerable in our society. A number of noble
Lords have spoken about this. Seeking to differentiate those in poverty
as “deserving” or “undeserving” serves only
to scapegoat those who are the victims of Britain’s stagnant
economy. They are blamed. The implication is that if we did not have
the people labelled “benefit scroungers”, everybody would
be in work and the economy would be all right. This sort of rhetoric

are currently 6 million British workers in poverty. They rely on
benefits to bridge the gap between a lower-than-living wage and rapidly
rising living costs. These people will bear the brunt of the Bill when
they are hit by real-terms cuts to their essential working tax credits
and child tax credits. Furthermore, a below-inflation rise in benefits
risks creating work disincentives, especially when working people face
above-inflation rises in food and transport costs. For a worker
receiving the minimum wage and facing a 4.2% rise in the cost of their
commute, the Bill simply means that work will pay less than ever
before. There are also more than 1 million disabled people
who will be directly affected, adding to the pressures they already
face from changes including the overhaul of the disability living

this legislation. Just 15% of adults with autism are in full-time work,
yet research by the National Autistic Society shows that the vast

a false one to draw because in pounds and pence terms, families are
struggling to make ends meet on a daily basis. The average weekly
take-home pay in Britain is £395. That is five and a half times
the jobseeker’s allowance of £71 and seven times the

Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow
the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, who is an expert in his field and brings
an interesting Welsh dimension, as does my noble friend Lord German, to
this important debate. It has been an excellent debate so far,
reflecting the rising level of apprehension that exists in the country

am in some difficulty with the Bill because, at the risk of sounding
pedantic, I do not even agree with the title. The Bill’s Short
Title is “Welfare Benefits Up-rating Bill”. The Long
Title is “To make provision relating to the up-rating of certain
social security benefits”. I have argued this etymological,
perhaps pedantic, point before. There is a world of difference between
statutory social security entitlements and welfare benefits. Welfare
benefits were things that we inherited from our American cousins. They
have nothing whatever to do with the statutory provision that we in the
United Kingdom have enjoyed for the past 20

agree with noble Lords who made powerful speeches about the kind of
language that we use to frame the debate. It is not just
“drivers” and “skivers”, but goes more
fundamentally to the point that since Section 150 of the
Social Security Administration Act 1992, which the Bill seeks to amend,
we have always had uprating. I was there when that Act was cast. It put
the uprating debate beyond short-term party-political arguments. It
stated that there were entitlements that gave people on various
benefits a stake in creating the wealth of our country. That is a very
important element in the social cohesion that we have enjoyed in this
country to date. We are at risk of setting a very bad precedent with
the Bill by disrupting this for a three-year

because we always talk about cash as snapshot cash figures—and
the quantities are truly frightening for anybody who does not know
anything about it—instead of talking about percentage shares of
the wealth of the country and the long-term longitudinal dimension to
some of this debate, which tracks what families do in the course of a

the near future—we have to ensure that the country knows what
that means for the future. It is an ageing society. We are all living
longer and that is a success story, but we have to pay for that, too.

second point concerns something that one or two colleagues have
mentioned. On top of everything else, this Bill worries me. I could be
persuaded that for the next 12-month period there is a case for looking
at the uprating of benefits, and I would certainly want to engage in
that. However, I am deeply worried that this is on top of everything
else. I would like to think that I have been studying this as long as
anybody, but I have no idea what the next five years are going to hold,
particularly for low-income working-age families. The point that was
powerfully made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, was that the
cumulative effect of all this has not been analysed by anybody. I would
argue—and I think that the people sitting behind the Minister
would probably say this—that the situation has been changing so
fast that it has been impossible to pin down a cumulative analysis of
what has been going on. I agree with her that this has to be

want to make a connection between what the noble Baroness was saying
and what my noble friend Lord German was saying, because he said
something important with which I fundamentally agree: these cuts now
have to stop. Between now and 2015, I will stand shoulder to shoulder
with my noble friend Lord German, particularly in relation
to low-income working-age households, in arguing that there should be
no more cuts after this. Anything else would be to risk poverty and
deprivation on a scale that we underestimate at our
peril<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:12:54"></hs_TimeCode>. If my
noble friend Lord German and I get our way and stop any future change
beyond this Bill, we could get on and do the arithmetic that the noble
Baroness, Lady Hollis, is suggesting. Perhaps it is calculus, not
arithmetic. If we do not do that, we will all be arguing blind. I
certainly do not know what the full consequences will be of everything 
<?notus-xml column=521?>that has happened to date, and I do not think that that is safe. I want

want to make one other point about fairness. I think the noble Lord,
Lord Adebowale, made it earlier. There is a qualitative impact to these
cuts as well as a quantitative one, particularly for low-income
working-age households. The noble Lord said this powerfully; he has
more experience in the front line than I have. The impact of a 1% cut
for somebody in the lower two deciles of income is much more profound
than for others. It does not matter what the cash effect is; it is the

matter that deeply concerns me but that has not been drawn out enough

closing, I want to try to promote an amendment to this Bill because, as
we have been saying, an inflation risk has been introduced in a way
that we have never seen before. This Bill imposes a 1% uprating in
2014-15, regardless of inflation. I am sure that we all trust the
Office for Budget Responsibility; I am not an economist, but it seems
to me that their forecasts have been pretty dodgy in terms of some of
the metrics in the economy in the past. If they are not right about a
2.6% increase in CPI, and a 2.2% increase the year after, in 2014,
anything in excess of that will increase these cuts.</hs_para>

metrics but will get them checked before Committee, because my
arithmetic is not great, but if inflation were to be 2% more than the
OBR’s current forecast over the next two years, the savings in
2015-16 increase from £1.9 billion to £4.7
billion. Who can put their hand on their heart and say that they know
that we are not going to face this kind of inflationary increase? With
food costs, fuel costs and rent costs, some families will certainly
experience a 2% increase over the OBR estimate. I do not
know how widespread that will be, but some of them will face that, so
it is just not safe for us as legislators. I know there might be some
issues of financial privilege in some of this, but I think it is

above that, they have to default back and argue the case year by year

with great interest to the debate so far, and I, like many others, have
a number of concerns with this Bill. Capping the uprating of most
benefits to no more than 1% for the next three years will mean an
exponential increase in the net losses each year. The Government have
already reduced the welfare budget for working-age people, so this Bill
will be yet another blow for low earners and unemployed, sick, or

first concern is that the impact of benefit uprating changes will swamp
any gains from raising tax thresholds for low-income households.
Uprating changes are less noticeable than other cuts but over the years
can have a large impact on someone’s income. Between 2011 and
2015, the uprating changes to child benefit alone will result in a
real-terms cut of almost £6 a week for a family with two
children. Child benefit, in addition, plays a role in determining the
level of housing and council tax benefit paid to those on low incomes
in work. The real-terms cut due to child benefit uprating alone during
that period is almost £11 a
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:19:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

working full time on the minimum wage, if there are children, not only
will suffer a real-terms loss of £11 a week between 2011 and
2015 but will gain less than £2 a week from the rise in the tax
threshold, because a rise in net income means a drop in housing and
council tax benefits. Also,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:19:32"></hs_TimeCode> effects of
this Bill will not be greatly eased by the change in the personal tax

uprating changes are not occurring in isolation from other benefit
cuts. In considering this Bill, it is important to have in mind the
full impact of all the changes. Very few people who rely on benefits or
tax credits as part of their income, whether in or out of work, will
experience a cut in uprating alone. There have been numerous other cuts
to tax credits, housing benefit, council tax support and disability
benefits as well as capping. Citizens Advice has analysed the overall
impact for a household through a series of changes in circumstances on
what we currently know. The analysis demonstrates in a small way the
combined impact of the changes on some groups, assuming that this Bill
is passed. The example I want to present is not at the extreme end as
there will be many people who will be even more severely hit by the
cuts and will lose much more.</hs_para>

couple, Mike and Anne, have two girls aged 12 and seven. They live in a
three-bedroom property belonging to a local housing association and are
both working full time with a combined income of about £46,000 a
year. With this joint income they will be about £17 a week
better off from tax and benefit changes in 2015 than they were in 2011.
They will lose about £6 a week in real terms from the uprating
of child benefit, but they will gain around £23 from the change
in the tax threshold, giving an overall gain of £17 a week.
However, this position rapidly deteriorates if the family circumstances
change for the worse. If, say, Anne becomes ill and is diagnosed with
MS, she may have to cut her hours because she quickly becomes
exhausted.</hs_para>

Anne becomes a lone parent. She now has earnings of £10,000 a
year, but is entitled to some help through benefits, including
disability benefits and premiums in recognition of the extra costs she
now faces as a result of her illness. Between 2011 and 2015, someone in
her position will suffer a large loss in benefits, around £58 a
week, while gaining only about £2 a week from the rise in the
tax threshold as the gain in net earnings leads to a reduction in
benefits. That is an overall loss of £56 a week. This is made up
of an underoccupancy charge, loss of lower rate DLA, a £5
council tax payment and about £18 due to all the uprating
changes.</hs_para>

is the loss under the current system. The loss under universal credit
will be even greater for someone in Anne’s position. If she
moved over to universal credit at the point when her health
deteriorated, she would not get transitional protection, and in 2015
would have a real-terms income of £95 a week less than in 2011.
This is because under universal credit she will get no more financial
support than someone who is not ill or disabled. If Anne’s
condition further deteriorates and she has to leave work, she is
awarded the middle-rate care component of DLA and is placed in the ESA
support group. She now has a great many extra costs.</hs_para>

loss between 2011 and 2015 for a household in this position is about
£34 a week, and that assumes that Anne keeps DLA or the same
value in PIP. This loss includes a real-terms loss of about £15
due to uprating changes, despite the protection for disabled people.
Again, this is all under the current system. Under universal credit, if
Anne does not get transitional protection, she will be £61 worse
off in real terms in 2015 than someone in her position would have been
in 2011. The extra loss is due to the loss of the severe disability
premium offset by the rise in the support element of universal

summary, between 2011 and 2015, this couple with a joint income of
£46,000 a year have a real-terms gain from tax and benefit
changes of £17 a week; they would have a £23 gain if they
did not have children. A disabled lone parent in Anne’s position
who is working will have a real-terms drop of £56 a week
overall, despite the gain from the raising of the tax threshold. The
drop will be a real-terms drop of £95 a week between the current
system in 2011 and universal credit in 2015. For someone in

are already struggling to manage, as has already been mentioned by my

high inflation. For many, this can mean making choices such as whether
to keep the house warm or to eat properly. Disabled people who cannot
work, those who are unemployed and cannot find work, and those on low
earnings who are working are all being affected by other benefit cuts.

am told that benefits for asylum seekers are not welfare benefits, and
that although they are benefits designed for the welfare of those in

there are no plans for any increases in the near future. I am thinking
of a teenage girl in Leeds who has to look after her disabled mother as
they seek asylum after fleeing from terror. She goes without meals
herself in order to ensure that her mother is kept out of destitution.

Will the Government look again at the effect of the provisions of this

protected, the lower child disability addition of universal credit is
included in the Bill among the benefits to be capped at 1% per annum. I
follow the noble Lord, Lord Low, in asking that this should be looked
at again. This benefit will be halved under universal credit; families
with disabled children will have that element of their benefit reduced
from £57 a week to £28, and now that savage reduction
will be compounded by an increase of only 1% rather than by inflation.

effect on families of the continuing erosion of child benefit. This
benefit has long been the mark of our support for children in our
society, but already we have seen a significant number of families
being deprived of this universal benefit altogether. The social value
of paying this benefit to the mother has, I believe, not been properly
or adequately counted. It is a benefit that is widely used to support
the next generation, but it is now being refused to many. The 1%
increase in 2014-15 follows three years of freezing the uprate so that,
over the five years from 2010 to 2015, the level of child benefit for a
family with three children will have reduced by £380 a
year—in addition to the other reductions for children in
deprived circumstances. Child benefit is key to the welfare of our
society and it needs to be protected.</hs_para>

than that and ask whether she will make it clear that the vast majority
of those on benefits are not shirkers, fraudsters or spendthrifts. The
majority of those who receive benefits are in work and the majority of
those out of work would love to work if they could find jobs. The
stigmatisation of those who receive benefits is both serious and
dangerous. In 2011, there was an increase of 30% in attacks on disabled
people, fuelled by stories of how people were falsely claiming
disability allowances. Politicians and journalists are accused of
spreading a mythology that causes stigma. Will the Minister today begin

Sheikh:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the Bill as it will restore
fairness and simplicity to the process of social security payments. It
will also deal with the question of affordability. It is important for
a Government of any persuasion to show that they empathise with
taxpayers who are essentially paying for welfare handouts. The concept
of fairness is one of the reasons for 
<?notus-xml column=526?>proposing this Bill. It is worth remembering that the coalition
Government inherited the biggest budget deficit of any country in the
developed world. It is estimated that capping social security benefits
in this manner will save the Treasury £3.7 billion in 2015-16
and that, thereafter, there will be permanent savings each and every
year in our welfare
spending.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021130000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021130000033">Welfare<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:32:36"></hs_TimeCode>

not produce the intended result of helping individuals to return to
work. If we can get more people in work, some of them will receive
salary progressions and improve their standards of living. In the years
1997 to 2010, when average earnings increased by 30%, tax credit
spending increased by 340%. One of the aims of this Bill is to tackle
the lack of aspiration and ambition among a number of those who have

successful in addressing the matter. Children and young people who live
in households where adults do not engage in any form of employment are

wealth for the country. It is unfortunate that some people have chosen
not to make a contribution to society and have opted to receive
benefits as a way of life. The welfare system was created to ensure

Donaghy:</Member></B> My Lords, I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord
Sheikh, for being a hard-working and successful entrepreneur. I know
several people who have two or three part-time jobs who work extremely
hard and who remain low paid. I never cease to be surprised that the
low paid are always blamed for being low paid and being eligible for
tax credits, but low-paying employers are never blamed for their
part.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021133000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021133000002">This
Bill is political and deserves a political response. The challenge has
been issued by the noble Lords, Lord German, Lord Bates and Lord Brooke
of Sutton Mandeville: “What would I do instead of this
Bill?”. In the words of Yosser Hughes, “Gissa job”
and I will tell you. This Bill is completely unnecessary, it is based
on a misrepresentation and it is playing politics with people’s
lives. All this will become apparent when the impact is actually felt
by real people, when the jobless numbers rise and child poverty
increases.</hs_para>

absolutely no need for the Bill, as has already been said by several

primary legislation. So why do it? The Work and Pensions Secretary,
Iain Duncan Smith, said that it would,</hs_para>

ask the Minister: what certainty can there possibly be when the level
of inflation in the next three years—a key ingredient, she must
accept—is unknown? What certainty can there be when the markets
are up and down like a yo-yo? I suppose it could be said that higher
rate taxpayers have been provided with certainty, and claimants are
certain that they will be a lot poorer. The real reason for this
unnecessary Bill is to provide a symbolic dividing line between the
coalition Government and the Labour Opposition—short-term
political gain on the back of those at the bottom of the labour
market—and this sleight of hand will be found
out.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13021133000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021133000005">Secondly,
the Bill is based on the false premise that this is about fairness

pitched to present this Bill as an act of fairness to working people
whose earnings have risen by about 10% since 2007 while out-of-work
benefits have gone up by about 20%, but we all know how misleading this
comparison is. I negotiated wage increases for the poorest paid in
universities for 16 years, 90% of them women, mainly part-time. Using
percentages to present a case is designed to mislead. We used to say
that 10% of nothing is still
nothing.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13021133000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021133000006">The
whole presentation by the Government is about employed versus
unemployed, when the reality is nothing of the kind. It is actually
about divide and rule. Thirty per cent of households will be affected.
Those most likely to be affected are families with children,
particularly lone parents, 90% of whom are women. The Government claim
that many of those affected by the Bill could cope with the
below-inflation benefits by moving into work, but 60% of those
households affected are in work. The Government claim that the disabled
will be protected, but disabled people in the ESA support group will
see their basic allowance of £71 uprated by 1%. This represents
almost 70% of their out-of-work support and 991,000 disabled people
receiving ESA in 2012 will experience a 1% uprating, representing a
loss of £87.65 a year, as has already been
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021133000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021133000007">The real

either we have 200,000 extra children in poverty or we have 350,000

the Government are playing politics with people’s lives. They
claim it is about rebalancing the economy and making work pay. Let us
say for the sake of argument that the 60% on diminishing tax credits
who are in work get better jobs, leaving room for the 40% who are not
in work to do the lowest paid jobs. Where are these jobs coming from?
Last year 300,000 jobs were lost from the public sector. The OBR
predicts the loss of a further 900,000 jobs by 2017-18, while the
Institute for Fiscal Studies predicts 1.2 million lost jobs in the
public sector over the same period.</hs_para>

they are all going to come from the private sector, and so far they
have, but there is no growth in the economy. People are spending what
they have on energy, food and rent, and large retail chains are going
out of business. Maybe they will all become self-employed. Between June
2008 and April-June 2012 the number of self-employed rose to 4.2
million, a rise of 367,000. During the same period, the number 
<?notus-xml column=530?>of employees declined by 434,000. Maybe this is how we are going to work
our way out of poverty.</hs_para>

the figures, 80% of that increase in the number of self-employed were
aged over 50 and more than likely to be male, according to the Office
for National Statistics. So we are turning into a nation of 50 year-old
entrepreneurs. When you delve even further, they turn out to be
construction workers, carpenters, taxi drivers, et cetera. This
suggests people who have little choice about their employment status,
whose job prospects have diminished because of age barriers and who are
probably bumping along on the bottom of the labour market, getting what
they can but not continuous employment. It could also explain why
output is flat while employment is growing. It is not the brave new
world but more like a twilight
zone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:50:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021133000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021133000012">The
Government are not looking after the economy; they are looking after
their own. The gap between rich and poor, already unacceptable, will
widen. The <I>Times Magazine</I> last week said that a child born in
Lambeth is likely to die eight years before their counterpart in
Kensington and Chelsea. I presume that the latter need the extra eight
years in order to spend their tax breaks. It is bad enough that we live
in a society that tolerates these differences in mortality rates. This
Bill is intended to be a propaganda coup for the Government. It will
soon be seen for what it is: a gratuitous attack on the poorest and
weakest in an unequal
society.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_11_PT_1/973A01BD03CBCC53E261A5BDA214207FDF2828D6" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 February 2013">Monday,

Wigley:</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to follow a number of
long-standing colleagues with whom I have campaigned on these issues
over many years. I, too, voice my concern about this Bill, which will
result in real-terms cuts in support for thousands of low-income
people, including, despite government claims to the contrary, up to 1
million disabled people, particularly those endeavouring to
work.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13021138000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021138000002">If the
Bill goes through unchecked, the increase in welfare benefits will be
1% while CPI inflation stands at 2.7% and RPI inflation at 3%. As the
noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, mentioned, inflation may well increase
substantially. This will lead to real-terms cuts during the next three
years in payments to support those who are working and contributing to
the economy. They are the very “hard working families” so
beloved of the spin doctors of those who want to underpin the concept
of the deserving poor—deserving, apparently, of just 1%
uprating. I cannot see how this will contribute to promoting a work
ethic or allow working people to participate in a savings
culture.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021138000003">I
shall refer to figures relating mainly to Wales, although I realise
that the arguments will apply to many other areas, too. The effect of
the measures in Wales will be disproportionally greater, since incomes
per head in Wales are substantially lower than average incomes in
England. Figures released before Christmas show that GVA per head in
Wales stands at 75.2% of the UK average, so cuts to in-work benefits
for the low-paid will hit Wales proportionately
harder.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021138000004">According<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:52:26"></hs_TimeCode>
to the most recent DWP data, as at 1 December last year,
more than 125,000 families in Wales were receiving working tax credits.
This comprises 
<?notus-xml column=531?>some 93,000 families receiving both working tax credits and child tax
credits, and 32,000 families receiving just working tax credits. The
2011 census records that in my home area, the Gwynedd local authority
area, 9,200 families were receiving one or more elements of tax credits
out of the total 52,000 households. This means that 17.5% of all
households were in receipt of tax credits. These people generally spend
their money within their own local areas. The Welsh economy is made up
overwhelmingly of small businesses. These working tax credit reductions
will mean that demand is further sucked out of local economies as
people have, in real terms, less money to
spend.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021138000005">The
uprating will also hit those seeking work. The Government may intend
this real cut as furthering workforce discipline, surmising that, as
benefits will be even lower, so people will be prepared to take any
job. In this, they are fundamentally mistaken. Many unemployed people,
particularly in Wales, are seeking work in vain because the economic
policies of the Government are failing. There are some parts of the
west Wales and the valleys area whose GVA per head is only 65% of the
UK average, with 21 unemployed people chasing every vacant job. Putting
the morality of this on one side for a moment, starving people back
into work has no prospects of success if the jobs are just not
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021138000006">If we
are to combat this, boosting skills alone will not cut it; we must also
tackle the demand side of the economy. We have to make sure that there
is real work out there for people to do. The Government's Work
Programme, allegedly designed to take people off benefits and into
work, was utterly ineffective throughout the UK, but Wales recorded the
worst figures, with the Department for Work and Pensions saying that
only 1,380 of the 42,380 people on the programme entered long-term
employment—a success rate of only 3%. In Wales, 77,377 people
are looking for work and claiming jobseeker’s allowance, while
just 20,310 vacancies are posted in jobcentres. This means that, across
Wales, there are on average four people chasing every empty
job</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021138000007">We are
facing a vast increase in the number of the working poor—people
who are now resorting to the food banks to feed their families. If this
Government were serious about ensuring that work pays, they should
legislate to ensure that work really does pay more in wages so that
people do not have to resort to benefits to make ends meet. Legislating
to uprate the minimum wage to the recommended living wage would be a
good start, and I commend the points made by the noble Lord, Lord
Bates, earlier in this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021138000008">It has
been estimated that the private sector in the UK is sitting on a cash

Wales, although most economic powers are not devolved, we can take some

Wales as part of a 
<?notus-xml column=532?>budget deal. We are also pressing for a new procurement policy that
could create several thousand jobs through sourcing public sector

work and training is what is needed, not temporary workfare schemes to
take people off unemployment figures for six months. At the very least,
the Government must make sure that increases in benefit rates reflect
rises in the cost of living. Otherwise, this proposed cut will deepen
inequality, increase poverty and further dampen the economic prospects

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, said it
and, to a large extent, the noble Lord, Lord Wigley, demonstrated it as
regards Wales; namely, that this Bill has wider social implications,
but they are not welcome implications. They are to put a big burden of
the sorting-out of our economic situation on low paid working people. I
follow the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, in saying that it is quite a
dangerous move, after 20 years of virtual cross-party consensus,

unnecessary. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T19:58:00"></hs_TimeCode>The

is supposed to be part of a strategy on the part of the Government to
reduce benefit costs, simplify the benefits system and increase
employment, but any such strategy is put in jeopardy by a government
believing their own propaganda and that of their press allies. That
propaganda seems to be all about the distinction between the deserving
and the undeserving poor—those who work and those who do
not—but the burden of the Bill falls on those who do work, who
are already squeezed by a cut in real wages, particularly at the lower
ends of income, and who will therefore be twice hit by a cut in the

propaganda also suggests that benefit recipients’ real living
standards have risen dramatically faster than those who are in work. As
the figures that have been provided to us by the CPAG show, the real
value of unemployment pay and other social benefits has steadily fallen

in the past couple of years is the dramatic fall in real wages at the
bottom end. That is not a reason to aggravate that unfairness and

the Government were really telling the public that we need to
differentiate between those who work and those who do not, they would
have provided for a benefit system that differentiated between levels

The Government have, rightly, stuck with 
<?notus-xml column=533?>focusing on need rather than on whether you are in or out of work. Of
course, the downside of that is that they have hit both equally. For
those who are in work, the Government claim that they have offset that
by raising the tax threshold at the same time, but the tax threshold
hike has been offset by the cut in housing benefit, the abolition for
many and the cut for others in council tax benefit and other
benefits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T20:00:36"></hs_TimeCode>. The

particular families in particular situations, especially in London.
Those families are obviously chosen to highlight a point. For obvious

market—out-of-reach mortgages, soaring private rents,
unaffordable leasehold charges, the inadequate quantity of new social
housing, and increasingly expensive social housing at
that—reflect a failure to build, a failure to refurbish and a
failure to provide housing choice fit for our society at various
levels.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021138000018">Hence,
in all forms of tenure, housing costs are rising. Inevitably, that
leads to a rise in housing benefit payments. I repeat that that is a
failure of housing policy; it is not a failure of social security
policy. I predict that the pressure on housing benefit, or what is
intended will become the housing component of universal credit, will
seriously sabotage and possibly completely undermine what I think is
universally regarded as the commendable aim of introducing universal
credit, unless housing benefit and the pressures on it are dealt with

back, the roots of this problem go to a serious mistake, made, probably
unconsciously, decades ago. Until the 1960s, the vast bulk of
government intervention in the housing market was on the capital side:
help to local authorities to build social housing; and help to
homeowners and landlords to improve 
<?notus-xml column=534?>their stock. A much lesser proportion was on the revenue side in
subsidies to people, and much of that was through tax relief on
mortgage payments. We now have a completely switched system, so that
more than 90% of state support in the housing market is revenue based
and very little is capital based. In the next five years, £90
billion will be spent on housing benefit; £5 billion,
at best, on new and improved housing. Within government, the two
aspects are dealt with by entirely separate policies and entirely
different departments. CLG designs housing policy; DWP decides housing
benefit. If the two sides were brought together in one pot with one
policy in one department, we could perhaps, over a period of years,
develop a sensible housing strategy: building more houses, improving
those we have, and providing selective support to tenants and
householders who are faced with unaffordable
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021138000020">Unless
we do that, unless we take housing benefit out of the plans for
universal credit strategy and put it back into housing policy, we will
not solve the housing crisis, the pressure on housing benefit and
therefore the pressure on the social security budget in total. Unlike
other benefits, housing benefit—and, I guess, council tax
benefit—depends not on your income or your family circumstances
but on the home and the area in which it is situated and on the state
of all the housing markets in that area. As long as the housing crisis
persists, the total benefit bill will inexorably rise faster than
inflation. Then the Treasury will again insist on real terms cuts to
the income of many of the poorest in our society, such as the proposals

Gardner of Parkes:</Member></B> My Lords, it has been a very
wide-ranging debate, and many different aspects have been developed by
different speakers. I start by taking issue with the noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, for saying that we on this side have tried to make this a
battle between the deserving and the undeserving. I do not think that
there should be moral judgments like that, and I do not believe that
our party is making them. I will start with the noble Lord’s
speech because it was the previous one and therefore it is fresh in my
mind. It is important to realise that housing benefit has been a great
problem. He says that we need to address it. Of course we do. One way
to address it is to restrict it, and that is what has had to be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T20:07:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021138000023">I
have seen people living in properties who have been getting housing
benefit of about £80,000 a year. That is just the benefit. It is
not their living costs or 
<?notus-xml column=535?>anything else. People in employment might be earning £20,000 a
year in the same area. It is pretty hard to watch that happen. When I
was chairman of social services on Westminster Council, many years ago,
we discovered that housing in London was terribly expensive even then,
and that there was plenty of space and lots of unoccupied properties
in, I think, Liverpool. It was somewhere quite
remote<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T20:08:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021138000024">We
gave all those people who had no housing rights at all the right to go
there. We provided transport and everything else, and Liverpool was
willing to provide the accommodation. One-third of those people arrived
there. The other two-thirds vanished into the blue. They went off our
housing list, but they never appeared anywhere else. Evidently they
would rather do anything than leave London. When we now see these
people living in a little shed in a back garden in Acton or somewhere,
it is terrible that people so desperately want to stay in London, where
housing is, I would say, at the top of the range in price, and the
least available. We had terrible trouble then because all the bed and
breakfast hotel accommodation, which is so widely used now, was taken
up by tourists or new arrivals to the country. Even to get a bed and
breakfast space we at Westminster Council had gradually to move out
wider and wider. It got to the point where no one in London had any bed
and breakfast space
available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T20:09:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021138000025">I
feel for councils now that have nothing to offer people. This problem
has not arisen in five minutes. It goes back a long, long way. When I
was on the Greater London Council, I remember that we had a
Conservative housing chairman and a Labour Government at that time. The
chairman said, “This is the time when we could solve the housing
problem, because I know what we need in London and the Labour
Government have good ideas on what they could do”. However, it
never happened because each of those authorities changed. The
Government and the council changed, so the whole scenario
changed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021138000026">Housing
is a major problem. What is very bad is the continuing increase in
utility bills and fuel rises. People in council blocks have recently
told me that they can manage to pay the rent—they were renting
from people who had bought their leasehold because that was all that
was available—but they could not afford to warm the flat because
the fuel bill is so high. That is worrying, because we were told that
every effort would be made to see that fuel bills came down to a level
where a card payment at a prepayment meter, which most of those people
have to use because it is the only practical way for them to budget,
would not be more expensive than having a quarterly bill. Yet only last
week someone told me that it is still 10% more. Of course, it is going
up all the time. That would be something—there are many
things—that could be done to help people. The housing issue is
not such a battle now. It has been addressed by putting a ceiling on
housing
benefit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0002.htm#13021138000027">I

in this country and knew nothing about it. I had no job or anything
else. Particularly if you have come from another country, it really
does not much matter where you settle provided that you have the school
that you want. Wales has always had a marvellous reputation for
literacy, and I am quite sure that the schools would be good there. You

frivolous in this very serious debate. The one thing that we all have
in common in this Chamber tonight is that none of us wants to see
restrictions on anything. However, we just have to be realistic and
look at the common sense of it. If we do not have the money to afford
things, we cannot attempt to do it. It is all very well to think that
you can do everything for everyone. I read in the statistics, which I
think someone else quoted, that there was a 60% welfare increase under
the previous Government between 2003 and 2010. Every household had to
pay more than £3,000 a year to meet that extra increase of 60%,
and the fact that we went too far and spent too much then is of course
catching up with us now. It would be lovely if these things did not
happen. However, this has happened and we have to try to put a stop on
it, at least to be sure that we do not go on for ever.</hs_para>

McKenzie, spoke early on about how we denigrate people as being
workshy. Again, when I was in dental practice we had only a very poor
catchment area near us because the only way people could get to work
was by bus. There was absolute overemployment in the country, but we
would go to the jobcentre and get nice young people to come and start
work. We made the mistake originally of giving them keys to the
surgery. That was a big mistake because most of them did not last a
week. Then you would phone and say, “Where is Joanie? We were
expecting her at work”, and someone would say, “Oh no,
she never gets out of bed before midday. We can’t do anything
with her”. So this is not a new problem. There have always been
people who did not want to work, but there are others who do. That is
the tragedy today; plenty of people desperately want to work but cannot
find the work, as the noble Lord, Lord Wigley, suggested about Wales.
It really is a major problem.</hs_para>

never heard him speak before, but he clearly understands all the
technical terminology, which I cannot claim to understand at all. The

hardest. That is true, because they are paying the biggest bit. Someone

people talk about the difficulty of having to choose whether to warm
the house or feed their children, surely food banks are better than
leaving your child hungry. I can see someone disagreeing with me, but
whatever I say, someone will disagree with me because there are two
definite views on this. However, we have to be realistic.</hs_para>

strongly supportive of old people having bus travel passes or of

in the local economy. According to the Office for Budget
Responsibility, the multiplier effect of changing benefit levels, for
good or ill, is twice that of personal tax allowances. So what is the
sense of taking money out of poor people’s pockets in order to
put some back into better-off people’s pockets in a way that is
less likely to keep the economic wheels turning? Again, a number of

the past five years have been an aberration. With the exception of a

now only 11% of average earnings compared with 18% in 1948 and 20% in

so many criticisms so well expressed, I say simply that disabled people
have suffered particular uncertainty and distress. Unfortunately, the
changes proposed to their benefits in the Bill add more uncertainty.
Yet, when announcing the Bill last year, the Chancellor said that he
would exempt some benefits for disabled people and carers from the 1%
cap on uprating. Indeed, the exceptions of disability living allowance
and the support component of employment and support allowance are to be
welcomed as an acknowledgement that disabled people need additional
protection in these difficult economic

these protections do not go far enough to protect disabled people who
have collectively experienced an estimated drop in income of
£500 million since the emergency Budget of 2010. The
reality is that measures in the Bill mean that many disabled people and
their carers will experience cuts in the support that is essential if
they are to cope with and overcome the barriers and extra costs that
they face as a result of their disabilities. A serious concern relates
to the changes around the employment and support allowance. The noble
Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, has already explained in detail how the
disabled will be left worse off. I will not repeat his excellent
analysis, except to remind your Lordships that these cuts could cost
disabled claimants between £63 and £88 per

previous occasions, I have spoken in the House about the difficulties
faced by those who suffer from dystonia. I declare an interest as
patron of the Dystonia Society. Dystonia is a neurological condition
which affects 70,000 adults and children in the UK. It causes
involuntary and sometimes very painful muscle spasms, and is
experienced by approximately 20% of disabled people with cerebral
palsy. Many sufferers receive employment and support allowance, and for
some that is essential support. Dystonia can be unpredictable, with

matters, I shall highlight three ways in which housing will be affected
by the 1% limit on benefit increases. First, the new 1% cap on
increases to local housing allowances—the housing benefit for
private sector tenants—will accentuate the reluctance of
landlords in the private rented sector to offer new tenancies or renew
existing tenancies to those who rely on benefits. The new cap on rent
increases on its own might not look significant but we have seen a
succession of limitations on local housing allowances and another one
is bound to affect landlord
attitudes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T20:37:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0003.htm#13021138000062">If
the landlord puts up the rent by more than the 1% limit for the local
housing allowance, the shortfall for the tenant to make up—the
gap between the actual rent to be paid and the amount received by way
of the allowance—will widen, taking more out of the
tenant’s meagre income that is needed for other costs. Of
course, as landlords will note, these extra pressures on
tenants’ incomes make rent arrears more likely. The last thing
that these landlords want is the hassle and expense of
evictions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T20:38:19"></hs_TimeCode>. I was
glad to note the special help through exemption from the 1% LHA cap for
areas with the highest rents. But, because of the reductions to other
benefits, a household in London is still likely to lose more than
£500. This obviously increases vulnerability to getting into
trouble with rental
payments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T20:38:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

hoped that the caps and ceilings they have already applied to their
support for housing costs would lead to private landlords lowering
rents accordingly. But in most areas—very prominently in London
and the south of England—rents have gone up instead. Last year,
they increased by 7% in London and 3.4% across England and Wales.
Landlords have been able to charge these rents because they can let to
tenants who are not in receipt of benefits. Because so many new
households in reasonably paid jobs are now unable to buy, landlords in
much of the country can choose to take in these better-off homeseekers
in place of those who need benefits.</hs_para>

incomes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T20:39:59"></hs_TimeCode> of those
in work do not keep up, more working households are requiring help with
housing costs. New figures from the Building and Social Housing
Foundation show that the proportion of housing benefits going to people
in work is rising significantly, and working households now account for
90% of all new claimants. Caps on local housing allowances, therefore,
affect the hard-working families whom the Government want to protect.
Discouraging private landlords from letting to those in receipt of

brings me to the second likely effect of the Bill: the adverse impact
on social housing. The decline in home ownership, and the resultant
ability of private 
<?notus-xml column=544?>landlords to choose to house those on rather higher incomes, magnifies
the importance of the social housing providers. However, I fear that
the Bill—not on its own but, as in the private sector, in
combination with other reductions in support for tenants—will
make things more difficult. A large proportion of housing association
and council tenants derive income from benefits due to fall in real
value for three years. If the gap between 1% and inflation,
particularly inflation of food and fuel prices, is modest, this extra
burden may not be too disastrous; if the gap is wide, as the noble
Lord, Lord Kirkwood, has set out, those affected will really be
struggling by year three. Even so, the 1% uplift is unlikely to be
catastrophic; rather, it is the cumulative impact of this latest cut,
on top of earlier reductions in help, which is likely to be pretty
devastating for several hundred thousand social housing tenants, and
therefore for their landlords,
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0003.htm#13021138000066">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T20:41:46"></hs_TimeCode>
detect a gradual awakening to the magnitude of the problem that one of
these changes will bring. This is the “underoccupation
penalty” for those deemed to have a spare room. I named this the
“bedroom tax” some 18 months ago and, although these
words have been strongly criticised, I stand by them. I will spare your
Lordships at this late hour another analysis of the truly awful
consequences for 660,000 social housing tenants of this penalty, levy
or tax. However, already I note that this measure is, understandably
but unfairly, turning tenants against their social landlords, who will
be required to collect the bedroom tax next April at an average of
£14 per week per household. The anxieties of these housing
providers about their ability to extract the money from hundreds of
thousands of tenants, some of whom may already be in debt, is
compounded by the knowledge that the Bill will mean that the real
income of many of their tenants is now destined to fall. Combine this
with the impending imposition of council tax at 20% to 30% for the same
people, and the financial position of social housing tenants, and
therefore of social housing, looks increasingly fragile. Throw in the
new regime for paying housing benefit in big monthly sums directly to
tenants, who face horrendous choices in juggling debts and spending on
very low incomes, instead of the benefit going straight to the
landlord, and the risk multiplies that rents do not get
paid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021138000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0003.htm#13021138000067">To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T20:43:24"></hs_TimeCode>

because arrears mount, and evictions and emergency housing cost a

money to support their local communities; to do all the preventive work
that helps families to get on; to regenerate the neighbourhoods where

the poorest half of the population has become poorer, with the poorest

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have taken
part in today’s debate. It is an issue about which all
participants feel passionately and I can well understand why. I will
try to respond to as many questions as possible, but let me begin by
reminding the House of the purpose of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T21:05:39"></hs_TimeCode>. As my
noble friend Lady Stowell pointed out in her opening speech, this
Government inherited an exceptional fiscal challenge. The financial
crisis of 2008-09 resulted in the largest deficit since the Second
World War and the UK experienced one of the deepest recessions of any
major economy. Even before the recession began, the UK had the highest
structural deficit of any country in the G7. This level of public
spending was simply not sustainable. There are still tough choices to
make. The savings from this Bill provide a significant contribution
towards delivering the savings needed to ensure that 
<?notus-xml column=551?>spending is on a sustainable path.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T21:06:24"></hs_TimeCode> is, of
course, never an easy decision to take action on welfare spending and I
understand only too well that the welfare system provides vital support
to millions of people. I also understand that while benefit rates will
rise in cash terms, they will be fall in real
terms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T21:06:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

times, people have seen significant restraints in their pay across the
public and private sectors. With welfare expenditure accounting for
£1 in every £4 spent, it is simply unrealistic to think
we can achieve the savings we need without taking further action on
welfare. We have already had to take tough decisions on welfare
spending in this Parliament, yet despite these, more than £200
billion was spent on welfare last year. Under the previous Government,
spending for working-age people and children increased by around
60%—equivalent to an extra £1,400 cost per household in
Great Britain. This is the context against which this Bill must be
judged<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T21:07:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

we believe are necessary limits in welfare spending, I cannot stress
enough that our motivation is not, to quote various noble Lords today,
to “demonise”, to “stigmatise”, to brand
the poor as undeserving, to impose a harsh ideology on them or to
divide and rule. It is simply to help—albeit
painfully—provide a sustainable platform for the public finances
and the economy going forward. This is something that every citizen of

who take that view, all I can say is that we simply cannot possibly
agree. For those who accept that we

Baroness for correcting me. In that case, and in view of her earlier
intervention, I think that what she and the noble Baroness, Lady
Sherlock, are saying is that the money will be raised from the
millionaires who, in their view, are getting a windfall benefit of
£3 billion. I believe that that is what both noble
Baronesses have said. But it is clear that either they have not read or
they do not believe the report from the Office for Budget
Responsibility which suggests that the impact of reducing the higher
rate of tax from 50% to 40% is probably £100 million and may be
negative. The Government therefore simply do not accept the figures
which have been quoted against us. The figure of £1 billion a
year to which I think the noble Baronesses have referred was based on
an HMRC static comparison. What we know only too well is that given the
chance of paying 40% or 50%, the rich—surprise,
surprise—change the way in which they order their affairs. There
is no pot of gold through a 50% tax rate. My view is that, frankly, the

measure progress on poverty. The most recent decrease in child
poverty—a fall of 300,000 in the number of children in relative
poverty in 2010—was due to the recession causing a fall in
median income and pushing the poverty line down. That is clearly
absurd, which is why we are consulting on a better measure of child
poverty, one that includes income but goes beyond it to tackle root
causes; for example educational failure, problem debt or
worklessness<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-11T21:18:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021143000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0003.htm#13021143000040">In
terms of how we tackle this issue, it is worth while looking at the
success of the previous Government in dealing with child poverty. In
the period 2003-04 to 2010, £170 billion was spent on tax
credits but there was little or no progress in reducing the levels of
child poverty. We in this Government want to look at some of these
basic issues around educational failure, problem debt and worklessness.
We recognise, as I am sure all noble Lords do, that education is one of
the key factors in getting poor children out of poverty. That is why
this Government are committed to providing additional funding for
disadvantaged pupils through the pupil premium, which will rise by
£2.5 billion a year by 2014-15. We are also spending £200
million extra in universal credit to support families with childcare
costs. For the first time, this support will be made available to
families who work fewer than 16 hours per week, which will mean that

also a major problem for poor families, who not only take out debt but
often take it out at extortionate rates of interest. That is why we are
putting in place stronger, more responsive regulation of unsecured
lending and other forms of consumer credit to ensure that borrowers are
protected and can be confident of getting a fair deal, and why we have
given the Financial Conduct Authority power to regulate loan sharks and

best route out of poverty. As my noble friend Lady Stowell set out at
the start of this debate, the Government are reforming the welfare
system to improve incentives for individuals to enter work. Universal
credit will not only improve the financial incentives offered for
people who want to work but will simplify the benefits system.
Replacing the main benefits with one single payment and removing the
complex system of hours rules and different tapers that currently exist
means that claimants will understand that they are better off getting a
job and increasing their hours. Under universal credit, 3.1 million
households will benefit by an average of £39 a week and up to
250,000 children will be taken out of poverty. Any household whose
migration to universal credit is initiated by the DWP will receive
transitional protection, and there will be no cash losers from the
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021143000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211-0003.htm#13021143000043">A

working-age recipients, many disabled people will also be claiming
benefits that include help towards everyday living expenses or housing
costs, but those benefits for the extra costs of disability are

households continue to make the greatest contribution towards reducing
the deficit as a percentage of their income and benefits in kind from

underlying principles behind the scheme continue to apply, i.e. that
additional support is given to help the most vulnerable with the extra
costs associated with heating the home during severe weather periods, a
further qualifying criterion has been introduced for recipients of
universal credit, which restricts access to those not in employment. An

further changes have been made to the funeral payment scheme. The first

payments will be made monthly, changes must be made to prevent any
final benefit arrears owing to the deceased from extinguishing an award
being made to the person taking responsibility for the funeral. The
second change removes council tax benefit from the list of qualifying
benefits that currently act as an initial gateway to the scheme

Senior Minister of State, Department for Communities
and Local Government &amp; Foreign and Commonwealth
Office (Baroness Warsi):</Member> Membership of the EU brings many
non-economic advantages. We have more influence in international
affairs because we are a powerful player in the EU. Membership acts as
a significant multiplier for our foreign policy—whether
implementing sanctions against Iran or Syria, or promoting democracy in
Burma. It helps us promote our values of freedom, democracy and the
rule of law beyond the EU’s borders, projecting security and
prosperity through both enlargement and a stable neighbourhood. It
provides many advantages to the British people, who can live, work,
study and retire anywhere in the
EU.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13021126000832" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211w0001.htm#13021126000832">EU:

Attlee:</Member> The Government are keen to make progress with the
project to deliver high speed rail in the UK and are looking to speed
up the timetable wherever possible. From 2026, when phase one opens,
rail passengers into Heathrow would start to benefit from significantly
faster journey times. This will mark a major improvement in rail access
to Heathrow compared with today. Passengers from the Midlands and north
will be able to access the Heathrow Express service from Old Oak Common
station, which will provide an 11 minute connection into the airport.
Rail journeys from the Midlands and the north will be as much as 50%
quicker, involve fewer changes and it will no longer be necessary to
travel via central London. This demonstrates the Government’s
continued support of the principle of integrating HS2 with our
country’s
airports.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021126000415" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130211w0001.htm#13021126000415">However,
in September 2012, the Government launched an independent Airports
Commission to identify and recommend options for maintaining the
country’s global hub status. The Airports Commission will take
into account the surface access implications of any options for
increasing the UK’s airport capacity. The Government have
therefore paused work on a dedicated spur to Heathrow until the

the Public Records Act 1958 usually requires the transfer of public

Lord Chancellors have since 1967 been satisfied that security and
intelligence information falls within the categories of information
that may be retained, and have signed a “security and
intelligence instrument” to approve this approach. The
“security and intelligence instrument” was most recently
renewed in December 2011 and applies until 31 December 2021. Before it
was renewed, assurances were provided by Ministers in other government
departments and those responsible for the records of other public
records bodies that this protection is necessary. It is for individual
bodies holding particular papers to decide whether they wish to rely on
the “security and intelligence instrument” to retain

Northover:</Member> The UN high level pledging conference in Kuwait on
30 January saw a significant increase in humanitarian pledges made for
Syria by the international community. In the lead up to the conference,
which was attended by the Secretary of State, the UK worked closely
with others to lobby the international community, to ensure that other
countries increase their efforts. I am pleased to note that Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, and the UAE each pledged $300 million, and the USA and
the EU also pledged significant amounts. The UK doubled its
humanitarian aid which now totals £139.5 million. This meant
that the UN target of $1.5 billion to provide urgent support to the
Syrian people from January to June 2013 was surpassed.</hs_para>

commission has the technical capacity to perform its functions but is
currently under-resourced financially and historically has suffered
from political

commission experiences particular challenges in overseeing the
Registrar General’s office which is responsible for the
registration of voters. The Registrar General has said there will be a
period of intensive voter registration using mobile registration
centres before the next elections. It will be essential that eligible
voters are able to access these registration centres, that they have
the necessary documentation, and that adequate oversight processes are
in place to ensure changes to the voters’ roll are processed
correctly. The commission is currently working with the Registrar
General's office to plan this registration
exercise.</hs_para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2013-02-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_11_PT_1/Index/FF69D78DB7D03F3290A8DF5CDE19EF30104BEB8B" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="18" cday="Monday" cmonth="February" cyear="2013" date="11" day="Monday" issue="111" maxparts="1" month="February" part="1" price="4@010c00" printing="daily" session="201213" volume="743" year="2013"><tocdate col="WS31">Monday 11 February 2013</tocdate><title>ALPHABETICAL
