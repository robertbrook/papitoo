interim guidance on the use of private maritime security companies in
December 2011. This was updated in June 2012 and is periodically
reviewed to ensure its relevance. The Government are working with
industry to establish a national accreditation system for this
industry; both stress the importance of compliance with international
maritime law, including the principle of self-defence, which provides

that response, but I am a little disappointed not to hear that it is
possible for us to ban altogether this independent commercial activity.
It is seriously prejudicial to the interests of, perhaps, formerly
redundant members of our services who find deliverance from their
predicament by joining, given the extreme hazard that they will

Warsi:</Member></B> My Lords, there are, of course, many members of the
Armed Forces who take part in private security companies, including
private maritime security companies: 90% of private maritime security
companies are based in London. We have led the international community
in providing the guidance and rules under which such companies can
operate. My noble friend will be aware that these companies operated
long before we issued the guidance; clearly, they now operate within a
system for which there is
guidance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T14:38:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

West of Spithead:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest that I
am involved with a maritime security company. I am glad to say that I
do it not because I am desperate for things to do, but because I feel
that it is an important thing to do. I am delighted to speak because,
710 years ago today, the first admiral was commissioned in our country.
That is rather nice. However, I would point out to the Minister that we
must really focus on, and produce, some clearer guidance. There is no
doubt that a large number of companies are now doing things which are
beyond the law, since it is quite difficult for them to meet the
requirements that are meant to be met. For example, the whole issue of
floating armouries is a very real problem. Could I ask the Minister to
push this issue much faster, because there will be an
occasion—as the noble Lord said—where people will be
getting into serious difficulties as a result of unintentionally
breaking our laws and international
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T14:39:28"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T14:39:28"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warsi" PimsId="5263" UID="13020416000342" xid="1971" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000342">Baroness
Warsi:</Member></B> The noble Lord speaks to this matter with great
experience, both in relation to his previous role and in terms of his
current role. He will be aware that these companies were operating
before we issued guidance; it was really a reaction and response to the
fact that they were predominantly operating out of the United Kingdom
that the guidance was issued. The guidance is quite detailed in terms
of the plans that they must set out and being responsive to the
necessary organisations that monitor this in the particular area that
they are in. The noble Lord will be aware, too, that international law
will apply in international  
<?notus-xml column=3?>waters. The law of the particular flagged ship will apply to that
particular vessel. For the companies that operate in that specific area
around Somalia and the Indian Ocean, there are specific rules on which
we have led in the

Chidgey:</Member></B> My Lords, with new companies employing in the
order of 2,700 armed guards to meet the surge in demand, costing the
international shipping community over $1 billion a year, does my noble
friend agree with the analysis that the current downturn in piracy is
temporary and that it will in time re-emerge from the Somali clans
unless irreversible progress is achieved in stability, security and the
rule of law? In that regard, what progress has been made since last

from a meeting. The president of Somalia is in the United Kingdom,
having discussions about progress that has been made since the Somalia
conference. My noble friend will be aware, too, that a follow-up
conference has been planned for later on this year. I have the
statistics somewhere in this great brief, but I can inform noble Lords
that numbers of successful piracy attempts in that region have gone
down dramatically. My noble friend is right that, ultimately, we need

obvious legal and bureaucratic problems that might arise. When will the

armouries. Noble Lords may not all be aware that these are,
effectively, vessels that sit outside of immediate country waters with
a view to providing a place where armed items can be transferred and
reused. We are currently consulting across Whitehall as to the best way
in which to operate. The noble Lord will be aware that Sri Lanka has a
specific example, whereby a ship which is used as a floating armoury
lies just outside their territory. I am sure that he and other noble
Lords will agree that to have such a vessel also increases concerns
about what may happen if it is taken

cope on their own? The reduction now has come about because of a
combined effort from the navies of NATO plus the private sector.
Therefore, are the Government not right in the way in which they have
approached this, working with the private sector and the merchant
marines? It is not the first time that that has happened—and

that it is also important that we work in the region to make sure that
these pirates are captured, properly prosecuted and subsequently

projects in rural areas tend to be small. Basically, they happen when
the land or housing is protected for rural people. The projects may be
small or larger, but they can be built under a number of systems; we
know that there is shared ownership, social rent, affordable rent and
intermediate rent, so there should be a reasonable spread across the
country.</hs_para>

broadening of the Question put by my noble friend Lord Knight. However,
does she not realise that in rural areas particularly, affordability is
a question of income as well as of the availability of housing? This is
particularly true in areas such as the south-west, where the ratio
between house prices and incomes is at its worst. Therefore, will she
address holistically the problem of affordable housing in areas such as
the south-west by having a coherent regional housing policy which
allows people to live in the villages in which they were

Centrica’s withdrawal has nothing to do with confidence in
nuclear; its priorities are currently different. Cumbria County
Council’s decision is, of course, disappointing but we welcome
the very positive votes from the borough councillors of Copeland and
Allerdale, which show that there are places that are willing to go on
to the next phase. It is not an indicator that nuclear is dead: it is

raise the work done on thorium. We maintain an interest in the global
potential of thorium and have, for the longer term, commissioned a
wider analysis of nuclear fuel cycle scenarios which are open to the
UK, among which is the reactor design fuelled by molten thorium salts.
However, previous studies show that there are still significant risks
to resources to develop thorium fuel to commercial deployment. In these
difficult economic times, we need to concentrate on potential
technologies that compete for the same investment but may have a
sounder outcome than thorium currently

may have missed the point made by my noble friend Lord Foulkes.
Centrica has withdrawn from the UK nuclear programme—the
third  
<?notus-xml column=9?>company to do so, as E.On and RWE have also pulled out. It is all very
well for the noble Baroness to say, on the issue of thorium, that we

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Baroness perhaps missed the
first part of my response, in which I stated that the two questions
posed by the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, were two separate issues. Coming
back to Centrica’s withdrawal, it has not withdrawn because it
has no confidence in new nuclear but because of its own commercial
priorities. However, significant progress is being made, and the noble
Baroness will be aware that, in the last quarter of last year alone,
the sale of Horizon to Hitachi and the granting of the first nuclear
site in 25 years at Hinckley Point C happened. I would not be as
pessimistic as the noble Baroness is being about nuclear, which is of
course part of our low-carbon energy mix but not the only
part.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_04_PT_1/EC70F83D6AB2E53CDC32D6ACC6ED00539AA01E51" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 February 2013">Monday,

mitigating risk as a result of this whole episode. Can the Minister,

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, I am afraid that this is a
somewhat technical amendment, but I will do my best to explain what is
intended in concise and accessible language. Clause 20 is about
enabling projects that were authorised under the various major
infrastructure consent regimes that preceded the Planning 
<?notus-xml column=13?>Act 2008 to go ahead without also requiring authorisation under the
Planning Act in the form of a development consent order. It deals with
cases where a developer’s plans for a project have changed and
they need to have the original consent varied or replaced to take
account of that change. We want to make it absolutely clear that in
such a case, the variation or replacement of the original
consent—for example, planning permission under the Town and
Country Planning Act 1990—is all that is needed. The developer
will not need to start again from scratch and apply for a development
consent order under the Planning Act 2008 if they already have a
validly varied or replaced consent under the relevant pre-Planning Act
regime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000066">The
reason for making the amendment is that new Section 237A, which Clause
20 would insert into the Planning Act, would still potentially leave
projects authorised under pre-Planning Act legislation having to apply
in some cases for a development consent order under the Planning Act.
For example, the new section would not remove the need for a
development consent order in a situation where a project had been built
and it was necessary to make changes to the conditions of its original
planning permission relating to operational matters. This seems wrong.
As an additional benefit, the amendment also simplifies the drafting of
new Section 237A of the Planning Act. I beg to

72 refers to the fact the Planning Act regime was supposed to give a
one-stop shop for major projects. The problem is that there is still a
large number of prescribed consents that may be disapplied only by a
development consent order with the permission of the body that would
otherwise be responsible for granting that consent. If that
body’s permission cannot be obtained, one has to go for separate
consents, which add to the time and cost of the

Michael Pitt, who is chief executive of the Planning Inspectorate, said
only two weeks ago at a conference that 40% of the required consents

that the Committee will agree. This amendment removes the requirement
in Section 150 to obtain a consenting body’s permission and
replace it with an obligation to consult that body in any case where
the promoter intends to include in the draft DCO a provision
disapplying a consent for which that body is responsible. This would
mean a case-by-case approach, and if the consenting body had concerns
about the disapplication, it could object. This would be an interesting
and useful way of simplifying the process for those bodies that are
happy to do it. I hope that that is a sufficient introduction to this

75ZA is not supported by the organisations that I mentioned earlier.
This is not because they oppose it; they have not been asked

<?notus-xml column=15?>I thought it might be useful to raise this issue, and it
comes in this group. It comes out of a discussion that a number of
colleagues have recently had about the increase in heavy goods vehicle
movements to major construction sites. In so far as this affects rail,
I declare an interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group. It also
affects water. If you look big projects that have been built and that
are being planned at the moment, some have done extremely well in
reducing the amount of road traffic to and from the sites, and some
have done pretty badly. The construction of terminal 5 was probably the
best in terms of non-road movements; it had several consolidation
centres away from the site and brought everything in by rail. The
Olympics at Stratford were not bad: a lot of material went by
rail and some of it went by water. The Thames tideway
tunnel, which your Lordships have debated at some length and no doubt
will debate again, started off by driving away by road all the spoil
from the excavation of that enormous tunnel wherever the sites on the
Thames were. That was about 500 trucks a day. When I suggested that it
should be sent by water, I was told that the river was too congested.
However, if you look outside today, you are lucky to see a ship going
past every few minutes. There is more to it, sadly, because with some
of the big developments that are now taking place, usually on the south
bank of the Thames, a lot of work could be done to take the spoil away
by river, with short road or conveyor-belt journeys if
necessary.</hs_para>

project, and back on nuclear I am afraid, Sizewell is one of those
which look likely to go ahead with EDF. The latest rough calculation of
the number of trucks required to go in and out of that site every day
is about 300. As some noble Lords will know, the roads around Sizewell
are not very good for that number. In addition, if the promoter, EDF,
was able instead to send more of the goods by water, sea and rail, it
could also bring some of the workers in by rail by improving the
railway lines. There are benefits there as well. The suggestion is to
require those who are applying to those granting development consent to
include in their applications a report on the feasibility of using
water and rail transport. It may not always be possible, but it will at
least make people think about it. I shall be interested to hear what
the Minister has to say in his reply when we get

Amendment 75ZAA. The new subsection (2) proposed in the amendment would
insert new subsections into Section 4 of the Planning Act 2008 on fees.
There is a bit of a problem over how the infrastructure planning
commission calculates its fees. It is worrying for those who are making
an application because if they do not pay the fees, they will not make
any progress with their applications. You either pay it if you want
this, or you do not pay it. The real problem here is that the fees are
set out in the Infrastructure Planning (Fees) Regulations 2010, which
provide that PINS may charge for each day in which the examining
authority examines the
application,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13020416000297" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000297">“in

completion of the
examination”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13020416000259" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000259">The
problem is whether it charges five days a week from when it
starts to when it finishes or charges only for 
<?notus-xml column=16?>the actual days worked by the examining authority, not by all the staff
underneath, but just the examining authority. It makes quite a lot of
difference to the fees. I do not know what the solution is, but there
have been examples when one examining authority has been
known to be examining two applications at the same time. If you are
charging for what you are doing on a daily rate, that does
not seem quite right. We have had discussions with the noble Baroness,
and I know that this is something that the Government are
looking at. However, it needs some pretty detailed investigation so
that applicants know what they are going to be up to and have some
confidence that the examining authority has been able to demonstrate
that the money that has been spent, and the hours and days worked, are
on their
project.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13020416000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000077">The
last part of the amendment concerns national policy statements. I am
afraid that the amendment responds to the Department for
Transport’s failure to bring forward the National Networks NPS,
which is supposed to cover railways, the strategic road network and
strategic rail freight interchanges. I am not going to go into why
these are necessary. Given that the cost of applications for these
facilities can go into tens of millions of pounds or more, the more
comfort that these companies can have—especially when they are
private sector companies—the better.</hs_para>

promised to be published for consultation in October 2009. That is over
three years ago. It has been repeatedly delayed and it is not thought
to be coming any time soon. In fact, at some stage applicants have been
told that they may never see it. At a recent Enterprise Forum event,
the Secretary of State for Transport said that an NPS covering roads
and rail is “far from imminent”. I am not sure how many
years “far from imminent” is in government-speak, but it
is years not months, as the Department for Transport prefers to
concentrate on specific projects. I find this depressing and
discouraging. If the department is going to go back to its old ways of
10 or 20 years ago of keeping roads in one box and railways in another
and then saying, “Oh dear, they don’t meet in the
middle”, it is a step backwards. I hope when he responds the
Minister can give us some comfort that I have got it all wrong and it
is actually going to happen very quickly so we can all be excited and
welcome it. I will leave the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, to carry on.

this in context for the House. We are addressing the need for national
infrastructure. This is now widely accepted. It is not sufficient to
talk about it and to produce lists of things that could be done. One
has got to get ahead with it. Much of the Bill—and I welcome
this—is clearly directed to that end; to try to remove some of
the barriers, speed up the timetables, reduce the bureaucracy that has
been involved, and in every way help those who are contemplating
substantial infrastructure investment to achieve their objectives, of
course while protecting important environmental and other interests.

set up by the Planning Act 2008, which was originally the
Infrastructure Planning Commission and now is part of the Planning
Inspectorate. Sir Michael Pitt and his colleagues deserve our very warm
thanks for the readiness with which they switched the
commission’s role from being an independent agency, with the
power to make decisions, to becoming part of the inspectorate, with the
decisions having to be made be Ministers. The democratic legitimacy of
that was very obvious but they accepted it without question and are

that we are going to need a national policy statement for shale gas? A
large number of different government departments are going to be
involved if that industry is to move from the exploratory to the

the anxiety about the sheer volume of paper that EDF had to submit for
its development at Hinkley

heard that it had to submit 45,000 pages—there must be ways of

of dealing with that could be to improve the pre-application process.
There is a strict timetable once the application has been lodged with
the Planning Inspectorate. The target is that an applicant should get a
decision within 12 months. But it is in the pre-application stage that
applicants are expected to consult very widely with a range
of interests. Of course, with a big project such as Hinkley Point, this
is of enormous importance. From my knowledge of the case, it has been
conducted extremely thoroughly by EDF and its contractor Arriva, but it
can drag on and on. Amendment 75ZAA suggests that there should be some
oversight of the pre-application stage. The Planning
Inspectorate—which is always knows as PINS—should be
involved in that, to help and advise both the applicant and the
consulted bodies and individuals on the best way of doing this, and to
set a reasonable timetable of how it might be achieved. So far this has
not happened. There may be some informal contacts, but what is looked
for here is a legislative imprimatur for such a process, to keep the
pre-application stage under control. I hope the Government will be
prepared to consider
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000085">We

can perhaps cover the other proposed new subsections more briefly. If
we could achieve the pre-application programme management and oversight
mentioned, there would be a shorter period and lower costs.
Applications would not be over-egged or gold-plated, as I think
happened with the Hinkley Point application and have been told also
happened with others. It would improve the process of engagement by
local authorities and other statutory consultees, and reduce the risk
of applications having to be withdrawn or being long drawn out during
subsequent stages. All this would help make the whole process more
efficient.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000087">Finally,
there is the question of waivers. There should be a procedure whereby
the Secretary of State may recognise that some of the processes or
requirements are irrelevant to a particular application by an
applicant, and can be waived. The applicant would then not have to go
through the process of submitting documents and evidence for matters
which are really quite irrelevant. It is perhaps strange that such a
procedure does not exist already, but this amendment includes such a
requirement. People have to put all sorts of things into application
documents: a land plan, a works plan, an access plan, an ecological
plan, a heritage plan and a Crown land plan, separately or in
combination. However, the fact is that an application may already

seems to me that in this case the system could again be improved. It
has been a good system, and it has been widely admired and taken up.
When I looked at the website over the 
<?notus-xml column=19?>weekend there were 101 applications currently under consideration by
PINS using the new procedure, and there will be many more. However, it
needs to be improved and speeded up, and this is an opportunity for us
to do that. I hope Ministers will respond positively to some of these
issues.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_04_PT_1/1F4363E4F856AD55764521E715B712CCDD604000" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 February 2013">Monday,

noble friend Lord Berkeley and supported by the noble Lord, Lord
Jenkin. When the previous Government introduced what they said was a
national planning agreement in 2008, many of us said, “About
time, too”. The problem with major projects in this country is
the length of time that they take. Any way of shortening that time
taken, without withdrawing people’s democratic right to make
proper objections, is to be welcomed. When the 2008 Act was passed, one
of my perhaps more cynical colleagues said, “It’ll never
happen”. Once you try to shorten the procedures, you immediately
deprive the legal profession, to name but one group, of the
opportunity—how does one put this as kindly as
possible?—to spin out the process for as long as possible. It

restated virtually the same matters day after day, month after month

kind enacted for that project. We were anxious to see as much of the

My noble friend mentioned various other projects; he did not mention
Crossrail during his speech on the amendment. I am sure that he would

the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, to Sir Michael Pitt, who is
doing an excellent job of public service as chief executive of the
Planning Inspectorate—and did so in his previous work at the
Infrastructure Planning Commission. However, in the present economic
downturn where businesses are under so much pressure, the Planning
Inspectorate, like other parts of the public service, should seek to
keep its costs and charges down to an absolute minimum. That is the
first important issue raised in the amendments in the name of my noble
friend Lord Berkeley and the noble Lord, Lord

key issue in the first amendment in this group is to do with the basis
on which PINS calculates fees for the processing of development consent
order applications. The fees are set out in the Infrastructure Planning
(Fees) Regulations 2010, which provides that PINS may charge for each
day on which the examining authority examines the application in the
period beginning with the start date and ending with the completion
date of the examination. This provision has given rise to uncertainty
as to whether PINS is entitled to charge a fee only for the actual days
worked on the development consent order by the examining authority or
for each day of the examination period, irrespective of the days on
which the examining authority may have worked on the
application.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000096">PINS
has adopted the second of these interpretations, which is hardly
surprising because that gives it a larger income and of
course it is under great pressure from the Government to maximise its
private income so that it is less dependent on
the department. However, it seems that any reasonable interpretation of
the fees that should be paid by promoters would lead one to conclude
that they should pay only for the actual days worked on the
development consent order by the examining authority. This is not a
minor matter. I talked about the issue with the National Infrastructure
Planning Association, which told me that for larger projects fees run
into hundreds of thousands of pounds and that even for smaller
projects, were the interpretation that fees would be payable only for
actual days worked by the examining authority rather than the entire
examining authority period, savings to developers of £20,000 or
£30,000 might not be

measurement relates to work done rather than just the clock ticking,

second issue raised by my noble friend is about consents that cannot be
disapplied by a development consent order without the consent of the
relevant body. My noble friend cited Sir Michael Pitt who said recently
that 40% of the required consents were outside the development consent
order regime, even though—as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin,
said—the Planning Act regime was intended to be a unified
authorisation process and therefore a one-stop shop for the
construction of major infrastructure. The issue here is whether to do
as my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, wish—that
is, remove the requirement to obtain the consent of bodies such as the
Environment Agency and Natural England in respect of their permissions
and replace that simply with a right for them to be
consulted—would lose essential safeguards for essential
interests. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about
that issue because it seems to be the fundamental point at stake. My
understanding is that a new consent service is being set up by the
Planning Inspectorate which should help in this respect and that
recently reissued guidance to promoters about development consent
orders sets out a stronger onus on consenting bodies to consider
including consents in the development consent order regime. I look
forward to hearing from the Minister whether he thinks that is likely

issue of fees—this was raised by several noble Lords, including
the noble Lord, Lord Adonis—addressed by proposed new subsection
(1) of Amendment 75ZAA. This amendment would restrict the ability of
the Secretary of State to set appropriate fees for applications for
nationally significant infrastructure projects. The Planning
Inspectorate’s fees are currently set out in regulations, which
include provision for day-rate charges that depend on the make-up of
the examining authority. There is a smaller charge for cases where a
single inspector is the examining authority and larger charges for
panels of inspectors. These fees are intended to cover the work of the
Planning Inspectorate, which supports the examination, including staff
working in case management, case administration, environmental
services, legal services and other relevant costs of the inspectorate,
including those incurred during the recommendation stage, for which no
separate fee is charged. This amendment would narrow the ability of the
Secretary of State to set appropriate fees to reflect the costs of the
application<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T15:56:56"></hs_TimeCode>.
This would, in effect, mean that the taxpayer would have to further
subsidise the service that the Planning Inspectorate provides for
nationally significant infrastructure projects. I strongly support the
“user pays” principle in relation to major infrastructure

significant infrastructure pay a reasonable fee for their planning
applications. I would not want to curtail the ability to charge
reasonable fees.</hs_para>

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> As I mentioned earlier, we have
already said that there are specific fees which are charged for
specific projects, so if a single inspectorate is being asked to look
at that, that will be clear in the fee structure. Similarly, if there
is a bigger application where a range of inspectors are involved, that
will also be transparent. I also highlighted the issue of the day rate,
which I mentioned earlier in my speech. In effect, all we are doing is
highlighting the issue of transparency, which was mentioned earlier.
The statutory instrument will address that point: it will outline the
Government’s policy clearly. Again, I refer the noble Lord to
what I said earlier about day rates also being charged as part of this
policy.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T15:58:07"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T15:59:27"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

instrument clarify whether an inspector can charge two separate
applicants for a day rate on the same day? Obviously, it is right that

paying the same costs on the same day for the same inspector. Let us

Government’s policy on different forms of infrastructure,
helping to speed up the examination phase and guiding the

Subsection (4) raises similar issues and proposes to allow developers
the option of obtaining a “waiver” of certain procedures
in the major infrastructure regime, subject to the discretion of the
Secretary of State. I appreciate that the noble Lord has brought
forward a more tightly drawn amendment in Amendment 75ZAA than the
original proposition in Amendment 75. However, the amendment continues
to capture a wide range of Planning Act 2008 requirements and would
provide developers with an opportunity to seek waivers against many of
the key elements of the major infrastructure planning process. This
would potentially undermine the certainty and transparency of the
regime. It is also not clear exactly what parts of the nationally
significant infrastructure regime developers would want to see a waiver
used for. As was indicated by my noble friend, while we remain in

Adonis:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord for
the marathon that he has run with such fortitude. I hope
that I may return to the fees charged by PINS. Having reflected on what
the noble Lord said, I think that he made a dramatic statement which
did not contain a great policy shift. I understood the Minister to say
that the order which will be prepared later this year will
be transparent about the number of inspectors—I stress, the
number of inspectors—who are engaged in examining a DCO
application. I understand that there is not much difficulty in finding
this out and that developers are well aware of the number of inspectors
in respect of their application. The issue is not the number of
inspectors, it is the number of days on which they are engaged on the
application, which they are able to charge for. That is a distinctly
different point. If the order simply requires transparency on the
number of inspectors, there will be no effective change from the status
quo. The essential issue is whether developers and applicants are being
charged excessively for the work being undertaken by the
inspectorate.</hs_para>

noble Lord back to my earlier point: Planning Inspectorate fees are
currently set out in regulations which include provision for day-rate
charges which depend on the make up of the examining
authority—that was the point I was making—but there is
something within them specific to day rates. Current practice and

it becomes as to what the actual change will be, if, indeed there will
be any change whatever in the statutory instrument he refers to. If it
simply re-expresses the status quo, what is the purpose of producing it

infrastructure projects are, of their very nature, complex and involve
large numbers of interested persons. All such projects are listed in

scheme, which perhaps covers a substantial geographical area and a lot
of different interests, may be expected, not unreasonably, to use its
best endeavours to notify to all interested parties, having a criminal
sanction is going a step too far. The Compulsory Purchase Association
certainly feels that the provision is an impediment and stands in the
way of getting these things done in a timely manner, while everyone
carries out their due diligence in order to try to make sure that there

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government have today laid before the
House the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill, and their response
to the report of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards
that was published on 21 December last year,
following the commission’s pre-legislative
scrutiny of the Bill. I thank and pay tribute to the members
of both the Independent Commission on Banking and the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards. The two commissions, whose membership
comprises some of the most distinguished policymakers and formidable
intellects in the world, have between them shaped a set of reforms to
British banking that will lead the world and set an example to other
countries in the seriousness, radicalism and meticulousness of the
changes that are
proposed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:29:56"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Bill that is published today reflects their painstaking work, and the
Government have accepted almost all their
recommendations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:30:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000159">The
reforms address what the Chancellor has called the British dilemma: how
Britain can be a leading global financial centre, with more than its
share of international trade in financial services, while at the same
time not exposing the ordinary working people of this country to the
catastrophic risks of banks failing. These reforms were, and are,
necessary. The previous regime was tested and failed. UK taxpayers had
to bail out the banks with £65 billion of the hard-earned money
of ordinary working people, while those who had taken a one-way bet
with their money slunk away, losing nothing more than their
job—and sometimes not even
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:30:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000160" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000160">The
anger that the country feels about what happened must be channelled
into change, to reset Britain’s banking system. The objective of
the Bill proposed by Vickers and endorsed by the commission is that any
failure of any bank in future should not impose a cost on the taxpayer,
and not interrupt for a second vital banking services. That is a high
ambition, but one that is appropriate for a country with a reputation
for financial stability and confidence that has for centuries been one
of Britain’s chief assets in the
world<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:31:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000161" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000161">As
is well known, the Bill will erect a ring-fence around the core
operations of banks headquartered and regulated in the UK. Within that
ring-fence, banks must be completely insulated from
activities such as using depositors’ funds to speculate for the
banks’ own benefit in capital markets. In the event of failure,
depositors will be given preference in liquidation. As a result of the
commission’s recommendations, the Government are
making a number of further changes to the Bill. First, in the
honourable Member for Chichester’s acute phrase, which will
permanently enter the lexicon of banking, the ring-fence will be
electrified. The regulator will be given the power to order the full
separation of any bank that attempts to undermine the ring-fence. The
directors of the banks will be personally responsible for ensuring that
their banks comply with the ring-fencing rules, and the Prudential
Regulation Authority will conduct an annual review of the operation and
adequacy of the ring-fence
rules<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:32:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

explicit provisions in the Bill for the principal aspects of
ring-fencing, including that there should be separate boards of
directors, remuneration arrangements and human resource management, for
ring-fenced banks. Thirdly, the Bill gives us an opportunity to make an
historic change in the competitive environment of UK banking.
Competition is essential to ensure that customers benefit from
innovation, extracting customer service and efficiency from their
banks. That has not always been the experience of customers in the
past. As well as bringing in a seven-day automatic account-switching
service from September this year, the Government will take steps to
tackle the cosy arrangement whereby the biggest banks determine how
payment systems will be run. Why should it be necessary in 2013 for a
cheque to take six days to clear, with banks and not customers scooping
up the interest on balances during this delay? Why should a new bank
have to beg an incumbent bank for permission to use the payments
system? We will require access arrangements to payments systems that
are fair, reasonable and
transparent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:33:34"></hs_TimeCode>. The
commission has, rightly, emphasised the importance of competition. I am
grateful to it for propelling this drive further, as I am to my
honourable friend the Member for South Northamptonshire, for whom
greater competition in banking has been a personal
crusade<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:33:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000163">The
fourth change is that more parliamentary scrutiny will be built into
the secondary legislation that implements this high-level Bill. Drafts
of the principal statutory instruments to be made will be available to
the House before Second Reading. The Government accept the
recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
on the type of scrutiny each should

are historic reforms, but they are appropriate for our country, and for
an industry in which, directly and indirectly, 2 million people work.
It is our biggest export earner and contributes £1 in every
£8 of our tax revenue. We should take the steps necessary to
restore confidence in and to an industry in which it has fallen so far.
There is much scrutiny of the Bill before us, both here and in the
other place. I look forward very much to our discussions in the weeks
and months ahead.</hs_para>

Davies of Oldham:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Lord for repeating the response to the Urgent Question but I am
appalled that this issue is being tackled as an Urgent Question. It
means that this House has merely 10 minutes to consider the matter.
Surely on this issue—the most significant piece of legislation
that will go before the two Houses relating to an industry that has
been at the centre of the greatest crisis in many years—there
should have been a Statement in the other place. Why was it a junior
Treasury Minister who made the Statement and not the

is indicative that the Government would like to water things down. They
have done that from the beginning. When the Vickers commission
reported, the Government’s first reaction was to set about
watering down its recommendations, by allowing, for instance, the
reduction of the advised leverage ratio. When the Joint Committee of
the two Houses proposed to electrify 
<?notus-xml column=34?>the ring-fence, the Government’s first reaction was to refuse to
commit to it. As we see today, they have significant reservations about
it. They have produced only a partial
climbdown.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000167">Does
the Minister agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, who is in her
place? I apologise if am pre-empting what she might say but I will have
no other opportunity in this debate. She is the economics spokesperson
for the Minister’s party. She believes that attempting to limit
the procedure to individual banks will effectively tie up the sanction
in years of complex litigation. That is why we endorse her viewpoint;
it is ours, too, that this should be legislation. The back-stop power
should apply to all
banks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000168">Is it
not vital that the Government make up their mind shortly and include a
reserve power in this Bill for full separation of retail and investment

Opposition have asked for. I believe that is what the noble Baroness,
Lady Kramer, is asking for. It is certainly what the parliamentary
commission indicated in its report and I fail to see why the Government
are not more responsive in an area that they must know causes the
greatest anxiety to the British people. The Government must look
closely at this, and be determined, clear and effective, and not
wishy-washy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000169"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13020416000433" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000433">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I smile with amusement when the noble
Lord accuses the Government of not taking this issue seriously. When
his party was in his power, and we and I suggested to it and him that
they do exactly that, we were told that it was irrelevant to the
problems that we were facing and that we should definitely not do it. I
will certainly not take any lessons from him about the importance of
this issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000170">As
for whether the legislation should include reserve powers to implement
full separation across the sector, this was put to the Governor of the
Bank of England, who said that he did not want such reserve powers.
More importantly, general reserve powers would give huge power outwith
Parliament to tear up the provisions of the Bill as we envisage it, and
fundamentally change some of the ways that we see it working. The
Government think that if you got to the point where that was a
possibility, or you wanted those powers, the appropriate way to do it
would be to come back to Parliament, rather than leaving it to the
regulator to exercise what would be very sweeping powers
indeed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000171" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000171"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Kramer" PimsId="5891" UID="13020416000434" xid="2104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000434">Baroness

choice. Will the Government look seriously at splitting up some of the
major banks, especially those in which we have ownership? I have not
read the Statement but can he comment on whether Chancellor or the

Newby:</Member></B> On the second point, the Government’s view
is that, as a general rule, we support the level proposed by Basel III
and do not want the UK to be out of line with what is happening
elsewhere in the global banking community. As my noble friend knows,
the Government and I completely share her views about the importance of
competition. As a first step, it is very important that we see rapid
progress when it comes to those branches that, for example, RBS is
supposed to be divesting itself of but which so far have not been
divested. That is one step towards the greater competition that she
seeks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:40:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000174" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000174"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Martin of Springburn" PimsId="5460" UID="13020416000436" xid="2012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000436">Lord

our friendly societies, which were excellent self-help groups and were

were gobbled up by these banks? There are far too many young couples

Lord’s support for the mutual sector. It is interesting that,
over the past couple of years, the mutual sector has been doing very
well: Nationwide and the Co-op have been growing rapidly, which we very
much welcome. We also welcome some of the specific decisions that have
been taken by banks such as Nationwide, under which people who want a
mortgage will get preferential treatment if they have had an account

is it not important that we electrify the loopholes as well as the

are having full ring-fencing and whether we are electrifying the
loopholes, I think, to take the analogy on, that if you have a proper,
electrified ring-fence, there are no loopholes. First, the aim of the
electrified ring-fence is to set up a very robust system. Secondly, the
electrification not only allows the bank that has transgressed to be
dealt with but will act as a very severe deterrent to prevent banks

Berkeley:</Member></B> Amendment 75ZAB stands in my name and in the
name of the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine. This amendment comes out of
a fairly recent discovery about some new roads that have received
permissions under development consent orders. If the developer wishes
to put a charge or toll on them then, for some reason, it has to be a
fixed-toll plaza, with lots of toll booths and the old fashioned things
that one sees on motorways in France, on the M6 toll, and the Dartford
crossing. It seems rather odd that a developer who seeks planning
permission to build a toll road needs to be told as part of getting
consent that if he is going to put a toll or a charge on it then it has
to be a fixed-toll point. It seems to me that that has very little to
do with planning—except for the planning permission of the
site—and that the method of tolling should come out of a policy
from the Department for Transport. I have had a useful meeting with
officials on it.</hs_para>

should now have a policy on tolling. I do not mean which roads should
be tolled and which ones should not be because that is a separate
issue. We have the London congestion charge, we have tolls for the
Dartford tunnel and for the Birmingham northern relief road, and we
have lorry road-user charging coming in. The lorry road-user charging
is going to be time-based rather than distance-based, which is odd.
Nobody else in Europe is going time-based but that is probably why we
are. Worse still, if these all move forward, you are going to have to
have separate equipment in your car or lorry for each area, road,
tunnel or bridge that you wish to use because I suspect that more and
more of the crossings that now have toll booths will wish to convert to
taking money while you are on the move because it is so much easier and
cheaper and, of course, it is quicker for the person paying.</hs_para>

Noble Lords will correct me if I am wrong but the cost of collection of
the congestion charge in London is something like 30% of the amount you
pay. With some of the modern electronic systems used in other cities
and some motorways on the continent, you are getting down to about 5%,
which means that the developer keeps more of his money. One hopes that
one day the Department for Transport, maybe in its new roads policy
which we were told about earlier in the Committee stage, will come up
with a policy on tolling. That should include one system for the whole
country—one technical system—that you can have in your
car. That means a common technology and it would be much better if it
was common throughout Europe. Then it would be up to the developers,
the Government or whoever to decide what rate should be charged for
using whatever facility you need. We want to get away from the idea
that if you are getting consent for a particular crossing or something
with a development consent order, it has to specify the type of toll
booth, which seems to be a rather retrograde step. I look forward to

way of missing the congestion that can be found around spaghetti
junction and the Ray Hall viaduct, the elevated section of the
M6—until one reaches the toll booths, where we have this
medieval concept of queuing to pay, the sort of thing one did with a
horse and cart centuries ago. Invariably, I find myself behind someone
who has got in the wrong lane, or someone who does not have the right
money or cannot find their credit card, and a lot of the time saved by
using the toll road is lost as one queues to get through this barrier.

because that damages its motorway. It is no accident that the bit of
motorway infrastructure regularly under repair anywhere in the country

one, on which I hope the noble Lord can give the Committee comfort. It
is as simple as whether it is possible to have a tolling regime without
having to have toll booths. The reason the issue has come to the fore
is the Silvertown tunnel proposal. TfL, quite rightly, does not want to
have toll booths, but the legal position is unclear. TfL tells me the
issue is whether the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 or the Greater
London Authority Act is the relevant legal basis for tolling. If it is
the one, then there is not a need for booths; if it is the other, then
there might be. I think we all agree on what the public policy

Berkeley, makes a persuasive case in favour of amending Section 144(3)

developers wishing to include road charging provisions within the
development consent order and to remove unnecessary additional
processes and restrictions from the major infrastructure regime. While
I cannot comment on the detail of individual cases, I share his
commitment to ensuring the delivery of the crucial infrastructure that
this country needs to support vital growth and jobs. I also agree with
him that it is important that we take the opportunity to ensure that
the provisions of the Planning Act 2008 are fit for purpose and are not
inadvertently acting as a barrier to growth. This is therefore an area

75A and 75B to Clause 22 are intended to preserve the possibility of
special parliamentary procedure in relation to compulsory acquisition
of land of certain types of transport statutory undertakers. Clause 22
relates to Section 128 of the Planning Act 2008, which
provides for development consent orders authorising the compulsory
acquisition of land of local authorities and statutory undertakers to
be subject to special parliamentary procedure. As currently drafted,
Clause 22 would repeal the whole of Section 128. The
amendments would instead remove the reference to local authorities and
the general reference to statutory undertakers in that section and
restrict its application to land of harbour and railway undertakers.
These are providers of infrastructure for public benefit, and it is
important that land required for these purposes should continue to
enjoy the additional level of protection which this procedure confers.
Since Section 128 is not to be repealed in its entirety, Section 129 of
the Planning Act, which relates to the operation of Section 128, will
continue to need to apply. Amendment 75A would also remove its
repeal.</hs_para>

special parliamentary procedure is still to apply under Section 128 of
the Planning Act in relation to land of transport undertakers, it
should be subject to the same limitations. These amendments would

compulsory purchase treat the CRT with greater respect and encourages
constructive discussion. It claims that if the Bill is passed, the CRT
will lose the right to request an SPP. Will the Minister confirm

at limiting the scope of what is meant by “open space”.
They do this by a very simple process. An open space, for the purposes
of this clause—and I am not referring to some of the earlier
clauses that we discussed—would be limited to land which has
been formally designated as open space by the responsible local
authority. All important pieces of open land are officially and
formally designated by the local authority, but they cannot cover every
single piece of open land. For instance, where there is a road junction
in a village with a triangle of open land in the middle of it and
somebody wants to improve the road system and would require some of it,
in theory that could be open to the SPP because it would belong to the
local authority. However, it would never have been designated as open
land that way. There are pieces of open land where boys are accustomed
to go and kick a football around, but no local authority has ever
thought it necessary for that to be formally designated. It just
happens to be there; but why should an important road or other
development be held up simply because there happens to be a procedure
which is triggered by the fact that there is a compulsory purchase of
open land?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000218" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000218">My

another point, he referred to this as essentially our “most

about the informal bits of land, land that happens to be open land but

what the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, said about the threat of a

question of whether the Secretary of State is making a reasonable
judgment on what is in the public interest is clearly judicially
reviewable. That is the constraint in here which means that it is poor

are other reasons why Clause 22 is undesirable. As the noble Lord said,
there have been very few references to or uses of special parliamentary
procedure. Once again in this Bill, the Government come forward wanting
to do something without providing any clear evidence of why it is
necessary. The first thing that the Minister has to try to do is to
give us some evidence of why this is necessary in the real world, not
of why, in some theoretical future, there might be a problem or two,

purposes of public recreation. When it is threatened with compulsory

were mapped for access under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act

the amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, produce a
new definition of open space, which is that it has to be designated by
local authorities in addition to, and over and above land designated in

considerable new duties on local authorities to make sure that they

authorities, is not the way forward. It would be vague and confusing,
and to put out a new definition of open space just for this purpose

lead also to lots of judicial review. The noble Lord, Lord

Berkeley:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, invited
me to speak to my amendment, which was very kind of him. The noble
Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, gave a very good description of it, which
I do not need to repeat, but there are a couple of issues on which we
ought to reflect. First, the special parliamentary procedure, which my
noble friend Lord Faulkner described at Second Reading and again today,
is to my mind a second attempt to oppose planning permission if you
fail on the first occasion. Is that worth having and, if so, what
exceptions or types of development should be included? There is also
the question of the scope of the SPP because I believe that it can be
very wide: for example, looking at a complete planning application
again; or it could be narrowed to apply to just the particular issue
that is under
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T17:31:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000235" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0001.htm#13020416000235">I
found a very interesting example of this recently on Humberside where
the established port operator there, Associated British Ports, got into
a bit of debate with a new company, which I think was trying to develop
a port complex next door for offshore windmills or something or other.
A railway line runs through the middle of the proposed development
which the developer was trying to purchase so that he could install
level crossings rather than having the cost of a bridge. The detail
does not really matter but the issue comes back to the fact that if you
are opposed to a proposed development, the SPP gives you a second round
of attack, if you like, in putting your case. If you want it to go
forward as quickly as possible, you will argue that the consent order
process is perfectly valid and, if you do not like the outcome, I
suppose that you can go for judicial

also worry when my noble friend Lord Faulkner says that there have been
only two or three of these cases in the past goodness knows how long,

procedure, a lot of people might try to use it. That is not a reason
for not having it but it is a reason for considering whether one needs
it, the scope it should have and how long it should last. I have tabled
my amendment in conjunction with the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding,

The Planning Act 2008 brought together a range of different consent
regimes for nationally significant infrastructure into a single
development consent order. The overall aim of this regime is to provide
a more efficient and quicker consenting regime for very large
infrastructure projects. Development consent orders can include
authorisation for the compulsory acquisition of land, but when certain
categories of specially protected land are acquired, special
parliamentary procedure can be triggered. The decision by the Secretary
of State that such land is to be compulsorily acquired is then
transferred to a Joint Committee of Parliament for confirmation. While
the special parliamentary procedure is undertaken, the development

cannot
start.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020416000239" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020416000239">The

involved—the special parliamentary procedure was triggered for
an infrastructure project under the Planning Act. The special
parliamentary procedure added more than a year to the consent process.

22 also amends the provisions in the Planning Act 2008 which cover the
compulsory acquisition of commons, open space land and what are known
as “fuel and field garden allotments” or the compulsory
acquisition of rights over those types of land. The Government have
considered carefully the extent to which SPP should apply when open
space is compulsorily acquired or a right over such land is acquired in
respect of nationally significant infrastructure projects. At present,
the main situation where the Secretary of State can decide that SPP
should not apply is when replacement land is given in exchange for the

significant. The government amendments to Clause 22 are minor and will

special position, including its benefit in relation to SPP. That said,

said that they hoped that no planning authorities would ever come under
these provisions, but they were nevertheless a necessary back-stop.
However, if there is to be no back-stop of special parliamentary
procedure in these cases, is it not the case that the incentive for
developers to provide alternative land or open space when necessary
will be less because they can simply apply to the Secretary of State,
who can say, “No, you do not need to do so”? They can
then do absolutely nothing about it. Surely the fact that there have
been so few examples of special parliamentary procedure is because
applicants for development consent have done their business and found
appropriate alternative open space to replace any that they are using.
The current system is working and there is a danger that there will be
far less of this happening, simply because the back-stop SPP procedure
will not
exist<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T17:52:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020432000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020432000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Greenway" PimsId="3555" UID="13020432000117" xid="1249" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020432000117">Lord

compulsorily—a point made with great force by the noble Lord,
Lord Greaves, in the previous debate. Those words are embodied in
Section 122(3) of the Planning Act. In order for a petitioner to
demonstrate that there is no compelling case in the public interest, he
should be able to bring evidence to bear about the benefits of the

compulsory acquisition—and the 1945 Act; yet the

examples in the same way as it does for 2008 Act cases. I should be
grateful if the Minister can explain why the Government have decided

Lord Faulkner knows

the 1945 Act does not currently make provision for Parliament to

of legislation which state that Special Parliamentary Procedure should
apply to an order to a limited extent. Indeed, the amendment would

be helpful to give a very brief summary of how the actual proposals in

provision that requires an order to be subject to SPP to be limited as
a “special-acquisition provision”. New Section 1A of the
1945 Act provides that, where an order is subject to SPP under a
special acquisition provision, that order is to be known as a
“special authorisation”, in so far as it authorises the
compulsory acquisition of special land or rights over such land.
Paragraphs 3 to 18 of the new Section 1A set out modifications to the
provisions of the 1945 Act. In many cases, these provide that
references in the 1945 Act to the “order” are read as
references to the “special authorisation”. The broad
effect of this is that only petitions relating to the acquisition of
special land may be considered by
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020432000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020432000017">The
noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, mentioned at Second Reading, and he has

in Clause 23 keep existing procedures in place regarding the handling
of petitions. It will continue to be for the Lord Chairman of

under Clause 23, the provisions in the 1945 Act in respect of petitions

construed as petitions against a special authorisation. Petitions can
only therefore be certified as being proper to be received if they are

It amends the present Local Government Act 1972 procedure for the

obligation to give reasons for, or even publish, the decision. There is
no right of appeal by the objectors. The land can then be
used, sold or let for other uses free of all existing open space trusts
and without regard to the fact that a park or recreation ground may
have been gifted to or acquired cheaply—often, perhaps, with

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord
Greaves for explaining his proposed new clause. He is of course greatly
concerned with the protection of open spaces such as commons and what
are known as “fuel and field garden allotments”. I am
sure that that sentiment resonates with many in the Committee. My noble
friend also explained that when a local authority, including a parish
or town council, wishes to appropriate this type of land for another
purpose or to dispose of it, notification procedures should be beefed
up and exchange land should be provided. His main point is that the
present arrangements are inadequate and that more protection is
required to prevent open space and other similar land from being lost
to
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020432000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020432000030">The
system that my noble friend seeks to amend concerns two types of land
and two types of transaction. The types of land are commons, including
town and village greens, and open space. The transactions are
appropriation and disposal. The Committee will not be surprised to hear
that the legislation that governs all of this is not confined to the
Local Government Act 1972, which this amendment seeks to change.
Significant elements are contained within the Town and Country Planning
Act 1990. For commons, I think that my noble friend already has most of
what he wants. Appropriation of common land larger than 250 square
yards requires an order to be made by the local authority and then
confirmed by the Secretary of State. Exchange land must also be
provided, on pain of special parliamentary procedure—which we
have just debated extensively—in the same way as for compulsory
purchase
orders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020432000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020432000031">In
many cases, disposals also need the consent of the Secretary of State.
For open space, the publicity and related arrangements for the
consideration of objections are the same for both appropriation and
disposal. If local authorities fail to consider objections properly,
they run the risk that their decision will be challenged in the courts.
Although protection for open space may appear lacking in legislation,
this is not the whole story. Open space has had strong protection in
the National Planning Policy Framework. Paragraph 74 states that
existing open space should not be built on unless an assessment has
been made to show that the land is clearly surplus and, moreover, that
the loss should be replaced by the equivalent or better provision. It
is therefore the Government’s view that the protection of open
spaces should be through the planning system and not front-loaded on to
the procedures for appropriating or disposing of land. I hope that my
noble friend will be minded to withdraw his
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T18:13:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020432000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020432000032"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Greaves" PimsId="3545" UID="13020432000128" xid="1111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020432000128">Lord

are having in this

open spaces just through the planning system when in practice, as the
Minister said, there are different laws that relate to open space,
commons and so on. This is precisely the problem that we had when we
talked about the registration of town and village greens: trying to

am grateful to the Minister for reminding us that the National Planning
Policy Framework strongly proposes that, wherever possible, open spaces
should not be built on, but that is not the purpose of this amendment.
It is about buying and selling open space, not about the planning

said. I will carefully look at his response and again take advice. For

this group standing in my name. The question before us is what projects
should be considered nationally significant and therefore subject to
the Planning Act 2008, as amended in this Bill, and therefore subject
to a national rather than a local planning consent regime. The 2008 Act
permits this change to projects of national significance in respect of
infrastructure. Clause 24 extends this to business and commercial
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020432000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020432000035">The
thrust of my amendments is that Parliament should not give the
Secretary of State such wide-ranging powers without defining their
extent carefully in the Bill. In the Bill, discretion as to what
constitutes national significance is left almost entirely to the
Secretary of State. The only substantial limitation is that regulations
may not encompass projects that include residential dwellings. My
amendments are all probing and I look forward to the Minister’s
response to the substantial points underlying
each.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020432000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020432000036">Amendment
77ZJ would exclude from the new arrangements sites of special
environmental or historic importance. Amendment 77AB would
exclude developments that involve surface mineral extraction or
quarrying. Such applications arouse especially strong local feeling,
and to circumvent local planning entirely for such schemes is bound to
give rise to acute concern. Amendments 77AA, 77AC and 77BA
would remove the Secretary of State’s discretion to define what
is meant by business or commercial and to permit the bypassing of a
local authority, because Amendment 77ZA and other amendments
in my name specify the definition in the Bill.</hs_para>

define business and commercial projects of national significance,

Government will no doubt respond to my amendment by saying that they
have consulted both on categories of development and on thresholds

application is of national significance. Last week, the Government
published their analysis of the responses. However, they have not yet
said how they intend to proceed. A key issue for us in this debate is
to know what the Government’s response will be to the

proposed list of development types set out in annexe A of
the recent CLG consultation on extending the Planning Act regime. I
imagine that this could always be reversed if the Government were
minded to do so, but the Bill prevents any housing element being
included in
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020432000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020432000041">I
believe there is a large number of potentially significant business and
commercial developments that will have some
retail and certainly some housing element in them, even if it is only a
caretaker. In theory, if there is just one property in a development,
it cannot qualify for going down the nationally significant route. It
is important for such developments to be able to include
some housing element and to go for the nationally
significant approach. An awful lot of time and
cost could be saved if this were possible. The original
prohibition of housing was well intentioned, and
clearly big housing projects are not
what the nationally significant definition is
for, but it is a problem because if there were
just one or two houses in a big development, it would
be  excluded.</hs_para>

Lords are aware, the purpose of Clause 24 is to extend the existing

intention is not to bring new development into the regime automatically
but to provide an alternative planning route where proposed development
is of national significance. We have recently consulted on the types of

to be a sensible approach. If a scheme is of national significance and
is directed into the regime, the Secretary of State will have to
consider all the issues that are important and relevant, including any
impacts on the historic or natural environment, before reaching his

discourage developers bringing forward much needed infrastructure or

recognised in the National Planning Policy Framework, minerals are
essential to support sustainable economic growth and quality of life.
Without minerals, our building industry would grind to a halt. It is
essential that there is a sufficient supply of material to provide the
infrastructure, buildings, energy and goods that the country needs. We

of national significance, but again we wish to consider the

other questions I wanted to ask were about minerals. Will Clause 24
make a difference, for example, to the way in which planning permission
or development consent is given for things such as quarries in national
parks—the quarrying of limestone in the Peak District, for
example—which are highly controversial and at the moment are
done by the local planning authority, the national park? Are decisions
like that going to be moved to the Secretary of State and the
infrastructure planning

other question was specifically about the development of fracking for
unconventional gas, which is going ahead slowly in Lancashire. Lots of
different consents have to be obtained for that, notably from the
Department of Energy and Climate Change, which takes place at a
national level. However, the development that has taken place so far
and the scale of it means that the planning permission, as I understand
it, is the responsibility of the county council; in the case of the
fracking that is taking place, or is about to resume, at the moment on
an experimental basis in Lancashire, that will be Lancashire County
Council.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020432000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020432000057">It
seems to me that with something like fracking, there are two crucial
sets of decisions to be made. One is the question of whether the
drilling, the fracking and the extraction of the gas should be allowed
to take place. Then there are all the environmental issues related to
that on the surface, such as the screening of developments and whether
pipes from the different wellheads, which are quite close to each
other, should be underground, overground or whatever, which is a matter
of the local landscape and local planning. I would be quite appalled if
the decisions over that kind of local planning were taken away from the
local planning authority—in this case Lancashire County Council,
as it is a minerals development—and put in the hands of a
national authority, which I really do not think would have the local
understanding or the ability to do the job properly. There are two
separate issues there. Would it be possible for them to be separated,
because they are dealing with quite different aspects, and for the
decisions about whether the drilling and fracking goes ahead—and
I should say that it seems to me that this is development which ought,
at least on a pilot basis, to proceed as far as a viable commercial
scheme—to be taken nationally through the infrastructure
planning process but for the local details of the environmental
protection and amelioration connected with it, and how that works on
the surface, to be left with the local planning

publish the reason that a planning decision is to be made centrally,
including why the application is regarded as nationally significant.
This is a simple case of transparency and accountability. If the
Secretary of State is to be granted the wide powers contained in this
Bill, it is only right that their use should be open to scrutiny case
by case. If the local authority is to have its planning role set aside,
it seems only fair to tell it why. Just as planning inspectors have to
give reasons for their decisions, it seems entirely consistent and
transparent that the Secretary of State should have to give reasons for

Boles, when briefing Peers, very kindly indicated that there would be

flies in the face of the Government’s commitment to localism.
The Secretary of State has call-in powers if necessary. Indeed, if 
<?notus-xml column=67?>local authorities struggle with some of these larger-scale proposals,
the Planning Advisory Service is available to support them. What

business and commercial developments will be defined in terms of type

summary of responses and, as the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said, it was
not hugely illuminating. Indeed, all the types of development that the
consultation proposed would have major local impacts and need to be
dealt with by local government. I add my voice to those who already
urge the Minister that we see not only the summary of responses, but
the Government’s reply and their intentions in terms of the
clause, before Report. I ask the Minister to commit to producing the
Government response before Report—otherwise we are being asked

is that the proposals under Clause 24 also include the extractive
industries: deep-mined coal, large onshore gas, oil and other mining
and quarrying above certain thresholds. They would be brought within
the major infrastructure planning system without robust guarantees that
the considerable environmental impacts of these developments can be
addressed through the planning system. They are usually dealt with
through specific local, national park or county-level policies and
procedures governing mineral planning issues. It is also unsatisfactory
to propose that deep-mined coal be included in the proposed fast-track
process because this seems at odds with the presumption against new
coal that is included in the National Planning Policy Framework. It
does not say much for commitment to addressing climate change if we
regard these types of energy generation as sufficiently important to
bypass the normal planning system.</hs_para>

there might be safeguards for decisions made under the national

that they are scrutinised by Parliament before being agreed. However,
we do not yet know as a result of the consultation process whether
Ministers will change their minds about formulating national policy
statements for business or commercial schemes. The consultation was on
the basis that there would be no national policy statements for these
schemes, but I see from the consultation response summary that there
has been some pressure to develop further national policy statements in
these areas. Can the Minister give the House some clarification on the

national in their significance. It seems that they are being
artificially designated simply to enable developers to chance their
luck with the Secretary of State rather than the local planning
authority. Of course, the Minister will say in response that there are
other safeguards surrounding the impacts of business and commercial

the Minister sent, clarifying the Government’s position on the
local plan, still made it pretty clear that there is no legal
requirement for the Secretary of State to give weight to the local
plan. Therefore, in the absence of a national policy statement, the
Secretary of State can legally give weight to almost anything. Even
where there is a local plan, the Secretary of State’s
consideration will take account of a whole range of factors, only one
of which will be the local plan. That is a considerable departure from
the principle of the planning system, which is of a plan-led approach.
At the very minimum, will the Minister undertake to look at amending
the clause to ensure that the local plan is afforded pre-eminence in
the absence of a national policy statement?</hs_para>

that the Minister will no doubt want to put forward is the role of the
NPPF. The Government made it clear in the consultation document that,
in the absence of a national policy statement, the NPPF and other local
policy and material consideration could form the policy framework for
decision-making on these schemes. However, in practical terms, the NPPF
does not lend itself to the national infrastructure planning process.
It was written to inform the decisions of local planning authorities in
their plan-making and development management functions under the Town
and Country Planning Acts. Throughout the NPPF, the references to the
planning system and planning law are really references to the Town and
Country Planning Acts, not to the 2008 national infrastructure regime.
The very wording of the NPPF says that local authorities should do this
and should do that, not that the Secretary of State should do this and
should do that. This makes the NPPF difficult to apply outside the
specific context of local planning. To give one example, the
presumption in favour of sustainable development could not be applied
to the Secretary of State’s decisions under the national
infrastructure procedure because the whole of this policy in the NPPF
is set in the context of what local authorities will do in the local
plan.</hs_para>

Secretary of State might not have a national policy statement to guide
him, can choose to give as little or great weight to the local plan as
he may, and the NPPF does not give him much help, if my analysis is
correct. This does not exactly seem a policy and plan-led decision
system, which gives certainty to developers, fairness to local
interests and swiftness to decisions.</hs_para>

about Clause 24—some might say I already have—but there
are a few other things that I should like to put as weights in the
scale. The process itself for national infrastructure planning 
<?notus-xml column=69?>is not particularly satisfactory in the absence of a national policy
statement or a pre-eminent authoritative local plan for a number of
reasons. Local authorities can be asked for a local impact statement
but these are pretty expensive and complex, and there is no requirement
on the local authority to produce one. Depending on the volume of these
cases, we might well find that local authorities become less and less
keen, as they are not the deciding authority, to produce
these.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020432000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020432000077">There
is also a particular issue with developers making significant changes
to their applications following the pre-application consultation. That
is admirable in that developers are responding to local input, but the
big problems with the national infrastructure procedural hearings are
that they are very tightly timetabled and there are no formal rights to
cross-examine developers. There are real questions about whether there
is real community involvement when such changes are happening through
the NSIP procedure. This is particularly so since the decisions will
not be made by the democratically elected local planning

involve more than 10 to 20 cases per year. I, too, am
concerned about volume for a number of reasons; for example, the shale
gas fracking issue, where we know that potentially 800 well-heads are
predicted in the north-west. These are well-heads of a limited
duration; they move on fairly rapidly after a few years, so multiple
applications are likely to come up in the future. In the light of
predictions—for example, Friends of the Earth believes that
there is a potential pool of projects of all sorts that could well come
within the criteria, which are currently being consulted on and might
total between 300 and 500 per year—it would be useful to know
whether Ministers are still of the view that only 10 to 20 applications

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, I was going to congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Young, on her brilliant speech that meant that I did not
have to say anything at all, really—until she started
challenging me, as her 
<?notus-xml column=70?>supporter on this amendment, in her last few remarks. I do not think I
did capitulate on Clause 1; I think it was on Clause 5 that I came to
the view that it was not going to make any difference to anybody in
practice. I will review that, but I certainly still feel fairly
resolute about Clause 1, which I think is fundamentally wrong in
principle no matter how many councils it
affects.</hs_para>

concerned, my view is there should be a limited-scale commercial pilot,
which inevitably would be in the west Lancashire plain, before anything
else happens. I think that will take quite a few years to get under
way. I certainly would not be in favour of the large-scale development
of shale gas in this country until that pilot had taken place and we
could assess whether or not some of the worst fears are true. I suspect
that some of the worst fears are not true but equally, we must assess
the environmental and landscape implications, which are perhaps not
quite as important as the more fundamental questions about the effects
of the drilling, but are nevertheless very important. That is my view
on shale gas. As I said in the previous group, I am in favour of as
much of that decision-making as possible remaining at a local,
Lancashire level, even though the basic consents for the actual
operation would be taken at national level by the Department of Energy
and Climate Change, and perhaps
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000003">I have
one or two points to add to what the noble Baroness said. First, if
there are 20 or 25 a year, the Government ought to come clean and tell
us which commercial and business developments they believe have been
stopped or significantly delayed in the past year or two
years—or whatever period they choose—thus making this
proposal necessary. Again, this would provide us with some hard
evidence on the ground of ways in which the present system is
preventing commercial and business developments taking place.</hs_para>

Government would have to say which of those developments that have been
delayed or, particularly, stopped they think ought to go ahead, and
then people can judge this by outcomes. We can talk about processes
until we are blue in the face but what most people are interested in
are the actual outcomes of the planning process. Therefore, my question
for the Government is: if this proposed new system had been in place
for the past two years, what would have been different? If the answer
is, “Not very much”, we are wasting our time here talking
about it, quite
frankly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000005">To
underline what the noble Baroness, Lady Young, said about the
underlying planning policies that will guide the Secretary of State in
his decisions, the whole infrastructure planning process, as
set out in the 2008 Act, originally through the
Infrastructure Planning Commission, was based on a series of national
policy statements, which were government policy and were originally
intended to guide the Infrastructure Planning Commission in its
decisions. Just as local plans are there to guide local planning
authorities in their decisions, the national policy statements were
there, in different policy areas, to guide the Infrastructure Planning
Commission in its work.</hs_para>

infrastructure planning process is being undertaken by the Secretary of
State, the system has a fundamental fault at the heart of it, and I am 
<?notus-xml column=71?>increasingly of the view that the Government have got themselves into a
bit of a mess by giving the powers of the Infrastructure Planning
Commission to the Secretary of State. It is the Secretary of State who
will make the policies and then make the development control
decisions—presumably on the basis of the policies he has
determined. There is something fundamentally wrong with that system,
not least in that a decision is produced and there is no appeal process
other than judicial
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000007">If
there are not to be any of these national policy statements in relation
to commercial and business development, where is the underlying
planning policy coming from? Is it made up on the hoof by the Secretary
of State or does it genuinely come from local plans? If it genuinely
comes from local plans, why do we need to nationalise the system? As
the noble Baroness eloquently explained, it is clearly not in the
National Planning Policy Framework. The framework is very clearly set
out as planning guidance from the Secretary of State, as policy, to
local planning authorities making the decisions. That is its legal
basis. That is what it is, and it replaces what the Government will say
was about three feet of planning policy guidance that came in the old
PPSs and PPGs. That has all gone; we have now got the National Planning
Policy Framework. It is not an adequate basis for making decisions on
big, nationally significant projects, whether they are on
infrastructure or whether they are these new business and commercial
ones that have been made by the Secretary of
State.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000008">The

Government’s decision—which has of course now been
accepted by Parliament—is that the NSIPs should not go to an IPA
which is then able to make the decisions itself, because the IPA is not
accountable to anybody. To have the IPA—or, as it is now, the

Lord Greaves, lives in. I have been the recipient of a number of
complaints about the difficulty firms have in making developments which
seem to me to be absolutely essential, and indeed are so under the
national policy. There was an incident in which I sought help for an
electricity substation, for which it was absolutely necessary to bring
ashore the product—the electricity— 
<?notus-xml column=72?>from what was intended to be a large offshore wind farm. I am not sure
whether even that has yet been granted. I was the recipient of at least
two complaints about the provision of underground gas storage. Again,
people have an absurd idea of what these things may be. Those are the
kind of big decisions, big applications, which have been seriously held
up. I think therefore that it is absolutely right for an applicant to
say that the application should be heard under the NSIP
procedure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000012">There
is also the different problem raised by Amendment 78B. This has been
put to me by the National Grid, which obviously has very considerable
experience of dealing with applications which may arouse a good deal of
opposition. The case is a very simple one; it is in fact seeking
consistency. Under the new proposals for commercial development, only
the applicant is entitled to ask the Secretary of State to make a
referral to the inspectorate, whereas for all previous applications the
application can be made by anyone, in addition, of course, to the
promoter. One must ask whether it is right that, concerning the new
category of business and commercial project, only the applicant is able
to refer. Why does this not apply to all the other bodies? The argument
for consistency seems really quite overwhelming.</hs_para>

that is an argument. However, he of course pointed out that that
amendment would enable someone to draw key information to the Secretary

Secretary of State can then of course direct that the matter goes
direct to the inspectorate under the NSIP procedure. On that occasion I
was trying to break new ground, but that is not the case under this
Bill. As I said a few moments ago, under this Bill only the promoter
can take that step in relation to business and commercial projects, and
I am puzzled as to why. My amendment therefore simply seeks to bring
all the existing applications into line with the new one for business
and commercial projects. I hope that my noble friend will view this as

quote those figures because I think it is beholden upon my noble friend
to answer—and I am sure she will do her best to do so—why
the Government seem to think there will only be 10 to 20 cases emerging
through this fast-tracking process if fracking is brought forward.
There is a disparity which needs urgent clarification. Yes, it is a
developing area, but if the Government are going to proceed with
fracking, and take it forward as part of the energy mix in the short to
medium term, then not only is there a case for a national policy
statement, but there needs to be far greater clarity about the
implications—particularly the resource implications—that

Hanham:</Member></B> I thank those noble Lords who have taken part in
this rather interesting and short debate. I will try to pick up some of
the matters raised, either as we go through or subsequently. Perhaps it
would be helpful if I explain the Government’s rationale for
Clause 24 and the reforms within it. As we have said on many occasions,
one of the Government’s top priorities is to get the economy
growing by creating the right conditions for growth. This includes
ensuring that the planning system is operating in the most efficient
and effective way. Clause 24 will support this aim by allowing
developers of nationally significant business and commercial
development to request to use the streamlined planning regime set out
in the Planning Act 2008.</hs_para>

Baroness’s Amendments 77A, 77B and 78A would remove the ability
of the Secretary of State to issue a direction for prescribed forms of
business and commercial development in response to a request from a
developer. I have listened to views expressed that business and
commercial planning applications should be determined by the local
planning authority, and we have no difficulty with that. The Government
agree that that is the right approach in the vast majority of cases.
However, there will also be a small number of projects that will be of
national economic importance 
<?notus-xml column=74?>and, in certain circumstances, it will be right that a decision on such
proposals is taken at the national level by democratically elected
Ministers.</hs_para>

are not proposing that that should be a mandatory route for developers;
it is optional. Developers of major projects will choose to request to
use the infrastructure planning regime only if it offers other benefits
which the local authority cannot provide, such as statutory
timetabling—the noble Baroness asked me what it would
be—and the one-stop shop, which will be useful where multiple
consents are required.</hs_para>

request made to use the infrastructure planning regime will also be
subject to the agreement of the Secretary of State, who will have to be
satisfied that the proposed project is of national significance. Under
Section 35(10) of the Planning Act, the Secretary of State is required
to give reasons for his decision when making a direction, and that
requirement is carried forward in new Section 35ZA(10) in Clause 24.

unnecessary.</hs_para>

Jenkin spoke to Amendment 78B, which would limit who can make a request

waste, water or waste water projects below the Planning Act thresholds

sympathetic to its aims, but perhaps I may explain why we have set out
a different approach in the Bill for business and commercial
schemes.</hs_para>

Planning Act sets specific thresholds for energy, transport, water,
waste and waste water projects. Any proposal for a development which
meets those thresholds must seek planning consent through the
nationally significant infrastructure planning regime. Section 35 of
the Planning Act allows a request to be made to use the regime for
projects which are below the thresholds. We have not sought to limit
who can make a Section 35 request for infrastructure
projects as we recognise that other parties may hold information which
could indicate that the project was one of national significance and
should be directed into the regime. However, for business and
commercial schemes, the Government have been very clear that for
developers of major schemes this is an optional route. Therefore, the
limitation on who can make a request is not there. We believe that it
should be for a developer or applicant to determine whether the
advantages of using the infrastructure planning regime outweigh the
usual route of making a planning application to the local planning
authority. The Secretary of State will direct a project into the regime
only if he considers that it is of national significance.</hs_para>

have been expressed that if we do not accept the amendment the
Secretary of State will be inundated with requests from third parties,
or that there will be delay to the application being submitted or to
the local authority decision-making process. We think that this is
unlikely. We are aware of only a very small number of such requests
having been made to date. The impact assessment states that the figure
is likely to be between 10 and 20 a year. We will have to see how that

an application or proposed application is directed into the nationally

communities, and local authorities will continue to play an important
role. The consultation requirements of the Planning Act, as noble Lords
will know, are rigorous. Local authorities will also be invited to
prepare a local impact report. The Secretary of State must
have regard to the report as well as to other matters that are both
important and relevant in making his decision on the development

both important and relevant, as indeed is the National Planning Policy

do not think that there would be any disagreement with my saying that
the local plan and the National Planning Policy Framework are both

help to know whether they were major applications as defined at the

applications would have gone to be decided at national level under the

many of the 87% of presumably major applications that were dealt with

to address the contribution of academies and free schools to our
national education provision. I look forward to the summing up of this
short debate by my noble friend the Minister, as this is the first
opportunity for him to make a substantial speech in this House. I begin
by declaring an interest as the unpaid chair of a commission on
academies and free schools for the London Borough of Wandsworth. The
commission has met with many potential academy sponsors and free school
providers, and I for one have been often inspired by the enthusiasm,
expertise and deep commitment of those who seek to change the life
chances of young
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000052">We are
witnessing a revolution—the most important revolution in
education for many decades. Beginning with the vision in the previous
Administration of the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, who I am pleased to see
in his place, already more than half the secondary schools in the
country have become academies. Most are converter academies by the
choice of their governing bodies, and some are sponsored academies
where schools 
<?notus-xml column=79?>failing to raise the performance of their pupils have, with the guidance
and help of a sponsor, been made into academies where pupil success has
followed. Such schools are often located in the most deprived and
difficult areas, with generations of failure behind them. There are now
2,673 academies in England and 80 free schools are already open with
more than 100 in the pipeline for this
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000053">Now
primary schools are becoming academies and primary free schools are
being established. There is an urgent need for action at this level.
The DfE reports that 1,400 primary schools are below the minimum floor
standard—800 of these for at least three years. This means that
several thousand pupils are leaving the primary phase having failed to
achieve even a minimum standard in basic English and maths. The weakest
200 of these schools have already become academies in this academic
year and many more will follow. We rejoice to find that, since becoming
academies, more than 40 of these primary schools have completely
eliminated the gap in attainment between the children of the poorest
and richest
families.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000054">Free
schools, including the excellent university technical colleges, have
allowed communities of parents, teachers, local people and a range of
approved sponsors to bring their commitment and determination to set up
new schools, to raise standards of teaching and to lift aspirations in
places where all too often only acceptance of defeat and a lack of
ambition had been before. Many bring innovative and exciting new ideas
into educational provision, offering different and challenging forms of
education which meet the special interests and needs of local children
in ways no local authority would be able or likely to
offer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000055">The
providers of free schools are diverse. So far, 59 have been
groups of teachers, existing schools or other educational
organisations. This is indeed a policy endorsement by the professionals
in education. Some 45 have come from parent groups; community,
religious and local groups; and charities. Again, this is endorsement
of the policy by the people who are most concerned and most likely to
be the best judges of its success.</hs_para>

all academies have been or will be a total success, of course, although
the overwhelming majority have achieved more than even their supporters
would have dreamed. The British cup-half-empty media have seized on the
occasional academy where standards have not been spectacular, although
even these have often achieved more than their predecessor, but no one
who truly cares about children and young people can fail to celebrate
the life-changing opportunities which academies and free schools have

them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000057">Some
basic statistics demonstrate what great gifts have been given to young
people by this programme. Overall, pupils in sponsored academies have
increased their achievements by five times the national average for
maintained schools. Years of failure in some local authority areas have
been turned into success. My noble friend Lord Harris, in the wonderful
work he has done in creating successful academies, can be proud of his
Bermondsey academy, for example, where, 
<?notus-xml column=80?>with more than two-thirds of pupils receiving free school meals,
62%,—almost twice the national average—have achieved five
A* to C grades in their GCSEs. However, statistics can only invite us
to reflect on what this means in terms of young people whose
lives have been turned around and whose aspirations have been raised
beyond anything their predecessors had
experienced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000058">Why
do academies and free schools achieve where local authorities had
failed? The answer is freedom. Academies are free from local authority
control, which has not always been benign. They are free to deliver the
curriculum which fits the needs of their pupils, not some centrally
determined formula. However, their offering must be “broad and
balanced”, and must include English, maths, science and
religious education. They are free to set pay and conditions for their
staff, enabling them to reward hard work and success, and to attract
the best and brightest teachers. They are also free to determine the
length of time pupils spend in school daily and termly: their
curriculum is not subject to the time restraints which too often
prevent local authority schools from expanding their offerings to
follow the needs and interests of their
pupils.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000059">Most<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T19:33:47"></hs_TimeCode>
importantly, these schools offer professional freedom to the head and
teachers. Professional judgment always trumps bureaucratic
prescription. Teachers really do know best. For the past 20 years or so
we have cramped professionals—not only in education—with
regulation, prescription, inspection, targets and league tables. None
of this has worked to raise real standards. Indeed, we have been in
danger of de-professionalising the best-ever generation of teachers.
The system has forced them to teach to the requirements imposed from
outside instead of to their own professional judgment. Removing these
external constraints has resulted largely in the great success of
academies and free schools: the proof is in the
results.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000060">Although
the evidence is that the longer schools have enjoyed their academy and
free school status, the greater their improvement, some have rightly
expressed concern about how we can ensure that these standards are
maintained in the longer term, especially when many of these schools
will be exempt from regular inspection. It is my profound belief that
the best form of accountability begins with the accountability of the
individual to their own professional standards. I am however greatly
reassured by the initiatives which have arisen voluntarily and
spontaneously within the academies and free schools themselves. Many
have formed “chains”, which are looser perhaps than a
strict federation, although enjoying many of the financial and quality
benefits of shared central services and shared governance, which others
have adopted.</hs_para>

they are a federation or a chain, these associations are proving to be
a far better guardian of quality than many of the external official
bodies which control community schools. The strong and successful
schools in the chain offer support and help to their newer developing
partners. This model is now widely adopted and provides excellent
advantages for quality control. Again, it is a product of leaving the
professionals to determine their own quality assurance. It will be
important to ensure, however, that the chains do not 
<?notus-xml column=81?>become substitute local authorities with power again drifting away from
the individual school—that “living cell of the body
educational”, as it has been
called.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000062">In
the Harris group, we see an outstanding model of this way of working.
The Harris Federation has set up a complete system of raising teaching
quality: first, in initial training, as a group of designated training
schools, and then in offering a careful programme of teacher
development, which takes the average teacher, through several steps, to
excellence. The successful heads in the group are also involved in a
leadership development programme for those with leadership potential,
to ensure a supply of outstanding heads for the future. I cannot but
feel that this is a more trustworthy and sustainable pattern for
ensuring quality than an occasional visit from an Ofsted inspector with
limited scope for development

Baker of Dorking:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for
introducing this debate. I also welcome my noble friend Lord Nash to
the Front Bench. Although he has skirmished at Question Time, this is
the first debate on which he has had to answer. This is an engagement
and not a skirmish. I should like to make one major point. Michael Gove
has imposed on the English education system an enormous revolution,
which is irreversible, by expanding the academy programme very
substantially and by introducing free schools. As far as I can see, it
will not be reversed by any Government and will not be taken back under
state control in the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000065">That,
of course, started with the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, who realised that
some of the most successful schools, when he was responsible for this
matter, were the original city technology colleges, which I established
in the 1980s—16 of them. He used them as a model for the
academies and persuaded Tony Blair to announce a target of 200. Now
there are 600, so they are rolling on at a rapid pace. In fact, when
Tony Blair becomes very eloquent about this, he not only speaks warmly
of academies but rather implies that he was their creator. I am happy
to share the parentage because it shows all-party
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000066">Why
are these colleges so successful? They enflame and engage people at a
local level—parents, teachers, local communities and
businesses—to improve the basic schools in their community. That
is an enormous release of energy, enthusiasm and commitment, which is
quite striking across all the country in all communities and in all
parties. That is to be immensely welcomed, and the noble Lord, Lord
Adonis, is to be congratulated on initiating
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000067">The

colleges open at the

colleges are popular because they deal with children aged from 14 to
18. This is another revolution in English education. The rest of the
world is moving slowly to a transfer age of 14, which I have just
recorded in a book that was published last week. I draw it to your
Lordships’ attention, and it should be available in the Library.
In this book, I argue that the right age of transfer is 14, not 11,
that the national curriculum, of which I was one of the authors, should
stop at 14 and that at that point there should be four types of
colleges: university technical colleges; liberal arts colleges, a
vastly expanded grammar school sector for the academic, which would
probably be non-selective; then something my noble friend Lord Moynihan
would welcome, a series of at least 30 or 40 creative arts, performing
arts and sports colleges throughout the United Kingdom; and then there
should be career colleges, which come out of the FE movement, covering
the other subjects. All this is releasing energy at the right point.
This revolution would really be very significant for the English
education system.</hs_para>

that is going on at the moment is the extension of the school leaving
age to 17 this year and to 18 in 2015. This will have a profound effect
on the English education system. Education will be a continuum from
five to 18. It is irreversible. It is going to happen, and whenever it
has happened in the past, when the school leaving age was moved from 10
in 1880, to 12 in 1890, and to 14 in 1921, there was a huge increase in
the number of new schools and reorganisation of schools. There is a
unique opportunity in this large continuum to look at the shape of
education. The instruments to do that are essentially academies and
free schools.</hs_para>

very glad that the Labour Party now supports this movement. It is very
effective. One of the university technical colleges completed two years
last summer, so we had 16 and 18 year-old students leaving. A totally
comprehensive selection went in, with 20% special educational needs. In
that school, there were no NEETs last summer: every student either got
a job or an apprenticeship or went on to college or university. There
are not many schools with that particular mix that can say that in our
country. We know, therefore, that we have a successful formula, and I
hope that that formula can be extended on a much wider scale. I applaud
this great change that is now sweeping through the English education
system, and I will now finish.</hs_para>

English education system has undergone continual change in the post-war

leave their mark. If we have learnt anything about that 30-year change,
it is that improvement is likely to be accelerated and sustained if
there is broad ownership at local and classroom level. We need to
consider carefully the management of schools: with freedom
comes responsibility. The Secretary of State cannot and should not
micromanage academies from the centre. In a successful academy system,
we will see schools supporting and learning from each other. They will
operate as a community of schools, each independent, but working best

There have been some stunning successes among individual
sponsored academies and academy chains that have raised
expectations of what can be achieved in the most deprived communities.
However, it has to be about more: it has to be about the highest
quality of teaching, with teachers who are well trained, highly
motivated and—dare I say it—well rewarded. It has to be
about inspections carried out in a fair and rigorous manner by
qualified inspectors with classroom experience. It has to be about
self-improvement: schools working together to develop their
understanding and expertise and supporting each other. It has to be
about all schools having equality of resources and equality of
freedoms.</hs_para>

Sutherland of Houndwood:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the debate
introduced so well by my noble friend Lady Perry. I also welcome the
Minister to his first short debate; we are quite civilised people here,
and we look forward to hearing what he has to say. I understand that
the Minister has form in this area of academies, having been involved
in the very successful sponsorship of Pimlico Academy, which is one of

remarks largely to academies, rather than free schools. I want to
emphasise now that I agree with what has been said already in the
debate about the ways in which academies and other new forces in
education are enriching the educational provision in this country,
which is well needed and very important. Two consequences of academy
status have been especially welcome. One is the very important freedom,
referred to by my noble friend Lady Perry, to exercise professional
judgment. It is marvellous that this is happening, and I hope that head
teachers will not be too dirigiste, operating from the top of their own
little pyramid, but will make sure that the freedom passes down to
classroom
level.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000080">The
second consequence is a promise by the Secretary of State that the
reduction in bureaucracy which would follow would be to the benefit of
academies. I agree with this: they have been a positive source, even if
I now have a couple of questions to raise. One element of the way in
which bureaucracy is being removed is the reduction in the requirement
for outstanding academies to have an inspection every five years. I can
see the point and the value of this, but they are exempt from that.
Although it is sometimes an irksome discipline, I have to say that
excellence and outstanding qualities in 2013 might not still be there
in 2018. It is important that we have one way in which to moderate
that, at least. I understand that Ofsted anticipated that that would be
an issue and has now put in place for exempt schools the possibility of
an exercise in which it will inspect, in paper form, at least what is
happening in the school—a risk assessment, as it is called, will
be carried out. It will be paper-based, it will achieve a lot and will
help reassure parents and governors. That is good, but I suggest that
one or two features of an outstanding school may not be able to be
covered in a risk-based assessment of this kind. The first, for
example, 
<?notus-xml column=85?>is the overall judgment about the effectiveness of a school; I am not
sure how that can be done on the basis of a paper exercise. Yet it is
highlighted in the Ofsted statement of intent as one of the most
important judgments to be made. It is rather important that this can be
done one way or
another.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000081">Secondly,
I am not sure how a risk-based assessment that is effectively
paper-based will deal with the spiritual, moral, social and cultural
activities of a school. These are immensely important to a
school’s character, and it is difficult to see that they could
be accounted for in this type of
assessment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000082">Thirdly—and
this point follows on from the previous point and was of considerable
interest to a number of noble Lords here this evening in previous
debates on previous legislation—to be blunt, it will be
difficult to reassure the wider community on the basis of a paper
exercise that in one or other of the faith-based schools there has not
been a straying from the boundaries of education into indoctrination. A
few years ago, this would not, apparently, have been a real problem,
but it is now. Some of our young people are suffering significant
indoctrination—obviously in one faith, but in others too. One
check on this in a faith-based academy, which may well do excellent
work on the curriculum, pupil behaviour and all the other things, is
whether there is a move towards indoctrination. It could take place,
and it is essential that we are reassured that it would be picked up.
There are other elements of the way in which Ofsted operates that might
do this, but any reassurances that can be given would be very
welcome.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13020436000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000143">7.52

Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells:</Member></B> I, too, thank my mentor,
the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, for this debate. I offer my remarks
particularly, but not exclusively, in relation to church schools. There
are 140 primary and 97 secondary Church of England academies. Although
that makes the Church of England the largest provider of academies, it
still represents only 3% of our primary and 53% of our secondary
schools. Within my own diocese, some 70% of secondary schools as a
whole have moved to academy status, and that is quite remarkable. In
respect of academies, two of our schools—one Church of England,
one ecumenical—were indeed ground breakers. In the early days of
academies, lack of understanding by the Department for Education of
church school ownership and trusteeship led to too much problem solving
on the hoof once the legislation had been
passed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000084">Our
concern is that, with so much attention and energy being devoted to
this ideology about school structures, the risk is that we divert our
attention from the needs of the vast majority of children in our
schools, especially in the primary phase. We need to frame our debate
as being about the effectiveness of schools and the ways in which to
achieve greater levels of collaboration and effective partnerships that
result in more good and outstanding schools, irrespective of their
status as academies or maintained schools. For example, in Southwark
diocese, 88% and, in Liverpool diocese, 85% of Church of England
schools are rated as good or outstanding by Ofsted, with only a handful
of those schools being academies. So the need to 
<?notus-xml column=86?>ensure that we learn the lessons of what makes for effective provision
without limiting the debate to academies and free schools continues to
matter a great
deal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000085">In
April, the work of the multi-academy trusts comes on stream. We welcome
the Department for Education’s listening mode and are grateful
for the sponsor capacity grant. However, it is regrettable that the
grant is not really sufficient to fund adequately sponsored conversion.
I hope that the Government take a look at that. Also, for many schools,
anxiety has been increased as documentation is frequently changed at
short notice, adding significantly and unnecessarily to work loads. As
the local authorities gradually disappear and the academies and free
schools have an increasing influence, if they are to succeed and if we
are to achieve and ensure the quality that we are looking for, as the
Government and all of us wish, it remains important that the department
talks at a national and diocesan level with church schools and that
both plan ahead and resource more

Church of England approach in dioceses across the country is to
recognise the need for real structural collaborations to bring about
transformation in standards, resulting in effectiveness of schools. For
many, this now includes setting up multi-academy trusts, but in doing
so we must continue to find a way for schools of all categories to join
the same MAT so that the expertise and capacities in our good and
outstanding schools can be used for the benefit of weaker schools. I
hope that Ministers continue to work with Church of England officials
to enable that to
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000087">Free
schools often offer a good way in which to introduce new providers into
the system and bring fresh ideas to the needs of the community, but
there is a need to ensure that limited resources are focused on the

to the Minister’s attention the fact that there
remains a continuing lack of engagement with BME communities in the
free schools programme, particularly those that have been acutely
disadvantaged in education, such as the African, Caribbean and
Pakistani communities. Some such communities are attempting to seize
the pre-school programmes as an opportunity to improve educational
outcomes for BME and other pupils, but they face barriers to success.
Other such communities remain largely unaware of the programme, and it
is important that the Department for Education gives attention to the
engagement of such underrepresented communities. Many free schools
being established with the aim of improving education in deprived urban
areas are enrolling people from disadvantaged backgrounds at much lower
rates than other local schools. Barriers linked to financial expertise,
financial resources and social capital all have implications in
relation to
this.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_04_PT_1/AF0E03197F2E114F14989D6ECA6A2EF8039D49C1" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 February 2013">Monday,

But generally the picture has been one of progress, and I remain

am sure that we all remember what it was like before that and how
difficult it was to get schools to change. Some local
authorities—Hackney springs to mind—actively opposed
school improvement, and many others were ineffective. We all remember
how difficult it was to get individual schools to pay attention to what
parents wanted; there simply was no mechanism. I had the pleasure of
speaking at something organised by the British Council in Berlin
earlier this year, and it was astonishing to be taken back to an era
when schools did not indulge in self-improvement. Teachers were not
observed, and there were no mechanism for individual teachers to
improve. So much is better now than it

Wilshaw was a great head of Ofsted, and is at last being recognised by
schools as their friend and as someone who has shared their experiences

of places he can turn to. He has a whole collection of groups and
associations, of academies and their sponsors, who stand ready and
experienced to help schools improve. He has individual academies that
will take on failing neighbours and make them better, and that is a
proven way of improving schools. One of the great discoveries of the
past 25 years is that we can make schools better; we do not have to
tolerate underperformance. Through the academy movement, Ofsted has
been provided with the means of continuing that process of spreading
good practice—of picking up the schools that are not doing well

to have sent my daughter there but I cannot face it. It is still in the
hands of the sponsor who started it, and they are still doing badly by
it. That is not tolerable. I know that there are problems with the
original agreements with academies, but we simply must put that right.

Baker of Dorking has alluded, sport is so important as a catalyst,
capable of transforming many disenfranchised children into focused and
successful young people. Hatcham College, due to its success as a CTC,

academies in the country, with outstanding exam results at both GCSE

be a liveryman of the Drapers’ Company, and today I was
privileged to visit the Drapers’ Academy, in Harold Hill in the
London Borough of Havering. The academy is sponsored by the
Drapers’ Company and Queen Mary, University of London, itself an
institution founded by the Drapers. The academy was formally opened by
Her Majesty the Queen, who herself is a Draper, in October last year. I
thank and congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, for initiating
this important debate, and on her excellent

today with the principal and staff and addressed some of the senior
students. I was asked to inspire the students, but I came away
inspired, not only by the amazing transformation of what was
a failing comprehensive school—a school that was the last choice
of people in the local community, in an area where, at the bus stop
outside the school, you saw children with other school uniforms going
far afield. Now, thanks to a brand new building, new leadership and,
most importantly, a new attitude, this school has been transformed.
There are now many more applicants than there are places each

board of governors at the Drapers’ Academy is chaired by the

this Government have taken the concept and redefined it to focus too
much on school autonomy as a prize in itself. In doing so, it has lost
some of the unique transformative power that characterised the early
experience. The latest government research has shown that sponsored
academies, building on the original concept of introducing new school
leadership, continue to outperform other models. However, they are a
small percentage of the whole and are now massively outnumbered by the
so-called converter academies: that is, schools already judged
outstanding or good by Ofsted which have chosen to become academies
since 2010. This rush to convert all schools to academies highlights
some of the essential differences between us and this Government. For
example, we do not believe that there is just one model of
success<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T20:12:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000114" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000114">When
I first took over as shadow Minister, I visited a number of schools
involved in the London Challenge initiative introduced by the previous
Government. Some were academies, some were maintained schools. All are
now highly performing schools with strong and innovative school
leaders. Indeed, Pimlico Academy, with which the Minister has been long
connected, was a beneficiary of the scheme. The key success factor was
the intervention and collaboration between schools, put in place to
improve the quality of teaching. As a result of this initiative,
London’s schools went from being among the worst to
being among the best performing in the country. The success of such an
approach is confirmed by a growing weight of national and international
research which identifies that collaboration is the key to reform.
However, meanwhile, the recent report from the Academies Commission
showed that many of the converter academies which had been required to
support a struggling school nearby in order to gain academy status have
now broken that promise with no comeback. The same report identifies a
growing trend towards complex admissions procedures which dissuade the
less determined parents. As a result, it too often remains the case
that poor children are served by a poor education. The research shows
that children from a socially deprived background remain
disproportionately more likely to attend a school that is classed as
underperforming by
Ofsted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020436000115" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0002.htm#13020436000115">Therefore,<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T20:14:30"></hs_TimeCode>

power of partnership and collaboration. We fear that the early 
<?notus-xml column=92?>focus on underperforming schools in areas of high social and economic
deprivation is being lost. We see a teaching profession demoralised and
criticised when teachers are the key to improving teaching quality and
we see parents struggling to navigate complex admissions policies.

a more measured approach, addressing these issues and genuinely
informed by existing evidence, will be adopted in the academy strategy

how schools are run and should have the freedom to make a difference to
the lives of their pupils. The best ideas in schools come from schools
themselves. I have noticed that the best schools often have the same
characteristics: a broad and balanced curriculum, high aspiration, a
longer school day, plenty of extracurricular and sporting activities,
and good engagement with the local business community. We are keen for
all schools to emulate what the best schools do. The evidence from

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment seeks to avoid a
potential inconsistency in Greater London between the concept of what
is of “strategic importance” for the purposes of the
Mayor of London’s powers to intervene in the local planning
process, and what is of “national significance” for the
purposes of the Planning Inspectorate’s role under the new
scheme. The potential inconsistency is set to arise in the City of
London in particular because the Government’s proposals in the
Bill do not reflect the recognition given in the existing system to the
special circumstances of the
City<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T20:29:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020441000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0003.htm#13020441000002">Greater<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T20:29:49"></hs_TimeCode>
London provides a useful yardstick for the Government’s
proposals because regulations have already laid down in some detail
what sort of development might, because of its implications for the
regional economy, require a wider look than that taken by the local
planning authority alone. It is in the interests of certainty and
consistency that this careful demarcation is not undercut by the new
proposals, which have a similar aim only with a national rather than a
regional scope<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T20:30:22"></hs_TimeCode>.
Of course I am not suggesting that every development deemed to be of
regional importance should be regarded as nationally significantly as
well but the converse seems to me compelling. I struggle to see how a
development could be said to be of national significance when it is not
treated as regionally
significant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T20:30:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

once that the Government’s current proposals generally reflect
this view. The consultation indicates a threshold of 40,000 square
metres of floor space, above which a development might be considered
nationally significant. Of course that comes from annexe A in the
consultation document. This considerably exceeds the thresholds laid
down for potential strategic importance in most of Greater
London—namely 20,000 square metres in central London and 15,000
square metres in outer London. This was provided by the Town and
Country Planning (Mayor of London) Order
2008<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T20:31:29"></hs_TimeCode>, which was

suggest that this is the right way round. Powers to determine matters
on a regional level should, if I can put it this way, kick in before
powers to determine matters on a national level are involved. However,
in the City of London—as opposed to Greater London as a
whole—a higher threshold is provided for when a development
might be regarded as of potential strategic importance within Greater
London. The threshold in the City is 100,000 square metres of floor
space. It may seem strange to some of your Lordships to single out a
particular area in this way. It is, however, a recognition of the
markedly different planning environment in the City from anywhere else
in Greater London and, I might suggest, from anywhere else in the
country.</hs_para>

question of thresholds was discussed at some length in this House when
the Bill for the Greater London Authority Act 2007 was considered in
Parliament. It came to be accepted, I think on all sides of this House,
that it was appropriate to recognise the special circumstances of the
City in this way. I have reason to hope that the Minister may be
receptive of this argument today. My noble friend Lady Hanham may well
remember that she was on the Front Bench for the Opposition at the time
of that Bill and she appeared to be very appreciative of the
City’s case. I have no doubt that my noble friend Lord Ahmad

of commercial development, what is significant in the City is not the
same as what is significant elsewhere. The City is an area devoted to
business in a manner unlike any other. Noble Lords who take an interest
in these things will recall that it has fewer than 7,000 residents on
the parliamentary roll, but more than 300,000 people work there. No
global commercial centre can sustain itself without a substantial
property stock capable of meeting the changing needs of international
business. A principal objective of the planning system as it has been
operated in the City is to ensure a plentiful supply of office
buildings as one might say befits a world-leading business and
financial district in the 21st
century.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020441000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0003.htm#13020441000007">During
the discussion about thresholds in 2007, I think that the House earlier
recognised that applying the same thresholds to the City as elsewhere
would capture a whole raft of projects which, while of potential
strategic importance in other London boroughs, were unexceptional so
far as the City was concerned. This would have defeated the purpose of
the new powers, which was to enable developments of special or unusual
importance to receive the wider consideration that 
<?notus-xml column=97?>they merited, while leaving boroughs to perform tasks within their
normal range of responsibility and expertise without undue disruption

uncertainty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T20:35:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020441000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0003.htm#13020441000008">The
application of this principle in the City led to the adaptation that I
described. To apply the threshold of 40,000 square metres in the City
would leave far more projects liable to be treated as nationally
significant than would be treated as regionally significant for Greater
London. This seems absurd. Of course the situation under this clause is
not quite the same as that which exists with respect to the Mayor of
London, because the exercise of the Planning Inspectorate’s
powers will be triggered only on the application of the developer.
However, this point of difference does not justify what seems to be a
substantially different approach in respect of the City to the notion
of what is of strategic
importance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T20:35:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020441000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0003.htm#13020441000009">The
Government have been clear that they regard the new process as
something to be used as an exceptional course. In the other place on 4
December, my honourable friend Nick Boles described it as a backstop
where there were genuine reasons to bypass the normal role of local
planning authorities. In my view, this requires thresholds for national
significance that recognise the distinct position of the City, in the
way that it is currently recognised in determining potential strategic
importance at regional level. In that way, we would avoid the
topsy-turvy situation where the City was the only part of Greater
London where a development could fall within the nationally significant
regime without being treated as of potential strategic importance at
regional level. As I said, that would be

put it simply, we agree. That is why we set out in Clause 24 that new
Section 35(4) should require the Mayor of London’s consent
before business and commercial projects in Greater London can be

noble friend asked a few questions about the mayor’s role. I
reiterate that we recognise that London has its own planning context,
with the mayor taking responsibility for strategic planning across
London. That is why we built into the legislation the requirement to
obtain the mayor’s consent to issue a direction for any business
and commercial project in Greater London that wants to use the
nationally significant infrastructure regime. We also agree that it is
hard to envisage a type of nationally significant scheme that the mayor
did not have the ability to consider as being of strategic

responses that we have received on the proposed thresholds; the
intention behind them was to provide a gateway and give a clear

will explain our position a little further. We do not think that the
amendment will work from a technical standpoint, as the schedule to the
Town and Country Planning (Mayor of London) Order 2008, which refers to
projects of potential strategic importance, goes much wider than the
Government have proposed in their consultation paper on extending the
infrastructure planning regime and commercial projects. For example,
the order includes retail as part of strategic development which may
affect the mayor’s strategic policy. The Government have already
indicated in the consultation paper on extending the regime to business
and commercial projects that they do not propose to include retail
development as a prescribed project of potential national
significance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020441000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0003.htm#13020441000017">The
2008 order also includes types of transport infrastructure as
development of potential strategic importance. Under the 2008 Planning
Act certain forms of transport infrastructure that meet specific
thresholds must be considered under the nationally significant
infrastructure planning regime. Transport projects that fall beneath
the thresholds have to make a request to use the regime should they
wish to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020441000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0003.htm#13020441000018">The
amendment would add to the complexity of the legal picture, confronted
with issues around London. I come back to the point that I made at the
outset. We have built into Clause 24 a simple requirement to obtain the
mayor’s consent so that this complexity is not necessary. For
its implementation we are working with the mayor’s office and
will continue to have discussions with him about how this can best be
taken forward. With that explanation, I hope that my noble friend is

is not, largely, planning. It is funding, lack of clarity about

simply a list of projects and not a blueprint for how they are to be

always possible to give certainty, but if a firmer framework is put

considering the responses that we have received, including on the
subject of whether or not a national policy statement for business and
commercial development should be prepared. I should stress that, unlike
nationally significant forms of infrastructure, this clause does not
provide for a mandatory planning route. Developers may, as we discussed
on previous amendments, make a request to the Secretary of State to use
the Planning Act regime or they may continue to submit their planning
application to the local council. Although there is a worrying trend of
large-scale major applications taking longer to determine, we recognise
that many councils do determine important applications quickly and that
the majority of business and commercial applications will probably
remain with the local council for decision. We expect the numbers of
business and commercial applications to be determined via this route to
be very small.</hs_para>

intention behind Amendment 79 as we also believe in the important role
that parish councils can and do play in the planning system but we are
not happy to accept it for the following reasons. First and foremost,
the Planning Act 2008 already places a requirement on the applicant to
inform local authorities, communities and other prescribed bodies,
which include relevant parish councils, about the proposed application
and to engage them in pre-application consultation. In addition, should
an application then be accepted for examination by the Secretary of
State, the applicant must inform those bodies that the application has
been accepted so they have an opportunity to make representations and
register as interested parties for the purpose of the examination.
Therefore, we cannot accept the amendment simply because it is not
necessary. Parish councils are already defined as a statutory party in
the regulations that accompany the primary legislation. This means that
parish councils must be consulted about proposed applications for a
development consent order and if they wish to make representations,

return to the Mayor of London, as distinct from the lord mayor, and to
Greater London, as distinct from the City of London. This amendment
would enable the Secretary of State to include a requirement in the
regulations for the community infrastructure levy—henceforth to
be referred to as CIL—that in setting their CIL rates London
boroughs should have regard to the policies of the London Plan. This
simple addition to the mayor’s current powers to vet proposed
CIL demands would give developers greater confidence in the CIL-setting
process and that local and cross-London priorities are being
effectively aligned. It would also ensure that the strategic priorities
set out in the London Plan are the focus of localised spending for the
good of the capital as a
whole.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020444000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0003.htm#13020444000002">The
mayor will continue to vet all local CIL charging schedules in London

according to the mayor, many developers have expressed considerable
concern about CIL, worried that substantial payments proposed by local
planning authorities could make new and important developments
unviable. According to the mayor, a handful of local CIL rates proposed
by some London boroughs are now emerging that appear to be
prohibitively high and could jeopardise London’s key
developments coming forward, despite passing the regulatory tests of
viability.</hs_para>

housing—of which I gave a brief outline at the beginning of my
speech—have every incentive to do so, and are not held back by
the unforeseen consequences of statutory definitions that may have been
fit for purpose at the time, but in retrospect turned out to be too
restrictive. I am afraid this is what has happened in the case of the
regulations implementing the CIL. The regulations quite rightly
recognise that we should not increase the burden on those with low or
modest incomes, who are already struggling to find a home they can
afford, by adding what would be a sizeable additional tax. However, the
definitions of relief are so tightly drawn that we now find they do not
cover some of the new and inventive models of affordable housing that
are
emerging.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020444000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0003.htm#13020444000011">I
have mentioned that I was recently approached by a young company that
found a very clever way to build smart new flats in central parts of
London that young singles and couples can buy outright, even if they
are on a modest income. The company wanted to build a small block of
flats in Wandsworth for sale at around £200,000 each. The
council wanted them, the Mayor of London wanted them, and they had a
waiting list of 13,000 would-be buyers who desperately wanted them.
However, as noble Lords may know, Wandsworth was one of the first
London boroughs to implement the new levy, and when these people did
their sums, they worked out that this would add some £10,000 to
the cost of each flat. For a young couple on perhaps £30,000 or
£40,000 a year, who have already been saving for perhaps seven
or eight years for a deposit and have to pay London rents,
£10,000 is an awful lot of money. The company reluctantly had to
conclude that the scheme was unviable, and the plans were
dropped.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020444000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0003.htm#13020444000012">These
were genuinely affordable homes. They were available only to people who
could prove that their salary was below the mayor’s limit for
affordable housing. They were for sale at 20% below the open-market
value, with a maximum price of £225,000. They could only ever be
sold to other buyers who qualified for 
<?notus-xml column=105?>affordable homes. They would remain affordable homes, however many hands
they went through. In fact, they satisfied every condition that my
noble friend’s department sets out in the National Planning
Policy Framework to qualify for affordable housing. Council planners
say that they are affordable houses. The company had built five blocks
of them already before the CIL came into effect. The Mayor of London
agrees that they are affordable houses. DCLG says that they qualify for
the affordable housing enhancement for the new homes bonus—so
one part of the department seems to recognise this while the other does
not. However, when it comes to the community infrastructure levy, they
are treated in exactly the same way as if they were homes for
millionaires. That really cannot be right. The only reason for it is
that, when the regulations were drawn up in 2008, that type of home did
not exist, so it was not included within the narrow definition for
affordable

have recently reviewed the statutory guidance for CIL. It is now
clearer about the relationship between the levy and the implementation
of local plans. The mayor can use the statutory guidance to challenge 
<?notus-xml column=106?>councils if he feels that their rates could put implementation of the
London Plan at risk. Perhaps I may dwell on this point a little
further. The issues within the statutory guidance published in December
2012 make it clear that charging schedules should be consistent and
support implementation of the London Plan. It is also clear that the
ability to deliver viably the sites and scale of development identified
in the local plan should not be threatened. I point the noble Lord
specifically to paragraphs 32 and 33 of the guidance, which refer to
charge-setting in London and

have also encouraged charging authorities to consult for at least six
weeks on their draft charging schedule. This also provides an
opportunity for the mayor to review and challenge proposed rates if
necessary. As I have already said, the challenge can be made, and the
correct place for the challenge is at the consultation and examining
stages, when the mayor can make representations on all borough CIL
charges. An independent public examination stage is also key to CIL.
Any representations can be made to an independent examiner, who must
determine whether the proposed CIL charge is appropriate. We therefore
strongly believe that the impartial role of the examiner is essential,
and the mayor’s role should be to engage with the process rather
than take on additional powers to direct. My noble friend talked
specifically of several London boroughs that have raised concerns and
the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, also spoke specifically of where those
matters have been raised. I am certainly not aware of which London
boroughs have raised those issues but if that information is shared I
am sure that can be looked

to Pocket, which met with my noble friend and my honourable friend Nick

a note with Ministers. My noble friend Lady Hanham mentioned to me that
she was very impressed by the issues raised. On the definition of
affordable housing for CIL, the CIL Regulations 2010 give such a
definition, which was quite tightly drawn. That said, if there are
continuing concerns about the operation of the levy, they will be
listened to. I am sure that as the levy comes more into play and
practice, both in the mayor’s office and at a borough level, we
will continue to look at how best it can be improved. However, turning

81A would introduce a new clause which would allow designation of a

the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. It is difficult
to see how this adds anything to the existing Section 10 of the

Greaves, this already requires the Secretary of State to have regard to

amendment then proposes that a report should be produced annually

decisions on nationally significant infrastructure projects where no
relevant national policy statement had been designated. I suggest that
such annual reports would add a new legislative requirement with no
discernable benefits. It is important to remember that a key factor in
taking decisions on nationally significant infrastructure projects is
the framework set out in national policy statements. Where these
statements are in place, the Secretary of State is generally required
to make decisions on development consents in accordance with them. The
statements include specific policies on the mitigation of, and
adaptation to, climate change.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T21:24:27"></hs_TimeCode>National policy
statements are also subject to a sustainability appraisal before they

implementation of national policy statements is properly
considered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020444000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0003.htm#13020444000036">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T21:25:01"></hs_TimeCode>
addition, most nationally significant infrastructure projects must be
subject to detailed environmental impact assessment, and cumulative
impacts must be considered as part of those assessments. I know that a
number of noble Lords have expressed concern about those situations
where no national policy statement may be in place that relates to a
development requiring consent under the Planning Act 2008. But, in such
circumstances, the Secretary of State must take account of factors that
are both important and relevant when reaching a decision on development
consent for a project.
Such<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T21:25:34"></hs_TimeCode> factors are
very likely to include planning policies as set out in the
Government’s National Planning Policy Framework. A core planning
principle of the framework is for planning to support the transition to
a low-carbon future in a changing climate. In short, I would argue that

Amendment 81C, the National Planning Policy Framework already expects
local councils to adopt proactive strategies to mitigate and adapt to
climate change, in line with the objectives and provisions of the
Climate Change Act 2008. We have set out clear policies in the
framework on how local authorities should support the move to a
low-carbon future. They should do this by planning new development in
locations and ways which reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by actively
supporting energy efficiency improvements to existing buildings and by
having a positive strategy to promote energy from renewable and
low-carbon sources. We have also made it clear that local plans should
take account of climate change over the longer term, including factors
such as flood risk, coastal change, water supply, and changes to
biodiversity and landscape. I am sure that all of this rings pretty
hard with the noble Baroness, who has spent quite a lot of time on all
these issues. I also recognise the work of the Planning and Climate

at<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T21:30:55"></hs_TimeCode> this time of
night I will try to deal with the amendment extremely briefly. As we
discussed earlier, the problem with the planning system is that it
involves more than one consent. In many planning applications there is
an obligation to notify other statutory bodies of the application that
has been made. One of the problems that has emerged from that is the
time taken by those other bodies to respond. In the mean time, of
course, until they have responded, the planning authority cannot get
ahead, which is one of the reasons why planning decisions get
delayed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T21:31:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020447000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0003.htm#13020447000002">Amendment
81CA sets out a procedure by which in appropriate cases the local
authority can charge the consultee for the delay. This, it is hoped,
will never have to be used. Of course, if there is agreement with the
authority that the consultee cannot reply within the 21 days or
whatever is appropriate for that particular consultation, that is
different. If they have agreed a different timetable, that is fine.
However, in many cases they simply do not reply. A disincentive to
delay of that sort, with the prospect of being fined, might in fact
encourage the
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T21:32:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020447000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0003.htm#13020447000003">One

the delays due to consultation. It has been estimated that these delays

are also discussing Amendment 81CB. This is a rather more drastic
amendment, which perhaps at this stage should be regarded as a probing
amendment. Certain of the consultees, the statutory bodies, have the
power to veto applications. Examples have been given—I will not
quote them all—of where a highways authority has said,
“You cannot possibly do that. We will veto it”, and it
does so under a power that has 
<?notus-xml column=113?>been given by the Secretary of State. This amendment is intended to
remove that power of the Secretary of State. It is not right that a
highways authority or whoever should have the right to veto an
application just like that. I can understand that there may have been a
reason for it, but it is one of the reasons why planning applications

will be seen by the Minister as a constructive one. It is supported by
the Local Government Association, of which I am a vice-president but it
is also supported by the water industry, specifically its trade body,
Water UK. The purpose of the amendment is to place a 
<?notus-xml column=116?>requirement on Ofwat to have regard to future housing projections and
demographic growth in adopted local plans. This would give greater
certainty for water companies to invest in the essential
infrastructure needed to support growth. The benefit for
local communities would be more consistent planning such as
investment in new reservoirs, more flexibility between water supply
zones and upgrades to outdated existing infrastructure to cope with
more extreme weather conditions and the increased incidence of drought
and flooding.</hs_para>

has become increasingly clear that accelerated development to support
economic growth, which the Government are committed to delivering, will
stretch the capacity of our infrastructure. We therefore need to
mobilise large-scale, long-term investment in repair, replacement and
renewal of critical infrastructure across the country to provide the
supply that we need. Demand for water is rising, supplies are more
problematic, and flooding is more prevalent—partly as a
consequence of too many of our drainage systems being unable to cope
with the volume of water. I think we would all agree that an improved
water infrastructure is needed to deal with that increasingly volatile

repair and replacement to conserve

key issue is the five-yearly price reviews, which are unhelpful to

projections, to ensure security of supply in the future. The Water
Services Regulation Authority, Ofwat, is the water industry’s
economic regulator for England and Wales. Currently, it reviews prices
every five years and sets the prices that water companies can charge

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for moving the
amendment, which has crept into our Bill. While the aims behind the
amendment are laudable and understandable, we consider that the
proposed amendment to Ofwat’s duties is probably unnecessary. It
duplicates Ofwat’s existing duties, which is not in keeping with
the Government’s principles for economic regulation. Ofwat
already has statutory duties requiring it to protect the interests of
existing and future customers. It is already required to ensure that
water and sewerage companies are able to finance their functions, which
include a statutory requirement to provide an adequate water and
sewerage service to all
premises.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020447000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0003.htm#13020447000030">The

statement. This makes it clear that, in assessing the costs and
benefits of supply-demand options, the focus should be on the best
overall value in terms of long-term resilience rather than a least cost
approach for the short term. This guidance also emphasises the central
role of the water industry in enabling the development required to

areas and sectors that have fared relatively badly since the last
revaluation from those that have fared relatively better. Clearly, the

neither the rental data nor judgments have been subjected to moderation
and validation. Moreover, even on the VOA data given, experts have
questioned whether the data can be used to justify the figures used by
the Government. This has been set out in the briefings we have

2015, at the time of the general election. It is accepted that

clear consequence of postponement will be that those areas and sectors
which have done comparatively poorly since 2008 will be denied for an

that have performed comparatively well will have a postponement of the

values will not necessarily generate a reduction in business rates
because the tax rate—the multiplier—will rise to keep the
aggregate business rates steady. However, if rental values have fallen
across England by 14%, those areas and sectors which have done worse

although retail has held up in some areas, the situation in many high

Smith of Leigh:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to speak to the question
of whether the clause should stand part of the Bill and will try, at
this time of night, to avoid repeating some of the comments made by the
noble Earl, Lord Lytton, and my noble friend Lord McKenzie of Luton.
The significance of this clause is that it breaks the consensual
approach to business rating that has been in place since the Local
Government Finance Act 1988. Here we are, on the eve of the revaluation
which would have taken place later this year, being asked to delay it.
The process of revaluation seems to have been clearly explained in The
Council Tax and Non-Domestic Rating (Demand Notices) (England)
(Amendment) Regulations, which the Government issued in 2012 and which
say:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1302052000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-0003.htm#1302052000036">“All
rateable values are reassessed every five years at a general
revaluation. The current rating list is based on the 2010 revaluation.
Five-yearly revaluations make sure each ratepayer pays their fair
contribution and no more, by ensuring that the share of the national
rates bill paid by any one ratepayer reflects changes over time in the
value of their property relative to others”.</hs_quote>

Lords mentioned the Government’s case about volatility, but
volatility has always occurred whenever we have had a rating
revaluation and we can cope with that. The data we have from the
Valuation Office Agency are pretty sketchy. I will not repeat the
comment about the rather suspicious addition of the 500,000 others who
make the balance of the case. Before that the balance was that there
were more winners than losers. The various revaluations that we have
seen—I got a briefing from Colliers International—show
that in all parts of the country rateable values in the retail sector
seem to have fallen by at least 19%. For the individual centres they
looked at, well over 80% had shown considerable falls, with a third of
them over 25%. By contrast, the West End had shown an increase of 26%.
These figures come from what Colliers calls itsmid-summer review, which
happened last year. If the Government go ahead with this delay, the
retail sector might well refer to this as a midsummer<I>

mentioned the Portas review so I will not go into that again. One
briefing I read also said that a further unintended consequence of the
review could be its impact on property prices over the next couple of
years. In areas of decline, this will put further downward pressure on
prices so that property values fall much further than they might have
if the review had taken place. In areas where property prices have
risen, the effect may be the opposite—property prices would rise
to soak up the impact of the lack of change. By the time we get to the
proposed revaluation two years hence, the amount of turbulence will be
significantly higher than it would have been if we had gone ahead with
it now. Therefore, it is going to take a Government some degree of
courage in 2015 to go ahead with that review if we are going to
implement it. As noble Lords have said, this is a really important
step. The Government need to give us a lot more information, if they
have it, about how they can justify doing this, or we will need to come

would have happened to business rates bills in 2015, but the fact of

parks, 29%; hotels, 6%; theatres, 25%; and pubs, 11%. Retail overall

business rates payers. Both the Government and the Valuation Office

meetings with representatives of those affected by the postponement. I

raise doubts about future rate bills. That is a revaluation as a
statutory exercise. We need to take primary legislation to stop it,
quickly, for 2015. That is why we have moved to include the measures in
this Bill. By placing the date of the next revaluation in the Bill, as
well as the requirement for five-yearly revaluations thereafter, we
have also shown our commitment to keeping rateable values up to date. I

for half an hour or so, was there for two minutes and 40 seconds. Just
one of the representative bodies got a question in and was more or less

allocation of a large proportion of “don’t knows”,

entirely dependent in these things on the information that is provided

number of appeals, it will increase the mutterings of dissatisfaction
and pressure for much more radical change, and it is likely to increase
pressures in relation to investment, particularly in areas that are
really struggling and have been hit quite badly both in terms of the
turnover that they can generate and the values of the premises. The
downward spiral is never at all comfortable for occupiers, landlords or
anybody else. That needs to be recognised because this will produce

the noble Earl said, the Valuation Office report was interesting in
part but the other section, if you look at the detail, seemed to say
that there were no data on which it could really base that finding. The
incredible thing was that all 500,000 of these others were placed as
potential gainers from non-implementing. Not a single one was regarded

the Ministers want a confrontational meeting, a meeting with the
Valuation Office to really understand the basis of those figures might
be helpful for your Lordships. If the Minister would agree to arrange

regulations from last year talked about the fair contribution based
upon property values. The Minister is saying that to avoid turbulence
we are actually going away from that principle. Lots of people would
have gained by a revaluation, mainly in the retail sector but in other
sectors, too. In a sense, they have the certainty that they will pay
rateable values but higher than they should. But with that, I will not

that Sub-Committee E and Sub-Committee F, the two sub-committees

the report is prepared and submitted—at some time, I hope,

study. Access to lawyers was just one of a package or road map of

within the European Union in increasing numbers and, inevitably and
regrettably, some get involved in the criminal justice systems of other

themselves having to deal with unfamiliar legal systems, probably in an
unfamiliar language. Although I do not think we should always assume
that everything we do is better than anything anybody else does,
British citizens finding themselves in that situation in other member
states may frequently find themselves with fewer rights than they could
expect in similar circumstances in the United Kingdom. As I said, in

counter to cross-border crime is to promote mutual recognition of the
judicial decisions made in other member states—that is, the
decision of a judge in one member state to be given effect in another
with the minimum of formality. It is a form of co-operation based on
our practice and it seeks to avoid the disruption of having very
different criminal 
<?notus-xml column=3?>systems across Europe, as would happen if they had gone down the road of
harmonisation. Perhaps the most well known example of mutual
recognition is the European arrest

report accepts, that mutual recognition has its faults and is
incomplete, but the evidence given to us for this inquiry suggested
that it is largely successful. Mutual recognition requires trust
between judges, and so a judge faced with a request for speedy
extradition may be reluctant to agree if he or she thinks that this
will result in the defendant spending long periods in poor prison
conditions awaiting trial or if the trial is likely to be unfair.
Equally, a refusal to extradite on such grounds is likely to be viewed
in the member state making the request as an unwelcome criticism of its
own criminal justice system. The road maps are intended to provide that
trust by ensuring that minimum standards for defendants’ and
victims’ rights are adhered to across the

that such legislation laying down minimum rights is in principle
beneficial, and we supported the proposals. Why, we are sometimes
asked, did we not consider the European Convention on Human Rights or
other international legal instruments to be sufficient? Quite simply,
as the Government acknowledge, the European Union legislation generally
brings greater clarity and is usually capable of better enforcement,
which is lacking in the case of these international instruments.
Members of the Committee will recall, because it was mentioned on many
occasions, that the backlog of cases in the European Court of Human
Rights at the time of writing was more than 150,000, and it is still
more than 100,000. Non-legislative measures such as better judicial
training and better co-operation have a contribution to make but, in
our view, they do not replace the need for legislation. We believe that
the United Kingdom has little to fear or gain from legislation in this
area because, as I said earlier, our standards are generally recognised

have obviously had the opportunity to shape much of this legislation,
which has enabled British citizens travelling abroad to benefit from
improved standards in other states. We recognise, however, that this
remains a sensitive area for European Union activity because of the
very different legal traditions in the different member states. The
case study on the proposal for access to a lawyer demonstrates how the
proposal—or, I should say, a proposal—can be too
ambitious. That led to a situation in which we were not able to support
the idea that the United Kingdom should opt in; indeed, we supported
the Government in their opt-out. I understand that we were not alone in
our concerns. The matter has currently been taken to the European
Parliament, which has submitted some 80 amendments to the general
approach that was agreed in the Council. I understand that
those 80 amendments take us back to square one, if not back
further than that, so the negotiations are still
continuing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T15:42:16"></hs_TimeCode>.

the report sees the area of criminal procedure as one that has made
slow but careful and steady progress. We would like the present

work before we go further. We are wary of road-map measures that might
affect the admissibility of evidence. In practice, we support the

in cases where they have not opted in but stayed involved with the

this report does not pre-empt the opt-out decision and the separate

Clearly the opt-in/opt-out uncertainty creates certain problems. There
is a framework decision which we have already opted into and which was
intended to allow the supervision order that is intended to allow those
who are awaiting trial to spend time on remand in their own country. We
participated in its adoption but we have not implemented it. Many

referred to both sections of the road-map proposals. The report
endorses the proposals, which seem to me to pose three sets of
challenges. The first is what I call the challenge of national amour

to organise our internal criminal justice systems?”. I would
like to turn to that in a minute. Secondly, there is a series of
practical, technical challenges—again, I would like to come back
to that. Thirdly, and for me the greatest challenge, is how to move
further along this road map, building on the achievements of mutual
recognition to date while continuing to encompass the two entirely
different legal traditions, to which my noble friend also referred. The
UK, Ireland, Malta and Cyprus have adopted an adversarial, common-law,
precedent-driven system while the other EU states have
adopted—to a greater or lesser degree—an inquisitorial,
judge-led approach.</hs_para>

inevitable practical difficulties, such as the lengthy pre-trial
detention, although these can be considerable. I declare here an
interest as a trustee of Fair Trials International. I do not speak for
that organisation this afternoon but it has given me some background
information on some of the practical issues here. One of the cases
currently causing Fair Trials concern is that of Corinna Reid. She was
extradited to Tenerife, which is Spanish territory, in 2009; her
daughter was six months old then and being breastfed. Corinna’s
trial is not expected to start until April 2013. After her extradition
Corinna was kept in jail for about a year and then given bail on the
basis that there was hardly sufficient evidence against her. However,
she has not been allowed to leave Tenerife, has struggled to support
herself and has now been separated from her daughter for more than
three years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T15:48:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
While adoption of the European supervision order may have helped in

is not just the practical issues—it is also the impression left

tensions, I want to remind the committee of the case of Amanda Knox, a
US citizen, and Meredith Kercher, a UK citizen, in Perugia, Italy. It
was a messy murder involving two students and perhaps drugs as well.
The US follows the adversarial system that we have here. If
you had looked at the US newspapers you would have been astonished to
see the scale of incomprehension regarding the role and effectiveness
of the Italian judicial system. In my view the vast majority of
the UK population would suffer from the same
incomprehension; and no doubt the reverse is true with the general

turn now to the issue of national amour propre. The report contains
several flattering references to the United Kingdom’s approach

play in raising standards across the EU. We need to be careful about
what we can achieve in this regard. Our lawyers and judges are of
course pleased to be regarded as representing the shining city upon the

give an extreme example to illustrate the dangers of trying to be too

the day that the unlucky Mr de Menezes was shot dead in the Tube by
armed British policemen. The Rio newspapers were outraged; there were
acres of newsprint on the scandal and an inquiry was requested. Yet my
host, a senior and experienced Brazilian businessman, said to me,
“This is because we expect those standards of the UK, but I
estimate that the Rio police probably shoot about 1,000 people a
year—and there is no fuss or commotion whatever”. He went
on to say that they would go on 
<?notus-xml column=6?>shooting them and, despite what had been written about the incident in

underline some of the practical and technical challenges to the
road-map proposals, in particular those concerned with the European
arrest warrant. There can be no doubt that the European arrest warrant
has played an important role in tackling cross-border crime over the
past eight years. However, it is also widely recognised, including by
the Joint Committee on Human Rights, that there have been problems with
the operation of the warrant and that some concrete reforms are needed
to protect against overuse and abuse of the system. The problem most
commonly highlighted is the use of the arrest warrant for minor
crimes—that is, the issue of proportionality. The warrant was
meant to be used to tackle serious crime and terrorism but thousands
are being issued every year now and often for the most minor crimes;
there are about 1,000 a year from the UK alone. This has a
disproportionate effect on the people concerned and wastes vast amounts
of time for the already overstretched police and courts.</hs_para>

recent FTI case. Last year Poland requested the extradition of 23
year-old Natalia Gorczowska to serve a nine-month sentence for
possession of a small quantity of drugs for personal use. The sentence
was received when she was only 17. It was only a suspended sentence,
but the sentence was reactivated because Natalia came to the UK and
forgot to tell her probation officer. The sentence therefore became one
of imprisonment. Since the incident six years ago, Natalia has ceased
to use drugs and has found a job. She now has a home and a baby. Her
extradition has been ordered, which has resulted in her losing all this
and in her son now being taken into care by the UK
authorities.</hs_para>

problems with the arrest warrant that need to be addressed. They
include: first, the power for the courts to refuse extradition or seek
further information where they have sound reason to think that the
person will be subject to mistreatment, arbitrary detention or an
unfair trial in the country that they are sent to; secondly, a power to
delay extradition where the case is not trial-ready to stop people
being extradited long before any decision has been made even to
prosecute, as where such decisions are made people are then held in
prison for months under extremely difficult conditions awaiting trial;
and, thirdly, a power to refuse extradition where the court believes
that it would be more appropriate for the case to be heard in the
UK—the so-called forum bar. Those kinds of changes could prevent
the misuse of what is otherwise a valuable crime-fighting tool, and I
hope that the Government are successful in their current efforts to
persuade other member states to agree to these sensible
reforms.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020419000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000027">I
end as I began by saying that this is a valuable report. As my noble

bigger debate about opting in or out. However, the debate is none the

to give full effect to agreements already reached. The Euroagnostic
among us, of whom I am one, have a concern that the EU’s

is not appropriate to have European Union-wide harmonised criminal
procedural law. Our traditions are extraordinarily different, and it
could create structural confusion and embarrassment if we were to

procedure laws are to some extent different. As our chairman pointed
out, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Boyd of Duncansby, was helpful in
drawing attention to some of those differences. It is certainly right
that we should ensure that the European Union provides minimum rights
for defendants and victims travelling or located in other countries.
That is a common phenomenon because of greater mobility—perhaps
too common. I read in the press the other day that London is the

my mind, it was right that the United Kingdom did not opt into the

explicitly in our protocol on the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union, allowing us to opt into such proposals. That seems to
be the proper approach that we should be taking, on a wider canvas, to
the criminal justice system.</hs_para>

is perhaps worth pointing out that when we considered the issue as an

in any field of European law, as in any field of law, there will be
many measures which could be improved, there will be measures which are
redundant, and there will be measures which are critical to the
functioning of particular parts of our national systems. It is
therefore interesting to note that this 30th report of the EU Committee
does not find any major stumbling blocks in the path of criminal
justice in the UK consequential upon the activities of the European

there is significant benefit to be gained from EU legislation setting
minimum rights for defendants and victims, particularly for British
citizens travelling within the EU who, on the whole, enjoy a high

case-by-case approach to opt in has resulted in the Government opting
into all the proposals for criminal procedure legislation, with the
exception of the proposal for access to a defence lawyer. That is not
yet so formed that it would be viable and would not interfere with the
operation of the criminal justice systems. It is just not clear enough.
However, in other cases, my noble colleagues have indicated the range
of protections available to United Kingdom citizens who find
themselves, for whatever reason, as either victims of or witnesses to a
crime, or indeed as perpetrators of a crime, in countries outside the
United Kingdom. The overall tenor of this report therefore is that
there are no significant problems and that the Government should take a
positive approach in principle to exercising the UK opt-in in relation
to road map
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000040">As
my noble friends have said, the report concludes by drawing attention
to the decision to be made next May in relation to whether the United
Kingdom opts out of the pre-Lisbon EU legislation, including the
European arrest warrant. We are conducting a separate inquiry into that
matter. I make no statement as to whether the United Kingdom should or
should not opt out of the pre-Lisbon measures. As the noble Lord, Lord
Bowness, said, we are still hearing evidence. However, I should like to
revert for a moment to the report—the subject of this
debate—and I draw your Lordships’ attention to the
comment by Professor Spencer in paragraph 113 that an
“unthinkable mess” would ensue were we to opt out of the
EAW.</hs_para>

a stand-alone measure. It has coherence with a number of other vital
measures, and my question for the Government is whether they are now in
a position to enlighten us as to their strategy for dealing with these
matters. In June last, the Government responded that they were
examining the issue. As noble Lords have said, mutual recognition has
proved to be profoundly important for that trust, which is essential to
the international fight against crime and terrorism.</hs_para>

that such is the nature of the world in which we live that crime, which
has always had its international dimensions, is now in its cross-border
dimensions—a major problem for Governments and for the
protection of national interests, including national security, and of
the public good. Over almost 10 years a series of measures has been
agreed by the member states of the EU which has as its purpose the
effective and efficient delivery of a coherent response to the threats
of international crime and terrorism within and without EU borders.
Those measures have included the EAW, a process through which member
states may seek the co-operation of other member states in securing the
arrest of individuals suspected of crime who are resident in that other
state. The UK makes regular use of the EAW, and indeed, in its
published evidence, ACPO recently stated that the EAW was the most
important of all the
measures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000043">Much
is made by some of the fact that the UK receives a very significant
number of requests for extradition of individuals to other member
states and of the cost of the extradition process. The reality is
important. Our ability to extradite rapidly persons who are a threat to
public order and safety in the UK provides a protection for people in
the United Kingdom. It is simply neither possible nor proportionate to
screen every EU citizen coming across borders, yet ACPO statistics show
that in 2011-12 the Metropolitan Police Service received 50 European
arrest warrants for homicide, 20 for rape and 90 for robbery. The
evidence is also available to demonstrate that criminals who take
refuge in the UK do not invariably begin to live lives as model
citizens. They may well reoffend. The EAW, or possibly a similar
process, enables processes through which other states can secure their
return, maybe before further crime has been committed in the UK. There
is a significant public safety benefit to the existence of such mutual
co-operation that is considered in this report—something that
the United Kingdom has consistently
supported.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000044">The
UK made 221 requests to other states in 2011-12 and 93 people were
surrendered to us through that process, the existence of which has
worked to our benefit. Looking back we know that an Algerian national,
Ramda, was arrested in the UK in 1995 in relation to a
terrorist attack on the Paris Metro. France sought extradition—a
process that took 10 years. Mr Ramda spent those 10
years in custody in the United Kingdom at massive cost to the United
Kingdom. When Osman was identified as a suspect in a failed bomb attack
on Shepherd’s Bush Tube station on July 2005, his extradition
under the new mutual co-operation processes saw him surrendered within
three months. He was sentenced to 40 years’ imprisonment for
conspiracy to murder. There is a stark contrast between the 
<?notus-xml column=11?>10 years and the few months that mutual co-operation has
enabled. The capacity for mutual co-operation is a very strong crime
prevention measure that has the ancillary benefit of significant
financial savings when one takes into account the average cost of
keeping a prisoner for a year, which is estimated by the Ministry of
Justice to be in the region of
£40,000.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000045">Under
analogous measures we can seek: orders freezing property or evidence;
confiscation orders; and evidence warrants to obtain objects, documents
and data for use in criminal proceedings. We can transfer prisoners to
serve their sentences in their home country, which brings benefits not
only to the prisoners themselves, who are being restrained in a
language and culture they understand, but also to their families who
can visit them more easily. Non-custodial sentences can be carried out
in the home country, again reducing the cost to the UK taxpayer of such
criminal sanctions. None of these measures is perfect, but the report
shows that there have been significant
improvements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000046">Many
other relevant systems have been created over the years, including
Eurojust and Europol. They include the Schengen information systems and
the potential for joint investigations across Europe. Even if we take
into account the effectiveness of a European arrest warrant, surrender
can occur only when the home country knows that the suspects are in a
particular host country. If the home country does not know where the
suspects are it cannot seek them. The host country does not know that
it has a potentially dangerous criminal on its territory. The system
for the exchange of criminal records, which includes provisions
enabling a court in this country to be informed about and to take into
account similar crimes in respect of which the accused has been
convicted in other member states, is useful. The provisions provide
protection for public safety in respect of people who are identified
for one crime here because, following an exchange of criminal records,
decisions which need to be made about bail et cetera will be informed
by the individual’s previous records, thus enabling individuals
who are a serious threat to public safety to be
detained<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:14:42"></hs_TimeCode>.

European criminal procedure processes, but the report demonstrates that

such

the protocol 36 arrangements should inform the debate which is now
required on whether or not we should opt in. I would emphasise that
there is no guarantee, as I understand it, that we would be able to opt
back in: we can apply to opt back in. This has to be one of the more
important decisions facing us at this time. It will rightfully be
informed by the debate and the vote in both Houses and, indeed, by the
report by the two sub-committees currently working on the issue. Mutual
recognition and the trust which is consequential to it has proved,
however, to be a significant protection for the people of the United

works of the European Union Committee—arguably a less pardonable
admission—but it does strike me as odd that the

preliminary question relates to the stress of the documents on the fact
that British citizens travelling abroad would benefit from a common EU
policy guaranteeing fair and due process in relation to criminal
charges. That of course is right, but is there an implication that
British citizens resident abroad would not be included in that

report dissents from the Commission’s proposal for suspects and
accused persons to have access to a lawyer effectively “as soon

the Council’s road map of 2009 which referred to this right

course a very different position. Unsurprisingly the Government, along
with several other nations’ Governments, share that view, and
the committee subscribes to it, and indeed I endorse that reservation.

the silent canine goes by the name of the European arrest warrant,

has become a live issue in recent months as the Government have
threatened to withdraw from the system despite strong support from a
wide range of organisations for a procedure which has proved to be of
significant value in combating international crime, including terrorism
and other serious offences, as mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady
O’Loan.
European<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:21:46"></hs_TimeCode> arrest
warrants are supported by the police, as one might expect, but also by
organisations such as Fair Trials International and Justice Across
Borders, with the former acknowledging that there may be problems but
arguing for reform rather than abandonment of the system. It supported
the approach of the Scott Baker report on extradition as a basis for
reform. What are the Government doing to promote those

2010-11, EU member states applied for 5,382 European arrest warrants in
the UK, of which 1,149—somewhat under 20%—were granted.
Significantly, however, only 7% of those affected British citizens; the
vast majority were for citizens of other European countries. For our
part, as the noble Baroness pointed out, we have sought 211 warrants
and obtained

any event, it is as well to look at some of the cases. In addition to
the Osman case, to which the noble Baroness referred, it is instructive
to consider the case of Robbie Hughes, who suffered a life-threatening
brain injury in a violent criminal assault. His attackers were
eventually arrested, tried in Greece, convicted and sentenced to four
years’ imprisonment. Without the European arrest warrant, it is
quite possible that they would have escaped justice altogether. Mr
Hughes’ campaigning mother, Maggie, points out that the
interests of victims are in danger of being lost by the
Government’s approach. She noted in an interview in the

what is the Government’s rationale for the policy that they
appear to be adopting, so markedly in contrast to the Lord
Chancellor’s tub-thumping—not to mention
child-smacking—approach to criminal justice and penal policy?
Why are the Government threatening to relinquish a powerful tool to
bring to justice suspected perpetrators of serious crime, some of it
inherently cross-border in nature? Are they more concerned to throw a
bone to the ravening Eurosceptics on their Back-Benches at the expense
of the victims of crime, whether British or citizens of other EU

there are concerns about aspects of the EAW system—and indeed
there are—why have the Government failed to implement the
European supervision order allowing defendants to be bailed to their
home country pending trial, thereby avoiding long periods in custody
abroad of the kind referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson,
before they are dealt with? Admittedly, that has been
a serious problem in some cases. In an age of mass travel and
ever faster-developing internet
communications, crime is becoming ever more
international. It is in everyone’s interest
that criminals be brought to justice, whether their crimes are
economic, violent or take any other

course, within the different systems—adversarial or
inquisitorial, based on common law or Roman law principles—basic
human rights to a fair trial must be a pre-eminent feature of criminal
procedure and the criminal justice system. The UK should be leading the
way to achieve that, not sulking on the sidelines. I agree with the
noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, that this cannot be achieved simply by
example. That is all the more reason to work with others in the EU to
improve the system on the lines adumbrated by the committee, to a
degree by the Government, and by the organisations to which I

interesting that the contributions to the debate endorsed the findings
of the report that co-operation in this area is not the great danger to
our beloved criminal justice system that might be suggested. The noble
Baroness, Lady O’Loan, made the point that, in practice, it has
worked extremely well and to the benefit of British citizens to have a
policy of co-operation and of trying to set minimum standards. I
understand the point of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, about national
amour propre. I always find in our papers there is always scepticism
that any country could have a justice system as fair as ours and that
foreigners are not to be trusted with such matters. However, the more
serious reality is that we have different forms of systems and that
that sometimes makes it difficult to get complete
cohesion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:29:01"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, I take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, that it is
important that we carry public opinion and understanding with us on

number of references have been made to the European arrest warrant.
Again it is a matter of balance. The noble Baroness, Lady
O’Loan, made a number of telling points about the effectiveness
of the European arrest warrant and the fact that it is an important
weapon in the armoury against organised crime, cross-border crime and
other matters in what the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, referred to as an
increasingly mobile continent.</hs_para>

that it is fair to say that we have taken a negative view on that. We
have pointed out, and a number of contributors have raised the fact,
that there are issues about proportionality, dual-criminality and
pre-trail detention that we wanted to discuss to try to get the arrest
warrant improved. That has been our approach. The Home Secretary has
responsibility for the European arrest warrant and it has been
considered as part of the Scott Baker review. The Government’s
response to that review is to take the opportunity of the 2014 opt-out
decision to work with the European Commission and other member states

Maclennan, warned and underlined that, in these areas, we cannot have
complete harmonisation and that the case-by-case approach that the
Government have taken has been right but that EU legislation adds
value. My experience in the Ministry of Justice over the past two and a
half years, as the report itself reflects, is that we have taken a very
pragmatic and positive view in decisions in this area. The idea that

including the existence of the emergency brake. The UK and Ireland have
the additional safeguard of the opt-in. We agree that it is a difficult

appropriate balance. Again, I take on board the noble Lord's argument

supervision order is unlikely to help to avoid lengthy pre-trial
custody in cases where an EAW has been used to secure the return of the

to secure the return, the suspect has shown himself to be a flight

the report. As I said, it shows the committee’s practice of
employing detailed scrutiny and careful analysis. Criminal procedural
rights reflect long traditions which have been developed carefully and

concern, ensuring that offences can be properly and effectively

are built into the treaty to ensure that the differing legal traditions
of member states are respected. In addition, the UK opt-in applies in
this area. We think that, in principle, minimum rules concerning the
rights of individuals in certain areas of criminal procedure and the
rights of victims of crime can help to facilitate judicial co-operation
and mutual recognition—a point made by my noble friend Lord
Maclennan. These measures are intended to build greater trust among the
competent authorities of the EU member states which are charged with
acting on decisions made in other member states by giving them greater
confidence that the decisions were made against a background of minimum
standards.</hs_para>

order to ensure that all legislation in this area is appropriate and

forward only in accordance with the treaties; where there is a
convincing evidence-base for the need for such legislation; and where
it is a proportionate response to an identified problem. This is an
area in which there has been progress within the EU in recent years.
The criminal procedural rights road map was agreed at the end of 2009
and subsequent legislative proposals have been brought forward by the
European Commission. Furthermore, the Budapest road map, agreed in June
last year, focuses on strengthening the rights and protection of
victims of crime. So far, the Commission has brought forward six
legislative proposals in this area and four directives have been
adopted. We expect up to three further instruments to be proposed this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:38:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in its report, the UK already has a high standard of criminal
procedural rights. This has been noted by the Commission, which has
taken inspiration from our systems and procedures. The directive on the
right to information clearly draws upon the PACE notice of rights and
entitlements provided to suspects in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland. The directive on the rights of victims of crime was also
inspired by our practice. We have found that we can participate in most
proposals in this area without having to make substantial changes to UK
law and practices. The changes that we need to make to implement the
victims directive are largely aligned to our domestic reform
objectives—that the needs of victims are put first across the
criminal justice system. We welcome the committee’s
consideration of the potential added value of EU legislation in this
area. The committee notes that in certain areas the EU legislation can
be of real practical benefit to UK nationals travelling abroad if they
become subject to the criminal justice systems of other member states,
either as victims or as suspects. My noble friend Lord Maclennan and
the noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan, made that point.</hs_para>

committee’s examination of the potential disadvantages of
measures in this area: namely, the disruption to diverse and sensitive

The Government approach proposals on a case-by-case basis with a view
to maximising our country’s security, protecting
Britain’s civil liberties and preserving the

very helpful report. Despite the rather intemperate rant of the noble

which we have gone about these areas has been pragmatic and
analysis-based—where the Government have been more in keeping
with the traditions of your Lordships’ European Union Committee
than the noble Lord suggested. We have a good practical record. Where
we have questioned, looked for amendments or waited before making a
final decision, those actions have been based on good policy grounds,
not on any kind of ideological motivation or hostility to the process.

answer to why it merits two reports lies at the beginning of this
follow-up report that we have produced. The tourism industry in this
country is worth £115 billion a year. That is
somewhere in the region of 8% of GDP. It is a fast-growing industry; it
is projected to grow by something like 2.6% in the course of the next
10 years or so, faster than the majority of other sectors in the UK. We
know from surveys that something like 80% of those coming to this
country do so because they want to see and experience our cultural
heritage. Yet, as the news of Hadrian’s Wall
illustrates, every extra footfall in these areas actually creates
immense problems, whether it is dust in museums, turning the pages of
books or what have you. We need a continuous programme of conservation

first report in 2006, which I chaired, coined the term “heritage
science” as being that area where science and humanities
overlap. It is a multidisciplinary area, affecting both what is termed
movable and immovable heritage, from things such as Stonehenge, which
is perhaps the ultimate in immovable heritage, to digital technologies
such as blogs and websites—an example not just of a movable
heritage but almost of a virtual heritage.</hs_para>

main areas where we made recommendations. In the first place,
we put recommendations to universities and research councils. Largely
by serendipity, Britain in the 1970s had taken the lead in this area of
science and the application of new scientific ideas to the preservation
of cultural heritage, but those scientists who entered the sector
during the 1970s and the early 1980s were now ageing, and we needed
badly to renew the seedcorn if we were to maintain our leading global
position. So we called on the research councils, particularly the AHRC
and the EPSRC, to put together a joint programme of research that would
both help to develop new ideas and, most importantly, bring on new
talent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:50:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000094">We
were also conscious that the EU was developing the area within the
framework programmes and that there was a need for Britain to play a
strong hand

resources that were available through them.</hs_para>

second area of recommendation was to DCMS, where we found a failure of
leadership. Even though it was the department responsible for cultural
heritage, we found that its published objectives made
no reference whatever to conservation or sustainability. Our
recommendations were that the department should write these objectives
firmly into its mission statement and make its arm’s-length
bodies—the big museums, galleries, English Heritage, the British
Library, the National Archives—aware of the importance that is
attached to these objectives. It should appoint a chief scientific
officer who could provide the leadership that we felt was so lacking in
the
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:51:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000097">Thirdly,
we made recommendations to the heritage science community. We found it
much too fragmented between the large players—the big museums
and galleries and so on—and the small museums and galleries;
between the National Trust on the one hand and English Heritage on the
other; and between individual conservators and the universities. Each
group had its own agenda and was, if you like, singing from its own
hymn sheet rather than singing in unison. We argued that they needed to
sing in unison and, essentially, our message was for them to get their
act together, develop a national strategy—which, in effect,
becomes a single hymn sheet—and sing from that single hymn
sheet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:52:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000098">The
purpose of the follow-up inquiry was to review the implementation of
the recommendations in the first report. During February/March last
year we had seven sessions of evidence from both those who had given
evidence to the first inquiry and the Ministers and research councils
to whom the recommendations had been addressed. By and large it is a
very good news story: there had been a positive response to those
recommendations. The Arts and Humanities Research Council and the
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council had responded to the
challenge of the report, and in 2007 had launched the science and
heritage research programme. This was widely recognised as a shot in
the arm for the sector: it brought new research and brought on new
young researchers. Above all, it put Britain back on the global map as
a research leader, which was instanced by the fact that Britain fairly
rapidly took the leadership of the European joint programme
initiative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:53:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000099">DCMS
responded by rewriting its objectives. Its business plan has as its
first objective to protect our nation’s cultural heritage and to
ensure that the historic environment is properly protected and
preserved for future generations. In 2008 it appointed a chief
scientific officer. Admittedly, the person concerned was not, as we had
hoped originally, a scientist but was an economist from the Treasury.
However, she rose rapidly to the challenge, took a substantial interest
in the area and, most importantly, established a new
committee for DCMS—the Science and Research Advisory
Committee—to advise the department and its Ministers and to
identify the scientific issues that might impact upon
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T16:54:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

person concerned, left the department in 2010 and had not been replaced
when we took evidence from the department this time last year. At that
point the department was somewhat vague about whether or not it was

her.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000101">In her
absence, the Science and Research Advisory Council had, as Rick
Rylance, the director of RCUK and the chief executive of the AHRC,
observed, somewhat lost its energy. By the time that we took evidence
from it DCMS, having responded initially fairly positively, was not, we
felt, completely on the ball, although I have to admit that Mr John
Penrose, who was the Minister who responded at the time, took a
positive line and clearly felt that that the committee’s
recommendations were good and wanted to co-operate to see what the
department could do, although the department was at the time dominated

third set of recommendations went to the community itself, the rather
narrow community of scientists who work in the conservation and
heritage sector. We found it to be a very fragmented community. We
recommended that it come together to produce the strategy document.
That took some time. English Heritage was extremely co-operative and
provided the secretariat for it, but it was not until 2008 that we
began to see the strategy taking form. It took its time over it. We put
together a survey of different parts of the sector but eventually, by
2009, we had a form of strategy. Edward Impey from English Heritage,

reassured from the evidence that we received from the AHRC. Its 2011-15
delivery plan earmarked heritage for specific support and included the
AHRC’s innovative training programme for postgraduates and
early-career researchers. In the EU framework programme, Horizon 2020,
we had seen both BIS and the research councils being extremely
supportive of cultural heritage, making sure that in both Challenge 5
in that programme—climate change, resource efficiency and raw
materials—and Challenge 6—Europe and the

a leading role in the joint programme initiative, which is a joint
initiative between countries of the EU. However, those answers have all
come from the AHRC, which affirmed its position as the champion for
heritage research. Where is the EPSRC? It continues to support the
joint programme but has not supported the science and heritage bid put
forward by 14 academic and 14 non-academic institutions to develop a
multidisciplinary doctoral training centre. Again, where is the Natural
Environment Research Council here? It declined to join the original
programme on science and heritage back in 2008, in spite of its

multidisciplinary research. The AHRC does not have the clout or the

Minister that, while many good things have emerged from the joint
science and heritage research programme, research leadership
cannot be maintained without investment and, in this multidisciplinary
area, this investment has to come from collaboration among the research
councils. I hope that he will bring these remarks to the attention of
his colleagues in BIS. To date they have been highly supportive of this
area and have rewarded its recognised high standing in Europe, but that
high standing is at risk if the science-based research councils do not

concern is the continuing failure of DCMS to grasp the nettle and
demonstrate adequate leadership. Both in our 2006 report and in its
update in 2007, we called on DCMS to include the conservation of
cultural heritage in its departmental objectives and to provide
“moral leadership” to the community. Since then, as I
have already noted, DCMS has amended its objectives to include the
protection and preservation of the nation’s cultural heritage.

shows, among those giving evidence to us there was widespread criticism
of DCMS itself and, above all, of its failure to provide leadership in
the sector. The department for its part has argued that it effectively
delegates these responsibilities to its arm’s-length
bodies—to the museums and galleries and to English
Heritage—and,
further<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T17:02:45"></hs_TimeCode>, that it

that the funding agreements between DCMS and its major

leadership issue there is the whole question of the chief scientific

who took up his post in September 2012. Again, he is an economist from
the Treasury rather than a natural scientist but the hope is that, like
his predecessor, he will prove sympathetic to the need to carry forward
the research in this area. The Science and Research Advisory Committee
will play an important part in this, yet to date it has failed to meet
under the new CSA. A meeting was scheduled for September but was
cancelled because he had only just arrived. The December meeting,
again, was cancelled. Is it proposed to continue with the SRAC and, if
so, what will its mandate be and how is it proposed to fit alongside

third area of concern is the development of the national heritage
science strategy and its successor, the national heritage science
forum. While congratulating the sector on managing to co-ordinate its
disparate parts in backing the strategy, the committee noted that, as a
strategy, it failed to identify any clear targets or timings for
actions to be taken. Rather, having willed the establishment of the
forum, it passed the buck back to the forum without clearly identifying
how it was to take this forward.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T17:05:35"></hs_TimeCode> forum is
moving forward quite nicely. At the moment it has five definite
members, five people lined up to join and four who may be going to
join. If the community is going to grasp the nettle and take forward

emphasising that in all three areas this is a multidisciplinary area

to DCMS, please recognise your leadership role in this sector. It is
easy for such a fragmented community to play one sector off against
another. Please, now that the Olympics are over, recognise the

improvement in the coherence of the heritage sector since our first

careers for young people. However, the Department for Culture, Media
and Sport still seems to be unwilling to have a more direct leadership
role in the encouragement of heritage science, despite its importance
to our flourishing tourist industry and to other sectors such as the
arts and crafts industry. Moreover, it still does not seem to envisage
a clear role for the chief scientific adviser and, while opting out of

is about its lack of leadership in relation to the Government’s
educational policy, where it seems to have exercised little influence
in favour of a broader curriculum. The Government’s education
policy is prescribing an ever-narrowing curriculum for schools, which
is largely exam-based with a heavy emphasis on academic subjects. The
proposed EBacc includes no room for creative subjects, which underpin
not only the appreciation of music and art but also commercial success
stories such as our flourishing fashion industry. Design studies, for
example, which are exercises in problem-solving and lateral thinking
and will be increasingly important in our rapidly changing
technological society, are also excluded from the new curriculum. I
wonder how the DCMS has been attempting to influence some of that
rather narrow view of education. In its educational policies the
Government are rapidly turning back not just to the 20th century but to
the 19th century, with its emphasis on rote learning and the
regurgitation of undigested lumps of information. I was fortunate
enough to go to a school that was founded in the 1890s in direct
opposition to the narrow education then available in the boys’
public schools. Bedales valued not only art and music but crafts and
outdoor skills, such as farming and gardening, as being of equal
validity to academic subjects. I still have a bookcase that I made

other countervailing trend of the 19th century, of course, was the arts
and crafts movement, with its emphasis on quality and design. Again, I
declare a personal interest as one of my ancestors was a distinguished
architect of the Whitechapel Art Gallery, the Horniman Museum and the
Bishopsgate Institute. All three buildings were dedicated to increasing
access to art and learning and crafts for all. The education policies
of the Government appear to be narrowly directed at preparing a
minority of pupils for university and not for any of the alternative
careers that might be in the heritage sector, such as training in
crafts and design, and without any appreciation of the technical skills
that underpin engineering, architecture and our flourishing fashion

century again, an interesting and well researched theory is that the
great engineering and entrepreneurial successes of the Victorian era
were specifically created by those excluded from universities, such as
non-conformists and Quakers. Many talented people have skills that are
not nurtured by a university education. The narrowing of the school
curriculum will inhibit the creativity and flexibility that will be
increasingly needed by the heritage sector and other sectors in our
society if this country is to cope with the increasingly difficult
times ahead. I urge the DCMS to take a more active role in influencing
government policy, not only because heritage, science and the creative
arts enrich individual lives but because they can underpin the future
prosperity of this country. We should be fostering enterprise rather

way in which she chaired the original report, which was described at
the time as something of a wake-up call. I am not convinced that it was
a wake-up call for the DCMS but it was certainly a wake-up call for the
heritage science
community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T17:12:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

report have been impressive. If we look at the joint science and
heritage programme of the AHRC and the EPSRC, we can see very positive
results. There is now a national heritage science strategy, developed
by a steering group, and, as we have heard, a National Heritage Science
Forum is being set up. These are attributes arising directly from the
first report. The follow-up report, as we have heard from my noble
friend, was to review implementation, not just by the Government but by
the research councils and the heritage science
community—museums, galleries, libraries and those who look after
historic buildings and
archives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-04T17:13:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000121" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000121">The
AHRC deserves many congratulations for the way in which it has carried
the baton for research in this area. Like my noble friend, I have to
say that I am less convinced that the performance of the EPSRC and the
NERC has been quite so impressive. It is a concern that the EPSRC seems
unwilling to provide opportunities for heritage science to compete for
resources for doctoral training and capital equipment. That makes one
wonder if research councils will not be working together in the way in
which they did originally when they were facing the danger of
fragmentation of this interdisciplinary research area, which after all
was the problem identified in the original report of 2005-06. I agree
with my noble friend that the AHRC as a small research
council—indeed, the smallest—will find it hard to sustain
sole
responsibility.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_04_PT_1/6D843E1E32AC25A7FFEBB5DEF4699274DF106C6C" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 February 2013">Monday,

scope of science heritage suggested to us in the original report, and
contended to be the case, is that DCMS must clearly be the appropriate
department to provide what we described as moral leadership, and that
continues to be the case. After all, the department leads on cultural
heritage and it interacts with English Heritage and many national
museums and galleries. There are of course some parts of our national
cultural 
<?notus-xml column=26?>heritage for which DCMS is not the lead department. In the Chamber on
Friday we debated the Antarctic Bill, one provision of which is to
allow the Government to help with the conservation of the Antarctic
huts—Scott’s, Shackleton’s and others. Admittedly,
that is a very small part of our conservation heritage but it is the
responsibility of the Foreign Office. Defra has responsibility for Kew,
which has an enormous responsibility for cultural heritage. The
herbarium, the library and the seed banks are very much part of our
culture and that of other countries. You cannot enforce the Convention
on Biological Diversity without going back to the specimens collected
over many hundreds of years and held in our archives. Defra is, of
course, fulfilling the responsibilities there.</hs_para>

is not for it to tell arm’s-length bodies how specific funds
allocated to them should be spent, I agree. However, I have to say in
parenthesis that that is precisely what Defra is doing at Kew now,
where it seems to be requiring every item of capital expenditure, even
of quite small sums, to be passed across it first. That is very
frustrating for the trustees at Kew, of which I am no longer one. Going
back to DCMS’s role as the promoter within the Government and
champion of heritage science, while I recognise that it is not there to
tell arm’s-length organisations what to do, it has a particular
responsibility in helping to co-ordinate the approach to attracting EU
funding and ensuring that future framework programmes meet our needs
appropriately, as well as those of our partners in Europe. I believe
objectives could be set for DCMS in this area without in any way
getting in the way of the arm’s-length bodies.</hs_para>

programme, programme 7, has as one of its themes the adaptation of
heritage to future challenges such as climate change, digitisation,
resource efficiency, the use of raw materials, the development of new
technologies and the dissemination of best practice. If we think about
it, many of these areas require an input from the engineering
discipline, as well as from many others. That brings us back to the
requirement to make sure that there is a wide spread of input from the
research base, including from the EPSRC. I understand that the existing
joint programme initiative under framework programme 7, which is

congratulate those members of the National Heritage Science Forum who
have set up a transitional body to draw up a vision defining its
strategic aims and potential impact. Looking at the organisations which
we know will be joining this forum, such as English Heritage—of
which I am sure we will hear more in a moment—the National
Trust, the British Museum and the British Library, it gives a lot of

Andrews:</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to contribute to this
debate. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, for the leading role
that she has played in the first report and in the committee’s
work to essentially make science and heritage more visible. That was
the task and I believe that it has been and is being
achieved.</hs_para>

of my personal interests: first, I declare an interest as chair of
English Heritage, in the conservation of our extraordinary diverse
heritage in this country; and, secondly, in seeing that science serves
every conceivable cultural and economic purpose. The noble Baroness,
Lady Sharp, and I overlapped for a while as academics in the science
policy research unit in Sussex, and she played a key role there in
leading the design of research
programmes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000128">However,
English Heritage is not only an adviser to government: it is
essentially a major contributor to the field of heritage science. We
are therefore hugely indebted to the Select Committee for the
consistent and relentless attention that it has focused on this
relatively neglected critical area of work for the past six years. As
we know, the work started in 2006 and the follow-up report today very
usefully charts the progress made. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, set
out comprehensively where progress has been made and referred to some
of the issues that we still have to
address.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000129" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000129">I do
not believe that it is possible to overemphasise the importance of
science in the successful protection and public enjoyment of our
heritage, covering everything from the conservation of the boots worn
by sailors on the “Mary Rose”, which are on display in
the Mary Rose museum, to the conservation of wartime
airfields.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000130">The
first report of the Select Committee explained that science is an
essential instrument and support for those who work with the portable
remains of the past—in museums, libraries and galleries and
their collections—and for those, such as English Heritage, who
work with fixed remains such as historic buildings, archaeology on land
and sea and historic townscapes and landscapes. In each respect,
science helps us to detect and locate the evidence, and to analyse,
conserve, interpret and understand it better. I am reminded that

shall give a couple of examples which reflect the way in which science
and technology are opening up our knowledge and understanding of, for
example, our pre-history. Last year, English Heritage funded a
high-tech survey of the standing stones at Stonehenge. It is a monument
that has been in the care of the nation since 1918 and one might
therefore have thought that there were very few secrets left to reveal.
However, the application of a new three-dimensional laser scanning
technique revealed a plethora of previously unrecognised carvings on
the stones, including 71 images of Bronze Age axe heads. Most
importantly, it revealed significant differences in the way that
particular stones were shaped and worked, leading archaeologists
to  suggest a far greater emphasis than had hitherto been 
<?notus-xml column=28?>placed on views through the monument during the winter solstice as well
as the more familiar summer
solstice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000132">Today
we had an equally brilliant demonstration of the exceptional power of
heritage science to write, or possibly rewrite, history. We have this
morning learnt that, beyond all reasonable doubt, the skeletal remains
uncovered last year in a modest Leicester car park are indeed those of
Richard III, buried in the former Franciscan friary church. The
evidential trail announced at a press conference this morning is
compelling. Geophysical surveys helped fix the location of the
excavation which uncovered the grave; radiocarbon assay provided a date
of 1455-1540 for the bones; osteoarchaeological analysis suggested a
male in his twenties or thirties, confirmed scoliosis—curvature
of the spine—and revealed blade injuries at the base of the
skull which were almost certainly fatal; and, finally, DNA analysis
confirmed that the skeleton was related genetically to the last two
direct descendants of the lost king. That is pretty effective and
pretty
convincing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000133">However,
if anyone really wants to see science at the frontiers of knowledge, I
can recommend no better place to visit than our own scientific
laboratories at Fort Cumberland, run by English Heritage. There, you
will see science at the geographical and intellectual frontiers, with
analysis of DNA from Roman infanticides, the dates of the introduction
of historical cereal and game species to England, and the development
of X-radiographic dating of historic windows. It is an extraordinary
place and I should be very happy to arrange a visit if anyone wanted to
go.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000134">Therefore,
science and heritage are giving us ever greater insights into our
ancestors. They are helping us to conserve monuments with far greater
sensitivity than in the days when concrete was slapped on everything,
and we are still digging out that concrete. They are also helping us to
create greater wealth. All that is taken for granted in the importance
that the Select Committee has attached to scientific knowledge and
technology in terms of heritage. Its reports in 2006 and 2007 set out
that economic and cultural importance.</hs_para>

Lady Sharp, said, the committee set out a raft of crucial
recommendations for better leadership and better co-ordination of
resources, and the need for a national strategy for science and
heritage, as well as a forum. As she said, the current report
acknowledges that there is a great deal of good news to be celebrated.
However, as has also been made clear, there is some way to go. It is
true that the AHRC has done some excellent and ground-breaking work
with its successful science and heritage programme. It is, for example,
looking at major research projects on conservation matters as diverse
as flood resilience and renaissance sculpture. Very importantly, it has
addressed the challenging issue of future capacity by encouraging
post-doctoral studentships and collaborative awards. As the noble
Baroness said, it is beginning to put us back on the map as a global
leader. The national heritage science strategy is indeed a
reality—the final report in 2010 set that out—as is the
national heritage science forum, which is intended to implement the
strategy by bringing these diverse organisations together.</hs_para>

action. We have heard about the DCMS and the very welcome appointment
of the head of analysis. Incidentally, we hope that the holder of that
post is going to act as an advocate and a champion for heritage
science. The DCMS is committed to unlocking philanthropic funding. It
is also committed to the fact that heritage is embedded in the
objectives for Horizon 2020, the European framework funding programme.
We also talked about the new programmes from the AHRC, such as Living
with Environmental Change and Connected Communities. RCUK has provided
welcome support for funded programmes and for the encouragement of bids
from the independent research organisations. I am pleased to say that
in our sector the heritage science communities are showing welcome
signs of increasing partnership and collaboration. We have seen
seed-core funding from the AHRC to support the national heritage
science forum, and we welcome early sign-up by bodies , including the
National Archives, the National Trust, ICON, University College London
and English Heritage. All that is good news. In part, it is a response
to the reduction in the resources available in many areas. There is a
tangible increase in the appetite for working together.</hs_para>

questions raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, deserve answers. I
endorse the questions that she raised, as well as those asked by the
noble Earl, Lord Selborne, in relation to the EPSRC and the role of the
science research councils. There is clearly important work to be done
in collaboration on the science base. There remain questions about the
degree to which the momentum created by the science and heritage
programme will be supported further. I think that there are also
questions to be answered by the DCMS in its leadership capacity. As yet
there is no central means of consistently measuring the health of the
heritage science community itself. Again, I think that that comes back
to the DCMS and its leadership role.</hs_para>

which should now be emerging from its formative stage will need to
demonstrate leadership and secure long-term sustainable funding and
membership support to ensure that it can deliver on its potential.
There is work to be done here by the DCMS, the research councils and
the heritage bodies. I believe that there is certainly the will to do
that because of the knowledge that there is a great deal at stake here.
We at English Heritage are fully committed to the recommendations of
the report, and I can explain briefly how we are meeting the challenges
that we face in terms of our own contribution.</hs_para>

significant steps to implement the strategy. It is a fundamental tenet
of the national heritage protection plan, which guides the
prioritisation of all our resources, and which we are optimistic will
increasingly act as a framework for all organisations that protect our
heritage. We take the need for collaboration extremely seriously. This
lies at the heart of our post-CSR organisational restructuring,
despite, as we have heard from my noble friend Lady Hilton, a severe
cut in our funding. Crucially, we have retained our science expertise
almost untouched because we recognise its strategic value for
capacity-building in the sector, as well as the leading research
expertise, which represents unique expertise.</hs_para>

our decision to move away from the chief scientist model in favour of a
fully integrated and regularly convened science network within English
Heritage, which is better able to co-ordinate information on foresight,
knowledge and gaps in practice, in support of the national heritage
protection plan—a much more diffuse model. Collaboration is also
written into our own English Heritage strategy, which we have produced
this year, and which is in part in response to the committee’s
recommendations. It is driving our increasingly close work with the
research councils: we have a concordat with the AHRC, joint workshops
and a collaborative doctoral partnership. All that will help to build
capacity.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13020419000141" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000141">We
are now in a different and more challenging climate. Almost all the
publicly funded bodies responsible for heritage science are working
with reduced resources. That will impact on the speed and scope of what
we can achieve. However, the committee is right to urge the forum to
provide clear leadership to encourage wider membership and the right to
exhort greater public engagement. However, I hope that that call will
be heard beyond the forum to the funders and supporters who could
enable the forum to achieve greater things. Increasing membership of
the forum itself will respond to that because there is a will to do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000142" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000142">I
recognise that this is a personal aside but it is central to our
understanding of the heritage of science in this country: I personally
believe that it is essential that the Royal Institution continues its
outstanding work in terms of scientific knowledge and understanding,
which has been its unique role for two centuries. In my early days as
an academic with Professor Roy MacLeod, I spent a lot of time in the
archives of the Royal Institution working on the papers of Don Tyndall,
a physicist, and Thomas Archer Hirst, the mathematician. I have a deep
affection for the place, its collections and its history. The
scientific community, as it should, is rallying around with great
distinction to help the RI find a solution to its current problems, not
least in terms of the work that it does to spread the understanding of
science among young and old alike. It is impossible to imagine our
scientific heritage without the Royal Institution in place, and I
sincerely hope that it will get the support and resources that it
needs—not least, naturally, the support of the
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020419000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020419000143">I

is quite rare for committees to invent things or coin phrases. One
thinks about camels and horses, but it seems clear that the committee
invented “heritage 
<?notus-xml column=31?>science” as a brand or an identifier for the sort of work that it
wanted to see happen and where it had found gaps in the past, and we
must be very grateful to it for doing that. Trying to identify
a new area or new discipline is very difficult, but where science and
heritage overlap is obviously a bit of a dark space, and it has been
brought into the light and some work has been generated around
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020423000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020423000003">The
common theme that has wound through all the contributions so far in
this debate has been the way in which the speakers have come across the
heritage sector and, more generally, the cultural sector because,
although this debate is about heritage, it seems to be picked up in a
number of different sectors, including museums and galleries, not
necessarily of “heritage” in the physical sense. The
common theme appears to be that this is a very fragmented sector and,
although funding had been reasonably good until the recent downturn, it
is now suffering badly from the fact that it is being underfunded and
is seeing a number of its previous groups and supporters pull back
because they themselves are also having trouble with their funding.
This is obviously a problem. Therefore, it is good not only that we
have this supplementary report but that we have an opportunity to
discuss it, because there are important issues at stake here.</hs_para>

the importance of science in relation to the work for which she is
responsible and in relation to the sector in general. Her wonderful and
very timeless example of Richard III, which brought us up to
date on how science can help with the conservation, understanding and
illumination of the history we are engaged in, as well as engaging
audiences—both tourists and our own citizens—is a
brilliant way of getting us into this

Lady Sharp, mentioned recommendation 1. This relates to the concern
about the link across to the research councils—in particular,
the AHRC, which has done a great job in developing a programme here.
However, difficulties have been found in the EPSRC and now the NERC as
well. The response provided by the department indicates that the

are weasel words, perhaps, because inflation has eroded that

Minister tell us where the cuts have actually occurred in the areas for

which concerns the relationship between the department and its
arm’s-length bodies, the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, and others
mentioned the great need in this fragmented sector for leadership from
the department. The committee recommended that before the next round of
funding negotiations with arm’s-length bodies, the DCMS should
set specific departmental objectives for heritage science related to
its departmental objectives to protect our nation’s cultural
heritage. Similarly, the ALBs should set out how they will help to
achieve these objectives in funding agreement negotiations with the
department.</hs_para>

DCMS appears to have watered down its approach to this by saying that
it is setting out principles. Only one of them, as we have been
reminded, deals with heritage science. Can the Minister give us more
detail on why this has happened and the reasoning that led to the
decisions that flowed from that; for example, limiting the cuts to the
museums to 15%—they are still cuts—and restricting
English Heritage’s activities to a rather narrower group? The
response goes on to assert that,</hs_para>

may be clear but can the Minister explain why the department has not
taken up the committee’s suggestion that it requires ALBs to set
out how they will help to achieve those objectives and why these
aspirations are not included in the funding agreements? After all, if
they are not in documentation and therefore not being measured, it is
highly unlikely that the DCMS will be able to put any pressure at all

the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, made a number of points about the chief
scientific adviser role mentioned in the original report. Indeed, the
supplementary report says that the failure to find the resources to
enable the appointment of a CSA would amount to “negligent
short-termism”, which is fairly tough phraseology. The committee
is clearly of the view that the department should have a CSA and I
think that the DCMS’s response here is very limp. Appointing an
undergraded principal adviser and not a chief scientific adviser is not
sufficient. To misquote Wilde, one economist might be forgiven but two
in a row seems negligent in the extreme. They are supposed to be
scientific officers and to lead with expertise and knowledge in this
area. I have nothing against economists—many of my friends are
economists—but they do not necessarily have this kind of
expertise. Certainly they would have been at a bit of a loss in digging
up Richard III from the concrete under which he was buried. These are
trivial examples; nevertheless, if this is going to be done properly,
surely the department must get a grip and find a position, and a budget
to go with it, that will support the aspirations
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020423000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020423000010">We
are not only talking about this report today: the report of the Science
and Technology Committee sets out what should be the role and functions
of departmental chief scientific advisers. Now that we have a second
appointment, can the Minister confirm that the scientific adviser is
carrying out all or most of the functions outlined in that
report—for example, policy involvement, including sign-off,
access to Ministers, membership of key committees, access to a
dedicated fund to commission 
<?notus-xml column=33?>research or to convene a group of experts and a formal role in
decision-making about departmental spending on research? Does he or
she—it is a he this time, I think—have staff to support
his work and, if so, how many? Those are the minimum criteria required
for chief scientific advisers and, if we are not going to get the full
post—clearly there will be some reduction—I hope that the
aspiration will be there to ensure that this post delivers what is
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020423000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204-gc0001.htm#13020423000011">On
recommendation 7, the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, drew attention to the
fact that the committee is keen for the DCMS to facilitate access to
European funds, and he particularly mentioned programme 8. The response
indicates what has been going on here. Obviously there has been some
valuable work but it concludes that the Government believe that
cultural heritage research can now expect strong support from EU
funding through Horizon 2020. Can the Minister update us on what has
happened? Has there been any strong support and, if so, what form does
that

13 suggests that a forum should be set up to facilitate the development
of a digitisation framework to promote and manage the overall
digitisation in the sector. This is a complex and important area, as my
noble friend Lady Andrews mentioned, and it plays into a number of
points made by my noble friend Lady Hilton on education. Nothing will
generate more interest and enthusiasm among our younger audiences than
making sure that what is done is done at a level at which they will
want to engage and understand. The Government’s response is,
again, slightly disappointing. They said—this was picked
up—that they do not wish to impose a top-down, centralised
structure to any digitisation framework. We can sympathise with that,
but that is not the recommendation. It was not to have a top-down
direction but to have a facilitation role. Can the Minister explain why
the department has chosen not to get involved in this or, if it has, to

Sharp of Guildford for initiating this debate and I pay tribute to
members of the committee for their continued focus on this important
area, without which advances in science heritage would certainly not
have been as extensive as they have been. I say to my noble friend Lady
Sharp that this is a far from obscure area. It is in no small part due
to the work of the committee and the reports it has produced that the
crucial link between heritage and science is now better recognised and
better understood. What impeccable timing today for the confirmation
that it is Richard III, which was also referred to, and what advances
have been made.</hs_para>

efforts to digitise our cultural heritage and to increase public
engagement with heritage science. We will offer support where
appropriate. The responsibility on the DCMS’s
arm’s-length bodies to care for collections and heritage assets

committee’s report, the first recommendation of your Lordships
was on research councils. The Government welcome the priority that the
Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council have given to heritage. I am mindful of what
the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, said about difficult
times. I replay to him that the Government have demonstrated our strong
commitment to science and research by protecting its programme budget
within BIS with a flat-cash, ring-fenced settlement of
£4.6 billion per annum over this spending review
period. Inflation may be a factor, but it is not huge as I remember
inflation in other times.</hs_para>

to rerun those figures for the Minister. Inflation has been running at
between 2.5% and 3.5% since 2010—and, indeed, from slightly
before that—so we are talking about a substantial compound
reduction. That is not trivial but quite a big pressure point on all
those budgets. I accept the Minister’s general point
that it is a cash-limited and therefore substantial figure, but it is
still certainly declining.</hs_para>

increased research capacity it has brought, the AHRC is now also
supporting heritage science through programmes developed in the current
spending review period. Heritage is one of three key areas in the AHRC

to the recommendations specifically directed at the Government. The
committee expressed concern about the way in which DCMS monitors its
bodies’ delivery of their heritage science responsibility and
recommended that the department set specific 
<?notus-xml column=36?>departmental objectives for heritage science. DCMS has structures in
place that enable it to ensure that its arm’s-length bodies
fulfil their high-level strategic objectives and indicators, and
achieve value for money. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of
Balmacara, raised this issue, but performance against ministerial
priorities and performance indicators is reviewed at regular
ministerial and officials’ meetings with senior management of
the arm’s-length bodies. The department does not wish to
micromanage these bodies by imposing a large number of detailed
objectives. The department is close to completing management agreements
that cover the current spending review period to 2015. I think that it
would be preferable if committee members knew once there had been a
completion of those management agreements so that the detail is more
readily available, with probably more time to consider.</hs_para>

up on the point about the work of the DCMS’s Science and
Research Advisory Committee, I say to my noble friend Lady Sharp that,
in considering its future, the Government Office for Science is now
conducting a review with a view to improving and enhancing its work and
making it more effective. The department now has a new deputy chief
scientific, who is working with the Government Chief Scientific Adviser

recommendations about possible sources of funding for heritage science,
which are entirely in tune with the department’s policy to
support efforts by the heritage sector to broaden its range of funding
sources, in particular through philanthropy. We agree that philanthropy
has an important part to play in supporting heritage science. To
support the fundraising efforts of the cultural sector, the DCMS, Arts
Council England, and the Heritage Lottery Fund have set up the Catalyst
programme, with more than £50 million going towards the
establishment of endowments to be matched by a further £100
million from private donors. Among those receiving endowment grants is

Government recognise that digitisation has huge potential to facilitate
wider and higher quality access to and understanding of future cultural
collections and artefacts. Indeed, last summer, the Heritage Lottery
Fund launched a new digital strategy and announced that funds can now
be used for digital-only projects. As has been replayed to me, the
Government do not wish to impose a top-down centralised structure to
any digitisation framework, and have asked their arm’s-length
bodies and the sector to collaborate together with the NHLF on a
national or international framework for digitisation. The DCMS’s
arm’s-length bodies are already taking the lead in attracting
commercial funding for the digitisation of heritage collections, such
as the partnership between the British Library and Google to digitise
250,000 out of copyright books from the library’s

work stands as an important touchstone against which work and progress

could be done, and I am conscious that the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson
of Balmacara, has set me some tasks and questions. Given that some of
them are quite intricate, I beg leave to write to him, as he generously
suggested, so that I can fully consider the implications of what he
said. It is important that the department works with its

number of points have been made about leadership, and I can understand
what is meant. Clearly, the department has, and should have, an
leadership role because it is responsible for the arm’s-length
bodies that do the work on the nation’s behalf. The department
sees heritage as having a clear role to play in supporting growth and
welcomes the emphasis in the follow-up report on the significance of
the sector to the UK economy. The Government have recently championed
the importance of heritage in their GREAT campaign and the department
also recognises the importance of science and of caring for heritage

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health
(Earl Howe):</Member> The academic consensus is that a male to female
birth ratio of around 105 (male births per 100 female) is normal and
ratios above 108 are unlikely to be possible without intervention.
However, some differences also occur as a result of random variation,
with differing gender ratios appearing by chance. In the United
Kingdom, the birth ratio is 105 and consequently, gender ratios alone
are unlikely to provide strong evidence of sex-selective abortions and
can only provide contextual information. Other evidence could include
different gender ratios by mother’s country of origin though the
above caveats would still apply. Birth registration, including
mother’s country of birth is a legal requirement and data are
compiled by the Office for National
Statistics.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13020417000320" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204w0001.htm#13020417000320">Ansaru</hs_DebateHeading><hs_DebateType>Question</hs_DebateType></NewDebate><hs_TabledBy UID="13020417000364" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204w0001.htm#13020417000364">Asked

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe):</Member> The directive (2005/36/EC) on the recognition of
professional qualifications sets out a system of automatic recognition
of medical qualifications underpinned by common minimum standards of
training for doctors. Article 21 requires the United Kingdom to
recognise such medical qualifications obtained by European Economic
Area doctors and to provide those doctors with the same access to the
profession as UK doctors. Article 8 enables member states to undertake
checks at the point of registration, to verify the doctor;s identity,
the validity of their qualification and that they are in “good
standing” with their home member state, but language capability
is not a matter which is permitted to be checked at this
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020417000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204w0001.htm#13020417000071">Article
53 of the directive states that “Persons benefiting from the
recognition of professional qualifications shall have a knowledge of
languages necessary for practising the profession in the host member
state”. This implies that recognition has occurred before
language testing is assessed and therefore language cannot be a
pre-condition to registration. European Commission guidance on the
directive makes it clear that the lack of language knowledge cannot be
a ground for refusal of the recognition of
qualifications.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13020417000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130204w0001.htm#13020417000072">Case

2014-15.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question">
