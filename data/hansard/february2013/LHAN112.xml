Lords, our commitment to hold business rate rises to the annual
retail prices index cap means that there has been no real-terms
increase in business rates since 1990. We have provided and are
continuing to provide considerable support on business rates, including
temporarily doubling the level of small business rate relief for

my noble friend, but is she fully aware that over 3 million people are
employed in the retail trade, and that, equally importantly, at least 1
million of them are young people aged under 25? The situation on the
high street in the past 12 to 14 months has been dire. Against that
background, surely the time has come for Her Majesty’s

all they can to support the high street and other businesses. As the
noble Lord made clear, the employment opportunities there are dire at
the moment and we want to boost them as much as we can. The high street
is facing challenges such as the rise of internet shopping. That is why
the Government are offering practical support such as the Portas-plus
package, and, as I said, why they have doubled the small business rate
relief. We have also given authorities powers to grant their own
discounts, which can be used to support local businesses,

Peston:</Member></B> My Lords, is not the reason why the high street is
in such a mess the catastrophic failure of the Government’s
economic policy? What is required 
<?notus-xml column=558?>for the high street to get going is what is required for the
whole British economy to get going: first, that the Government stop
blaming their predecessor—the economy was certainly in a better
state then than it is now—and, secondly, that they engage in an
expansionary rather than a contractionary fiscal
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T14:39:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hanham" PimsId="3741" UID="13021253000717" xid="1742" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000717">Baroness

deficit left by the previous Government. I do not think the noble Lord
would expect me not to get that crack in one way or another.
Whoever and whatever, we have realised that the economic situation is
not helping. The Question is about small businesses. We are doing all
that we can to help small businesses and to encourage the development
of shops and other businesses. We are also very well aware of the

are set on the basis of value. That is carried out by the valuation
office. We are helping small businesses in every way that we can. I am
sure that noble Lords would not discount the fact that many small
businesses now are not paying any rates because they have 100% relief.

very much with what the noble Lord has said about small individual
businesses. In fact, a number of those are being generated at the
moment. In all high streets, there are people who are setting off in
entrepreneurial ways. I do not think that is something that the

have a major role to play, but I accept, as I did in response to a
previous question, that small entrepreneurs and small businesses in the
high streets add value not only to the community but to the economy. We
do not need shops that are boarded up and shut; we want small
businesses to move in. There are plenty of examples of that happening
both in London and in the countryside. I think I am right in

the fact is that food waste costs the average household
£640 a year, which is a total of £12 billion to the

consumer prevent this waste. Does my noble friend agree that
supermarkets have a significant role to play in this area? While, for
example, Asda’s promotion of WRAP’s “Love food,
Hate Waste” campaign and the recent announcement by
Sainsbury’s that its guidance to customers will move from

Courtauld commitment and have helped consumers to save money and waste

the supermarkets, the “best before” label apparently
means that they are not allowed to sell it after that date. Yet there
is quite a period when that food remains good, and this is a great
source of waste. Many large establishments give all of that food away
to homeless charities and people who come to collect. Are the

“Use by” and “best before” dates help
consumers to know what is safe to eat. They are required by law. The
“sell by” and “display until” dates,
however, are not intended for customers and can confuse them. We have
encouraged retailers to remove these from goods or to render them
invisible to the human eye. Encouragingly, the WRAP retailer survey
2011 found that new labelling being rolled out by retailers including
Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury’s makes it clear that
consumers do not have to freeze goods on the day of purchase, but can
do so any time up to the “use by” date. A number of
supermarkets have also introduced new, larger, single-date label stamps
on to products to help consumers make the best use of the
food<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T14:57:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_12_PT_1/DBDFC81A2A7748BA85A6A9C692236C964D16F188" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 February 2013">Tuesday,

Does he agree with me that the manipulation of these rates by some
banks was a deeply cynical fraud against borrowers in times when they
could least afford it, and that while the fines levied by the FSA on
those responsible may be at record levels they were a small fraction of
the profits made by those institutions? The fines were substantially
less than those imposed by the US regulator. Due to the FSA’s
executive settlement procedures, those responsible received over
£100 million in discounts on the fines levied so far. Would it
not be more in keeping with the way in which banks treat their own
customers if the FSA was now to scrap early-settlement discounts and
replace them with a system of late-settlement
penalties<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T14:59:21"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000050"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deighton" PimsId="7002" UID="13021253000761" xid="2168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000761">Lord
Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend makes an important
point about the seriousness with which we are addressing this attempted
manipulation of LIBOR rates. On the specific question of the penalties,
the Financial Services Authority is the independent regulator. It is
mandated to set all the rules on regulatory matters. That includes
decisions about using early-settlement discounts as a way of managing
the process. It considers it in the public interest to settle matters
in cases involving financial penalties as early as possible and to
provide incentives. There are many advantages in early settlement. It
helps consumers to get compensation earlier than would otherwise be the
case and prevents cases being contested at the regulatory decisions
committee, which could cost a lot of time and
money.</hs_para>

Lord’s observation that it is really a singeing indictment of
the financial system that a benchmark as critical as LIBOR—which
is responsible for settling about $300 trillion-worth of
transactions—could be manipulated in this way. Once this was
uncovered, however, the Government have moved extremely swiftly,
appointing Martin Wheatley, the chief executive-designate of the
Financial Conduct Authority, to do a review. He came up with a 10-point
plan, which has been implemented in full. The Financial Services Act
was amended to make sure that LIBOR activities were brought within
statutory regulation; we created a new criminal offence to ensure that
it could be followed up in that way and the FSA has now been given the

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, before asking my question, I wonder if
the noble Lord could clarify part of his answer to the noble Lord, Lord
Bates, where he referred to the “attempted” manipulation
of LIBOR. Is he saying that the manipulation failed? Turning
to the Question, when I was a member of the Regulatory Decisions
Committee of the Financial Services Authority, discounts on penalties
were offered for early settlement only in cases where
either the firms had reported their own failings or they had offered
exceptional levels of co-operation. Did either of these circumstances
apply in this case to British banks prior to measures taken by the
American
authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:03:14"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Deighton:</Member></B> With respect to the noble Lord’s question
on whether the attempt was successful, I think that is actually the
issue. The FSA’s review found that it was unclear whether the
manipulation did result in a change of rates, so that is an open
question. On the degree of co-operation shown by the firms under
investigation, I understand that the firms were entirely co-operative.
Of course, they are all under new management and, effectively, are the
new brooms trying to sweep clean. I am afraid that I cannot layer
together the timing of that co-operation vis-à-vis the
application of the US penalties, but I am happy to look into that and

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment refers to the position
of the Defence Fire and Rescue Service within the structure of the
Bill. Noble Lords will remember that it was revealed in the discussion
of the Bill in Committee—the issue had not been discussed in
another place—that the Defence Fire and Rescue Service had an
anomalous status relative to that of other firefighters within the UK.
In particular, while other firefighters within the UK had their
retirement age fixed at the age of 60, together with other uniformed
services, the Defence Fire and Rescue Service at that time had a
retirement age tied to the statutory retirement age. Therefore, it
would be 65, rising in accordance with the pattern planned for the
increase in the statutory retirement
age<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:10:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000066">My
hypothesis in Committee was that this was simply a slip and a mistake
and that people had just happened to miss the fact that a category of
firefighters was not covered in the actual language of the Bill. I
therefore expected that, once the Minister had taken the matter
back—he conceded in Committee that he had not had the
opportunity to consider it with any great care—the mistake would
be understood and the firefighters would be included with the other
uniformed services, having their retirement age fixed at 60, as is the
case with the other uniformed
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:11:10"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, to my considerable surprise, this has not been the case. I
understand that the firefighters—and, indeed, the Ministry of
Defence Police, to which I will turn in a moment—have met the
Minister and that he has turned down this proposition. He has
substituted for it the assurance that their pension age would be
maintained at 65 and not, perhaps, go up with the statutory
pension age, although his assurance was not terribly clear in the sense
that it referred to a three-year differential between the statutory
retirement age and that for Ministry of Defence firefighters. In due
course, when it gets to 68 or 69, as we all live longer, those
firefighters would see their retirement age go up—or so I
presume; 
<?notus-xml column=568?>perhaps the Minister can clarify that
later on—while that of their colleagues in the rest of their
fire service would stay the same, at
60<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:12:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:12:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000067">The
Minister has one fundamental question to answer. It is an answer that
not just this House but the firefighters themselves deserve. How does
their job differ from that of local authority firefighters? In what way
is it less onerous, when they have to work on military establishments,
dealing on occasion with extremely dangerous materials, and
occasionally also in war zones? How is their job less
onerous? In those circumstances, why should we have this situation in
which their retirement age is five years
higher<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:13:20"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000068">I
wonder whether the Minister has taken the trouble to find out when the
Defence Fire and Rescue Service members actually retire. If he did take
that trouble, he would find out that the majority of them retire before
the age of 60. They retire early, with a significantly reduced pension,
and they have to do that because they are physically unable to keep
going. A study performed by the Civilian Consultant Adviser in
Occupational Medicine for the Defence Fire Risk Management Organisation
not only produced data but argued that continuing beyond the age of 60
was detrimental to the long-term health of firefighters in the Ministry
of Defence Fire and Rescue
Service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:14:41"></hs_TimeCode>. If the
noble Lord had taken the trouble to find out what was actually
happening, he would have found out that firefighters in this service
are forced to retire early due to their physical condition or because
they are unable to pass the regular physical examinations they undergo
to ensure that they can perform their duties to the required
standard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:16:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13021253000280" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000280">3.15

in my introduction, initially I presumed that this omission was a

that if the age of retirement, which is currently 65—even though
the majority retire before 60—were reduced to 60, like that of
all other uniformed services, this would be the only group in the

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, my name is attached to the first of
these amendments and I support the second one. I do not want to add a
lot to what my noble friend has said but I concur with him that at some
point along the line, there has been either a mistake or an oversight.
There can be very little argument but that the uniformed ranks who
happen to be employed by the Ministry of Defence do a very similar and,
if anything, significantly more dangerous job in certain locations than
firefighters generally, and that therefore the exception to the general
rule that applies to uniformed staff covered in my noble friend Lord
Hutton’s report ought logically to apply to this group of
workers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:21:33"></hs_TimeCode>. I
cannot see a logical argument for excluding them from that

second point is that this group is in a Civil Service scheme that
covers several hundred thousand people. We are dealing here with a
unique workforce of 800 firefighters who serve our defence forces in
the United Kingdom, in war zones and in other parts where the British
Armed Forces operate abroad. They are not like the rest of the Civil
Service, and nor would it be a major cost to the Civil Service scheme
were this anomaly to be rectified in the Bill. In the other areas of
the Bill in which I am interested as regards the local government
scheme, the Minister has been pretty flexible over many aspects, which
I applaud—and he will, I hope, be more flexible later
this afternoon. However, I am surprised that he
cannot see that this is an issue on which the Government could easily
concede; it would meet with huge approval, would cost very little and
would correct an anomaly that has been there  
<?notus-xml column=570?>for some time but does not need to be aggravated by raising the normal

Hutton of Furness:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I should briefly join
the debate because my report has been cited by my noble friend. I echo
the comments of my noble friends and support their argument. I ask your
Lordships’ House to indulge me if I revisit some of the issues
from my report. It talked about the uniformed services in general, not
about whether you happened to be in the Civil Service scheme or any
other scheme. I talked about uniformed services—firefighters,
police and the Armed Forces. My report made a simple argument that the
nature of their service is unique and should be reflected in the
pension arrangements that we make for

during the course of my inquiry, I had known about the unique
circumstances of the MoD firefighters, I would have referred
specifically to them in my report and urged the Government to show some
flexibility, support and sympathy for the special role that they play
within our Armed Forces. Sadly, this issue was not drawn to my
attention, so I did not make any specific recommendations about the MoD

himself—I know what a decent and honourable person he
is—of the fact that this is fundamentally a matter of fairness
and of the need to approach the issue in the right way. I do not
believe that there is any substantive technical reason why we cannot
look again at the role of the MoD firefighters and the MoD Police. If
there is a technical issue it has to be addressed on the face of the
Bill, as my noble friend suggested, or in the scheme regulations or the
discussions with the relevant trade unions. Surely there has to be a
way of doing the right thing for these people. The MoD firefighters
currently happen to be in the Civil Service pension scheme, which has a
higher retirement age than the firefighters scheme or the Armed Forces
scheme. It is incumbent on us to address that issue and not to use the

up of civil servants directly employed by the Ministry of Defence.
Although there are some similarities with their counterparts in the
Home Office police and the local authority fire and rescue services,
their terms and conditions of employment are set by the Ministry of
Defence and are therefore materially different in many respects. As
civil servants they benefit from provisions which are not available to
their non-MoD counterparts, such as the Civil Service compensation
scheme, injury benefit provisions, relocation and leave allowances. The
amendments being suggested would fundamentally alter the status of
these individuals and that should not be carried out
lightly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000081">I
should remind the House that, as civil servants, individuals joining
these forces currently have access to the Principal Civil Service
Pension Scheme. This means that since 2007 those joining these forces
have had a normal pension age of 65. The amendment proposed by the
noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, would reduce that pension age to 60. He has
already referred to this argument, but I shall make it again. Such a
reduction in pension age runs counter to the Government’s aim of
managing the risks associated with increasing longevity. It would also
make these workforces unique in seeing a five-year decrease in their
pension age as a result of these
reforms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000082">Furthermore,
there are a number of problems associated with the specific amendments
that have been proposed. First, it is not clear how the amendments
proposed by the Opposition would be implemented. The institutional
architecture required for these workforces to become part of the
non-MoD fire and police schemes would need to be established, bringing
with it additional cost. The non-MoD fire and police schemes are
locally administered and early work suggests that in order to include
the DFRS and MDP in these schemes, equivalents of elected police
commissioners and fire authorities would need to be established for
these forces. The schemes are also discussed and established through
fora which the MoD forces do not participate in, and which are not
designed to cater for them, such as the Police Negotiating
Board.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13021253000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000083">The
amendment would also split the remuneration of these individuals so
that their pay and other conditions are controlled by the Ministry of
Defence while their pension entitlement would be set by either the
Department for Communities and Local Government or the Home Office.
This will potentially place financial risks on the Ministry of Defence
over which it has no control and, more importantly, would prohibit the
MoD from taking a view on appropriate remuneration for these forces in
the
round.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000084">However,
the Government are not deaf to the concerns of the House. I have
listened carefully to the arguments for providing these groups with
additional protection. I have, as
the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, mentioned, also met representatives from
the groups themselves to hear their concerns. One of the issues that
they highlighted was that as SRA and NRA increases in the decades 
<?notus-xml column=572?>ahead, the disparity between their retirement age and that of their
civilian counterparts would be increased and their retirement age would
move towards 68. They believe that such further increases in retirement
age would be unfair and unreasonable, and I agree. Therefore, I held
discussions with colleagues in the Treasury and the Ministry of
Defence. As a result, the Ministry of Defence pledged to look at
appropriate ways in which the issue could be managed so that retirement
at 65 could be maintained in the new pension schemes established by the
Bill when they are implemented in 2015.</hs_para>

then heard the proposition that the differential—the
unfairness—should be fixed at five years’-worth of
unfairness, with the retirement age of MoD firefighters and police

can find a way to fix the retirement age at 65 but we cannot find a way

also completely failed to address two fundamental points. He failed to
answer the question: in what way do the working conditions of Ministry
of Defence firefighters differ from those of local authority
firefighters? He failed to take into consideration that the majority of
MoD firefighters are forced to retire before the age of 60 because of
physical and other health reasons. He also failed to take into account
the point made by my noble friend Lord Hutton that this is a
fundamental issue of fairness. Given that that is the position, we owe
it to Ministry of Defence firefighters and police to agree this
amendment. I urge noble Lords to do so and beg leave to test the

Powers Committee’s 10th report. The report identified that the
Bill will move some features of judicial pensions, which are currently
provided for in primary legislation, into secondary legislation. Under
the amendments, the pensions of the judiciary will be separated from
the Civil Service scheme, of which they were originally going to form
part.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000091">The
regulations governing pensions for the judiciary will be made by the
Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the Secretary of State for
Scotland where this is appropriate. Scheme regulations will also
require the consent of the Treasury. In addition, in order to recognise
the move from a basis in primary legislation to one in secondary
legislation for some elements of scheme design, scheme regulations will
attract the affirmative procedure. The exception to this will be cases
where the pension board for the scheme deems the regulations to have
either a minor or a wholly beneficial effect. The judiciary will be
represented on this board. As a final change, we have amended the Bill
so that the Lord Chancellor’s role in making pension schemes for
the judiciary becomes a protected function. This means that any future
machinery of government changes will not change the fact that the
responsibility for these pensions will remain with the Lord
Chancellor.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000092">The

amendments on powers to amend legislation follow on in particular from
the recommendations of the Delegated Powers Committee. As the Delegated
Powers Committee noted, the Bill as drafted contains
“unrestricted” powers to amend primary legislation. The
committee did not see a justification for such a wide scope to make
changes without full parliamentary scrutiny. It recommended that the
powers be limited to being able to amend existing primary legislation
for consequential and consistency purposes only. We have looked at
this, and agree with the committee.</hs_para>

currently mimic those in the Superannuation Act 1972, the predecessor
to this Bill, there is no evidence of the powers being used for
anything beyond consequential amendments in the past. We do not

amendments therefore reduce the scope in line with the Delegated Powers

should make clear that the amendments do not remove the power to amend
primary legislation completely, since such a power is essential to
bridge any gaps between pre-existing primary legislation and the scheme

have set out before, powers to make retrospective changes can be
required for several reasons. Usually they are required to make minor

efficiently, often for the benefit of members. They may also be used to

which increase the likelihood of the Government and their employees

36 implements a consent lock for any retrospective changes to pensions
that have “significant adverse effects” on members.
Members or their representatives would have to agree to such changes.
Significance is a low but appropriate threshold—one that is on
the whole favourable to members and not the responsible authority. It
has already been used in the Bill and by some noble Lords in
their own amendments. I note that the amendment tabled by the noble
Lord, Lord Whitty, in this area refers similarly to

our amendments mean that material or significant retrospective changes
would require the consent of the members who are affected, or their
representatives. Amendment 36 therefore provides an extremely strong
form of protection against the unfair use of retrospective powers. It
will give members who are significantly adversely affected, or their
representatives, a veto on any such changes. The requirements to follow
the affirmative procedure and to lay a report to Parliament
will also continue to apply to safeguard wider interests, including
those of the

consent requirement will apply to changes that have a significant
adverse effect on the pensions of all scheme members, whether active,
deferred or pensioners. That means that they go further than the
protections against retrospective changes in many existing schemes,

provide unambiguous protections for all members, not just deferred and

the consent lock will not apply to retrospective changes that have a
significant adverse effect on non-pension benefits, such as
injury and compensation schemes. Such benefits will continue to be
protected instead by the enhanced consultation procedure of Clause 22.
That clause requires consultation with a view to reaching agreement, a
report to the appropriate legislature, and the affirmative
procedure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000106">Injury<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T15:56:14"></hs_TimeCode>

employment, not whether they happen to be members of a public service
pension scheme. The persons covered do not accrue an entitlement
throughout their career in the same way as a pension, 
<?notus-xml column=579?>but rather receive benefits that are calculated at
the point of claim. Moreover, those schemes are entirely funded by the
employer with no employee contribution. We therefore think that a veto
power over changes to injury and compensation schemes that
might in some cases be regarded as retrospective would give
disproportionate influence to members. None the less, I should make
clear that reforms to current injury and compensation schemes
are not contemplated by this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000107">I

hope that the House will find it helpful if I speak to the other
amendments in the group. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty,
would restrict the scope of powers to make retrospective changes such
that they could make only non-material changes. As I have said, we
believe that the scope of those powers should not be categorically
restricted. Flexibility can be desirable—I mentioned the
possibility of members consenting to significant changes if they are
part of a wider negotiating package—and it is much more
important that we give members a fair say in what affects
them. Our amendments do that, with a veto power no less. So, in the
light of our amendments, the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty,

unnecessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000109">The

decisions—what is significant and who is affected?—that
require a clear decision in order to start the right consultative
process. Someone has to take a view on the nature of the effects in
good faith. In our view, the authority is best placed to do that, given

Amendments 37, 38 and 39 because they make a proper, logical story.
They seek to remove from Amendment 36 the role of the authority in
deciding whether an adverse effect on the pensions payable has in fact
occurred. In other words, the authority has to decide whether its
measures should be challenged in consultation. This is as if, in a game
involving Manchester United, penalty decisions against it were to be
made by Sir Alex Ferguson. I am sure that he, as a talented football
manager, would then make a decision on a reasonable basis. However,
with all due respect to that distinguished person, do we think that
these decisions would be made in a way which was balanced? I could
choose any other football manager, including Mr Wenger, who apparently
never sees things that happen on football pitches.</hs_para>

criteria that he applied in these circumstances, said that he wanted to
achieve a sensible balance between members’ protection and the
role of the authority. It seems that while the proposed new clause in
Amendment 36 provides for a significant protection for members of the
scheme, it is still not balanced in that it leaves the authority with
the responsibility for deciding that its own measures have had an
adverse effect on those members. In those circumstances, even the most
reasonable person is likely to be reluctant to feel that measures which
they are taking have a negative impact upon the scheme. Our amendments

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, I should be grateful if the Minister
could comment on the extent and the manner to which the
Government’s amendments to the ability to make changes and to
make retrospective changes affect the fundamental issue of
affordability. I apologise for raising this issue yet again but it is
fundamental. We start, as everyone knows, from the OBR advising that
there will be a cash flow deficit of £15.4 billion by 2016-17.
My related question to the Minister is: what is the Government’s
estimate of the additional cash flow deficit costs of both increasing
longevity and, more particularly, the new single-tier pension proposals
made by the DWP? It strikes me that two separate silos have been
working on this, with the Treasury in one and the DWP in the
other. Precisely what the effects of the loss of employer and
employee NI contributions and the ending of contracting out will be on
the deficit of pay-as-you-go public sector schemes seems to some extent
to be a
mystery.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000123">I
think it was in Committee that the Minister advised that he felt the
estimates I suggested were too high; thus I would be grateful if he
would comment on what the Government’s estimates are. My revised
estimates, done with the assistance of Michael Johnson, who many noble
Lords will know has done significant work on the subject, are that
there is an additional cash flow cost from longer longevity of the
order of £2 billion per annum, and there may now be a
additional £3.4 billion resulting from the loss of public sector
employers’ NIC rebates with the ending of contracting out and a
further £4 billion per annum as a result of public sector
employees continuing to enjoy an enhanced
occupational pension as if contracted out while
still 
<?notus-xml column=582?>being entitled to further accruals under the new
single-tier state pension, once it appears. In contrast, private sector
employers who are contracted out will be permitted to change their
scheme rules, effectively to reduce pensions paid, without trustee
consent. As I have said, I cannot believe that the prospect of a
potential cash flow deficit of some £24 billion per annum will
be acceptable to whoever is in power at that stage, given the state of
the public finances. Dare I say that it seems that not only the
Opposition but the Government are ignoring the affordability issue with
regard to this legislation as it passes through both Houses of
Parliament?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13021253000124" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000124">I

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, as the Minister said, I have Amendments
7, 31 and 35 in this group. I should explain that for the remainder of
the discussion of the Bill on Report I am likely to be seeing it
through the perspective of the Local Government Pension Scheme which,
in response to the noble Lord, Lord Flight, is a funded scheme,
not a pay-as-you-go scheme, and, moreover, a funded scheme that has
recently reached agreement between the trade unions and the LGA,
sanctioned by the CLG and the Treasury, on a new cost-management
structure. I therefore think the costs of any limit on
retrospection in that scheme are unlikely to arise. I probably should
declare that I am an honorary vice-president of the LGA and a member of
the GMB, although I have no pecuniary interest in the pensions covered
by the LGPS. I was also, until recently, chair of one of its
schemes.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13021253000126" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000126">The
Minister deserves considerable credit for moving significantly on this
front. It is clear that what appeared to be quite an open-ended ability
to amend primary and secondary legislation in the original text of the
Bill has been significantly modified by the changes which he has
proposed and the procedures that he has outlined, particularly in
relation to Amendment 36. It would be nice if he could go a little
further, particularly in respect of two points. Amendment 7 would
effectively prevent retrospective changes for non-administrative
reasons that had a material detriment for any members of the scheme.
The reference in Amendment 36 to “significant adverse
effects” sounds like a significantly higher threshold than
“material detriment”. Does the Minister think there is a
real distinction there? Could some quite serious detriment in effect
occur without triggering Amendment 36? I would hope not, but I would
like some on-the-record reassurance on that
point.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_12_PT_1/2A4AF7301859F7B77CD22CA824C24F493D56F8DA" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 February 2013">Tuesday,

I welcome the clause. The procedure is sensible and the associated
amendments are likely to be able to deal with the situation, if
anything, slightly better than the procedural amendments that I have
tabled. However, there is an issue as to whether a detriment is in the
eyes of one party rather than appearing to be a detriment to any

the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, there are two differences between the
Alex Ferguson situation and the one that we are discussing. First,
while he could of course be relied upon to act impartially in every
circumstance, he is not given that freedom. There are a referee and
various other officials on the pitch, taking decisions on a
second-by-second basis. There is an authority; it is just not him. The
noble Lord is concerned about what happens if that authority then acts
improperly or unreasonably—if, say, the referee blatantly misses
a series of handballs in the penalty area. The answer is that if there
is a sense that the authority is behaving improperly, it has an
oversight body: the courts. The authorities cannot just make arbitrary
decisions, let alone unfair ones, without acting in good faith. If they
do act unreasonably, they are also acting unlawfully. It is right that
the responsibility lies with them, as they operate the schemes.
Somebody has to make an initial decision. The underlying implication of
what the noble Lord is saying is that the authorities will act in a
malevolent way to do down scheme members. I do not believe that they
will, or that that is the

I have stated, the new clause on retrospective protections will require

operation of the cost cap. I have already made clear that adjustments
to benefits or contributions under the cost cap would not be
retrospective. The new clause, set out in Amendment 36, also provides
protections to this effect. First, there would be the procedure set out
in Clause 12(6) for reaching agreement on changes that are contingent
on the operation of that mechanism. Then, when scheme regulations were
made to give effect to those agreed changes, those regulations would
require consent for any provisions that were retrospective and had
significant adverse effects on

necessary either. As the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, himself said in

triggered. There is no need for this additional protection because the
response to the cost cap calls for the approval of the members
themselves. If that response were to involve a retrospective change

Flight, asked a couple of questions about whether the changes relating

ability retrospectively to reduce provisions and thus make it easier,

in practice—is that tinkering with accrued rights falls foul of
human rights legislation and the Government have made it absolutely
clear that they have no intention of going down that road. On the
question of figures in Michael Johnson’s report, the Government
simply do not recognise them. The House should be reassured that the
costings for these reforms and the single tier have been fully worked
through. If, at some stage in the future, the schemes appear
unfinanceable, we have the cost cap; that is the whole purpose of

have agreement, this will not always be the appropriate focus. Pensions

minor change was made.
Moreover<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:25:54"></hs_TimeCode>, this

35 goes somewhat further than Amendment 36. It would require that any
change to scheme regulations after the first set of
regulations has been made should follow the higher standard of
consultation and reporting requirements set out in Clause 22. As I have
said previously, this would be simply impractical. Amendments to scheme
regulations can be made for a wide range of reasons down to the
most minor of changes. It cannot be right that the more extensive
provisions in Clause 22 should apply to every circumstance.
Very often these changes are to the benefit of members and I am
sure that any delay in implementing such beneficial changes because of
the legal requirement to carry out the kinds of consultation set out in

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of

Speaker, we are lucky in Britain to have the finest police officers in
the world. They put themselves in harm’s way to protect the
public. They are cutting crime even as we reduce police spending, and
the vast majority of officers do their work with a strong sense 
<?notus-xml column=587?>of fairness and duty. But the good work of those thousands of officers
is undermined when a minority behave
inappropriately.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000147" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000147">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:30:25"></hs_TimeCode>
the last year, we have seen the Leveson inquiry, which cleared the
police of widespread corruption but called for greater transparency in
policing, and the shocking report of the Hillsborough independent
panel. We have seen the sacking of PC Simon Harwood and the
investigation of several chief officers for misconduct, and yesterday I
told the House about the investigation led by Mick Creedon into the
work of undercover officers from the Metropolitan
Police.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000148" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000148">I want
everyone to understand that I do not believe there is endemic
corruption in the police, and I know that the vast majority of police
officers conduct themselves with the highest standards of
integrity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:31:00"></hs_TimeCode>. This
was confirmed by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary in
its report last year. But that does not mean that we should ignore the
fact that when it does occur, police corruption and misconduct
undermine justice, let down the decent majority of officers, and damage
the public’s confidence in the

need clearer rules for how officers should conduct themselves. We need

police more accountable to their communities. Direct entry into the

Lord Justice Leveson’s report made several recommendations on
policing, focused on providing greater transparency and openness. The

I want to make sure that the Independent Police Complaints Commission
is equipped to do its important job. Over the years, its work has been
evolving and the proposals I announce today develop it further. Public
concern about the IPCC has been based on its powers and its resources.
I want to address both these
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000158" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000158">Regarding
its powers, last year Parliament legislated, with welcome cross-party
support, to give the IPCC the ability to investigate historical cases
in exceptional circumstances. In the same legislation, we gave the IPCC
the power to compel police officers and staff to attend interviews as
witnesses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000159">In
addition, as I have already said, we will legislate as soon as
parliamentary time allows to give the IPCC the power to investigate
private sector companies working for the police, along with other
powers the IPCC has asked for to improve its effectiveness and increase
public confidence, and I am prepared to consider any further
legislative changes that the commission says it
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000160" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000160">But I
believe the main difficulty for the IPCC is its capacity to investigate
complaints itself. Last year, the commission investigated just 130 of
the 2,100 serious or sensitive cases that were referred to it
independently, while supervising or managing about 200. Individual
police forces investigated the remainder. But 31% of appeals against
forces’ handling of complaints were successful. That is simply
not acceptable. I will therefore transfer to the IPCC responsibility
for dealing with all serious and sensitive allegations. I also intend
to transfer resources from individual forces’ professional
standards departments and other relevant areas to the IPCC to make sure
it has the budget and the manpower to do its
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000161" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000161">The
Government’s police reforms are working and crime is falling.

norm in our police, but that does not mean that we should not act. I

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
repeating the Statement in your Lordships’ House today. We
certainly welcome the direction of 
<?notus-xml column=589?>travel on this issue, and many of the measures outlined are sensible in
principle. Obviously, a lot of detail has yet to be revealed and I hope
that we will have the opportunity to contribute to that debate in your
Lordships’
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:38:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000164" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000164">British
policing has an enviable reputation across the world for low levels of
corruption, high standards of integrity and our tradition of policing
by consent. That is why, when there are cases where standards fall
below the level that we expect, we are rightly appalled and action has
to be taken to address that. On many occasions when I have asked police
officers why they have joined the police, without exception all have
very high on their list a very simple reason: to help people. The vast
majority of police officers join the force to help the public and keep
people safe from crime and harm, and they take great risks when doing
so.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13021253000165" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000165">Most<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>
people, when they go out to work in the morning, know that they will
never face a situation where their life could be at risk. However, in
Greater Manchester, there is now the trial for the killing of two
police officers who were shot down for answering a routine 999 call.
Officers such as those and their colleagues know that this is a risk
they face. Every day, police officers across the country face incidents
and disturbances. They have to inform families if their loved ones have
been injured or killed. They have to deal with some very unpleasant
situations and they undertake those responsibilities with great
integrity and without regard to their own
safety<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:40:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

officers are deeply concerned about serious cases that undermine
confidence in policing. The vast majority of police officers want
action against officers who let down the force and the public. They
also want action to improve standards. We must have robust and
meaningful action to tackle those who have weakened public confidence
and respect. The Minister mentioned some examples; others include
hacking and the Hillsborough tragedy. It is clear that there are also
problems with some undercover officers, and it is right that we address
cases where policing has failed to protect the public or deliver
justice. We must ensure that we have a framework in place to make such
cases less likely and take effective action against those individuals
involved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:40:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

many of the Home Secretary’s measures are sensible. We support
the implementation of the Leveson recommendations. Your
Lordships’ House made it clear that it wishes the rest of Lord
Leveson’s proposals to be implemented with similar speed. We
support a code of ethics, stronger professional standards and stronger
action when these are breached. The Stevens commission has taken
evidence on issues around codes of ethics, national registers, the role
of the College of Policing, and proposals for striking off police
officers, and is likely to make new proposals in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000168">Perhaps
I may ask the Minister some questions around this matter. I would
appreciate his answering answer me today, but if he cannot it would be
welcome if he wrote to me. Can he say any more about the professional
register? My understanding from the Statement is that the new College
of Policing will manage and publish the register and have a duty to 
<?notus-xml column=590?>ensure that those guilty of misconduct will not be
allowed to work for any other police force. The Minister said that they
will be “struck off”, but from what? There is currently
no register of police officers from which they could be struck off.
Will<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:30:00"></hs_TimeCode> there be a
new comprehensive register of police officers, or will there instead be
a list of those who have been found guilty of misconduct or other
offences? What criteria will be used?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13021253000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000169">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>
Statement implies that this will apply only to officers facing
disciplinary action leading to dismissal, and there may be other cases
where it would be right for someone to be on the register. Given the
welcome commitment that disciplinary action will continue, even after
an officer retires or resigns, will the Minister confirm that such
officers will still be included on any list? What is meant by
“publish”? Does that mean that the list will be publicly
available or available only to the police? The Minister will be aware
that former police officers often find employment in private security
work of varying kinds, including, I am sure, in G4S. Will the
information also be available to prospective
employers?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000170">I
have one further point on this issue. As I have said, it is welcome
that disciplinary action will continue even if police officers resign
or seek early retirement, and we have called for such action. However,
the Minister said in the Statement that those officers will
face sanctions if misconduct is proven. What will those sanctions be?
Being placed on a list or struck off a register is hardly a sanction if
the officers have already resigned or
retired.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000171" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000171">On
the issue of vetting, the Statement says that the college will
establish a stronger system of vetting but that chief constables and
police and crime commissioners have only to “consider”
this. It does not appear to be binding. Is that the case, or have I
misunderstood? Although candidates for chief officers’ posts
will be vetted, it is not clear by whom. Given that the
Government’s Statement places on the College of Policing
additional responsibilities beyond those previously proposed, is the
Minister confident that it has the necessary resources to undertake
this very important work? Unless it is 100% accurate, it will not be
worth very much or be that effective.</hs_para>

ethics. Can the Government confirm that the activities of undercover
officers such as using the identities of deceased children should be
addressed in such a
code?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000173" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000173">Although
there is much to welcome in the Statement, we are disappointed by the
proposals regarding the IPCC. The Minister will be aware that Yvette
Cooper, the shadow Home Secretary, has argued for the past year that
the IPCC has neither the powers nor the resources needed to be really
effective. We remain concerned that it will struggle to produce a
timely response to the Hillsborough tragedy, and there are countless
cases where the IPCC has failed to investigate
swiftly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000174" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000174">The
problem is that the Home Secretary’s reforms, which are outlined
today to the IPCC, seem to be incremental. We are not convinced that
the Government are doing enough to give the IPCC the real powers that
it needs, or to create a proactive rather than a reactive culture to
deal with problems, so there is  
<?notus-xml column=591?>a concern that it will not do enough to restore public confidence in the
IPCC to solve problems swiftly, to get justice, and to ensure that
lessons are learnt when policing goes
wrong.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000175" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000175">I am
still not clear—I listened very carefully and I read the
Statement before it came to this House—about the additional
resources that will be available to undertake the extra work. It
appears that all serious and sensitive cases will be dealt with by the
IPCC rather than by individual police forces. How will “serious
and sensitive” be defined, and who will define it? What about
initially low-level cases that are deemed not to be serious or
sensitive but which, as the investigation progresses, are deemed to be
serious and sensitive? Will they be transferred to IPCC? How much of
the total police forces’ budget will be transferred to allow the
IPCC to deal with all serious and sensitive cases? Will the Government
commit to ensuring that the adequacy of funding is kept under
review?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000176" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000176">In the
Police Reform Act, Ministers argued that more cases should be dealt
with by individual forces rather than by the IPCC. As a result, my
understanding is that under the Government’s policies the number
of commissioners roughly halved. Can the Minister confirm that he
considers that that was a mistake and that the Government will now be
recruiting more commissioners? It is hard to imagine that with
additional work and investigating all serious and sensitive cases, more
staff will not be needed, but where will those staff be found? How many
staff and how much financial resource do the Government envisage
transferring from police forces to the IPCC, or will they recruit in
other ways? Will there be any new money from the Government, or are the
Government confident that the IPCC can be fully and adequately
resourced by this transfer of funds?</hs_para>

final question, the Minister will be pleased to know, is whether he can
also confirm that the additional powers for the IPCC, announced by the
Home Secretary, will be introduced in this
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000178" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000178">We
are concerned that this incremental reform is a lost opportunity to
introduce a new, robust organisation with a new framework. Currently,
the IPCC, the PCC, the police and crime panels and the College of
Policing all have a role to play. One has to ask whether one strong
organisation with the appropriate framework and powers would be more
appropriate. I really feel that the Government should look again at
replacing the IPCC altogether with a new police standards authority,

police.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000179" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000179">We all

ensure that police officers get the support that they need and have a
proper framework of accountability to keep standards high. The

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness,
Lady Smith, for her general welcome for this Statement. I know that in
another place similar support was given to the Home Secretary’s
Statement. This is good news. I shall start with the last point made by
the noble Baroness, which was on rebranding. Do we want a new body? I
do not think that is necessary. The IPCC has good leadership under Dame
Anne Owers and it has a sense of direction, which is now supported by
the Government through this Statement. Although I cannot anticipate
what may be in future Queen’s Speeches, I am fairly confident
that legislation on this matter will not be long delayed. Indeed the
Statement drew attention to
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000181" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000181">The IPCC
is currently engaged in a lot of extremely serious investigations. The
Statement referred to them as probably lying at the heart of the
realisation that we need to look afresh at how we investigate the
police, and at what new framework we should establish. This is the
Government’s response. We believe in beefing up not only the
powers but the resources of the IPCC. The noble Baroness asked where
those resources were coming from and whether there was any fresh
government money. The Statement rightly said that they were
coming from the existing budgets of police forces—certainly in
the main that will be the case. However, the matter will be discussed
with each police
force<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:50:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000182" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000182">A
Statement such as this is clearly indicative rather than absolutist.
Certainly we will debate the issues that it raises over the next few
months. However, it is important, when the Government have something to
say on an issue as important as this, that they demonstrate to the
House, through the way they present the issues involved, their
direction of travel. That was the purpose of the Statement
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:51:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000183" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000183">The
noble Baroness asked a large number of questions. There was a radio
programme called “20 Questions”. I did not count the
noble Baroness’s but I felt that she asked a fair number. I will
do my best to answer them, but she very kindly said that I might write
to her. It might help if I wrote on some of these matters and put a
copy in the Library of the
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:52:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000184" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000184">The
noble Baroness asked how public the professional register would be. It
will be a public document. It is intended that organisations such as
the Security Industry Authority and private security firms will be able
to take note of these matters. It will not be just for police officers
to note who has been in effect deregistered from the police service as
a result of
misconduct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:52:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000185" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000185">The
parallel organisation to the IPCC is the College of Policing. With its
code of ethics, it will provide the framework in which the new sense of
purpose about integrity can be addressed. The noble Baroness asked
whether it would cover matters such as the identity of children. As she
knows, that is being investigated by Chief Constable Creedon at the
moment, and he will report on the full implications. That is just the
sort of issue at which I expect a code of Essex—sorry,
ethics—to look. I apologise for that slip of the
tongue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:53:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000186" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000186">The
noble Baroness also asked how one would define “serious”
and “sensitive”. One tends to know what is serious and
sensitive when it turns up. This will 
<?notus-xml column=593?>be about the relationship between the IPCC and individual police forces.
Individual forces have just as great an interest in making sure that
the public are supportive of them and perceive that the integrity of
the police is based very locally within each police force.</hs_para>

points to make. The list is designed to ensure that all those who are
dismissed as a result of misconduct proceedings, or would have been
dismissed had they remained in service, cannot find employment in
another force. That is the principal purpose behind it. They are struck
off from being a police officer in the future. We envisage that the
list will be used by other employers—I have mentioned employers
in the security industry—to consider whether or not to employ
such dismissed

Condon:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest in policing and
the security services. The Government are to be congratulated and
supported by all sides of the House on bringing forward this courageous
package of measures because it is clearly in the public interest and in
the interests of the service to ensure the highest levels of integrity
in policing. While there may be concerns about other aspects of police
reform, this package is clearly moving in the right direction. When the
Minister places a letter in the Library of the House, will he consider
including in it a response to just how and when resources will be
transferred from individual police services to the IPCC to enable it to
carry out its enhanced role? It is not clear at the moment whether only
budgets are to be transferred or whether this will involve real, live
investigators moving sideways on attachments, moving permanently, and
so on. The House would welcome some fairly clear guidance on how this
is to operate, but in the round, these proposals are courageous and are
to be
welcomed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:57:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, who
speaks with considerable experience of these matters. I shall certainly
do my best to respond promptly to his request for details of the
transfer of resources and whether indeed that will involve more than
cash and budgets, and will extend to resources. To some degree, the
Statement is a starting point for a discussion with individual police
forces and, indeed, with police and crime commissioners for they too
are engaged in the governance of the police across the country; I hope
that that dialogue will be productive. I am sure that noble Lords
appreciate that this is considered to be an important development in
the integrity of
policing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T16:58:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, welcome the Statement and I
agree with the implicit message that transparency and integrity go hand
in hand. I do not doubt that, when there is a problem, those who feel
it most keenly are individual police officers who themselves have shown
the utmost integrity. First, what consultation has been undertaken on
these measures, not just with ACPO but with those who represent the
lower ranks of the police service? Secondly, will any of
these measures —I am thinking particularly of the
registers of interests, gifts and so on—apply to civilian staff
within police

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My noble friend has raised two very
interesting aspects and I thank her for bringing them forward. The key
thing about these proposals is that they will affect the
professionalism of the police at all ranks so, as she rightly points
out, they represent a development that I hope will be welcomed. They
will be part and parcel of ongoing discussions that we are having as we
seek to create a modern police force in this country—something
that covers a whole load of matters and will now include this. We will

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to ask the Minister a
question which my noble friend did not ask. The noble Lord started his
Statement by referring to falling crime levels. The Minister will be
aware that integrity and transparency are not simply about high-profile
corruption cases or miscarriages of justice but about the way in which
the police represent what is going on in relation to crime and their
success in dealing with it. He will also be aware that, a couple of
weeks ago, the Office for National Statistics seriously queried the
rate at which crime is falling and suggested that some of the police
forces’
figures,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13021253000267" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000267">“overstate

Minister may also be aware that there are even more serious allegations
around, some of which may well be aired in a meeting here tonight, that
some of that underrecording is deliberate, whether as result of
reduced resources in police forces or as a result of deliberate
connivance or encouragement by senior police officers. If that is at
all the case, there are serious issues of integrity that need to be
addressed. I am not clear whether this new structure would be able to
address such issues in the police force; they are basically
administrative but have huge implications for the public’s and
the body politic’s trust in what the police are telling us. In
particular, can the Minister indicate whether the ONS suggestions are
being pursued and whether, in future, they could be pursued through
these new
arrangements<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

to keep oneself well informed, even if it is just to inform one of
where people are going wrong. This issue is a very serious one. I do
not think there is any dispute about the fact that crime figures are
falling. There are matters of definition, which I think it is going to
be in everyone’s interests to get tidied up, but the allegation
that these figures are being manipulated is a very serious one.
Unfortunately, I cannot attend the meeting which the noble Earl, Lord
Lytton, who is not in his place at the moment, has called for this

years ago, to be Police Minister in the other place, I suggest that the
situation which now obtains in relation to the police is not all that
dissimilar to that which existed in the early 1960s. The Government of
the day, a Conservative Government, set up the royal commission under
Sir Henry Willink because they were convinced that only an inquiry that
was wholly independent of government could have the chance of replacing
the police in that position of trust and distinction which they had
traditionally occupied in the community. I respectfully ask the
Minister to consider deeply whether that precedent should not now be
followed in the circumstances
prevailing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T17:05:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021253000202" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000202"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="13021253000811" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021253000811">Lord

Lord’s suggestion that there is equivalence between the two
situations, but I am certain that the restoration of good practice
within communities is a very local matter. That is why the focus of the
Statement is on the engagement of individual forces and the maintenance
of professional standards throughout the police force from top to
bottom. I hope the noble Lord will understand that I am not prepared to
go quite as far as he would

officials in Whitehall and others who need access to highly sensitive,

Police Complaints Authority who now serves on the small review group
looking at serious cases for the IPCC, I welcome what the Minister has
just announced. Perhaps I may ask him two questions. The first relates
to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Condon, about the
implications of a transfer of resources from local areas to the IPCC.
Has the Minister worked out the figures that we are talking about,
bearing in mind that the cuts that have been imposed on police forces
are causing serious problems in local areas? Has he worked out what the
implications of the transfer might be, because many lower level cases
are best dealt with at the point at which they occur; that is, in the
local area.
Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T17:07:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T17:09:27"></hs_TimeCode>,
the Minister mentioned the powers that are required by the IPCC and
said that we can expect legislation. Will he consult not only the IPCC
but the many other relevant organisations which have repeatedly raised
concerns about the existing powers of the IPCC? What will he do to

write to the IPCC, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary,
PCCs and the college itself to seek detailed proposals on how the
transfer of resources might take place and over what period. I think
that will help the noble Lord, Lord Condon, in his question to me. This

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T17:13:08"></hs_TimeCode> noble friend
quite rightly recognises that we have been through a process where
management has been seen as being the most important ingredient for
success. Indeed, management is important, but in policing—and
many other services—leadership is vital because of how those who
command inspire those who work with them. The College of Policing is
based on developing exactly that set of skills and indeed a
professional ethos within the police force and reinforcing that
professionalism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T17:11:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

there is another problem that needs to be addressed: the issue of
police officers with a criminal conviction being allowed to remain as
serving police officers. I have looked at this issue over the years,
most recently in January 2012. I was looking at it in respect of the
Metropolitan Police but I suspect that in other police forces the
pattern is similar. I was absolutely shocked to find that there were
400 serving Metropolitan Police officers who had had a criminal
conviction, a caution or a penalty note for disorder. Fifty-five of
these were for offences of violence—of which 30 were for
assault, ranging from battery through to actual bodily
harm—and 22 for offences involving dishonesty.</hs_para>

come out of this. For example, can it be right that serving police
officers who have a conviction for violence are able to
volunteer to be trained to use firearms or tasers? Can it be right that
police officers who have a conviction for dishonesty can then appear in
court? It seems inconceivable that police officers with serious
criminal convictions should be allowed to serve. I urge the Government

propose that there should be equal representation.
That would mean that there will always be equal representation of
employer and employee interests, regardless of the number of
participating employers in a scheme. Given that public service pension
boards will not have a role in setting the scheme regulations, there is
no need to engineer a balance that favours either group.</hs_para>

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, this is indeed a reprise of a debate
which we had in Committee. I believe that the Government have been
extremely clear about their position on this issue throughout the
legislative process, both here and in another place. Let me explain
again why we remain unmoved. At the risk of stating the obvious, the
Government have no desire or intention of replacing the
defined benefit schemes that have been negotiated.
Officials, employers and member representatives have worked extremely
hard to agree scheme designs that meet the needs of the different
workforces and which are fair and affordable.</hs_para>

believe that the new schemes are fit for purpose. Everyone is now
working to implement these schemes from April 2015 for most workforces,

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment relates to revaluation.
Clause 9 appears to allow the Treasury to change yet again the
basis of revaluation, this time away from the CPI to something else. We
discussed this in Committee and various assurances were given in that
respect, although they are not as yet reflected in the Bill. However,
no reassurances were given—indeed, the Minister was less than
his usual emollient self—in relation to the provision in the
Bill that in effect allows for negative revaluation in the light of
changes in the CPI. That means that the Treasury can on the one hand
amend the index and on the other impose a decrease in the accrued
pension without any consultation with those affected, and in a way
that, in the case of the LGPS, seriously undermines not only
long-established practice but the recent agreement between the LGA and
the trade unions.</hs_para>

have looked at the history of the LGPS over the past 30 years, although
it has actually run for a longer period than that, and there was only
one point at which the relative index, at that point the RPI, actually
fell at the point at which it was evaluated, and that was from
September 2009 to the 2010
increase.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021268000003">There
were no precedents at that time. We had to refer back to the Pensions
(Increase) Act 1971, which allows for increases but does not allow for
decreases. The interpretation at that time was that that Act did not
permit a decrease, so the 2010 adjustment was, in effect, zero. That is
one
aspect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021268000004">The
other aspect of having the potential for a negative adjustment in
revaluation is that it is inconsistent between those who are already
receiving pensions or who are entitled to deferred benefits and are
therefore governed by the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971, in which case
they would not be reduced, and active members who are still
contributing to the scheme and who would, at precisely the same time
when a negative revaluation could be made under this clause, see their
benefits go down. We would therefore be treating active members
disfavourably compared with members who have left the scheme or are
already drawing their
pension.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021268000005">I am
grateful for the assurances on the continuation of the CPI, but the
fact is that the sudden and unexpected replacement of long-established
RPI by the CPI has left a legacy of distrust in the schemes. Part of
that is that if the CPI, as is expected, performs, if that is the word,
less substantially than the RPI, there is a greater likelihood or
possibility of a negative figure. The recent agreement between the LGA
and the trade unions made it clear that past practice would continue to
operate, and that if there were a negative change in the index there
would be a nil adjustment. The implication of this clause is that it is
attempting to override that commitment and agreement, which I think the
Minister, and certainly some of his predecessors, would accept got the
Government out of a very difficult position on pension reform in
general and the LGPS in particular. Therefore, unravelling that aspect
of the agreement—there are other amendments I will come to with
a similar effect—is not
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0001.htm#13021268000006">Amendment
15 would stipulate precisely what is already past practice and in the
agreement: namely, that if there is a negative movement in the index,
there 
<?notus-xml column=603?>will be a nil adjustment. I think the Government should accept the
amendment. I appreciate the strong words of the Minister last time that
the Government are not prepared so to do, despite the anomalies and
distrust it would create. There are alternative amendments on this in
this group in the name of my noble friend Lord Eatwell. Perhaps the
Government could at least show their good will by accepting that if
there were a negative increase, it would have to be subject to the
affirmative procedure as provided for in my noble friend’s
amendment, which no doubt he will move more ably than me
shortly.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13021268000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000007">If
the Government do not move at all, we are in some serious difficulty.
It is causing considerable upset among employers, among those who have

by accepting my amendment or, in default of that, my noble
friend’s amendment. It would be wrong for the Government to
reject both. We would be on some sort of collusion course, whereas in
general the LGPS and the arrangements for it from 2014 are done and
dusted in a way that frankly was probably beyond the
Government’s dreams only a year or so ago. I think that would be
most unfortunate not only for the members of and employers in the

proposed by the Government and, in the case of the LGPS, has been
accepted in the negotiations between the employers and unions. If the
noble Lord seeks further rebalancing of the risk over and above what is

and perhaps even outrageous, that the Government are
pressing ahead here and are not taking the review properly into
account. The report does not recommend a normal pension age of 60; nor
does it make the case for firefighters working to 60. The review was
set up to assess the appropriate normal pension age. Nowhere in the
review does it say that 60 is appropriate. At most, the
review’s recommendations establish a set of conditions
—such as national firefighter fitness standards, fitness entry
standards at recruitment, fitness training throughout careers, and an
accepted testing regime—that would have to be met before working
to 60 was
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000024">The

seem intent on imposing a national pension age of 60 despite the

to move on to make some remarks about fitness. Aerobic fitness, one of
the core components of fitness—along with
anaerobic/high-intensity fitness and strength—is often measured
using the rates of oxygen uptake, or VO2. The Williams report suggests
that at least 42 VO2 is necessary for firefighting. This
is the level recommended by experts in the field and is the
level that the majority of fire services are using today. The report
admits that at 50 to 54 years of age, 51% of firefighters are below the
figure of 42 VO2. At the age of 55 to 60, that rises to 66%: two-thirds
of firefighters are below that standard. The report suggests that if 42
is the standard, then by 60 years of age up to 92% of present
firefighters could be below the minimum standard for operational duty.
To push ahead with this is risky and
dangerous<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T17:50:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that, even in a best case scenario, where firefighters maintain their
physical activity status, their body mass index and their smoking
status as they age, at 55 years of age approximately 15% of
firefighters would be below the minimum standard required for
operational duty. By 60 years of age, this percentage would rise to
23%. However, this best case scenario model uses a higher entry
standard than the one currently in force. It assumes that firefighters
are recruited at 47 VO2, whereas actually the recruitment standard is
much lower at 42. This means that the best case scenario is flawed as
it assumes a much higher fitness level on recruitment than is in fact

spell out clearly what kind of fitness regime and lifestyle changes
will be necessary to meet this best case scenario? Most firefighters
are likely to do fitness training at work of at least 30
minutes per shift; some do up to four hours a week. Does the noble Lord
accept that what may be possible in the future, with new recruits and
different standards, is fundamentally different from expecting people
now in service to reach these service levels at ages between 55

the noble Lord is not prepared to accept the amendment, can

do nothing other than accept that the national pension age must be set

further discussions to take place, and if the Government are not
persuaded, they can set the level at 60.</hs_para>

approaching retirement age at the present time and that the issue
arises much more for firefighters who are now 40 to 45. In those cases,
when it is recognised that people are going to live longer and when the

amendments in my name and that of my noble and learned friend Lord
Davidson, both of which seek to add flexibility and that famous
characteristic, future-proofing, to the Bill. It is a laudable
objective of the Government to have a common movement—a
standard process—that can be seen as fair and generally
acceptable across the entire structure of public service pensions.
However, it is an objective which will, inevitably, from time to time,
run up against reality. We have already seen it run up against reality
in the case of the uniformed services, which we discussed earlier. It
could also run up against reality in a whole series of other
circumstances where the best would be the enemy of the
good<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T17:54:47"></hs_TimeCode>. In other

flexibility and Amendment 19 relates flexibility to a scheme-specific

age. The review was a key component of the scheme’s specific

that the Bill can be amended to allow some flexibility. Amendment 19
would allow for further categories of workers to be exempt from the

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, as regards Amendment 18, we are aware of,
and greatly respect, the hard work done by the police, firefighters and
the Armed Forces. But the noble Lord, Lord Hutton, was clear that the
normal pension age for these schemes should be equal to 60, subject to
regular review. As we know, this fixed age is already significantly
different from the position for all other public service workers. A
pension age of 60 for police and firefighters is in line with the
reforms implemented by the previous Administration. We are not, and nor
should we be, in the business of reducing pension ages given the
longevity challenges we face. To do so would go against all that the
Bill is designed to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T18:02:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000045">We
already have made a commitment to review these provisions as and when
future changes to the state pension age are announced. Those reviews
will be separate from the state pension age reviews to ensure that the
specific impacts on public service schemes are taken into account. The
noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, asked about where we would legislate for the
DWP White Paper more generally. We will legislate separately for that.
Obviously, it is not appropriate to do that in this Bill. It is a much
wider issue and we will deal with the question of reviews in the
context of the rest of the White
Paper.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000046">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T18:03:23"></hs_TimeCode>
firmly believe that the drafting of the Bill is correct on this issue
and that the pension age provisions, including the link to state
pension age for other schemes, are rightly the cornerstone of the
legislation. It is also worth remembering that setting a normal pension
age of 60 does not prevent people retiring before 60 if they wish.
Early retirement factors can be taken within the scheme rules and added
pension can be bought. Both of those allow for more flexibility over
when people can access their pension. All three schemes captured by
this amendment already allow people to take benefits from the age of 55
if they wish.</hs_para>

to respond briefly to the points raised concerning the firefighters and

should start by making it clear that it is not the case that the review
found evidence that a very large proportion

60. The report finds that the average serving firefighter is already
beyond the required fitness levels at the age of 35 to maintain
operational fitness until the age of 60, if those individuals maintain

discussed with the union that there is an argument for more structured

may spend time on physical activity but quite a lot of it might
generously be called pretty informal. Getting a more formal and
rigorous fitness regime in place, which would help individuals more
generally as well as in their ability to work to the age of 60, falls
outside the scope of the Bill and is something that the FBU no doubt
will want to discuss further with its employers.</hs_para>

that in circumstances where people maintain their physical activity

should briefly remind the House of the reason for the state pension age
link in the first place. To get a grip on public finances, we were
faced with a choice. We could either significantly reduce the value of
scheme benefits or ask people to work slightly longer before they can
receive their pension. We decided that the latter approach is best.
Scheme benefits will be marginally less generous in the new schemes but
only by a small amount. Instead, we are asking people to wait until
their state pension age before becoming eligible for their
pension. We think that this is preferable to significantly reducing
benefits and increasing hard-working public servants’ reliance
on means-tested benefits in their retirement.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13021268000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000052">We should remember what
this state pension age link really means. For those retiring in the
near future, it means waiting until the age of 66. When people talk
about waiting until 67 or 68 and beyond, they are talking about several
decades’ time from now. We are not talking about extending
people’s working lives overnight. Instead, we have a lot of time
to assess how best to adapt to extended longevity and how to ensure
that employers provide the right working conditions to allow people to
work up to the state pension age.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T18:08:29"></hs_TimeCode> is why the
NHS working longer review—to which the noble Baroness, Lady
Hollins, referred—is so important.</hs_para>

think everyone recognises—I made this point in
Committee—that it is not just in the public sector that there
are a range of occupations which people cannot do as well at the age of
67 as they can at 27. It is a challenge across society to find methods
of working which reflect that so that people can carry on working 
<?notus-xml column=612?>to a later retirement age without being faced with undue stress during
their latter years. The review is looking not at the link with
retirement age but at how best to deliver NHS services with a workforce
who is living longer. I am sure that other workforces in the public
sector will need to follow the lead of the NHS in looking at how they
can achieve that.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13021268000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000054">What we should not do
is seek to make exceptions to the state pension age link. As I have
outlined, the link has very little effect in the short to medium term,
but it is a crucial part of the solution to the long-term problem.
While we should not dig our heads in the sand, there comes a time when
it is best to accept the reality of the situation: people are living
longer and the public service workforce must and will adapt to that.
The previous Administration recognised that when they asked all public
servants—barring those whom we have identified—to work to
the age of 65. We are simply future-proofing that approach by tracking
the state pension age as it moves beyond 65. If we do not face up to
the challenge of increases in longevity now, we would only have to do
so in the near future when there will be less resource available. For
those reasons, I cannot support this amendment. The universal state
pension link is absolutely vital to putting public service pensions on
a fair and sustainable footing. I have complete confidence that, with
the appropriate foresight and common sense from employers, it
will be deliverable across all the relevant public service
workforces.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000055">Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T18:09:42"></hs_TimeCode>,
Amendment 20 seeks to provide for an independent review of the pension
age mechanisms in this Bill. I reiterate that the Government are
totally committed to reviewing the pension age, as and when future
changes to the state pension age are announced. This was one of the
recommendations of the noble Lord, Lord Hutton, and we are sticking to
it. I add that the House should be reassured that, when coming to
decisions on any changes to the state pension age, Ministers will bear
in mind the consequences for public servants. We would also expect
member representatives to feed into this separate process. None the
less, there are good reasons why this Bill does not provide for the
review to the normal pension age provisions, which would follow any
state pension age reviews that result in a change to the state pension
age. For a start, public service pensions link to the state pension
age, not vice versa, so given that work on the state pension age
reviews is still in its early stages, and we do not know exactly how it
will consider public service schemes, it would be premature to lock
down details of the normal pension age provisions at this
stage.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13021268000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000056">More
importantly, we have not yet even developed those details—and
that is sensible. We should not be determining the parameters for such
reviews so far in advance, nor should we be trying to do so. It would
be for the Government of the day to consider what is appropriate,
beyond of course taking into account any changes in longevity. If that
were to involve an independent assessment, so be it. However, again, it
would be for the Government of the day to decide if that were
appropriate. The Government may already have had all the independent
advice that they require on longevity from the wider state pension age
review, depending on the final details of that process. If, during the
course of 
<?notus-xml column=613?>that review, there was no representation from the public sector that it
wished to be treated any differently from anyone else, the scope of a
review would be rather less than if there was a lot of independent
evidence and representations being made from the public sector that it
was in a different situation from the rest of the workforce—and
not just a different situation, but a worse situation. Of course,
nobody is going to argue that the public sector should have a
differentially higher retirement age. While we could put a bland
commitment into the Bill just to review the provisions from time to
time, that would not be worth while without being able to include any
details. It would carry very little weight and give no more assurance
on this matter than the public statements that we have made on our
intentions on a number of occasions. I therefore urge the noble

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I start with the amendment of the noble
Lord, Lord Whitty. As he says, the LGPS differs from the unfunded
schemes in several respects. While the current fair deal does not
technically apply to that scheme, a similar principle is contained
in the Local Government Act 2003. That Act requires
the Secretary of State to make a direction to specify how pension
issues are to be dealt with when staff are transferred out from a best
value
authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000069">The
noble Lord is understandably concerned to understand how the Government
intend to implement the new fair deal policy for the LGPS, given this
existing provision. The Department for Communities and Local Government
is currently considering how best to do it. Should it prove necessary
to amend the 2003 Act to implement the new fair deal policy, I can
assure the noble Lord that the Government will do so at the earliest
possible opportunity. I hope that I have given him the answers that he
was
seeking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000070">As
regards the amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Davidson, the
Government have stated a number of times—both in this House and
the other place—that we are committed to reforming the fair
deal. There are provisions in the Bill to facilitate this. Indeed, the
government amendments in this group are concerned with fair deal, which
I shall come to in a minute, and work is under way to determine how
this commitment will be implemented.</hs_para>

consultation closed only yesterday on some of the final policy details
of fair deal. We are in the final stages of planning for its
implementation. Therefore, in our view there is no need to refer to
fair deal in the Bill in the way proposed and we believe that the
amendment has serious flaws. As drafted, it would commit the Government
to bringing forward proposals for ensuring that compulsorily
transferred members of public service schemes can remain in those
schemes. It would also seem to commit the Government to bring
forward the proposals for the purpose of ensuring that
compulsorily transferred staff can remain in their schemes,
effectively committing government to implementing the proposals.
However, it would not be appropriate to give any member of the scheme
an unconditional right to remain an active member if their contract of
employment was transferred to an independent contractor. While, of
course, it is the Government’s aim that transferred employees
would have a right to remain in the scheme when transferred out of the
public sector, this right cannot be unconditional. While in the vast
majority of circumstances it will be appropriate for fair deal to
apply, there may be some cases when it would
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000072">There
have been examples in the past, notably during the financial crisis, of
highly paid specialist financial staff who have been brought into
government for a time- limited period, and then transferred to
independent employers. Although it may have been right to offer these
staff access to the schemes while working in government, it would not
be appropriate to allow them to retain access to the schemes when they
leave, especially as the taxpayer is ultimately responsible for paying
these
pensions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000073">Similarly,
on the wording of this amendment, a member of staff who was transferred
out and then voluntarily moved off the public service contract
to do purely private work could remain a member of the public

examples demonstrate that the implementation of the fair deal is
complex. The Government are carefully considering these complexities to
ensure there are no unintended consequences when the policy comes into
force. Given this, it is the Government’s view that the fair

assure noble Lords that the fair deal will be implemented when we have
done all the necessary

hope that I can explain why government Amendment 42 is
necessary. This amendment is concerned with people who are admitted to
a public service pension scheme but who are not part of the main public
service workforces listed in Clause 1. For example, it could apply to
staff employed by a hospice who are offering services under a contract
to the NHS and whose employer would like them to have the advantage of
the NHS Pension Scheme. It is important to note that this amendment
does not affect any of the main workforces in Clause 1. It can apply
only to other people who are admitted into the scheme under the
extension power in Clause 24.</hs_para>

fair deal, a range of private and third sector bodies will be able to
participate in these schemes in future. The amendment is concerned with
ensuring that the schemes can be appropriately modified to reflect
differences in the structure and nature of those diverse bodies. First,
the amendment clarifies that scheme regulations may make special
provisions in respect of people who are allowed to participate in the
public schemes. The health and local government pension schemes already
have a wealth of experience in providing for admitted bodies. The
special provisions that are currently applied to those schemes include
requirements for indemnities, guarantees, additional record-keeping, et
cetera. These provisions are needed to ensure that the body meets the
costs of participating in the scheme. The amendment would also allow
for modifications that have already been made in respect of admitted
bodies in the National Health scheme to be carried forward to the new
schemes. Such modifications currently relate to about 60,000
scheme members and it is important that these can be
maintained.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000077">Secondly,
the amendment allows for modifications to be made where bodies are
admitted to the schemes in the future. Where scheme regulations provide
for it, the responsible authority will be able to issue a direction to
modify how the scheme applies to the staff of a body that is brought
into the scheme. The NHS Pension Scheme currently makes between 100 and
150 such directions every year. Allowing for modifications to be made
via an administrative direction will ensure that the scheme is applied
appropriately in each case without the need to legislate for every
single one or the delays that that would
cause.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000078">The
Bill provides that a direction may be made only for permitted purposes.
Those are that the modification is necessary to protect the public
purse from costs arising from that body participating in the scheme,
where additional information requirements are needed to allow the
scheme and the risks to be managed properly by the scheme manager or to
reflect the nature of the employment or the structure of the
employer. This is not a new or novel power. The Secretary of State for
Health has had broader powers to modify the health pension schemes
since 1967. For those who wish to study the details, those powers are
to be found in Section 7 of the Superannuation (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1967. The power explicitly set out by this amendment is
more restrictive in scope than this existing power, which provides
unfettered scope to modify the existing health schemes. The important
safeguards set out in our amendment will ensure that any modifications
are appropriate. Allowing bodies to participate in the schemes under
Clause 24 will usually be as a result of fair deal. In such
circumstances it would not be appropriate for modifications to alter
members’ benefits in any way. Modifications that relate to fair
deal transfers will, therefore, be limited to ensuring that employers
meet their liabilities in full or provide the information necessary to
run the schemes properly. I hope I have succeeded in explaining why we
think that that amendment is
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T18:28:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000079">Amendment
43 relates to the locally administered public service pension schemes.
Under Clause 24(3), scheme regulations may specify bodies or persons
that may be permitted to participate in the scheme.
It is 
<?notus-xml column=618?>anticipated that the regulations will prescribe the
types of body that may be permitted: for example, a body that is
providing services related to the main scheme workforce or a body that
staff are transferred to under fair deal. Clause 24(5) then provides
for an administrative determination to be made to extend the scheme to
persons employed by such a body. Clause 24(8) requires an up-to-date
list of persons to whom the scheme has been
extended.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000080">All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T18:22:23"></hs_TimeCode>
these functions sit with the responsible authority. Our amendment
allows for the functions in Clause 28(5) and (8) to be
delegated to the scheme manager in a locally administered scheme. This
is subject to any condition that the responsible authority considers
appropriate. This reflects current practice in the local government
scheme, in which it is the local authority that determines to admit a
body to its pension fund. There are more than 5,000 admitted bodies in
the local government scheme, and local authorities are best placed to
determine their eligibility to participate in the scheme and to assist
in administering the list of those who participate. They will do so
within the limits of the scheme regulations set by the responsible
authority. In turn, it is the local authorities that will be
responsible for managing and administering the scheme for that body.
They will collect data, contributions and provide benefit information
and pensions to
members.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000081">I

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I am sorry if this amendment appears to
be another bit of LGPS exceptionalism but I hope that it can actually
clarify the situation. There is a bit of confusion between Clauses 12
and 13. On my interpretation, Clause 12 applies to all schemes, whereas
Clause 13, to which I have little objection, provides for funded
schemes. However, if Clause 12 indeed applies to funded and unfunded
schemes, it will cause some difficulty for the
agreement that has 
<?notus-xml column=619?>been reached on the new cost-management system for
the LGPS. As the clause stands, it does not reflect the dual process
required by the LGPS and the separate cost management that was

relatively friendly indications from the Treasury that it recognises
this problem and we would like assurances from the Minister that the

start date. I would therefore welcome reassurance from the Minister
that the ability of the Treasury, at various points that are set out,
to override a funded scheme—in this case, the LGPS—would
not be applied to a scheme that had its own government-endorsed
cost-management process in place. If I can have that confirmation, or
something like it, I would not press the amendment. Clarification would
also be useful on whether the whole of Clause 12 is indeed

Newby:</Member></B> I hope that I can go at least some way in giving
the noble Lord the reassurances that he seeks. The Government recognise
the unique nature of the LGPS and that the cost-control mechanism for
that scheme must reflect it. We have therefore developed a dual process
to which the noble Lord referred, which will give scheme stakeholders
additional flexibility to manage costs, while allowing the Government
to retain final control over the costs and design of the
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000087">Clause
12 will provide for the Government to retain this overall control. They
will use these provisions to put in place an automatic backstop which

flexibilities that we will give to scheme stakeholders in their

the LGPS is covered by these statutory provisions in exactly the same
way as the other schemes. All schemes need this mechanism to ensure
that they are a sustainable way to provide good pensions that last.

challenging” if it were to be in 2014 or 2015. If the Minister
can assure the House that the Scottish Government are now confident
that they can meet the current timescale, and that trade unions and
employers in Scotland have been consulted, I would plainly be in a
position to reconsider whether the amendment should be advanced. At
this point, however, pending what the Minister has to say, I beg to

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the purpose of the amendment is extremely
straightforward, and the noble and learned Lord has asked me a question
about the attitude of the Scottish Government. As I explained in
Committee, the Scottish Government may think that the timetable is
challenging but they have not asked for the extension of time that the
amendment proposes.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T18:38:39"></hs_TimeCode> has been a
series of correspondence between Westminster and the Scottish
Government in which there have been no calls for a delay. In fact, when
the Chief Secretary wrote to the Scottish Government asking if there
were any particular amendments that they would like us to consider
tabling, a request for a delay was not specifically made. I should take
this opportunity to reiterate that we do not believe that a delay is
necessary. There is ample time—just over two years—for
the Scottish Government to prepare before the existing schemes are
closed. These important reforms do not come as a surprise either north
or south of the border.</hs_para>

Hutton, recommended back in March 2011 that the key scheme design
features should be part of a UK-wide policy framework. Everything that
has been done since then, for almost two years now, has proceeded on
that basis. Furthermore, the new Whitehall-administered schemes provide
an excellent basis for the Scottish Government to consider when
finalising their scheme designs. We are not suddenly asking the
Scottish Government to start these reforms from scratch.</hs_para>

the financial implications of introducing a delay. This would result in
hundreds of millions of pounds of additional liabilities being accrued
in the Scottish schemes. These additional costs would have to be met
from the Scottish budget at the expense of Scottish jobs and services,
something that I am sure 
<?notus-xml column=621?>all noble Lords would want to avoid. In addition to
the cost implications, we should also consider the disadvantages that
Scottish public service workers on lower and middle incomes would face
if the reforms were delayed. They would continue to subsidise the
pensions of high flyers for another year. Taking all of this into
consideration, I hope that the noble Lord would feel that it would be
inappropriate for us to accept this

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, these are minor amendments that have been
urged on us by scheme members. They increase the level of flexibility
given to schemes and protect the value of the final salary link for
benefits that have been accrued in the current
schemes. The amendments concern the definition of pensionable 
<?notus-xml column=622?>earnings to be used in the new schemes and for the purposes of the final
salary link. The current drafting ties the definition of pensionable
earnings for the use of the final salary link to the definition of
pensionable earnings for the new schemes. We have recognised, however,
that in some instances this might not be desirable; for example, the
differences between the calculation of career average and final salary
benefits might make a shared definition
incongruous.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000097">Furthermore,
we have listened to concerns that imposing a shared definition means
that the value of final salary benefits could conceivably be reduced.
This would go against the spirit of the Government’s commitments
on the protection of the final salary link. These amendments,
therefore, mean that schemes may use the same or a different definition
of pensionable earnings for the purposes of the final salary link as
that used for the purposes of the new scheme. This does not preclude
the option of applying the definition of pensionable earnings that is
used in their existing schemes for the purposes of the final salary
link, if desired.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13021268000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000098">However, to make sure
that the value of the final salary link cannot be undermined by using a
new definition, the amendments contain a backstop protection, which is
that the definition of pensionable earnings for the purposes of the
final salary link may not result in the amount of earnings being
materially less than they would have been had the definition provided
for in the old scheme been applied when the new scheme service ended. I
hope that noble Lords will find these amendments to be a suitable
resolution to this issue.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13021268000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000099">Paragraph 3 of Schedule
7 sets out which periods of time should be disregarded in determining
whether someone has continuity of employment for the purposes of
retaining their final salary link. First, any gap, or gaps, of five
years or less where the person is not a member of a public service or
public body pension scheme should be disregarded. This is directly in
line with the recommendations of the noble Lord, Lord Hutton. It allows
public servants, for example, to take carer’s leave or to gain
experience in the private or voluntary sectors without seeing a
detrimental impact on their final salary pensions by losing this link
to their future public service
salary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000100">Secondly,
and most pertinently to Amendment 30, any gaps of any length of time
should be disregarded if a person was in a different public service or
public body pension scheme. Again, this is to allow members to gain
experience in different areas and to move from one area of public
service to another. Crucially, it is also part of the
Government’s very clear commitment to public servants to honour
their final salary benefits. The amendment in the name of the noble
Lord, Lord Whitty, would cut across that commitment. It would be unfair
to exclude current members of the local government scheme from final
salary link protections, which are being given to other public service
workers. Additionally, it would create a barrier to movement between
local government and other public service and public body
employment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000101">Under
paragraph 2 of Schedule 7, members of existing public service and
public body final salary schemes are able to maintain their final
salary link 
<?notus-xml column=623?>when they move between schemes by transferring their rights to benefits
out of their old final salary schemes into their new employer’s
old final salary scheme. This amendment would not affect this. However,
members of local government schemes should not have to proactively
transfer their benefits out of the LGPS to ensure benefiting from the
Government’s commitment on protecting their final salary
benefits, especially where other public service workers do
not have to do this. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, will
withdraw his

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, this is complicated territory. The way
in which the Minister described the implications of my amendment is not
the way in which I understand it. The LGA and the unions are concerned
that Schedule 7, as it stands, could reintroduce an
additional complication —an additional cost—into the LGPS
scheme, which was expressly removed by the agreement between the LGA
and the unions. That relates not so much to movement between the LGPS
employer and different public sector employers but to the situation
with people who have been employed by one LGPS employer, who then leave
and come back. I do not specifically stand by the wording in the
amendment, so I shall withdraw it shortly. However, the Government need
to make it clear where the responsibility lies. It seems to us that
responsibility for those in pensionable public service could see the
original employer being liable rather than the final employer. That
would give rise to unknown liabilities lying with the original employer
and not with the employer of the individual once they return to LGPS
employment.</hs_para>

over a substantial number of decades, so the administrative costs of an
employer trying to find out where their ex-employees have moved would
be quite substantial. It is difficult to estimate, but some actuaries
are telling the LGA that it could cost an additional 1% to the scheme.
If that were anywhere near an accurate estimate, it would seriously
jeopardise the 19.5% cost-management figure that has been built into
the LGPS and would increase the overall cost to the LGPS over and above
the ceiling.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000104">I
understand some of what the Minister says but, having outlined the
dilemma, perhaps he could suggest some other way of doing it. At the
moment, there is potentially a quite unnecessary cost loaded on
to the management of the LGPS. As I say, actuaries are telling
us that that could amount to a full 1% of the total cost. Even if it
were half that figure, it would be a serious issue. It needs to be
solved. My amendment may not solve it, but I would be grateful for more
guidance from the Minister. Perhaps he could have some discussions with
the LGA on this issue before the passage of this Bill is
completed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000105" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000105"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13021268000238" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000238">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, we realise that there is concern about
the potential costs involved in this policy, but we do not believe that
it generates unreasonable costs. It is about offering fairness and
consistency. The likelihood is that most people who leave local
government service for prolonged periods of time to work in 
<?notus-xml column=624?>different public service employment would not expect to return. It is
therefore most likely that they will transfer their final salary
benefits to their new employer’s final salary scheme. However,
if liabilities for certain local government funds are increased by the
risk of a final salary link attaching to future employment with
different local government employers, it would be a matter for
individual funds to make appropriate financial arrangements, with the
help of scheme regulations if required. Undoubtedly, further discussion
will be required on exactly how this should be carried forward.
However, we do not believe that it is an insuperable problem for a very
good feature of the scheme. We hope very much that negotiations and
discussions will take place and that some of the fears of local
government actuaries will turn out to be
unfounded.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13021268000300" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000300">Amendment

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I turn to two government amendments to
Clause 25. Amendment 44 is intended to remove any ambiguity as to the
persons to whom Clause 25 applies. It has always been the
Government’s intention that this clause should relate to any
person who qualifies for a public service pension scheme
under Clause 1(2) of the Bill, as well as any other persons to whom a
scheme has been extended under Clause 24—that is, all those who
are eligible for a public service scheme and not just those who are
currently members of such a scheme. Doubts have been expressed about
whether the clause has that effect. This amendment sets out the
Government’s intentions
unambiguously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000107">Noble
Lords will remember that at Third Reading we debated a proposed
amendment to Clause 25 moved by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty. Noble
Lords were concerned that the clause was too general in its scope and
could allow local authority employers to undermine the Local Government
Pension Scheme by offering alternative pension arrangements as a matter
of course. The noble Lord therefore sought to exempt the Local
Government Pension Scheme from Clause 25. I gave assurances in that
debate that these powers did not allow eligibility for the main schemes
to be overridden, nor did they allow employers to make any alternative
arrangements mandatory. I stand by those assurances. In short, Clause
25 does not allow scheme managers or employers to act in the
unscrupulous manner that a number of noble Lords feared.</hs_para>

some people, particularly in the local government sector, still have a
lingering nervousness about the clause. The LGA and others have
explained that, while they accept that the clause cannot lawfully be
used in this way, they remain concerned that some employers will
misrepresent it. To put the matter beyond doubt, the Government tabled
this amendment, which makes the use of Clause 25 subject to any
provisions contained in scheme regulations. It makes it clear that
provisions in scheme regulations take priority. Furthermore, it will be
open to scheme regulations to restrict how the Clause 25 power
is used in the scheme, if that is thought appropriate. My
officials discussed the amendment with the LGA and I understand
that it is content with this approach. I trust that this provides a
further level of reassurance. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000109"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Whitty" PimsId="4591" UID="13021268000246" xid="1139" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000246">Lord

servants. This includes access to the transitional protection offered

Dubs:</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment stems from the situation
that arose on 31 March 2010 when Jarvis, a rail maintenance company,
went into administration. The amendment is not intended to make any
new demands but simply to close what I think was an
unforeseen loophole in the Railways Act 1993.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:07:42"></hs_TimeCode>Schedule 11 to
that Act was intended to provide railway workers employed by British
Rail at the time of rail privatisation with the right to a protected
pension. This amendment is intended to restore that
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T18:59:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000114" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000114">In
other instances where rail companies collapsed or gave up contracts,
the workforce had always been transferred to other companies, but this
did not happen with Jarvis, due to complex reasons related to the
application of the transfer of undertakings regulations. Nevertheless,
many of the Jarvis workers who had been employed by British Rail at the
time of privatisation rightly expected that at least their pensions
would be protected by the 1993 Act. It was then discovered that the Act
does not cover cases of companies going into administration, which
meant that these workers simply lost out. It is estimated that some 650
former Jarvis workers have been affected, and that the cost of meeting
the pensions shortfall that would arise from accepting this amendment
would be in the region of £400,000. The amendment would also
honour the spirit of the Railways Act 1993 and ensure that in the
unlikely event that another successor company to British Rail went into
administration and the work was not transferred to another company, any
affected workers who were also employed by British Rail in 1993 would
have their pensions fully

am seeking to put right something that was not foreseen and which
clearly represents an unfairness and an injustice. Jarvis’s
former BR employees are not receiving the protection that was promised
at the time of privatisation. The major flaw in the protection order is
that it is an obligation on the employer, but where the employer
disappears it seems that there is no entity to take up that obligation.
That is obviously a serious gap in the original privatisation process,
and the former BR members employed by Jarvis were misled by
the UK Government as a result. They expected to get the pensions to
which they were entitled, instead of the much lower one they ultimately
received<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:02:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000116" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000116">I
do not think that this amendment was debated in the House of Commons

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble Lord has explained, his
concern relates to a situation that has arisen for people covered by
the railways pension scheme, which is a very different kind of scheme
from those covered by this Bill. That scheme was created as a railway
industry-wide pension scheme for the multi-employer railway industry
following privatisation. It is a unitised fund made up of a
number of different sections, only one of which is underwritten by the
taxpayer. Moreover, the scheme focuses predominantly on those working
for private sector employers in the rail industry. Conversely, while
some of the public service pension schemes in scope of the Bill may
admit certain private or third sector organisations, they are
predominantly focused on workers in the public sector. I will attempt
to respond briefly to the points raised in the noble Lord’s
amendment, but I am afraid that the primary focus of his attention
should be my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for
Transport.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13021268000119" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000119">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:04:22"></hs_TimeCode>
amendment would create a liability for the taxpayer to underwrite any
shortfall in a railways pension scheme section. This underwriting would
be required if the section develops a shortfall as a result of the
insolvency of a participating employer or former employer who is the
employer or former employer of a “protected person”.
Protected persons are beneficiaries of the section who still retain
certain rights deriving from British Rail days and enshrined in
regulations made under the Railways Act 1993 in relation to their
pension: for example, if their employer is obliged to provide pension
scheme rights “no less favourable” than the relevant
pension rights in their former designated pension scheme from British
Rail days.</hs_para>

current position. As I have said, the railways pension scheme is a
unitised fund that is divided up into sections. There tends to be one
section for each employer. Most participating employers in relation to
sections of the pension scheme are private sector railway operating
companies. Only two sections of the scheme benefit from a solvency
guarantee from government. The first of these is the “1994
Pensioners Section”, a closed section that deals primarily with
the residual, deferred and pensioner members of the former British Rail
pension schemes at the time of privatisation. The second is the
“BR Section”, a section comprising a small category of
contributing members and beneficiaries deriving from the former British
Rail pension scheme. Even if the amendment were within the scope of the
Bill, the Government do not believe that it is appropriate to amend the
existing legislation in relation to railway 
<?notus-xml column=631?>pensions, as set out in the Railways Act 1993 and
regulations made under it, and create a further liability for the
taxpayer, as the amendment seems to
propose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021268000121" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000121">The
noble Lord has tabled the amendment specifically because of the Jarvis
case. One employer, Jarvis, made use of the railways pension scheme,
but has become insolvent. In a situation where the sponsoring employer
of a section of the railways pension scheme no longer supports the
pension’s scheme, there are complex legal requirements affecting
how the scheme should operate in the future. The trustee of the RPS has
been working with the Pension Protection Fund to understand whether the
three sections of the RPS affected in this case are eligible for
support from the Pension Protection Fund. The three sections are
currently still in an assessment period. In the mean time, the trustee
retains responsibility for paying benefits, although the Pension
Protection Fund provides guidance on how the trustee should do
this.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13021268000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021268000122">I hope
that my explanation has provided some clarity for the noble Lord,
although I appreciate that he might not have got the help he seeks.

pension scheme is not a public service pension scheme in the same way
as those being legislated for here, and that this is not the

explanation and I think I would not be out of order if I said that I
want to study it in <I>Hansard</I> rather than comment on it directly,
particularly since  I am not an expert on the intricacies of
this issue. However, the outcome is disappointing. No one is
challenging the principle that these Jarvis workers should have been
better looked after than they were, given the commitments that were
made at the time of railways nationalisation, so what has happened is
rather unfortunate. This does not seem to be a fair outcome, whatever

I have no Bill under which to do that, although there may be other
ways. I look forward to receiving the Minister’s help. Also,
under the terms of the Railways Act 1993 maybe the Government could
introduce an order to rectify the situation. The Minister did not
comment on that suggestion, but I wonder whether he could take it away

the very urgent question of women’s safety as they go about the
ordinary business of life—both inside and outside their homes.
That is very important. This is not just a local Indian problem but a
world-wide one. When I got back, I saw that the Government had issued
an excellent document. The Ministry of Justice, the Home Office and the

the Crime Survey for England and Wales, only 15% of the victims of
adverse sexual events actually report the case to the police. What we 
<?notus-xml column=633?>have in the statistics of police action on
complaints is a very small part of the total problem. We ought to give
some thought to how we can increase the rate of complaints and
encourage women not to withdraw into a shell if they have
had a horrible sexual experience and how we can encourage
them to come out and
complain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000006">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:19:36"></hs_TimeCode>
major difficulty with rape and other sexual assaults is that 85% to 90%
of the perpetrators of the crime are known to the victim. They are
partners, somebody in the family or somebody the victim knows very
well. Part of the reluctance to complain may be that you might be
harming a family member or friend. We ought to set up ways, perhaps
after asking experts, to make the extent of the problem more visible to
the police and the criminal justice system than it is at present. If we
do that, we may be able to find out even more than
before.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000007">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:14:23"></hs_TimeCode>

she was a student at a music school. The case came to light many years
later and she tragically died while the court case was going on. That
shows us that women undergo a huge amount of bad experiences but

sexual offences. Typically, according to the survey, the women who are
more vulnerable to such attacks are young—16 to 19
years-old—are single or separated, have a low income, are
sometimes students and are often physically unwell or disabled, as well
as economically inactive. We have a profile of a vulnerable person who
is more likely to be predated upon, and when we devise our systems for
encouraging them to complain, following through what has happened to
them and getting justice for them, we ought to look at this profile
very carefully and find out how, based on that profile, we can add

late 2011, I attended a conference at New Scotland Yard for
SOIT—sexual offences investigation trained; this is a new
acronym to me—officers. I was impressed by the concern then
shown by police to extend understanding and professionalism in this
work, but I wonder whether this is still not something which is
often better recognised by the more senior officers. Has it trickled
down to the junior officers who will respond initially to complaints
and
offences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:21:30"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000015">What
also made an impression on me were some of the comments made by victims
of sexual offences, though “victims” seems to me to be
the wrong word, because the women in question presented themselves very
much as survivors. I looked this morning at the notes that I made. They
included: “Victims have lots to lose … villains are the
defence teams and the judiciary”—I recognise that that is
a pretty complicated area and I do not want to be too simplistic, but
this is the reaction—and “getting DNA on the database is
regarded as a result”. What all that amounts to is the victim
not being taken sufficiently seriously and not being treated as any of
us would feel we or people whom we know to be in this situation would
want to be
treated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:22:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000016">Since
I thought that we would have even less time available this evening than
we have, my focus in preparing my remarks was deliberately narrow,
although there is one other particular issue which I will come to in a
moment. The noble Lord’s referring to how women are treated
inside the home as well as outside prompts me to mention, though not at
length, domestic
violence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:23:08"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:23:14"></hs_TimeCode>.
Another point that he made which is similar to what I have been
saying was about the attitude of less senior 
<?notus-xml column=635?>police officers. When I mentioned this in a debate
not long ago in the presence of a retired, very senior police officer
who is a Member of this House, he took me to task afterwards. I raised
the matter also with the chief executive of a domestic violence charity
with which I used to be associated and she said, “No, the
attitude has not changed. We’d like to think it has, but it
hasn’t, certainly not to the extent that would be
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:23:55"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000017">The
other issue that I will slot in, and on which public awareness is
probably about 20 years behind that on domestic violence—which
is how I have heard others describe it—is that of trafficking of
women. Here I make a plea for imaginative understanding of victims.
That ranges from how immigration issues are dealt with through response
to minor offending by the victims of trafficking to treating the trauma
which they have experienced.</hs_para>

is not a very good idea to add to my speech in a rather disorganised
way a whole lot of scattered points, so let me come back to the other
item that I wanted to raise. The report which is the subject of this
debate inevitably presents snapshots, but it is trends which are the
most important. I am not saying that trends are completely ignored by
the report, because one trend which is very clear within it is the
steady rise in the number of offenders in prison for sexual offences,
from around 6,000 in 2005 to almost 10,000 in 2011. That suggested to
me that offender management is not succeeding, but then I came across
the statistic that more than 80% of those offenders had not previously
been cautioned or convicted for sexual offences. I am not sure how
these statistics lie together and whether the Government have any
comment to make on them, nor am I sure whether they are affected by a
tendency to prosecute for a lesser offence than rape, which I presume
is to ensure a conviction. Perhaps the questions on this should all be
about the rehabilitative skills which will be available in the world of
payment by results that we all see coming along the
track<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:26:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

cannot get away from the thought that perhaps no distinction is being
made with other offenders and that the best approach to rehabilitation
as well as punishment is the big question. However, I shall return to
where I started: I heard it said the other day that someone who is
murdered is murdered once—I do not condone that, of
course—whereas someone who is raped is raped over and over
again, because that trauma is experienced again and again. In the
system’s treatment of victims, we would do well to remember
that.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13021274000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000098"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:27:14"></hs_TimeCode></I>7.27

2010 on the report on the treatment of rape complainants by public
authorities, which the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, so kindly
mentioned, I was struck many times by how confusing, uninformative and
contradictory the official statistics were and how unhelpful they were
in enabling people to have any understanding of what might happen to
them if they were to enter the system. I therefore recommended in my
report that clearer data be produced by the Office for National
Statistics so that victims and the wider public would have a better
idea of what might await them and how people are dealt with. At last,
we have such information and it is very

shall refer to just two points in the authoritative report that we are
discussing today—I hope that it will be widely read, because
there is much in it that is useful and which helps us to understand, as
the noble Lord, Lord Desai, said, the complexity of the subject. First,
it says that between 2008-09 and 2011-12, the number of rape offences
reported to the police increased by 22%. Secondly, it notes that
conviction rates for all rapes—of females and
males—increased between 2005 and 2011 by 9.9%, and that the
conviction rate in 2011 was 51.8%. I understand that the figures for
2012 are somewhat higher. These changes in reporting and conviction are
substantial moves in the right direction and reflect the profound
changes that have taken place in the police, the prosecution service
and the whole approach to serious sexual offences in the past
few
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000023">In many
places, most of the time, rape services are better trained and
investigations and prosecutions are done by specialists. According to
recent research by the Association of Chief Police Officers, 19 forces
now have specialist rape teams. The research suggests that these teams
increase reporting, victim confidence and victims’ willingness
to stay with the long drawn-out process. More victims now have access
to a sexual assault referral centre as more of these centres open.
Research shows that these centres are universally welcomed. Everyone in
the field will tell you that they have made an enormous difference to
the humanity and effectiveness of the whole process. More victims,
although not nearly enough, now have an independent sexual violence
adviser to guide them through the system and help them with the ordeal
of going to court and understanding what will happen to them and how
they can best prepare themselves for it. The system of independent
sexual violence advisers is so admired that the Government of New
Zealand have been advised that it should be introduced
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000024">These
improvements are the result of the efforts of a substantial number of
people in the police and prosecution service, the health service, the
voluntary sector and the rape crisis movement. These are people, often
with huge commitment, working together and responding more effectively
and creatively to victims. I will mention three very quick
examples.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000025">In
London people who have been raped can go to the sexual assault referral
centres called the Havens. I declare an interest as patron of the
Havens. Some of these people are prepared to report to the police and
some are not. Some of them come for medical and other help and do not
want to go through the criminal justice process. The Metropolitan
Police have placed a 
<?notus-xml column=637?>specially trained police officer—a SOIT officer, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Hamwee, explained—in the centre from 8 am to 10
pm. This officer deals with those who want to report, and those who do
not. Of course, it is their right not to report. Those who do not
report are invited to talk to the officer anonymously, if they wish, to
tell their stories without detail but to give enough information to
contribute to intelligence-gathering—and perhaps prevent more
rapes, as rape is often a serial offence. This must be good
practice.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13021274000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000026">My
second example is the UK Network of Sex Work Projects, which I am
patron of, which runs a scheme to protect prostitutes from violent

project at a Cornwall rape crisis centre, where the counselling the

ask the Minister: how are the Government going to ensure that this

and crime commissioners that this work, although expensive, is very
cost-effective and must be a priority? Will they keep the specialist
units? What will be the exact arrangements in the reorganised NHS for
providing sexual assault referral centres? Where will the
responsibility lie? Where will quality assurance come from? I
understand that the Minister may need to write to me about that.
Finally, what do the Government envisage happening to the funding of
the network of rape crisis centres and other voluntary projects that
deal with many thousands of victims as local authorities face more
cuts? Will the support come from central government? I look to the

report to which this debate draws our attention tells us that shocking
numbers of women are victims of sexual offending. It is a horrifying
reflection upon our society. The noble Lord, Lord Desai, has noted that
the resolution of cases that do come forward takes a long time. If this
is to be addressed in the manner that he wants, there is surely a need
for greater provision of resources and training for the police, the
Crown Prosecution Service and others involved in bringing justice to
speed up the rate at which sexual offences are brought to court.
Investigation has to be thorough and justice must be scrupulously
pursued, but a year is a very long time for a case to reach
court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000033">Secondly,
independent domestic and sexual violence advisers and other such
agencies play an invaluable role in accompanying survivors through the
system, as the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, noted. I hope that the
Government are prepared to invest significantly in that crucial work.
More cases might be resolved if that were to be the case; and some of
the concerns raised by the noble Lord, Lord Desai, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Hamwee, about cases not being pursued or not being taken
sufficiently seriously by the police might be
addressed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000034">Thirdly,
I hope that the Government will recognise that recent budget cuts have
led many local councils to reduce provision of services for survivors
of violence. That is a real problem. I should add that a great deal of
good work continues to be done by organisations such as the
Worcestershire Forum against Domestic Abuse. Many individuals and

with
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000035">I
believe that the suggestions that I have made would be a real help, but
although they are crucial, they are tackling the symptoms, terrible as
they are, of a deeper malaise. Lying behind the horrifying facts that
the report highlights is the increasing sexualisation of our culture,
which creates an enabling environment for sexual offences to develop. I
feel that acutely as the father of two daughters, one aged eight and
one aged 13. Reg Bailey, the chief executive of the Mothers’
Union, carried out an independent review of that in 2011, and noted the
concern of parents on a number of issues, including the sexualised and
gender stereotyping of clothing, products and services for children and
pressure on children from a range of sources to act as
consumers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:41:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000036">Those
are just the background, but I suggest that it is an important one. A
lot of what we see is the result of that increasingly sexualised
culture. The number of children suffering from sexual offending is one
result. Reg Bailey’s report suggests a range of actions to
address those concerns which deserve attention, but which I cannot go
into now. Suffice it to say that, as all noble Lords will recognise,
there are big issues to which I hope that the Government will pay

Gale:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Desai for
giving us the opportunity to debate the report tonight. It throws up
some interesting statistics on sexual offences. On average, 473,000
adults are victims of sexual offences per year, and the majority are
female. About 90% of the victims of the most serious sexual offences in
the previous year knew the perpetrator. That comes up in every study.
For example, victims of rape are often raped by people they
know<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:43:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000039">One
paragraph in the report which struck me was that, of females who were
victims of the most serious sexual offences in the past year, as my
noble friend Lord Desai said, only 15% had reported such offences. The
reasons that they cited why they did not report such incidents were
that they were embarrassed, or did not think that the police could do
much to help, or saw it as a private family matter, not police
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T19:43:57"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is much to be done to encourage victims to report. Otherwise, there is
not much chance of ever bringing the perpetrators to justice and they

consultation, they plan to introduce a new Bill, the ending violence
against women and domestic abuse Bill. The Bill does not address the
criminal justice issues, as the Welsh Government do not have
the power to do so. It proposes that Welsh Ministers should
have the power to appoint an independent ministerial adviser for ending
violence against women. If the Welsh Government do that, that would be
a first in United Kingdom. They wish to legislate to require local
authorities and public service partners to collaborate on a local and

Government propose to ensure that education on healthy relationships is
delivered to all schools in Wales. They propose to place a duty on
local authorities to identify a regional champion for educational

that they are relevant to tonight’s debate. Now that we have
devolution, different parts of the United Kingdom can do different

try out new measures, because we are a small country. We have 3 million
people, all in close contact with each other, and can debate these
issues. Does the Minister agree with the Welsh Government on their
proposals, and will he hold discussions with Welsh Ministers to see how
those proposals could be implemented in England? Again, with
devolution, we can all learn a lot from each other where there is good
practice. We created the first Children’s Commissioner in the
United Kingdom, and all the nations of the United Kingdom now have one.

often of the view that it is good to be further down the list because
everybody will have said everything and one will have nothing to say.
That is not my view today; I have been extremely glad to have had the
opportunity to listen to previous speakers and to learn about their
specific concerns. We heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Stern,
indications of some improvement, which is a good sign for the future,
as well as the priorities for future action by the Government, so I am

to be covered on this issue and even though we had a debate quite
recently, I suspect that there will be plenty of others to come. The
Government’s report that is the focus of our debate today
states, as the noble Lord, Lord Desai, said, that one in five women
surveyed had been a victim of a sexual offence at some point in her
life since the age of 16. That such a large proportion of women in
England and Wales should have experienced this sort of assault

increasing sexualisation of our

images and language permeate all areas of our culture from film and
television to song lyrics and advertising, while the amount of explicit
pornographic material widely accessible on the internet continues to
grow. The ubiquity of this type of material creates an environment in
which, as we are seeing, more and more people are exposed to images of
sexual violence which can, in turn, have a serious impact on their own
attitudes, expectations and
behaviour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000049">Particularly
vulnerable to these harmful influences are children and young people.
The sexual offending report records that young women aged between
16 and 19 are the age group most at risk of being victims of
sexual offences, while an NSPCC survey reported that physical and
emotional violence is commonplace within teenagers’ intimate
relationships. It appears that many adolescents are increasingly
developing damaging attitudes towards relationships where violence and
bullying are accepted forms of behaviour. I think the noble Baroness,
Lady Gale, mentioned the importance of schooling in all this and, my
goodness, that is very true. Of course there is parental
responsibility, but schooling will have an increasing responsibility
over the
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000050">The
development of communications technology is increasing young
people’s access to sexually explicit material while
simultaneously reducing the ability of parents to oversee what their
children are viewing. These concerns, among others, prompted me to
introduce my Online Safety Bill, which I am glad to see has its
supporters in the Chamber today, as it is vital that mechanisms to
reduce access to explicit content are made simpler for the ordinary
internet or mobile phone user and that greater responsibility is placed
on the providers of internet services to ensure that their products are
not being used
inappropriately.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000051">The
opt-in mechanism contained within that Bill would prevent children and
young people accessing pornographic material on the internet, whether
accidentally or otherwise, by requiring that this material is
accessible only to consumers who have purposefully chosen, by opting
in, to have access to such websites. Furthermore—and this is
vital—service providers would be required to verify that the
consumer is over the age of 18. This second mechanism ensures that
young people are protected not only from inadvertently being exposed to
unsuitable material but from intentionally seeking to opt in. Sadly, we
also know that some young people intentionally seek access to
pornographic material, and these young people’s own behaviour
can be most influenced by the images to which they are exposed. As we
all know, having had talks about trafficking children, the group to
whom this whole approach is most dangerous is those who have been in
care for a long time but have nowhere that they can turn to.</hs_para>

Lordships’ House. I speak as somebody who supports an
organisation in Derby, where I am the bishop, called Safe and Sound
Derby. It works particularly with women who are the victims of sexual
exploitation, violence and abuse. In this debate, I feel that I really
need to speak as a Bishop. It seems less obvious to do that when we are

I want to speak specifically from these Benches as a Bishop.</hs_para>

Government have the unenviable but vital and necessary task of trying
to regulate behaviour. Ever since JS Mill in the 19th century, we have
seen Governments trying to regulate behaviour to protect the
individual’s right to be who they want and to do what they want.
It is difficult to regulate people’s behaviour
without—and this is where the church has a role, so I speak as a
Bishop—looking at the ideas, imaginations and inner motives
within people that lead them to claim freedoms which, in the terms of
this debate, have such terrible consequences upon other people, such as
violence against women and abuse.</hs_para>

regulate behaviour, the Government need to be in dialogue with faith
communities and churches, which are particularly concerned with
people’s inner motives and moral values, and the framework
within which to try to live their lives. Our culture is dominated by
people’s right to feel something, express it and be who they
want to be. That has many great effects and outcomes but it also has
some terrible ones, as we are hearing in this debate. We have heard
from the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, about the terrible profusion of
pornography and the freedom to access, make and trade it—and to
involve people in it. Starting from the base of what people feel they
want has seen an inordinate explosion of promiscuity in our society in
the past 30 or 40 years, and enormous stress in personal lives. My
right reverend colleague the Bishop of Worcester referred to the
sexualisation of young people and a sexualised
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13021274000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130212-0002.htm#13021274000056">Most
violence and sexual abuse takes place in a private space. That is why
it is difficult for the Government on their own to legislate about
behaviour. Motives, ideas and imaginings can be explored in private
spaces, and that creates an atmosphere where people feel intimidated,
disoriented and unsure what private space should be about. There are no
public norms; you are suddenly in a very small space if you are subject
to this kind of abuse and violence. So, besides the Government working
with agencies, as the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, has said, and the
structures in proposals in the excellent report, I invite us to think
about how the Government can work with a problem that largely takes
place in private space, below the radar—people claiming their
freedom to be who they want to
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-12T20:00:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

way of entering into the private space where most of this abuse takes
place is through voluntary groups. The Safe and Sound project in Derby,
which I support, works with victims and parents in their domestic
settings, trying to help them understand what has happened to them and
what values those domestic settings need to be about and to defend. In
the past nine months in Derby, which is not a large city, Safe and

all these women and girls come from difficult backgrounds. I know that
the statistics point that way but this very week in the <I>Derby
Telegraph</I>, our local paper, there have been articles on three
consecutive days about cases of children from very established and
well-off homes being groomed and drawn out of those. The whole ethos of
being a teenager, really, is to be uncomfortable in the private space
that your family creates and to want to find your own private space;
that is what teenage life is about. People who enter that through the
internet and other ways, such as taking girls to parties or whatever,
begin to create an attractive alternative private space that
does not seem to have many moral guidelines. It is called grooming, and
young people are increasingly being groomed into sexual exploitation,
abuse and trafficking.</hs_para>

abusive and damaging. I hope that the Government will take very
seriously, first, the proper resourcing, as other noble Lords have
mentioned, of the formal services and agencies that work in
this area. Secondly, I hope that they will take seriously the
resourcing of the work by voluntary groups such as Safe and Sound,

steps can the Government take to be proactive in the world of

framework for those inner feelings and imaginations that are powerful

a bishop, I shall end by saying that something that is distinctive
about the Christian faith is that it does not begin from saying,
“I wish to decide

be”. It begins from saying, “Love God and your neighbour
as yourself”—that is, put others first and yourself
second. That is the kind of moral and spiritual discipline that forms
an adult person: not to love yourself first and do what that is about
but to love others first and put yourself second. That is what
Christianity is about. It is that kind of moral and spiritual
discipline that is the only chance of complementing the
Government’s task of providing models and guidelines of
behaviour with encouraging people to learn and carry around within
themselves some kind of respect and understanding of what human
life is about that is based on some kind of discipline, some
kind of self-denial and some kind of honouring of other people
rather than oneself. I ask the Minister to comment on how the
Government can complement faith groups and others to ensure that better
standards of behaviour emerge not just from regulation and agencies but
from moral conviction and the culture of self-discipline that make
adult people proper citizens and would be a major step in bringing this
terrible problem under control.</hs_para>

suffering violence is about to have the spotlight shone on it, starting

will consider joining the amazing events that are taking place all over
the country on Thursday, not least outside in Parliament Square during

Noble Lords can access the full menu of events if they put OBRUK into
their search engine, or pop into the opposition Whips’ Office

for women and those who love them, but they have a serious
message—that violence against women is endemic across the
world—and call upon Governments, parliaments and justice-makers
to make this violence end. The events aim to increase awareness, raise

ethnicities, and on one thing they were clear: to prevent violence
against woman and girls we need to do much more to ensure that both
young men and women are supported to develop positive and equal
relationships with their peers. This must, of course, be true. When one

point that, similar to the long-term investment that successive

work to prevent violence in order to save lives and reduce the

Office’s strategic narrative <I>Call to End Violence Against
Women and Girls</I> is grounded in the principles of equality and human

feel that this remains the weakest part of government actions. For
example, a joint inspectorate’s report into sex offending by
boys found that in almost half the cases it examined, there had been
previous harmful sexual behaviour that had been either minimised or
dismissed as a one-off. In the light of this finding on boys’
sexual offending, how are the Government ensuring that all schools

introducing this debate, the noble Lord, Lord Desai, rightly expressed
the universal nature of this issue. Indeed, the noble Baronesses, Lady

February, and which draws attention to the universal nature of this

reinforced by all speakers, and particularly by the noble Baroness,
Lady Gale. I also thank her for informing the House about how they are

support to the ICC Trust Fund for Victims since 2011 to £1.5

excellent work in supporting victims of sexual and gender-based
violence during conflict. The Trust Fund for Victims was established by
the states parties of the ICC in 2002 to benefit the victims of crimes
within the court’s jurisdiction. It is entirely funded by
voluntary donations. The focus of its work so far has been in northern
Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where its project work
provides assistance to the victims of the most serious crimes,
including torture and sexual violence. It is making an important
difference in helping the victims of serious crimes rebuild their
lives. The Government are calling upon G8 countries for similar support

replacing the existing HST Intercity 125 fleets on the Great Western
and East Coast Main Lines. The Intercity Express Programme (IEP)
contract includes an option to extend the order to include East Coast
phase 2, which, if taken up, would replace the electric Intercity 225
stock on East Coast. The department is looking in detail at this
follow-on order and an announcement will be made in the

Northover:</Member> The UK remains deeply concerned at the plight of
civilians caught up in fighting in Blue Nile. In line with the African
Union Peace and Security Council communiqué of 25 January, we
continue to press the Government of Sudan and Sudan People's Liberation
Movement-North to start negotiations toward a cessation of hostilities.
Until this happens the UK will do what it can to support those affected
by the conflict, including those who have been displaced. The UK has
contributed £4.8 million to the World Food Programme's efforts
to provide assistance to 146,000 people in the Government-held areas of
Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan, and has funded national partners with
£1.8 million to distribute humanitarian assistance in these
areas. We are also ready to make further 
<?notus-xml column=152?>funding available to meet the needs of people in rebel-held territory as
soon as access is possible. We have given our strong support for the
UN's response to the refugee situation in South Sudan. The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development,
Lynne Featherstone MP, saw conditions in the Jusuf Batil refugee camp
first hand during her visit in October 2012. Total UK support for the
humanitarian situation in South Sudan stands at £48 million for
2012, which includes funds for the refugee crisis channelled through
the Common Humanitarian Fund, World Food Programme and a £5
million contribution to the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees to help, in part, to prepare for additional refugees in
2013.</hs_para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2013-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_12_PT_1/Index/7F525FF9F351B3CCE615F3A10995C5107FB2F70C" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="19" cday="Tuesday" cmonth="February" cyear="2013" date="12" day="Tuesday" issue="112" maxparts="1" month="February" part="1" price="4@010c00" printing="daily" session="201213" volume="743" year="2013"><tocdate col="WS37">Tuesday 12 February
