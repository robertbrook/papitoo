to ensuring that equality is promoted in the media and creative
industries in line with duties set out in legislation, including the
Equality and Communications Acts. However, we do not have a role in
influencing the content or output of these sectors, which must remain
independent of government. Nevertheless, Ministers maintain a regular
dialogue on issues relating to diversity and equality. Most recently,
that has included increasing the media coverage of women in sport and
the representation of disabled
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T14:36:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022512000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Benjamin" PimsId="5763" UID="13022512000297" xid="2043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000297">Baroness
Benjamin:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend. As Danny
Boyle demonstrated in the Olympic opening ceremony, diversity
throughout the creative industries is incredibly influential in how
modern Britain is portrayed and represented. Unfortunately, at present
there is no pan-industry system of monitoring diversity to hold
television or other creative sectors accountable and ensure that they
attract, retain and increase talent from a range of different
backgrounds. What measures are in place to ensure that the creative
industries are employing and fulfilling their diversity
responsibilities, and does my noble friend agree that standardised
monitoring would provide valuable data? Will she work with PACT, UK
Music and others in identifying how such measuring systems could be
introduced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T14:37:50"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022512000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Stowell of Beeston" PimsId="5900" UID="13022512000298" xid="2111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000298">Baroness
Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend raises an
important point. We all want to see ourselves reflected in the media
and for that reflection to be accurate in its portrayal. The Government
certainly welcome the work by PACT, the Creative Diversity Network and
broadcasters to devise a common system for monitoring diversity
onscreen and offscreen. We understand that discussions are progressing
well between these groups to consider how to standardise a system of
diversity monitoring across the industry, and that the first
pan-industry measurements are expected to be collected by the end of
this year. However, we believe that it is absolutely right that the
industry lead this initiative itself. While we look forward to hearing
about this system and its results, we have no plans at present to
mandate it because we believe most fundamentally in the independence of
the
media<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T14:38:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

4’s diversity executive. Further to the earlier Question, I
wondered if the Minister was aware of the lack of social diversity in
terms of social mobility and social background in the media. Will she
support broadcasters that are going out beyond non-traditional
backgrounds, and particularly beyond non-media hubs, to find young
people from those backgrounds who are not so much involved in the media

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> I share the point that the noble
Baroness has raised. I am aware that the BBC, which is the main public
service broadcaster, has the largest responsibility to ensure that it
is reaching out to new people in terms of its workforce. There are a
couple of schemes that the noble Baroness may or may not be aware of. A
BBC apprenticeship scheme has recruited over 50 apprentices in the past
18 to 20 months, 30% of whom were from the black and
minority ethnic communities. The BBC’s work experience scheme
has ensured since January 2011 that 60% are from BME backgrounds, and
of those 21% have secured paid work at the BBC. The latter scheme has
been recommended for an award for extending diversity in the
workplace.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022512000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000007"><Member ContinuationText="The Earl of Clancarty" PimsId="2608" UID="13022512000301" xid="2038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000301"><B>The

the noble Baroness, Lady King, I wonder if the Minister is aware that
not only the young but also the old need to be cared for. Is she aware
that the media, and particularly the BBC, are very short of women over
50 at the moment? Does she not think that it is time that that was

the first question, it is important for all of us to see ourselves
reflected in the media, whether that means people who come from the
area that we come from or people who are of a similar age. The most
important point is that the broadcasters themselves should acknowledge
the issue and take action. I was certainly heartened when the last
director-general of the BBC was willing to acknowledge that there was a
problem and took steps to improve the
situation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022512000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" PimsId="615" UID="13022512000305" xid="1547" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000305">Baroness

welcome the optimistic and accurate position which the noble Earl has

these dues. For shorter crossings and ferries, they are going up by
43%. People have ways of avoiding these costs, such as by putting into
other ports if costs continue to escalate. I therefore hope that, in
the time before the full Irish payments come in, increases in costs are
kept to an absolute minimum.</hs_para>

Minister agree that the best way to bring prices down is to ensure that
we have a genuinely competitive market in energy? Will she comment on
whether the Energy Bill that will come to this House later in the year

the marketplace to be able to drive prices down for the consumer. But

very encouraging reply. I suspect that every single Member of your
Lordships’ House has been touched by a midwife. They are a
remarkable and very committed profession. Is my noble friend aware that
although there is what the Royal College of Midwives describes as a
tipping point in the increase in the number of midwives attending women
in labour, the real crisis is in postnatal care, where new mothers
require advice, support and help in cherishing and feeding their
newborn baby? Is he also aware that this requires continuity of a
midwife? He has just told us that continuity is being carried through,
but a recent survey shows that 40% of new mothers always see a
different midwife. How does he propose that we put this situation

care from a midwife during labour, birth and immediately after birth,
and to continue to have the support of their midwife after the birth.
This is especially important for those women who are susceptible to, or
have, depression during pregnancy or postnatal depression. My noble
friend is absolutely 
<?notus-xml column=847?>right about continuity. This depends on each woman having an
individualised postnatal plan of care, taking into account her
circumstances. To assist the NHS, the department has asked the National

important issues. My department provides approximately £1
million a year for health assessments of asylum seekers in UKBA initial
accommodation in England. The aim of the health assessment is to
identify and address immediate healthcare needs, including pregnancy,
and to recognise ongoing and non-urgent care needs for attention in the
dispersal areas. The use of experienced health teams and interpreting
services to record medical history also avoids more expensive
arrangements at GP-registration stage later on. My officials met
Maternity Action on 19 February to discuss the report’s
recommendations and were assured that the maternity care provided by
NHS midwives was appropriate and in accordance with NICE guidelines.

an advantage on newspapers as well as on the public. Nevertheless, the
false impression remains, and it would be a vast pity if the
beneficial intent of the clause was to be harmed in this way and in so
doing give ammunition to those who say

second reason I tabled the amendment is that the whole idea of some
kind of pre-publication check is anathema to most journalists. I
emphasise that I am talking about working journalists. Remember that
the NUJ, as opposed to the proprietors, is in favour of Leveson; it is
not against it. It is against the kind of provision that I am seeking
to amend for the good reason that in any story of any controversy there
will always be people out there who want to stop the story, or at least
take the guts out of it.

very early on as a young journalist. I had been advised to show a
series of articles that I had written to the man who had given me
access to the story. When I met him, he was furious about what I had
written. Very obviously, so that I could see it clearly, a letter of
protest to my editor was set out on his desk. Happily, the editor took
no notice, but I have never shown an article in advance to any body or

had the support of a wide range of individuals, and, in varying

Meacher:</Member></B> My Lords, I support Amendment 1, which
seeks to ensure that the Government have flexibility to increase
benefits in 2014-15 and 2015-16 taking account of the level of
inflation at the time. The amendment does not seek to impose a
particular percentage increase in benefits in any year. It simply seeks
to avoid the straitjacket imposed by the Bill as it
stands<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T15:24:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022512000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000078">Amendment
1 covers all the benefits and claimant groups referred to in Schedule
1. It would therefore leave open the possibility of a Government
deciding to protect a particular group, perhaps disabled people or
children. This amendment has become particularly pertinent in the light
of the downgrading of the British economy by the ratings agency
Moody’s at the end of last week, along with the anticipation of
yet more quantitative easing and the expectation that in these
circumstances we will have more inflation year by year. That inflation
comes on top of a level of inflation which is already above 1%, which
is vital to this set of amendments and, indeed, to the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T15:25:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

considered in context. As noble Lords know very well, last
year’s Welfare Reform Act has already capped benefits and
imposed the bedroom tax so that an increasing percentage of
everyone’s rent will be paid out of their personal allowance,
leaving them with the most pathetically small amount of money to cover
food, heating, clothing and other necessities. Also, the Government
have already changed the basis of annual welfare benefit increases from
the RPI to the CPI. This is absolutely crucial because that measure
alone, before this Bill, is expected to save £5.8
billion a year. Such savings can be achieved only through imposing the
most incredible hardship on many of the most vulnerable people in this
country. The proposed limiting of upratings to an increase of 1% will
be an increase in the consumer prices index, not the retail prices
index, so it is not even going to cover an inflation rate of 1%. That
is how bad it is. It is the compounding of the previous Welfare Reform
Act with this Bill that is so deeply shocking to many of
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T15:26:48"></hs_TimeCode>.

cumulative impact of all these changes and the proposed 1% uprating
limit is not yet fully understood even by the experts in the field, let
alone by its victims. But it is not surprising that there is deep
concern in those organisations which have to work with vulnerable
people, including the CAB service. It is worried stiff 
<?notus-xml column=853?>about its clients and the capacity of the bureaux to cope with what is
going to be an unimaginable flood of people in desperate circumstances.
The Government are breaking the long-standing link between annual
incremental increases in benefits and prices. Once lost, it will be
very difficult to restore it. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine that
happening for decades. That is how serious this is. It is not just one
little part of a Bill; it is actually historic because it changes the
whole way we look at increases in welfare benefits.</hs_para>

homelessness on local authorities? Also, I refer to the overall impact

Government’s rationale for this uprating Bill—that
welfare benefit increases must take account of the public sector pay
freeze and the low level of pay increases across the economy in recent
years. Citizens Advice is right to argue that a 1% increase
means something very different to somebody on an average wage from what
it means to somebody on welfare benefits. A 20% increase in out-of-work
benefits in the period 2007-12 resulted in an average annual increase
in income of only £2.37 per week. A lower percentage increase,
of 15%, in public sector pay during the same period provided an average
increase in income for public sector workers more than five times
greater. It was a lower percentage but a much greater increase in
actual terms.</hs_para>

matters for families is how many pounds’ increase they have, not
some airy-fairy percentage; they want the pounds. Public sector workers
had on average an increase of £12.40, compared with the benefits

those on benefits to leap ahead of those on low public sector wages in
absolute terms, but there is no danger of that happening. Does the
Minister
agree?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022512000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000084">My
final point takes us back to the debates we had about direct payments
of rent to landlords and the payment of benefits weekly rather than
monthly. You could say that that is irrelevant to this Bill; I do not
think that it is. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Freud, for
explaining to me that he has done a lot of work since the previous Act
and those earlier debates, and that built into the system now are
exceptions to 
<?notus-xml column=854?>try to protect particularly vulnerable people; in other words, by
enabling some peculiarly vulnerable people to be paid more regularly
and to have their rent paid direct to landlords. I am referring to the

will spell out the exceptions for the benefit of this House. It would
be helpful to know how broad or narrow these exceptions are going to
be. Undoubtedly, exceptions to the requirement for monthly payments and
ending the direct payment of rent to landlords will help but, whatever
amendments may be agreed to this Bill, would it not be wise to put on
hold altogether, for a period of perhaps three years, the changes to
the frequency of welfare payments and the direct payments to landlords?
Such concessions would be relatively cost-free but would make a very
big difference to people’s capacity to cope as they find their
tiny incomes declining in real terms month by month.</hs_para>

we have just heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, but there are
a couple of points I would like to
make.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022512000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000088">The
first is the economic argument. I said at Second Reading that it did
not really make any sense, at a time when the economy was flat-lining,
to withdraw additional purchasing power from a section of the community
that was most likely to spend it: those on welfare benefits. With every
day that goes by and the economic news piles up about the dire
condition of the British economy, the stronger this argument gets. The
Minister did not respond adequately to that argument at Second Reading.
I would be grateful if the Government gave further serious
consideration to the force of that argument, which is genuine and
considerable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T15:34:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022512000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000089">The
Bill will cause real hardship for disabled people, carers and children.
Disabled people are said to be protected but, as we showed at Second
Reading, the protection accorded disabled people is partial. There is
some protection for those in the support group receiving employment and
support allowance, and disability living allowance is exempted from the
1% cap, but those receiving employment and support allowance
in the work-related activity group and other disabled people receiving
other benefits do not receive protection from the 1% cap. It cannot
therefore be said that disabled people are fully protected, nor are
carers.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=855?><hs_para UID="13022512000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000090">Above<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T15:34:58"></hs_TimeCode>
all, children are not protected. Disabled children in this country are
already disproportionately likely to live in poverty. Approximately 40%
of all disabled children—about 320,000—live in poverty,
compared with a poverty rate of 30% across all children. Nearly a third
live in severe poverty—where a family’s income is less
than 40% of the national average. Under universal credit, which will
begin to come into effect later this year, parents of disabled children
can receive a benefit called the disabled child addition. This will
replace the current disabled child tax credit, but, under universal
credit, the support available for disabled children who do not receive
the high rate of DLA care component will be cut by half, from
£57 a week under the disabled child tax credit to £28.52.
The Bill will mean that the value of this benefit will increase at a
significantly slower rate, by just 1% as opposed to in line with the
CPI, which is currently running at 2.7%. As a result of the Bill,
parents of disabled children receiving the lower disabled child
addition of universal credit will lose £25.21 a year, or
£75.63 over the three years during which the 1% cap is intended
to operate. I would be grateful if the Minister could reflect further
on the hardship that will be caused to all these groups and had second
thoughts about the universal application of the 1%
cap<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T15:37:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T15:37:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_25_PT_1/1260B7514BCDBFD8F2F96FC104575139BCC01636" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 February 2013">Monday,

We fully intend these amendments to undermine and negate the purpose of

Bill is unnecessary because if this Government misguidedly wish to
plough on with this capping on uprating, they could simply use the
annual uprating process. The Bill provides no certainty for taxpayers
because there is no certainty on claimant numbers, except perhaps the
prospect of them increasing, given the Government’s economic
failure. As for the markets, it is frankly untenable to suggest that by
locking those amounts, which account for less than 0.1% of government
spending, into legislation they will be assured and comforted. It does
not seem to have cut any ice with the rating agencies. The certainty of
a real terms cut 
<?notus-xml column=856?>in support cannot be welcomed by claimants, especially when

all know why the Bill was brought forward. We made our position clear
at Second Reading and I do not propose to revisit the issue in
Committee. The Bill is misdirected on several counts. It does nothing
for jobs. Indeed, by withdrawing real resources from low-income
families, which of necessity have the highest marginal consumption
rates, it is damaging demand. It ignores the IMF warning that the
fiscal stabilisers should be allowed to operate.
Its<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T15:41:33"></hs_TimeCode>
justification is supposed to be that there needs to be some correction
for the fact that benefits have been uprated at a faster rate than
earnings over the past five years—essentially, that those out of
work have done better than those in work. It is perverse, therefore,
that two-thirds of those hurt by the Bill are in work, taxing the very
strivers whom the Government claim to be supporting. Indeed,
specifically included in the cuts is in-work support, such as working
tax credit, SSP, SMP and paternity pay, as well as in and out of work
benefits such as housing benefit, the very support that enables
individuals to sustain employment and manage work and family
responsibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T15:41:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022512000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000096">It
is not only those in work who are having their living standards cut.
The Government are failing to honour their pledge to protect the most
severely disabled. If they still hold to their obligations under the
Child Poverty Act, they are drifting further away by pushing a further
200,000 children into poverty. Worst of all, at a time when the Bill
will reduce the living standards of the very poorest, they are
rewarding those with the highest incomes, including 8,000 millionaires,
with a generous tax cut. The contrast could not be greater: a
£2,000 a week tax cut for some, 71p a week if you claim

leaving the inflation risk with claimants, the Bill creates greater
risk for the poor and uncertainty about their real incomes. The 2012
Autumn Statement cites energy and fuel prices as remaining a potential
source of risk over the coming years. It estimates that inflation will
be higher in 2013 and 2014 than originally announced due to rises in
domestic energy prices and food commodity prices—the very costs
that hit the poorest hardest. We see today the reaction of the currency
markets to our credit rating downgrade: a weakened sterling, which will

normal uprating process should operate, with annual Statements laid
before and debated by Parliament. We will hear the cries from the
Minister asking what we would do. Clearly, one matter that should be
addressed to get the social security budget down is getting more people
into work. Despite claims to the contrary, the Government are failing
on jobs. Long-term unemployment and long-term youth unemployment are up
on the year. The Work Programme is little short of a disaster and
continues to fail the hardest to help. Some 1.4 million
part-time workers would like to be working full time. This is why we
have proposed a new initiative to get people into work and a compulsory
job guarantee for the long-term unemployed, and we have costed a scheme
that over the course of a year would help more than a quarter of a
million people into work, paid for by restricting on a tapered basis

We heard the Minister at Second Reading suggest that the saving that
this would produce would be “illusory” because the rich
would order their affairs to make sure that the will of the Government
was defeated. Indeed, the HMRC analysis suggests that some would do
this by forestalling and deferring, whereby income fell into a lower
tax period, converting income into more favourably taxed capital. Have
we not already had reports about income being deferred into next year?
However, the Government do not have to acquiesce in this and accept the

some points made by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie. I have the highest
respect for the noble Lord, Lord Low, and nothing would give me greater
pleasure than to vote for the amendment. There is a problem, however,
in that we cannot afford to vote for the amendment. The noble Baroness
who has just spoken talked about cuts. We are not talking about cuts
but about not having increases. It is true that there might be cuts
because of inflation, but if we go down the road proposed by the noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie, inflation will be even higher and the
cuts will be more severe. It was Lord Callaghan who pointed out, as a
Labour Prime Minister in the 1970s—sometimes I feel that we have
gone back to the 1970s; even the Daleks made an appearance in
Westminster last week—that inflation is the father and mother of
unemployment.</hs_para>

extraordinary for the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, to make so much of the
rating agency’s downrating of the UK from AAA status. I do not
know whether he has read what the rating agency had to say about why
that downrating was being made. It was because the agency believed that
the Government would not be able to meet the targets that they had set,
and which the Opposition are constantly urging us to abandon. The noble
Lord talked about the impact of the sliding pound and of inflation,
which is a consequence of not meeting these targets. On the idea that
finding money out of thin air will not hurt the poorest hardest in the
long term, because of the inflation that would be created and the
impact it would have on the pound, the hard reality is that we simply
cannot afford to do what the noble Lord, Lord Low, would ask of
us.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022512000108" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000108">It is the
cheapest of cheap politics to keep going on about millionaires being

secondly, that if they spend it by investing or buying goods it will
not generate wealth and prosperity in the economy, while somehow a
state bureaucracy involved in spending money and taking it by force
through an Administration will get better value and growth. That is a
delusion which we happily abandoned in the 1970s when we abandoned
rates of income tax at 98% and discovered that the consequence of
cutting taxes to 40% was that the rich ended up paying a higher
proportion of tax than in the past. Already we are seeing that the
proportion of tax paid by the very rich 
<?notus-xml column=859?>is falling and the proportion paid by the poorest is rising. That is not
as a consequence of the recent measures made by my right honourable

question about whether I accept that all this difficulty was caused by
the banking crisis, no, I do not. I think that the banking crisis was
caused by the monetary policy being pursued by the previous Government
by targeting inflation. The noble Baroness seems surprised by this, but
the fundamental causes of the financial crisis were the huge financial
surpluses that were being built up—I hesitate to stray too far
from the amendment—in China and the Middle East, which kept
interest rates low, and an inflation-targeting policy being pursued by
the Bank of England that meant that they were very low interest rates.
As a result, the banks tried to go for yield. The banks were certainly
at fault in devising packages that they thought would reduce risk and
give a higher return, and it is certainly true that regulators such as
the FSA should have been on to this.</hs_para>

the fundamental point is that while Labour were in charge they did
nothing about that; indeed, they revelled in it. We were told that they
had abolished boom and bust, and that they had come up with a new
paradigm. That is why that Labour Government, even at the height of the
boom, with huge revenues coming in and house prices and asset prices
going through the roof, did nothing except collect the tax. Instead of
putting the tax away for a rainy day, what did they do? They spent it
on welfare that they could not afford, and when the boom collapsed
there was a sudden gap in the market that my right honourable friend is
now having to deal with. So let us not rewrite history here; let the
Labour Party take responsibility for what it did in
government.</hs_para>

that our living standards will fall unless we are able to create
growth, and you do not create growth with the state taking more and
more from the productive part of the private sector. According to
the OECD, close to 50% of our GDP is being spent by the

to us, this is the least effective way of targeting resources on people
in poverty. A much more effective way of helping them is by
inflation-proofing their benefits. There is a choice. The choice was
made to increase tax allowances by more than inflation, which is of no
help to people too poor to pay tax, including people in work too poor

by cutting the tax burden and encouraging people to save to invest and
to work harder you create the wealth that is needed to create the

think that it is a fixed cake and that whatever happens it is

debate about the economics of this, but are people in low-paid work who

made by the noble Lord, Lord Low, and the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher.
This is not about the state taking money out of the productive economy
and somehow filing it away somewhere; this is about the state
redistributing money to people who are more likely to spend it and to
spend it in local communities, thereby helping to boost economic growth
at the time we need it. I do not believe there is an economic case. I

closely at Second Reading, and I thought that the position then argued
by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, was that the Opposition
opposed the 2013-14 and 2014-15 limits but had not yet reached a
position on 2015-16. Presumably by supporting this amendment, they are
now making the position that 
<?notus-xml column=862?>they do not agree and would therefore reverse the policy as it affects

we made our position clear in respect of 2013-14, which is not in the

clear that we will make no tax or spending commitments in respect of
the next Parliament, which would include the latter part of 2015-16. As
for 2014-15, we think that removing this cap would enable the normal
process to take place so that there can be an assessment in the normal
course about what is happening to inflation and the state of the

of course like it to be very much better, but contrary to some other
countries that are wrestling with the same problems our unemployment
rate continues to fall. We now have the highest level of private sector

this Bill or the regulations that we were debating before our half-term

stopping—this is important in cost terms—hopeless claims

worked. Putting it at its highest, it has allowed access to justice for

been faced with an impossibly large number of cases, many of which
should never have been brought in the first place. It has cost a

follow my noble friend, it is worth reminding the House of what we
discussed at Second Reading about the number of changes that will
affect people who are receiving benefits, even though many of them are
in work. Those changes will happen to them all at once. We will see a
new structure of benefits, brought together in universal
credit—that is a structure that I welcome—but it will be
accompanied, as in this Bill, and in reducing benefit inflation to CPI,
by serious cuts, which many benefit claimants will think is simply an
error by the department. They will go frantic with concern in trying to
rectify them. That is the second
change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022512000138" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000138">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T16:15:57"></hs_TimeCode>
third change that we are going to see is to the new patterns of
payment. For example, tenants of social housing who currently have
their housing benefit paid directly to the landlord will now have it
paid to themselves, looped through a bank account. Very often, given
other pressures of finance, debts and so on, they may be in real
difficulties in making that money over to the landlord at the end of
the month. So there is a new pattern of payment, with which tenants
must become
familiar<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T16:16:19"></hs_TimeCode>. They
will also have monthly payment of benefit, when many of them have been
used to weekly or fortnightly payments, and the payment will go to a
single earner or person in the household and not split. Again, that is
a major
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T16:16:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

changes—the new structure, the cuts, the new method of payment
direct to tenants, and the monthly payments—will be handled by
an IT system, when we know that 20% to 30% of the tenants wishing to
claim benefit have no familiarity with IT at all. So what will they do?
What they have always done is to seek legal advice from Citizens
Advice, which in the past has been funded very substantially by the
Lord Chancellor’s Department. CABs have received some 40% of
their funding from the Lord Chancellor’s Department, but that
has been cut, and they are now 40% short. As a result, those same
people facing this sequence of changes, some of which I support, like
universal credit, and some of which I deplore, will make their bids for
benefit on the basis of an IT system, with which they are not familiar,
instead of a paper trail. Where do they go? They cannot go to the
traditional advice centres because the legal aid money that sustained
them has been withdrawn in the worst, most foolish and most indecent
economy of which I can conceive. I declare my interest as a chair of a
housing association. I am having to appoint paid professionals to do
the welfare advice, to be paid for out of increased tenants’
rents, which hitherto was provided by the skilled but unpaid volunteers
of the CABs, which represented a real commitment to the big society to
which we all give lip service and which, I fear, is too seldom observed

noble friend is absolutely right that this is a foolish way to proceed
and I regret very much that we were not allowed to debate this

for eight years, I was responsible for tribunals before they went over,
via Leggatt, to a generalised tribunal system. I sat in on those
tribunals for DLA and other benefits. My noble friend is exactly
right—I could see within five minutes whether the person coming
before the tribunal had or had not received prior legal advice. If they
had not, the appeal or discussion at tribunal took five times as long,
with the chairman, as they were then called—now
judge—trying to tease out the issues and establish whether it
was a bona fide case, whether they could take it further and even
whether the person was claiming against the right benefit. In some
cases, they were complaining about an incapacity benefit when it should
have been DLA, and I felt like jumping up and saying,
“You’ve got the wrong benefit here—let’s
start

inaccessibility and greater difficulty for everyone to understand. That

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, at the risk of repeating arguments made
in earlier debates, I remind the Committee of the context of the Bill.
This country is still recovering from the most damaging financial
crisis for generations. When this Government came to power, the state
was borrowing £1 in every £4 that it spent. 
<?notus-xml column=866?>Even before the recession, the UK had the highest structural deficit in
the G7 and between 1997 and 2010 welfare spending increased by some 60%
in real terms. Welfare spending now accounts for more than a quarter of
government spending: that is, more than £200 billion.
The £1.9 billion of savings enabled by this Bill in 2015-16 is a
necessary part of helping to reduce public spending, tackle the deficit
and secure the economic
recovery<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T16:20:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022512000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000143">Amendments
1 and 9, spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, would remove the
1% uprating figure in the Bill in Clause 1 and Clause 2. The effect of
these amendments would be to give the Government discretion over
benefit levels on an annual basis in much the same way as under
existing legislation. As I have already explained, we believe it is
vital that we set out credible plans for the longer term. The Bill is
needed to enable us to set out our uprating policy over several years
so that we can be sure we will deliver those £1.9
billion worth of
savings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T16:21:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022512000144" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000144">My
speaking notes at this point said that this amendment would completely
undermine that core purpose of the Bill. I was relieved, but not
surprised, that the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, used that very word to
define the effect of these amendments. He said that the amendments
would undermine and, indeed, negate the core purpose of the Bill. They
would, and so a vote for these amendments would be equivalent to a vote
against the Bill at Second
Reading<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T16:21:49"></hs_TimeCode>. I note
that the amendments, while removing the 1% figure, do not suggest an
alternative uprating metric. If we assume that the noble Lord’s
intention is that we operate in line with the CPI, this would obviously
not deliver the savings we are talking about. I remind the Committee
that the £1.9 billion worth of savings that this Bill will
generate in 2015-16 are equivalent to the salaries of about 45,000
nurses and about 40,000 teachers, so these are not negligible amounts,
as some noble Lords have suggested, and the savings would have to be

I say, the amendments undermine the purpose of the Bill and, frankly,
demonstrate a fundamental difference of opinion between the two sides
of the House on how we deal with the current economic situation. The
Government believe that the main priority is to get spending under
control, reduce the deficit and restore growth. The Bill helps us to
achieve that. At the same time, we are implementing policies that make
a real difference to people’s lives—people of the most
modest means. Let me name just a few of them: universal credit; the
pupil premium; reform of early years education; tackling problem debt;
and lifting people out of paying income tax through raising the
personal allowance. We believe that these policies are vital if we are
to have a real and sustainable impact on poverty over the medium to

welfare payments, lifting people just above the poverty

<?notus-xml column=867?>had a broader impact assessment that covered the impact on mental
health, crime and, I think she said, social unrest. As regards the
impact on crime, it seems to me that the noble Baroness is being
completely unrealistic to believe that such an impact can be measured
with any degree of precision. At the start of the downturn, most
commentators believed that crime rates would rise substantially. If one
had taken the average view of people in the know, that is what one
would have put in an impact assessment. The truth is that crime rates
have not risen substantially. They have fallen. I obviously welcome
that. I make that point only to make the more general point that, while
one can make an impact assessment that covers some things with a
reasonable degree of precision, on other things—on crime, for
example—it is impossible to do what the noble Baroness
wants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T16:25:22"></hs_TimeCode>. That is

we have had a long-term decline in crime. However, I am not sure that
that makes it impossible to look at the increase in the amount of crime
among benefit recipients; that is something precise worth looking at.
Moreover, I do not think that that negates the possibility of looking
at the amount of mental breakdown among benefit recipients. Again, that
is one of my main concerns, having been involved in mental health
services for 25 years. I fear that there will be quite a dramatic
increase in mental breakdown and an incredible impact on a very tight

of the arguments made about millionaires and the huge tax boost that
they allegedly got. He did not mention that the Budget changes
announced last year affecting millionaires and those on very
substantial means would generate 
<?notus-xml column=869?>five times as much income as the 45p tax rate. It is simply untrue to
claim that the Budget measures last year mean that millionaires as a
group are paying, and will be paying, less tax this year and next than
they have in the past. Equally, it is simplistic and false to argue
that there is a sort of mechanical problem with HMRC, or an inability
of HMRC to collect money from millionaires. Millionaires are extremely
clever at avoiding tax. All the evidence from the Office for Budget
Responsibility and the work that it did demonstrates why the 50p tax
rate simply would not generate anything like the amount of money that
was originally envisaged. Indeed, it said that it was quite possible

minority ethnic communities such that small firms in those communities
have been shedding jobs disproportionately. Perhaps they have, but I
have not seen any evidence. One of the more welcome developments of the
past year, which has surprised a lot of commentators, is that hundreds
of thousands more people are in work, and this increase in employment
has taken place disproportionately in regions other 
<?notus-xml column=870?>than London and the south-east. There has been a slight rebalancing of
employment prospects, and regions such as Yorkshire and the Humber,
which I know, have done remarkably well in difficult economic times. I
completely support the noble Baroness’s view about the moral
economy of kin, but I question whether what has happened in recent

issues of tax, the Minister, in response to the Second Reading debate,

issue, would involve switching income from one year to another. It is
quite possible that, as we speak and draw to the end of the current tax
year and move towards, possibly, a 45% tax year, a great deal of income
will shift from this year into next year. Will the Minister say whether
he thinks this is okay and acquiesces with it, or whether it is a

you simply sit back, clever and well resourced people

Forsyth of Drumlean:</Member></B> I am most grateful to the noble Lord.
I am a bit puzzled because he said in answer to my noble friend Lord
Bates that we were discussing the policies of this Government, not the
last one. He is a little selective. However, given what he has
described—an economy which is not growing at all—how on
earth does he expect to fund the increase in benefits that he says he
is in favour of? That is the crux of the matter. It is not
about where we would like to be or how the world might be different,
the fact is that the economy is not growing. If the economy is not
growing, how is it possible to expand the welfare
budget<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T16:46:12"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> I was talking about the last Labour
Government in response to points that the noble Lord himself made
earlier on. On growth, I would outline that there is one particular
proposal that we in the Labour Party have been working on—the
long-term jobs guarantee, and we have explained how it could be funded
by, yes, restricting tax relief for the wealthiest in terms of pension
contributions. It would get people into work, get them spending, and
take them off benefits and welfare support. That is the way to do it.
Perhaps I can turn this back to the noble Lord. The approach the
Government have undertaken has simply failed to deliver growth; it is
not happening. Everyone knows that and it does not need me to expound
on it. The Government have failed to
deliver<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T16:47:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that we are challenging this burden of a real-terms cut. The noble Lord
said that it is not a cut, but of course it is a cut in real terms
because it is a cut in people’s living standards. It is also a
cut that we do not know the magnitude of over the life of this Bill,
which is why we object to it so strongly. We do not know what the rate
of inflation is going to be in two years’ time. We can speculate
on the impact of the downgrading of our credit rating, but getting
growth in the economy and thus providing more employment is certainly
more likely to impact in a positive way. That is what we would argue
for and plan for. It is making the people at the bottom end of the
income scale pay for the failure of this Government that we object to.
This Bill is the wrong way to deal with benefits uprating. There is a
tried and tested way that has operated for many years which is open to
the Government rather than locking it down and forcing people into a

for recovery and for the confidence of the markets which allows us to
borrow to finance this extremely high deficit. My noble friend is right
that an array of other policy weapons is available to prosecute a

nervousness of the markets. My interpretation of the markets is that
there is very little volatility at the moment; the markets have taken
this situation entirely in their stride. The market variable that has
shifted the most is the exchange rate, where sterling has moved back to
a range where it was trading before the eurozone crisis. The risk that
has gone out of the eurozone sector has enabled the euro to strengthen;
and the risk that was inherent in the US so-called
“cliff” situation did not materialise, which has allowed
the dollar to strengthen relative to sterling. I do not think that the
markets are doing anything other than continuing to reward this
Government’s focus on fiscal consolidation, which is why we are
borrowing at these incredibly cheap
rates.</hs_para>

recall that in the main phase of ESA an individual will receive a
personal allowance and an additional support component. Those are

allowance but a CPI increase of 2.2% for the additional component. We
will have the opportunity to debate the regulations shortly, although,
of course, they cannot be amended. Under income-related ESA, other
premiums may be applicable, such as the enhanced disability, severe
disability and carer’s premiums. Of course, the final amount of
any payment depends also on the income, if any, of the
claimant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:05:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

essential if the Government are to fulfil their pledge to protect
disabled people from the 1% uprating cap. Only disabled people are in
the work-related activity group. The assessment process ensures that
non-disabled people do not qualify. A recent DWP study tracking those
receiving ESA over 18 months revealed that three-quarters of recipients
were undergoing regular treatment for a health condition, including a
stay in hospital for some. ESA for those in the work-related activity
group is paid in two parts—the main component, which is
equivalent to jobseeker’s allowance and worth about two-thirds
of the total benefit, and the work-related activity group component,
which is worth the other
third<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:08:25"></hs_TimeCode>. Many
disabled people are being placed in the work-related activity group.
Capping increases in their benefit at 1% will mean that households
receiving ESA in the work-related activity group will be £87.65
a year worse off. The Government’s proposals to exempt from the
1% cap the support group component for those placed in the support
group mean that less than a third of ESA payments for less than half of
disabled people receiving ESA will be protected. That is what the
amendment of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, would achieve, but it would

figures show that there are 360,000 disabled people in the work-related
activity group who also need protection. This amendment would achieve
that. One third of disabled people in the UK were found to be living in
poverty before the global economic crisis. Disabled people routinely
experience higher living costs associated with their disability on
things such as equipment, personal assistants and special diets.
Disabled people experience the same increases in general living costs
as everyone else: food inflation is running at 4.5% and travel
inflation at 7%. Unfortunately, disabled people were not able to catch
up financially during better economic times. We should not allow them
to slip further behind as a result of this Bill; rather, we should
ensure that the Government’s objective of protecting disabled
people is fully

2, moved by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, to which I added my name,
and Amendment 3, spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Low. The Minister,
the noble Lord, Lord Freud, consistently argued during the passage of
the Welfare Reform Bill that there were two fundamental principles to
the Government’s welfare reform provisions. 
<?notus-xml column=879?>One was to make sure that people in work had an incentive to remain in
work and that those out of work had an incentive to move into work. The
second principle was that the money available, however much there was
available, should be focused as far as possible on those in greatest
need. Throughout the debates on the previous Bill, I found myself very
much in agreement with those two principles. It seemed to me that if
money is short, at least one should abide by those two principles. That
seemed very reasonable.</hs_para>

confused that in this Bill those two principles appear to be breached.
It does not seem that you are focusing on those in greatest need if
there is an impact that reduces in real terms the living standards of
people who are severely disabled. You are certainly not increasing the
incentive to work if you reduce the benefit of people who have not a
chance in hell of returning to work. We know that a lot of people who
in any normal view of things would not really be able to work have been
put into benefit categories such as jobseeker’s allowance, where
they are expected to work, although they would regard this as being
beyond their wildest dreams, much as they might like to. That is not
the point that I wanted to make; I simply want to ask the Minister how
she squares the provisions of this Bill with the principles so
eloquently and consistently laid out by the noble Lord, Lord

had some rough edges, and the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, is directed at one of those rough edges. Can my noble friend
the Minister tell the House whether a deliberate step was taken to
exclude the personal allowance part of the support group to meet the
budgetary requirements? Was this matter overlooked in the discussion
that may have taken place on the principle espoused both in this House
by the noble Lord, Lord Freud, and by the Secretary of State in the
other place that those who are unable to do something to help
themselves should not be penalised in this way? That is why the example

Lister of Burtersett:</Member></B> My Lords, I support both these
amendments. I have a question concerning Amendment 2. Like the noble
Baroness, Lady Meacher,  
<?notus-xml column=880?>I am slightly confused; I had understood that the rationale for not
including, say, pensioners in the Bill was that that group could not be
expected to make up the difference through paid work. Therefore, and in
a sense this follows on from the noble Lord’s question, why are
disabled people in the support group affected, albeit not as much as
some other groups? According to the Disability Benefits Consortium, a
person in the support group will be £138 per year worse off by
2015. That is a considerable sum for someone living on benefits, and of
course the personal allowance element is larger than the element that
is protected. Why does that principle of excluding groups that the
Government expect to go into the labour market to somehow protect
themselves not extend to people in the support group who, by virtue of
being in that group, are not expected to look for paid

the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, referring to the principles outlined
by my noble friend Lord Freud during the passage of the Welfare Reform
Act, I am clear that those principles—that we will target
welfare spending to those most in need and ensure that we do not do
anything to disincentivise people from pursuing work—remain

there will still be some effects among disabled people through the Bill
because we are including the personal allowance for both types of ESA
as well as the additional element for those in the work-related

are paid specifically to cover the additional costs associated with
disability are not included in the Bill. For example, the disability
living allowance and the attendance allowance are protected, as are the
disability premia in benefits such as income support, ESA, JSA and
housing benefit, and we have excluded the disability elements of tax
credits from the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022512000222" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000222">In many
cases, the basic rate of ESA is just one element of the total package
of benefits received. Many people on ESA are also in receipt of other
benefits, such as DLA, to which I have just referred, and housing
benefit. It is worth noting that around 65% of people in the support
group also claim DLA. The point I am trying to make here is that ESA is
not the only benefit that most people are relying on. People in the
support group receive a component worth £34.80 a week, as has
already been said, and they are also automatically entitled to the
enhanced disability premium of £14.80 a week if eligible for 
<?notus-xml column=881?>income-related ESA. We should not forget that some people will be
eligible for the severe disability premium or the carer premium. All
these are protected, like the support component. Income-related ESA
households where a member of the couple is over pension age also
receive a pensioner premium to ensure that the rate of benefit is the
equivalent of the pension credit rate. This rate is also uprated as
normal.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022512000223" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0001.htm#13022512000223">My
noble friend Lord German asked in particular about the personal
allowance aspect of ESA and why it is included in the Bill. It is
important for me to be clear that the personal allowance is there to
provide basic support. It is designed to meet the basic needs of all
those on out-of-work income-related benefits. The personal allowance is
consistent across all benefits which relate to those of working age.
There is a standard amount. For single people, it is currently
£71 a week. It is important that I am clear that this
rate is common across all claimants who receive ESA, JSA, income
support and housing benefit and reflects the fact that they perform a
similar function of providing basic support for everyday needs. They do
not reflect disability or the additional costs of disability, so
therefore it is right that they are set at a standard rate. That is the
rationale for including the personal allowance in this Bill and for the
personal allowance to be subject to the 1% cap on annual increases.
Treating one personal allowance rate differently from that in other
benefits would mean that there would be no clear level of income at
which state support is set and at which access to other help would be
available across a wide range of services. It would also introduce an
element of complexity in terms of the coherence of the benefit system
which would introduce new challenges and be likely to add further costs
to the running of the overall system.</hs_para>

acknowledged, the support group component is protected, so it is not
included in the Bill. It is the component element of ESA which
differentiates the need based on the effects of a disability or a
condition. That particular component relates to the effects of a
specific disability. The support group component is paid in recognition
of the fact that more severely disabled people are less likely to be
able to increase their income by moving into work and may have
additional needs. Therefore we pay those in the support group a higher
increase than those in the work-related activity group.</hs_para>

point that for those in the work-related activity group, ESA is not
like the old incapacity benefits that usually led to people being in
receipt of that benefit for a long period. This is intended to be a
short-term benefit for those in this group. Those who are placed in the
work-related activity group are there because they have been found able
to prepare for work. As such, they will be referred for appropriate
support, training and provision to ensure that they get the help they
need. ESA for people in that group is intended to be a short-term
benefit and we expect these claimants to be closer to the labour market
and be in a better position to prepare for work. Therefore, while they
may not be looking for work immediately in receipt of that benefit,
they have some ability to affect their own incomes. That is why it is 
<?notus-xml column=882?>right that the annual increase for those in the work-related activity
group should—unlike that for those in the support
group—be fully within the scope of the

the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, again referred to the alternative option

provide certainty. I will say that regularly throughout the passage of
the Bill; it is an important aspect of what we are doing. I know that
the noble Lord seeks to undermine that, but it is central to what we

Lord is clear about, is that the Bill still provides annual increases
in benefits, but at a reduced rate for some elements of those benefits.
We are doing this in the way that we propose because it adds to the
certainty. As I told the noble Lord when we were outside the Chamber,
the IMF was very clear that to anchor market expectations, policymakers
need to specify adequately detailed medium-term plans for lowering debt
ratios, which must be backed by binding legislation or fiscal
frameworks. This is part of what we are doing, and why it is

the economic situation, which we have already discussed today at some

elsewhere. Those in the work-related activity group are deemed able to
prepare for work and, as such, are better placed to be able to improve
their income levels. Therefore, we believe it right that the component

certainty for the markets, certainty for the Government and certainty
for the claimants. Many of us pressed her on the fact that certainty
for the Government, the markets or the claimants depended not just on
what the level of inflation would be but also on what the number of
claimants would be in order to get some estimate of what spending would
be. The Government had no way at all of forecasting two out of the

From the Minister’s response it seems that this is all about a
better future for everyone, and that seems to encompass a rather
strange load of decisions. My noble friend Lady Lister asked a question
which I do not believe was answered. She raised the comparison with

seems to me that this is incredibly mean-spirited. It just focuses on
the support group—the people who are in the most difficult
position and not able to access employment. The noble Baroness said

seek work, we know that the prospects are not good. Not only do we have
a work programme which is failing overall but there is at least
anecdotal evidence to suggest that the hardest to help are not being

Amendments 4, 5, 16, 18, 20 and 21, which are in my name, and I am
grateful to other noble Lords for adding their names to some of them.
These amendments seek to make two key changes to the Welfare Benefits
Up-rating Bill. The first is to ensure that universal credit rates,
including work allowances, are uprated with inflation. This will
protect the future value of benefits for low-income families while also
achieving most of the short-term savings required as part of the
Government’s deficit reduction
strategy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:37:32"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondly, the amendments seek to ensure that work will always pay and
that all working families are able to afford a minimum, decent standard
of living.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13022521000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000012"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:37:45"></hs_TimeCode>I
turn first to those amendments which seek to ensure that universal
credit is removed from the scope of the Bill. I have tabled them for
four key reasons. First, the baseline amounts for universal credit have
only just been established by the Government. It surely is reasonable
that these are now increased with cost of living. Secondly, the
majority of households protected in this way in the long term would be
working households. The measure would promote work incentives, about
which I will say more in a moment. Thirdly, the measure would protect
6.7 million children from some level of impact once universal credit is
fully
introduced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:38:32"></hs_TimeCode>.
Finally, the cost of the change would be relatively low over the next
two years as a result of limited levels of migration to universal
credit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:38:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022521000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000013">A
number of benefits have been substantially revised as part of the
introduction of universal credit. For example, the lower disability
addition for children, comparable to the disability element of child
tax credit, has been halved in value. Personal allowances for those
aged under 25 have been changed so that lone parents under 25 will no
longer receive the same rate of personal allowance as single adults
aged over 25. The severe and enhanced disability premiums present in
the current benefits system are being removed. These are major changes
to the system and, since we have only just established a new baseline
for support provided through the welfare system, it is surely
reasonable that that support should be increased to keep pace with
rises in the cost of living to ensure that the situation for families
remains comparable over
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:39:47"></hs_TimeCode>. Inclusion
of universal credit in the Bill amounts to a 
<?notus-xml column=886?>cut to the new scheme before it is even introduced. This surely cannot
make sense. At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:40:02"></hs_TimeCode>
this stage, we do not yet know what the impact of these changes to the
structure of support will be. We should at least wait and see what the
implications of these changes are before initiating cuts to
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022521000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000014">So<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:40:24"></hs_TimeCode>
how much will this cost? With my proposal, the Government can still
make savings, but they can also help to ensure that the success of
universal credit is not undermined. Based on a migration rate of 10% of
claimants by the end of 2014-15 and 30% of claimants by the end of
2015-16, the additional cost of removing universal credit from the
scope of the Bill would be £90 million in 2014-15 and
£510 million in 2015-16. This would mean that the Bill would
still make savings of £810 million in 2014-15 and £1.2
billion in 2015-16. In fact, since many households migrated across will
have a lower entitlement under universal credit and so receive
transitional protection, the costs may be significantly lower than
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:41:35"></hs_TimeCode>. Does the
Minister agree that, having only just set the rates of support for
universal credit, it would be reasonable to increase these in line with
cost of
living?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022521000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000015">Secondly,
I turn to work incentives. A key objective of the current welfare
system and of the future system in the form of universal credit is to
ensure that work incentives are maintained. The Government rightly
identify work as an important way for families to lift themselves out
of poverty, and we all accept that. However, this can succeed only if
the right work incentives are provided through in-work benefits and tax
credits. The Government estimate that around half of the total number
of households affected by the Bill are working households—a
total of 3.25 million working households, including working families
from all walks of
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022521000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000016">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:42:46"></hs_TimeCode>
impact will be reflected in children in poverty in working families.
The Government have admitted that they expect it to push 100,000 more
children in working families below the poverty line. The amendments in
this group in my name explicitly safeguard work incentives. The
amendment ensures that the allowances provided through working tax
credit, personal allowances within housing benefit and work allowances
in universal credit are increased in line with prices. Doing so
explicitly improves work incentives and ensures the principle that work
pays.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022521000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000017">Working
tax credit will be affected by this Bill as it stands. It is notable
that the basic and 30-hour elements of working tax have already faced a
three-year freeze, from 2011-12 to 2013-14. This means that, in total,
these elements will increase by just 2% over the course of half a
decade, a period in which prices have risen by eight times as much. On
top of this freeze, as a result of the Bill, a lone parent working 30
hours per week would receive the basic, lone parent and 30-hour
elements of WTC and, as a result, they will have a WTC entitlement
which is up to £132 per year

amendments also seek for the personal allowances within housing benefit
to be increased in line with inflation. The personal allowance rates
for adults are included within the scope of the Bill. This will mean
that households moving into paid work keep less of their earnings

with the passing of the welfare Act last year, the future of the
welfare system is focused through the universal credit. A key aim of
this credit is to promote work incentives through work allowances, but
it is notable that these work allowances are not mentioned within the
Bill. Failure to increase these in line with inflation will have a very
substantial impact on the actual value of the
allowances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:45:11"></hs_TimeCode>. For
example, the higher work allowance—the rate provided to
households not claiming for help with housing costs—for a lone
parent family is £734 per month, worth up to £477 per
month for working families. The Children’s Society have
calculated that, were this uprated in line with inflation, this would
be expected to be £770 by 2015-16, worth up to £500 per
month for working families. As a result, failure to uprate work
allowances within universal credit would cost working lone parent
families £23 per month, in the value of this allowance alone.
Does the Minister
agree<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:46:14"></hs_TimeCode> that
in-work benefits and tax credits help to ensure that work always pays?
Secondly, will she confirm that the reason that the work allowances
within universal credit are not included within the scope of the Bill
is that the Government intend to increase them at least in line with
inflation?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022521000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000020">In
conclusion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T17:46:44"></hs_TimeCode>, the
Bill as it currently stands seriously fails to protect working
families, and will cast children into poverty. It simply does not go
far enough to promote work, so that work always pays, particularly for
the lowest earning working families. My amendments go some way to

amendments and have added my name to most of them. The House owes a
debt of gratitude to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester
for raising these points. I particularly support his concerns about
lone parents. Over the whole systematic process of change, my concerns
are getting greater and greater about the compounding effect of all
these changes that we see in the social protection available in the

heart absolutely sank when I saw that this Bill was being applied to
universal credit, because universal credit should be the future; it is
the architecture around which we as a country should and must have
serious consideration about provision for low-income households. We
need to have a discussion with people such as my noble friend Lord
Forsyth of Drumlean as well, between now and the next election. I hope
that there will be a grown-up discussion about how the United Kingdom,
as a poorer country, accommodates some of these new pressures, and I am
willing to engage in that to the best of my ability. However, what is
wrong about applying these two years of locked-down 1% increases is

<?notus-xml column=888?>universal credit, when they are transitioned across into the new system,
that they are being sold a pup. That will potentially damage the
public’s understanding of what universal credit is about and
that is a real shame. I understand perfectly well all the arguments
that the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, makes, and we have to put up with
them in the best way we can, but we should have isolated universal

I do not think that we know how universal credit will work out when it
is in steady state, and it will take a long time to get there. I come
back to the costs that will be saved by applying this uprating Bill to
universal credit because I am a bit confused about exactly what the
Government think they are going to save. Therefore, I make my first
complaint—it is another moan—with conviction. The noble
Lord, Lord Freud, bless him, has worked very hard to try to get
universal credit to stand up. I read a worrying story in the
<I>Financial Times</I>, which said that the self-employed have not yet
been told that there is a real-time HMRC system heading in their
direction. Not many of them know about it. That is more than slightly
worrying—it is very worrying, because the computer system is
essential to that measure working sensibly. However, we must try to do
the best we can to make it work in

the right reverend Prelate was right to give this priority—one
of the best elements of universal credit is the way it deals with what
used to be known in the old language as income disregard. Some of us
have fought for years to do something constructive about income
disregard. It is a very intractable problem and universal credit has
given us an opportunity to get hold of that and provide incentives to
get into work. Universal credit does that, but the first thing that the
Government do after bringing in this new progressive reform is to cap
it at 1%. How that is supposed to meld with everything else that has
been done in connection with the Work Programme makes no sense to me.
It will save relatively small amounts of money in terms of the big
picture savings that the Government are trying to lock in, but for the
life of me it seems a counterproductive, silly cut to introduce and it

a number of teething problems; we think the Government have been right
to extend the introduction way beyond the original intention. It
therefore seems to me that very important questions have been raised
about why we should at this stage include universal credit within these
provisions. We on these Benches want to see everything outside this

million that year from removing universal credit, which would increase
over time as more households moved to universal credit; around
£160 million that year from removing working tax credits; and,
under Amendment 13, around £60 million that year from removing

Baroness, Lady Hollis, is not in her place, but she also made the point
in an earlier debate. We are making a lot of changes to the welfare

doing the right thing and that those changes will result in a much more
effective system. It is safe for me to say that in broad terms most of
those changes have received support from the House. There has been
recognition on all sides that the welfare system as it stood needed to

general issues, it is perhaps worth responding to points raised about
cumulative impacts and assessments. I know that my noble friend Lord
Newby referred to this in his response to the first group of

transparency around impacts and we publish the impacts of government

I say we are producing quite a lot of information. It is there and
publicly available, but let us not forget that all those assessments

key principle of this Bill is the certainty that it gives as part of

not tire of saying it to the House as it is important. By taking these
benefits out of the Bill and thereby restoring the annual exercise of
discretion in relation to prices, the amendments would undermine the
key principle of certainty. Amendments 4 and 5, if taken with the
others, would make it a requirement to uprate universal 
<?notus-xml column=893?>credit, working tax credit elements and housing benefit personal
allowances by at least prices. I am not sure whether that is the

Lords have talked about the inclusion of in-work benefits and
questioned whether these should be included. We cannot escape the fact
that some working households will be affected. I am not seeking to
suggest for one moment that they will not. Tax credits, for example,
account for around £30 billion of expenditure this year. Tax
credit spending rocketed under the previous Government by an
extraordinary 340% compared with the benefits they replaced.
Eligibility for tax credits was extended to nine out of 10 families
with children, so it would be unrealistic to exclude the benefits
received by working people from these decisions that we are taking. For
my part I think people understand that. There is a general recognition
that this element of spending could not be excluded, particularly when

debating these changes that we also make sure that we take account of
the other measures that the Government have introduced that provide
some benefit to families. For instance, in the Autumn Statement we
announced a further increase to personal tax allowance, and taken
together, increases to the personal allowance brought in since this
Government came to power will benefit 24.5 million individuals,

million to help freeze council tax bills in England, which means that

Lords have said this in today’s debate, which is a point that we
all agree on. Universal credit lies at the heart of coalition policies
to combat child poverty and transform the lives of those who most need
our help. The simplicity of universal credit means that people will
clearly understand the improved work incentives it creates, allowing
them to keep more of their income when they find a job or increase
their 
<?notus-xml column=894?>earnings. That simple point should never be underestimated. I find the
benefits system a complete minefield to understand, and the changes
that we are introducing are incredibly important. More than
3 million people will gain from universal credit, with an

Committing to uprate the work allowances goes beyond the legacy system
that saw no routine increases to the less generous disregards. It is
also worth responding now to a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady
Howe of Idlicote, who referred to statutory maternity pay. We will be
debating that later on as there is a group of amendments specifically
about that. She talked about the impact on women. There was quite a
lively discussion online on the Mumsnet website about statutory
maternity pay. One of the points made on the blog that was echoed by
quite a lot of people is that for those who are in a relationship or
marriage, their husband or partner benefits from maternity pay just as
much as they do because all their household income is pooled. We
undermine the intelligence of people if we argue that people are not

I turn to housing benefit personal allowances. I should make it
completely clear that the Bill does not uprate every aspect of housing

benefit personal allowance. This figure is used in the calculation of
housing benefit. I refer noble Lords to our previous debate. The
personal allowance is a block of money that is consistent across all
benefits. For single people it is £71 a week. That is what the

housing benefit is particularly complicated, I will make two things
clear. For those who continue to satisfy the income test for all
income-related benefits, including housing benefit, their eligible rent

reminded us that the effect of the Bill compounds the effect of so much
other legislation that is going through at the moment. In particular he
made the point that universal credit is the central architecture of
welfare for the future and reminded us that, in his view, the savings
are not worth the candle, and the effect of including universal credit
in the uprating provisions will be to prejudice so much that is good
about it. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, passionately expressed her
concern about more children being tipped into poverty, and about the
very wide margin by which it is now clear we will miss the 2020
children in poverty targets. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton,

Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to move
Amendment 6, standing in my name and that of my good friend, the noble
Baroness, Lady Lister of Burtersett. This is a probing amendment. It is
something about which I feel very strongly. It is a modest proposal
that does not seek to disrupt the certainty of which my noble friend
made so much earlier in the course of these important debates. The
amendment simply disapplies the 1% uprating in Clauses 1 and
2 in the event of inflation reaching 3% in 2014-15. In those
circumstances, we would revert to the default position of the annual
uprating mechanisms that we all know and love. We would achieve the
savings without exposing clients on benefits in future to the risks of
inflation above and beyond the government estimates on which the
savings will be
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:28:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022521000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000069">It
is important to remember that the Bill deals with two years of annual
uprating. However, we must factor in to the totality of the situation
we face the already accepted £505 million that the Autumn
Statement estimated that the 1% uprating would yield in this current
year. I am sure that we are all looking forward to the uprating
statement later in the week. In addition, the saving from the 1%
uprating of local housing allowance is being dealt with through
separate legislation. Both these reductions have already been made for
the current year, 2013-14. We must not forget the reductions this year,
in addition to those of the two years for which the Bill
provides<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:28:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022521000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000070">What
will the Government do if the OBR estimates are too low? We know that

estimates about the inflationary 
<?notus-xml column=897?>risks that we face. However, we all understand that the Bill is based on
the CPI and inflation forecast of the OBR, which at the moment stands
at 2.6% in September this year, to be followed by 2.2% in September
2014. Those are the estimates on which the savings of
£1.2 billion in 2014-15 and £1.9 billion in

colleagues have been as concerned as I have been over the past few
days. I am no economist but I am now more nervous about inflationary
pressures increasing. The Governor of the Bank of England designate, Mr
Mark Carney, has already signalled that he might take a different view
and so the strategy may change. If he goes for growth—I hope he
will consider that seriously because it is an element of economic
policy that we need to explore in the immediate future—it will
almost certainly have inflationary consequences. The fall in the value
of the pound and exchange rate concerns will all increase prices.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:31:11"></hs_TimeCode> am a
well-known pessimist—I am rarely disappointed—and I think
that things will get worse before they get better. Food and fuel
prices, and rents in certain parts of the United Kingdom, particularly
in London, will certainly increase. To be confident that the figures of
2.6% in September 2013 and 2.2% in September 2014 are going to stick is
not a safe basis on which to establish this
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:31:33"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:31:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022521000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000072">As
I said at Second Reading, the way the Bill is contrived at the moment
is a one-way bet for the Chancellor because he locks in his savings but
banks everything else if inflation goes beyond 2.2% and 2.6%. I do not
think that is fair. It produces government certainty but, sure as
anything, it will produce uncertainty for the benefit claimants in
2014-15 and 2015-16 if inflation breaches the OBR’s estimates.
The Government need a plan B to deal with the increasing risk that the
price that will be paid by benefit cuts in future will be higher than
the Government really

value of the lost purchasing power of these benefits is very sensitive
to inflationary increases and I asked the Library to look at what some
of these measures would mean. It is difficult to make sense of tables
in a speech because it is hard to speak in tables but if the OBR
estimates for 2014 and 2015 increase by 1%, the savings will not be
£1.1 billion and £1.9 billion but £1.8
billion and £3.3 billion. A 1% increase on the OBR estimates
would change the cut in the value of the benefits from 4% to 6%.

the table tells me that if the OBR estimates are underestimated by
2%—not 1%—in 2014 and 2015, the savings to the Chancellor
will be £2.5 billion and £4.7 billion. That is a cut in
the real value of benefits of 8%. I could go on—and, rather
obviously, it would get worse—but we can all pay our money and
take our choice about what the inflation rate will be. I have got a

a bottom line amendment; as he put it, a modest amendment. Support for

passed. Citizens Advice has calculated various scenarios assuming 2.2%
inflation and taking account of any gains from the rise in the tax
threshold, regularly waved as a fig leaf by Ministers. These show that
for some families, in or out of work, the net loss could be as high as
around £13 a week by April 2015. This is an enormous sum to lose
for someone on a low income. The amendment would not prevent these
losses if inflation is less than 3%. It is a damage limitation exercise

credits 2.2% below the actual inflation rate rather than the 1.2% below
inflation upon which the impact assessment is based. As the noble Lord,
Lord Kirkwood, said, given that the incoming Governor of the Bank of
England is making noises about possibly easing inflation targets and
the loss of the AAA rating’s impact on import prices, it is
quite possible that the 2% inflation rate predicted as the basis of the
2015-16 uprating could also be an underestimate. Indeed, many economic
commentators are talking about inflation remaining in excess of 2% for
at least the next two
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:39:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022521000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000079">A
more relaxed inflation policy may well make sense in terms of
stimulating the economy, but we should not leave the poorest members of
the community to bear the burden—hence this amendment. My
colleague, 
<?notus-xml column=899?>Donald Hirsch of the Centre for Research in Social Policy at
Loughborough University, has calculated the likely impact of the Bill
on a two-earner couple with two children on combined low earnings of
£20,000 a year and in receipt of child tax credit and child
benefit. Over the next three years, if inflation is on target at around
2%, they will lose just under £300 a year in real terms. To
repeat the point, that is a cut. If it runs at 3% a year over the
period, they will lose as much as £500 a
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:39:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

inflation rates with reference to benefit upratings, we must remember
two things. First, the switch from the RPI to the CPI is already
expected to significantly depress benefit rates over the long term. The
House of Commons Library cites the OBR’s long-term assumption
that the annual increase in the RPI will be 1.4% more than the CPI. The
Library calculates that such a difference will result in benefits being
worth, after 10 years, 86% of the amount they would have been had they
continued to be uprated by the RPI. That is quite a big
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:40:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondly, even the RPI does not provide an accurate measure of the
impact of price rises on low-income recipients of social security
benefits and tax credits at a time when the prices of the essentials
upon which they spend a disproportionate share of their budget are
rising faster than prices generally. Recent work by the IFS shows that
the general trend in recent years has been for higher than average CPI
inflation rates for those on low incomes. Again, Donald Hirsch has
calculated the increase in the cost of a minimum basket of necessary
goods and services between 2001 and 2011. This shows that someone whose
benefits were uprated only by the CPI during that period would have a
shortfall of around 11% as opposed to if they had been uprated by the
cost of the minimum basket. He warns
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13022521000131" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000131">“there

of the global influence on prices suggests that a long-term increase in
commodity prices will have a knock-on effect on essentials such as
food, fuel and clothing, and could mean that someone on basic benefits

requirements in 2000—and that is before taking account of the

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, we should be grateful to the
noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, and my noble friend Lady Lister for this
amendment and the manner in which they have spoken to it. I start by
reiterating that obviously our overall objective is to get rid of the
1% uprating cap throughout the Bill. Obviously, if we were successful,
the protection that both speakers are seeking here would be
unnecessary, but if we are not able to do that, we have to consider a
range of mitigations to these cuts. The aspect identified by the noble
Lord, Lord Kirkwood—the bearing of inflation risks much in
excess of OBR forecasts—is certainly one that should concern us
all. As it is, on the basis of the OBR forecast, by 2015-16 the 1%
uprating will imply a real cut of some 4%. Depending on what happens to
inflation, that real cut could be much higher. We have heard a range of
figures from both speakers that could flow from
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:46:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that these real cuts lower the base for whatever the uprating may be
for the future. Studies point to the rate of inflation for what might
be 
<?notus-xml column=901?>termed as essential items being higher than the overall rate, with
essentials for this purpose including such items as food, heating,
transport, fares and water charges. These are costs which are largely
inescapable for low income households. The briefing we have had from
USDAW records electricity prices rising by 3.9% and gas by 5.2% up to
December 2012, with the poorest 10% of households spending 17% of their
income on food, which rose by 3.8% in the period to December. As it
stands, this Bill places the whole of the inflation risk on benefit and
tax credit recipients, irrespective of the size of the risk. However,
if inflation is less than 1% the Government can take the benefit of
that and, if they so choose, uprate by less than
1<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T18:47:47"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_para>

Lord Kirkwood, and his noble friend Lord German who demanded of the
Government at Second Reading that there should be no further cuts
beyond those set out in the Bill. Of course they got a dusty answer
from the Minister, but the problem is that we do not know the level of
the real cuts which flow from this Bill because we do not know the rate
of inflation. The point made by my noble friend Lady Lister is that
inserting an upper rate of 3% should not be taken to imply that real
cuts up to this level are acceptable, but that automatic cuts above
that level are certainly not.</hs_para>

hope that the noble Lord will not press his amendment at this
stage—I think he said it was probing in nature—because we
believe that the right course of action is to eliminate the 1% cap in
its entirety. But if we are unable to do that on Report, the type of
backstop being sought by this amendment is something which deserves our
support—subject to only one exception, which is that the
Minister can give assurances about how poor people are to be protected

in their pay across the private and public sectors without the comfort

lot about certainty today. The truth is that no one has certainty,
whether they are in or out of work, about their future real income. As
noble Lords know, many people in the public and private sectors have
not been getting pay increases linked to inflation and have been
falling behind in real terms. This is exemplified by the difficult
decision we took to freeze public sector pay at a time when inflation
was rising to 5.2%. It is also borne out by the fact that, according to
the latest figures, over the past year average earnings have risen by
only 1.3%—not very different from the increase that is being
proposed in the Bill. This means that on the best available
forecasts—those produced by the OBR in November last
year—even with the effects of this Bill, by the end of the

Just at the point when government, understandably, wants to bear down
on HB costs, it finds its efforts destroyed by the shortage of housing
supply in the market. I sympathise, but the Government’s folly
lies in their response. Housing, like potatoes, is not a discretionary
item—its consumption cannot be reduced except by illegal
overcrowding in illegal slums—yet it is being treated by
government as though it were rather like going to the cinema. People
cannot choose not to have any housing unless they sleep rough or in
cars or on cathedral doorsteps. They must live somewhere and must pay
for it. The Government, instead of seeking to increase the supply of
housing substantially—which is the only answer apart, possibly,
from rent control—have chosen to drive down the HB bill by
fixing it to below average
rents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:02:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

always been tied to real, actual rents, precisely because rents vary
from place to place and by type of property. Local housing allowance
was in each area placed at 50% of the median local rent and adjusted
monthly—that is how sensitive it was to local rent
levels—so that half the houses or properties in the private
rented sector should be available and affordable to a tenant on HB. The
Government have now brought that 50% figure down to 30%—that is,
less than a third of properties will now be affordable—believing
without any evidence, and we have pressed the Minister on that on many
occasions, that this would press down HB and rents would fall. They
have done so because they seem to think that it is a tenants’
market. They have no evidence for that, understandably, because the
evidence does not exist, and because it has not been a tenants’
market—it is not and it will not be. If housing-benefit tenants
dominated the private rented sector then we would have seen rents begin
to fall during the past year. But they have not, and they do not,
because tenants on HB are only 20% of the PRS, so they do not have the
leverage that government attributes to them. Tenants are now being
punished for the fallacies, failures and folly of government policy. Do
you remember those notices in landlords’ windows: “No
Irish, no blacks, no dogs, no DSS”? I do. Well, that is
reappearing. According to the National Landlords Association, nine in
10 private landlords say that they are reluctant to accept HB tenants
because they do not have to. With five to eight tenants after every
flat, it is a landlords’ market, not a tenants’ market,
which is why cutting HB will not do anything to help drive down the

is bad enough, but we have a second whammy occurring. Not only is the
proportion of PRS property available to HB tenants being nearly halved,
but HB will no longer rise even sufficiently to meet their needs. HB
will in future be tied to inflation—this year, CPI—and
not as in the past to what is happening to rents. For the first time
ever, in other words, HB is being detached from what is happening to
real rents in the market, whether at 50% or 30%. In the past decade,
however, PRS rents have risen in real terms by more than
11<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:05:48"></hs_TimeCode>%. As rents in
London are rising by 7% a year and by 3.4% elsewhere, and as CPI is
currently running at 2.7%, then HB, which is supposed to cover 30% of
available properties, will instead cover only 20% in about five years
and perhaps 10% or less in 10 years. Shelter estimates that in a third
of the country the private rented sector will be inaccessible to all

double whammy is an increase in the number of people needing housing
benefit as rents soar and an increase in the number of people finding
that even the housing benefit that they receive will not cover the ever

will be too high, housing benefit too low and landlords too reluctant.
What is the result? Either tenants will seek to make up the difference
out of their benefit income, thus increasing severe child poverty, or
they will not. If they do not, they may face eviction and end up
homeless. If they have children, they may ultimately end up in bed and
breakfast before—with the lack of available social
housing—probably being recycled into the private rented sector
for the same sorry cycle to be repeated another year down the line. As
all the housing dominos fall over, misery cascades down the tenures,

tell us that a third of the expected savings from all this will be
recycled to help those areas with the highest rents, and that is
welcome. However, as with the discretionary housing allowance, they

is important to note that the amendment’s call for a review of
the impact of capping rent increases in local housing allowances at 1%
next year, rather than at the consumer prices index level, comes from
the landlord side as well as from those excellent bodies Shelter,
Crisis and the others representing tenants. If the case made from the
perspective of tenants does not win the argument, perhaps the points
made by the landlord representatives will prove
convincing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:11:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022521000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000102">Why
is there a need for a special review of how rent increases in the
private rented sector in comparison with increases in help with rent
from local housing allowance are likely to work out in the years ahead?
I suggest that there are two distinct reasons why the capping of local
housing allowance at 1% per annum irrespective of levels of real rent
increases in the marketplace is critical. First, the local housing
allowance can represent half or even more of the total benefits
received by those out of work and can represent most of the support
which many of those in low-paid jobs receive from the state. That means
that there are huge repercussions for tenants where a gap opens up
between the actual rent that must be paid and the local housing
allowance received to cover it. Cutting housing support means the
tenant finding the money to meet the shortfall on the rent out of
income intended for food, heating and other essentials.</hs_para>

housing costs greatly increase the level of child poverty—the
issue of concern to my noble friend Lady Howe. Department for Work and
Pensions statistics analysed by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation this
month show the child poverty rate in England at 19% before
housing costs are factored in, but at 28% afterwards. Where
housing costs are lower, that 
<?notus-xml column=908?>huge impact does not show up. In Scotland, for example, the child
poverty rate is the same as for England excluding housing costs, at
19%. It rises to 21% when housing costs are taken into account, far
short of the 28% figure for England because of England’s high
housing costs. Help with housing therefore makes a very real difference

poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:13:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022521000104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000104">Not
providing enough money to pay the rent for those who rely on income
from benefits simply means a cut to the other benefits that they
receive. For tenants in the private rented sector, the reduction in
living standards in real terms resulting from the Bill could well be
doubled: first, from the gap in direct help with income between 1% and
whatever inflation turns out to be and, secondly, from the gap in
housing help between 1% and whatever rent increases over the next three
years turn out to
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:14:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022521000105" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000105">Secondly,
there are consequences where support for housing costs is cut not only
for those receiving benefits but for the housing market—the
availability of accommodation. Obviously, it affects the attitude of
landlords towards providing accommodation for those on modest incomes
if they are subject to tough rent controls. In most parts of the UK,
there are plenty of other people desperately keen to find a rented
home—students, mobile single people who share, and, as we know
from excellent new research by the Building and Social Housing
Foundation, increasing numbers of working families with young children
who would have bought a home in times past but now cannot afford the
deposit and mortgage costs. The acute housing shortages in so many
parts of England mean that landlords are most unlikely to reduce rents
to assist those in receipt of local housing allowance. Rather, as the
Residential Landlords Association survey cited by the noble Baroness,
Lady Hollis, shows, landlords will avoid lettings where LHA rent
controls could apply, and will go for lettings on the open
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:15:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13022521000138" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022521000138">7.15

squeezing out that part of the rented sector puts more pressure on the
social housing sector—housing associations and councils. Of
course, that stock was diminished by right-to-buy sales of council
housing. The building of social housing in the past 30 years
has been at one-quarter of the level of the preceding 70 years. Now
those landlords have massive waiting lists. There are consequences for
the taxpayer if private landlords do not house lower-income households:
the cost to local authorities of stacking families in temporary
accommodation—hostels and bed and breakfast hotels. One London
borough now has 2,320 families in temporary accommodation. In 2010, the
figure was 610. That is an increase of more than 350% in less than
three years, and expenditure will escalate wildly if we have to return
to using those temporary solutions, including bed and breakfast hotels,
at costs far higher than for private rented sector

the limitation of increases to CPI levels beyond two years but to
enhance the squeeze by the 1% limit, probably well under half the
likely CPI increases—for three years makes a requirement for a
thoroughgoing review much more

amendment, echoing the sentiments expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady

have one last point. Can the Minister explain the Government’s
intention in relation to the special case of London? We have been led
to understand that one-third of the gains from the 1% cap on LHA
payment increases are to be recycled to support the higher rent
increases in the London area. We know that London rents have been
increasing by twice the level of inflation—6.7% last year, for
example—and excluding London from the 1% cap would ease
pressures there. However, it would be more than helpful if the Minister
could explain how this arrangement, which would of course make the
housing position of the capital even further out of step with the rest
of the country, be implemented in

Bates:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to comment on the amendment, in
which I find a lot to support, particularly the idea of a review.
Before I do so, I owe the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, an apology because
in my earlier intervention I made a point about higher-rate tax and
said that it had decreased, when of course it had increased. I
apologise for impugning his tax-raising credentials. It was a low blow
that was not intended. I take this opportunity to correct the record

is an interesting amendment to consider because we are dealing with a
significant crisis. There is no doubt that housing benefit itself needs
to be focused 
<?notus-xml column=910?>on: how it has increased from roughly £11 billion, circa 1997, to
a predicted £25 billion in 2015. Clearly, no one could sit in

second point is that private rents have been increasing at an alarming
rate when compared with the rest of the housing market. One needs to
consider the increases, which, according to the National Housing
Federation, have been something like 35% over the past three years.
Over that same period, we have seen an 86% increase in the number of
those claiming housing benefit, from 485,000 to 905,000. This is
happening at a time when, outside certain sections of the London
property market, house prices are actually falling. This is happening
when interest rates are at historically low levels, and mortgage rates
are at levels whereby 1.99%, two-year fixed rates are being offered.
There are very low mortgage rates while house prices are falling, yet
at the same time private rents are increasing by not only the rate of
inflation but in many cases by twice the rate of inflation. It does not
take a great economist—and I note that there are some in the
Chamber—to work out that there might be some correlation between
housing benefit and a potential inflationary effect on the private
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:23:30"></hs_TimeCode>. I

also note that one of the solutions to the problem is to ensure that
there is a greater housing supply through housebuilding. This is an
area on which I would pitch to my honourable friend in his pre-Budget
purdah and ask him to reflect on how additional funds could be made
available. I do not say that the Government have done nothing in that
regard. They have put up £10 billion in guaranteed loans to try
to stimulate the market, and they have introduced shared ownership
schemes through FirstBuy and NewBuy to try and increase house purchase.
That is an important element. We do not want, as a society and for the
health of our society, to divert people into a life in private rented
housing. We want to encourage people to have an ownership stake in
society and to own their own home. For them to do that, there need to
be enough homes coming on to the market.</hs_para>

is a competition because, as people are coming on to the market and
wanting to own their own home, investors who are experiencing low rates
of return in other asset classes are finding, according to Rightmove,
that there is a yield of 5.8% on private rented properties—the
figure is 6.5% in London—which represents extraordinarily good
value in the present market. Capital is therefore flowing into the
buy-to-let market, rather than the build-to-buy
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:25:32"></hs_TimeCode>. There
needs to be some step back from this approach and one needs to ask what
is actually happening and how it all connects with changes in

are, I assume, taking an approach whereby we believe that capping the
local housing allowance and housing benefit will lead to a slowing down
of the increases in rents. The noble Baroness is shaking her head, but
that is the assumption. We have certainly seen how rents have increased
when housing benefit and local housing allowance have increased.
Perhaps 
<?notus-xml column=911?>we should test this out, but that is difficult because we are talking
about affecting lots of very vulnerable people. However, there is a
case to be looked at. Some annual or periodic review of how this is
working and impacting on the housing market would be welcome, and I
encourage that part of the amendment. I am delighted to note that my

perhaps I may take this opportunity to raise one further question about
the way in which benefits are to be paid to the tenant rather than to
the landlord. I know that various demonstration projects are undergoing
trial in Edinburgh, Oxford, Shropshire, Southwark and Wakefield
involving direct payment, and that they have some time to run, but I
should be grateful if my noble friend in her response can provide some
assessment of how they are going. There are some concerns that paying
benefits directly to tenants, particularly when that may represent the
largest component of their income, might put them in an invidious
position, and some people might get into greater debt as a result. I
know that such schemes are being trialled and I should be grateful for

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a good but
short debate, as any debate around amendments of my noble friend Lady
Hollis and the noble Lord, Lord Best, on housing would be. You cannot
do better than that in your Lordships’ House. I am grateful to
the noble Lord, Lord Bates, for his earlier comments. I thought that he
had got it the wrong way round but was not quite sure whether I had
misheard. I think that my problem is that I am not confident to
challenge him; however, I am grateful for his
clarification<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:29:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Best, are on the same page on this matter and we are
happy to support the amendment, which calls for a review of housing
welfare benefit, especially regarding the affordability of private
sector housing. My noble friend and the noble Lord made a particularly
powerful case in their analysis of the consequences of a growing
divergence between levels of private sector rents and levels
of support. We know and recognise why there is a growing
divergence—the 30th percentile, the individual cap, CPI
uprating, and now the proposed 1% cap. It will be made worse by direct
payments when universal credit comes in. There are certainly causes of
the pressure on rents, with growing numbers of households and
insufficient new builds, but no evidence—indeed, quite the
reverse—that the restrictions on housing support are driving
rents in the opposite direction. It remains to be seen, as the noble
Lord, Lord Bates, suggested, whether there will be any slowing down
with the further ratcheting down of housing
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:39:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

consequence of the Bill is that there is a growing gap between rent
levels and support. I think the noble Lord, Lord Best, made this point
at Second Reading. That has to be met from income which is 
<?notus-xml column=912?>itself, as a result of this Bill, coming under increasing pressure
because of the real-terms cuts. The amount of housing support in the
private rented sector has been determined by family type and the rent
distribution in the local area. In the future, the link will be with
the historical levels of local rents; that seems a slightly illogical
basis on which to build a sensible system. The demand of my noble
friend and the noble Lord, Lord Best, for a review of the current and
changing relationship between local market rents and levels for housing
support is no more than a reasonable search for the data to monitor
what is going on. We hope that, on the basis of the commitment that the
noble Lord, Lord Freud, has already made, there will be no difficulty
with this so far as the Minister is concerned.</hs_para>

a point that the noble Lord, Lord Best, raised about the uprating for
2014-15 and 2015-16 at a maximum of 1%, which is being dealt with by
orders under the Housing Act 1996. As I think has been stated, 30% of
the saving under this measure, or £140 million, will be made
available to help with particular pressures on affordability. The noble
Lord, Lord Best, asked whether we can get some more information on that
and I should be grateful if the Minister could give us some further
detail. If £140 million represents 30% of the
Government’s saving from this measure, I compute that the total
gross saving—the total further amount being ripped out of
support for housing—is something to the tune of £500
million.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022525000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022525000005">I

in this group, as I covered quite a bit of it in the previous
discussion I will not go over it again, except to say that since the
noble Lord, Lord Best, referred to the personal allowance of housing
benefit, it is worth me repeating this for clarity’s sake.
First, eligible rent will continue to be wholly covered by housing
benefit for those who continue to satisfy the income test for all
income-related benefits, including housing benefit. Secondly, renters
in low-paid work will still be better off than they would be on
out-of-work benefits. Work will continue to pay. Although that relates
to the previous discussion, I wanted to say that again because the

noble Lord, Lord Freud, made the commitment and that that commitment is
now in the process of being delivered by a current review. Is she
referring to the original review that was established by the noble
Lord, Lord Best, is she saying that the terms of reference of that
original review have been extended or, thirdly, is she saying that
there is a further review for this particular aspect in order to
deliver the pledge made by the noble Lord, Lord Freud, that he would
keep under review any possibility of significant divergence between
market trends and housing

CPI limit and more than one in 10 rates have actually fallen in line

42% of landlords would scale back on housing benefit tenants. The
reality is that the housing benefit caseload has actually risen in

people most affected by the new 1% limit. The noble Lord, Lord Best,
referred specifically to effects in London, and I can confirm that the
funding that has been set aside will be there to address areas
precisely such as London and the south-east. Our intention is to

noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, and my noble friend Lord Bates spoke about
increasing the supply of housing. I shall respond to a few points on
that. First, the Government have committed £4.5 billion, along
with £15 billion of private investment, to deliver 170,000 new
affordable homes over this spending review period. Almost
58,000 affordable homes were delivered last year. That is one-third
more than the average delivery in the 10 years between 2000-01 and
2009-10. Secondly, the Government will provide up to
£10 billion in debt guarantees to support private
investment in the private rented sector and in new affordable housing.
Thirdly, in last year’s Autumn Statement the Government
announced a new local infrastructure fund of up to £474 million
to support key projects. This includes accelerating delivery of large
housing sites and enabling quicker disposal of surplus public land for
new
homes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T19:47:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the changes that we are making to housing benefit, my noble friend

these are very early days for the trial and it is too soon to give a
properly informed response to that question. However, there are
certainly no immediate signs of any serious problem. It is worth
reminding the Committee that this change is part of the wider reforms
of the welfare system where we are trying not only to help people to
prepare and, for those who are out of work, return to work but to help
people to take control of their own finances. While I understand the
risks that people point to in making that change, we should not ignore
the importance of ensuring that we give people the opportunity to have

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who
have contributed to this small debate. The noble Lord, Lord Best,
emphasised that housing benefit was a high-ticket item. He is right, so
any percentage cuts to that benefit are highly significant in terms of
the income as it affects tenant recipients. He also emphasised, and he
was absolutely right to do so, the folly as well as the cruelty of
sending thousands of families into higher cost temporary accommodation.
I agreed with every word he said—I hope that that does not damn
his speech.</hs_para>

Lord Bates, for a thoughtful contribution to the debate supporting the
review. I am delighted that he agrees with the commitment of the noble
Lord, Lord Freud, that such a review is desirable and necessary.
Contrary to what the Minister was saying, he is right that private
sector rents are alone among the housing triple tenures in rising fast.
They are rising faster than inflation. That, as I tried to argue, means
that it is impossible to leave that sector because by paying those
higher rents you cannot afford to save for the deposit that takes you
out of it. In turn, that raises rents still higher because nobody is
leaving that sector but other people are trying to enter, which makes
it even more impossible to leave it in the future. It becomes a vicious
upward spiral in which people are trapped. The noble Lord, Lord Bates,
is absolutely right that that is exactly what is happening. Poorer
tenants are also faced with that higher increased pressure on rents
with only housing benefit to help them cope with it, and that housing
benefit is being cut three times over—first by being connected
not to the 50th percentile of rents but to the 30th
percentile, secondly by being capped by CPI for the forthcoming year
instead of actual rent levels, and thirdly, in the subsequent two
years, by a further cap of only 1%, which the Minister has confirmed to
us. That means that more tenants will follow the desperately sad route
that the noble Lord, Lord Best, emphasised.</hs_para>

my noble friend Lord McKenzie said, quoting the <I>Guardian</I> article
that I missed, that will mean more families with children being
uprooted and spending longer periods in bed-and-breakfast
accommodation. Many years ago, as a former chair of a housing
committee, I saw how long it took those children, who were often
traumatised by those events, to get over them. They had had to move
home, move school and lose connection with their friends. At the age of
seven or eight, they were reverting to bedwetting and the rest. That is
what we are now going to be imposing on thousands more children because
of the folly of this
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022533000018">Finally,
I come to the Minister’s comments. She emphasised that she
thinks the policy is working and that according to her figures rents
are already being driven down as a result. I listened carefully and I
would very much like to see the evidence she has because it runs
contrary to what the noble Lords, Lord Bates and Lord Best, and the
National Landlords Association are saying; it runs contrary to my brief
from Shelter and my experience of the housing market. It may be that
the Department for Work and Pensions has a unique insight and extra
special information denied to the rest of us, but it does not conform
to what I know. Certainly it is the case that so far the CPI cap has
applied for only something like 10 months of the current year. None the
less, for the years thereafter—not next year, but two years
thereafter—it is going to come down to 1%, so there is going to
be an accelerating effect, a depression, on rent levels as a result of
the rent benefit and housing benefit caps arising from the
Government’s policy.</hs_para>

Government are banking absolutely everything on the fact that by
pressing and cutting down on HB, even though only 20% of those in the
market have HB, 
<?notus-xml column=918?>you will reduce the overall level of rents and therefore tenants will
not suffer. There is not a shred of evidence that I have seen or that
has been offered tonight to support that contention. The Minister is
gambling on the lives of children going into bed-and-breakfast
accommodation in the ideological hope that 20% of those in the market
can affect the rents that the other 80% will pay. They will not do it
because landlords do not have to let, and they will not let, except
those who have substandard accommodation that people who do not need
housing benefit will avoid. That is a form of Russian roulette that
none of us should be party to.</hs_para>

does not conform to anything that I am aware of. In the light of that,
I would like to reflect on what she has said and on what evidence she
can send me. I will also reflect on whether what she is saying means
that the Government are continuing adequately to keep under review the

Giddens:</Member></B> My Lords, what a pleasure it is to be able to
introduce this debate. I shall start by saying how I got interested in
anorexia and other eating disorders some while ago. It happened one
Sunday when I got two newspapers—I was feeling flush at the
time—and each had a colour supplement. On the front of one
colour supplement there was a starving black teenager in Africa,
emaciated and on the point of death, suffering from malnutrition. On
the front of the other colour supplement there was a starving white
teenager in the United States who looked identical in terms of her
emaciated frame. It seemed to me that the dynamics of those two things
must be completely different. In the first, there was a person dying
from traditional starvation: not enough food to go around; in the
second, there was someone dying in the middle of probably the first
society in world history where there is far too much food to go
around.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022533000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022533000022">After
that, I started looking fairly intensively at the history of anorexia
and other eating disorders, especially bulimia. It is very interesting
that there is a history. It goes back some way. We do not know the
details, but anorexia seems to have been very uncommon historically and
was mainly associated with fasting to death, especially female saints
who fasted to death in pursuit of the greater glory of God. Bulimia has
some analogues in 
<?notus-xml column=919?>history, but it was not even named until the 20th century.
You can say that anorexia, bulimia and other eating disorders are
essentially, in their mass form anyway, illnesses of our time. They
started to spread rapidly in the 1960s and from beginnings in the
industrial countries they then spread around the
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022533000023">As
everyone knows, anorexia and bulimia are most frequent among teenage
girls, but interestingly there is now a kind of extension through the
lifecycle. There are children as young as seven who are already
suffering from anorexia symptoms and there are cases of women in their
70s suffering from anorexia and bulimia combined. Male eating disorders
have been called the hidden epidemic or silent epidemic. They are not
out in the open to the same degree, although there is stigma associated
with all forms of eating disorder. The latest stats we have on the UK
suggest that one in five children in this country with a serious eating
disorder is male, which is a substantial and seemingly growing
proportion.</hs_para>

physical basis, but this cannot explain the spread of these phenomena.
You find an interesting thing in some parts of the world where, in the
same society, some people are starving to death from classical
starvation in remote regions, and in the affluent cities people are
starving from anorexia. It is a global phenomenon. This cannot be
explained by physical reasons. Why did it

think that it is primarily because of the rise of supermarket culture;
I do not simply mean the rise supermarkets themselves. Once you have
the rise of supermarket culture, you have all forms of food available.
You have to choose what to eat, and there is a sense in which everyone
has to be on a diet, with a barrage of information about their bodies,
their health and so forth. In the case of young women, as we know, they
are also bombarded by images of what a desirable body is like. These
are powerful images. We now see through the advent of the internet very
young children picking up the image of the slim body as the embodiment
of attractiveness. These two things come together and, like many other
aspects of our culture, they develop an addictive, compulsive
character. Anorexia is a compulsive cycle from which there is often no
escape without specific medical and other
help<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:01:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022533000026">In
our society we have a variety of food problems and problems with the
relationship between food and the body. Therefore, anorexia and bulimia
are the tip of the iceberg in terms of what has become normality. In
our society, over 90% of women have been on a diet at some point in
their lives. The figure for men is now over 50%. Interestingly, over
60% of women who have no history of weight problems are on a diet,
which shows how extensive these characteristics are. We are dealing
with a pervasive phenomenon in our society, rooted in a compulsive
relationship to food. There is a sense in which, at the other end of
the continuum, all of us have to wrestle with what to eat and drink in
relation to our
health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:02:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022533000027">Anorexia,

what is the Government’s attitude towards pro-anorexia and
pro-bulimia websites? As the Minister doubtless knows, they
have proliferated in recent times. They are connected with the social

and they do so in a forceful way. The websites themselves can become
addictive. There are many precepts and so forth on these websites, but

Alderdice:</Member></B> My Lords, I express my appreciation for the
noble Lord, Lord Giddens, obtaining this debate. I note that there have
been a number of debates on this issue; there was a debate recently in
Westminster Hall at the other end of the Building. It is something in
which I have been interested for some time. It is almost 30 years since
I first published a paper on anorexia nervosa. At that stage I was of
course interested in the psychological aspects of things: in individual
and family therapy, and cognitive behavioural therapy. The papers I was
publishing were on zinc, trace elements and gastro-intestinal hormones
in anorexia nervosa, trying to see if we could understand a little
better this devastating disturbance and the other associated eating
disorders to which the noble Lord has
referred<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:06:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lord rightly says, these disorders did not appear in the past century.
In fact, the first description of the disorder was in this city by
Doctor Morton in 1689. He described a patient he had treated five years
earlier: a young lady who had a disorder if this kind and died after a
few months. The name itself was described by William Gull in London in
the late 1800s. It is not a recent phenomenon, but it has become much
more pervasive.</hs_para>

looking back over the past 30 and more years is how little has changed
except for the prevalence of the disorder. Most of the ways we have of
understanding and treating these disorders have not changed terribly
much. We have not really come much closer to understanding in an
evidence-based way what we are dealing with. We can see some of
the resultant phenomena. I came to the conclusion with
gastro-intestinal hormones, for example, that most of what we were
seeing, which was not very clear anyway, was probably consequential. It
is clear that when a young person’s—or even an older
person’s—body weight gets down to a certain level, their
capacity to judge their body image changes. They become impervious to
any kind of psychological intervention. It is necessary to get their
body weight up to a certain level. In the case of young women, their
periods start to return and their thinking begins to change. This is
not simply a psychological phenomenon. It is not simply a biological
phenomenon<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:08:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Giddens, has also indicated, there are also sociological aspects to
this, which we can think and postulate about. I guess we do that a lot
in your Lordships’ House. One of the difficulties is trying to
ensure that we have research that takes us forward in understanding
these things in a scientific way. That is one of the reasons why I was
a little disappointed when my honourable friend Tessa Munt
asked of another honourable friend, Paul Burstow, who was
the Minister in February 2012, what the Government’s guidelines
were for the prevention of eating disorders. What targets
exist? What is the departmental budget for the prevention of eating
disorders? The answer was that there are no specific targets in respect
of the prevention of eating disorders. Nor has the department set aside
a specific
budget<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:10:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022533000036">I
find that disappointing because it seems clear to me that after
decades, during which a good deal of research has been done, mostly in
specific areas—people will take a biological approach or a
psychological approach and a few perhaps even will take a sociological
approach, although not very many—it is very difficult to get a
multidisciplinary research project put together without substantial
backing from the Government, a major foundation or whatever. That is
why I am a little disappointed that resourcing does not seem to be
coming forward from the department. I hope that my noble friend the
Minister will be able to say that that is not true and that resourcing
is

Countess of Mar:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the
noble Lord, Lord Giddens, for introducing this topic for debate
tonight. The simple definition of anorexia is a “lack or loss of
appetite for food”. Too often, we hear of awful cases of
anorexia nervosa. I will leave the discussion on that and on bulimia
nervosa to other noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, has given
us a very good grounding in
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022533000039"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:11:46"></hs_TimeCode>Numerous
medical conditions give rise to the loss or lack of appetite for food.
I think immediately of the many people with CFS/ME who are too
exhausted to chew and swallow food and must be tube fed, either nasally
or by a tube connected directly to their stomach. I think, too, of
young girls who have had a bad reaction to the human papilloma
virus—HPV—vaccine and who suffer fatigue, feverishness
and an acute loss of appetite, with the accompanying weight loss. Some
other conditions, including viral infections, hormonal imbalances,
neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumours, have in their initial
stages been labelled as CFS/ME because they present with the extreme
fatigue, pain, digestive problems and other symptoms associated with
that
condition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022533000040">From
the reports that I have had, there are many people with genuine
intolerances to foods and drugs whose symptoms are profound after
eating. The symptoms, which may be diverse, are a reflection of a
disturbance of the autonomic nervous system and may include nausea,
vomiting, bloating, abdominal distension and diarrhoea. Because they
occur after meals, these people try to ascertain which foods cause
their problems and they assume a restricted diet. This can occur after,
for example, gastro-intestinal infection or HPV vaccination. These
people, instead of being respected, as all patients should for their
observations of themselves, often find themselves castigated. They are
wrongly diagnosed as being anorexic, forced into psychiatric facilities
and made to eat those foods that they know have provoked their
symptoms. Historically, the same fate befell people with coeliac
disease until the 1940s, when researchers realised that their symptoms
of diarrhoea and malabsorption were caused by wheat, which was accepted
by the medical profession. Interestingly, during the war, they were
given bananas instead of
bread.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0002.htm#13022533000041">I am
particularly concerned that young people, mostly girls, are wrongly
being diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. Too frequently, their
parents are accused of causing their child’s illness and care
proceedings are initiated. Several youngsters have been
obliged by social services to be confined in mental health units and
are subjected to harsh “treatment” before their medical
consultants realise that they do not have the condition. In other
cases, the young person is blamed for failing to co-operate and not
wanting to get well. I am sure that their prognosis would be much
better if they were treated with more compassion.</hs_para>

friend Lord Giddens for bringing this desperately sad medical condition
to our attention again this evening. While reliable statistics are a
problem at the centre of this debate, and one that I shall return to,
we understand from the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence that 1.6 million people in the UK are affected by an eating
disorder, of which 11% are male, the vast majority being young women.
Hearing and reading about the case studies of some of these young
sufferers is a sobering experience. The self-loathing, hugely distorted
body image and seeking after some control—any
control—over their bodies, is enough to make one ashamed of the
societal pressure that we have put on these mainly young people. The
cycle of bingeing as a self-punishment for not losing enough weight, as
they see it, is often accompanied by self-harming and, in extreme
cases, a spiral into sectioning and force-feeding. Children, parents
and the whole family are affected as the young person tries every
device possible to starve themselves. Trust is replaced by fear and
worry.</hs_para>

we ask ourselves, should a significant proportion of our young people

through advertising and the media to attain someone else’s idea
of the perfect body? Is it the connections made by society between
thinness, worth and value? Is bullying on the internet exacerbating the
problem, and does the easy access to internet pornography reinforce a
falsehood about the way young people, especially young women, should
look? We should do all we can to reinforce young people’s
confidence and sense of their worth. In a time of austerity, we should

conclusion, there is at present a lack of data detailing the number of
people in the UK suffering from an eating disorder. Although the
Department of Health provides hospital episode statistics, they include
only those affected by eating disorders who are in-patients being given
NHS treatment. Those figures leave out those being treated in the
community, as out-patients and privately, and those who have not been
specifically diagnosed with an eating disorder. Could the Minister
ensure that the Department of Health conducts reliable surveys to
provide us with accurate statistics in future? This condition can
blight a young person’s life for years and years and, in

recovery, it is vital that there should be early interventions, which
must be the right ones—not just any intervention. In too many

for action. Time does not permit me to go into those tonight, but I
specifically ask the noble Earl to address one of them. It asks the NHS
to spend at least £300 million over the next three years to
tackle the serious problem of the shortage of weight management
programmes so that more patients can be helped in a supportive and
sensitive manner. Since reading this, it is difficult to find the

prompted by the prospect of this debate, I went to visit an outfit in
south London called Discovery. It is an organisation in the private

service: contracts with the NHS to provide direct weight management
programmes for individuals who are obese and in real trouble; and
training for people in the NHS and related bodies who are endeavouring
to start weight management programmes for those who are classed as
obese. Discovery tells me that it is extraordinarily fearful about what
the future holds for it under the changed arrangements set out in 
<?notus-xml column=927?>the Health and Social Care Act, which comes into force on 1 April. It
says that the PCTs, which previously provided funding and contracts,
are now disappearing. The contracts are also disappearing and not being
renewed anywhere. Many weight management providers are facing the
possibility that, although we have this growth in obesity, unless
something happens in April, they may well go out of business later in
the year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T20:31:46"></hs_TimeCode>. This

has the potential, with funding from the Department of Health and the
Comic Relief fund, to reach 29 million members of the public with its
vital messages on mental health. As is so often the case, it is the
courage of individuals as evidenced recently in a debate in Westminster
Hall in which Mr Brooks Newmark spoke. Events like that do
much to challenge stigma and secrecy, and I think the honourable Member

eating disorders. The fact is that they are not simply the preserve of
teenage girls. Male sufferers are growing in number, and I shall have

them. If this amendment does not achieve that objective, I hope that
the Minister will at the very minimum say that the Government will
bring forward on Report an amendment which does. This Bill cannot be
used to change the eligibility criteria, but it can be used to prevent
sequestration of vehicles.</hs_para>

“prescribed” means prescribed by regulations and Section
94 explains that these regulations have to be set out in a statutory
instrument. The Government have committed that PIP will be linked to
inflation. As the regulations setting the rate of PIP, the Social
Security (Personal Independence Payment) Regulations 2013, agreed by
the House on 13 February, do not make any reference—as we heard

disabled people’s financial independence: 60% reported that they

significantly increases the degree of choice and control that customers
have over their lives. Their average ranking of the extent of choice

Grey-Thompson:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Alton of
Liverpool has very clearly explained the amendment to which my name is
also attached. I declare an interest in that I am in receipt of
disability living allowance, but I do not have a Motability car. I have
used the scheme in the past when I was first able to drive, because it
was the only realistic and economical way that I could have become
mobile.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13022533000113" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0003.htm#13022533000113">At
the briefing that was held on the PIP regulations on 22 January 2013
with the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Freud, and the Minister in
another place, Esther McVey, it was my understanding that the timescale
for someone having to return their car if they were no longer eligible
for PIP could be relatively short, perhaps just a matter of a few
weeks. At the briefing, the noble Lord, Lord Sterling, the chairman of
Motability, expressed a strong wish to do as much as possible to help
people. However, I do not believe that Motability has too much room for
manoeuvre</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000114" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0003.htm#13022533000114">I
will not relive the debate around the 20 to 50 metres issue—I am
sure your Lordships’ Chamber has heard enough from me on that
matter. However, my concern is for those who have very expensive
adaptations, which are what they require in order to drive—they
could be left without an adequate method of getting around—and
for people who live in an area where public transport is not terribly
accessible. The short timescale between notifying someone of their car
being removed and it being taken away could make life extremely
difficult. Without some further protection, it could lead to chaos for
many disabled people.</hs_para>

there is perhaps not a lot of sympathy for some people in receipt of
DLA. In the media, they are often referred to as people with a
“free car”. The <I>Daily Mail</I> just today ran a
cartoon which trivialised those who claim DLA, and compared a disabled
person who was eligible for DLA to someone who had a blister on their
foot. DLA helps a disabled person with the additional costs of
disability—transport being significant—and the individual
in many cases also has to pay a deposit to access the Motability
scheme. If a disabled person was notified that their car was being
removed, the amount of unused deposit would be paid back to the
individual, but this could quickly be used to pay for extra costs such
as taxis. As a comparison, the journey from King’s Cross to
Westminster by tube is relatively easy and costs a few pounds. That is
easy enough for someone who is not disabled, but if you are a
wheelchair user, it costs £17 in a taxi—or
that is what I paid today. It would be easy to see how quickly the
money returned from a deposit could be
spent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000116" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0003.htm#13022533000116">If at a
later stage, on appeal, it turns out that the person did
indeed qualify for the appropriate level of support, then a
new deposit would have to be found, ahead of the budgeted
date, and they may not have that money available. A new car would have
to be found and adapted, and the process therefore starts again. Of
course, we do not know what the potential success rate at appeal is at
the moment, but if people have at least the guarantee of running
through to the end of their contract for a Motability car, this would
give many a more adequate time to make other
provision</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000117" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0003.htm#13022533000117">I
have heard many people say, “Well, disabled people should just
use public transport like many others”. I do not disagree with
that. Public transport is okay but, in many cases, is not much better
than that. London is perhaps one of the best cities in the country for
disabled provision, and I declare that I am a board member of Transport
for London. However, “patchy” is the best word that I can
use to describe transport outside London.</hs_para>

noble friend Lord Alton talks about spontaneity. He is absolutely
right. Motability cars are essential for spontaneous trips as well as
for getting to work or hospital, and for taking your children to
school. As a wheelchair user, I have to book train travel 24 hours in
advance; trains have only a couple of wheelchair spaces. I am always
grateful if there is an accessible toilet on board, but the situation
is not great if you are going from London to Darlington. It is not easy
for disabled people spontaneously to travel by public transport. I know
of at least one ongoing court case around disability access to public
transport and I was informed this morning of one major bus company
whose wheelchair spaces do not give priority to wheelchair users. There
is so much work that needs to be done in this area.</hs_para>

Low of Dalston:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very surprised to see the
need for this amendment. Usually, when benefit changes are introduced,
it is standard practice not to take them away from those who are
currently in receipt of them. If the Government go ahead with the
provisions in the way that is currently envisaged, it is clear that
they will effectively be depriving people of a benefit which they
currently enjoy, because what is a Motability car if not a benefit? It
is every bit as valuable as a cash benefit and I find it difficult to

benefits which they currently enjoy.</hs_para>

missed the first couple of minutes of the speech by the noble Lord,
Lord Alton. I do not know whether he referred to the numbers but he
cited the figures given by the noble Lord, Lord Freud: that in a steady
state the number of disabled people with mobility difficulties in
receipt of personal independence payment will reduce from about
1,000,000 to 600,000. I am given to understand that of those, it is
estimated that 27% might have a Motability car. I believe this equates
to about 200 Motability cars per constituency. That is a large number
of people who are likely to be beating a path to their MP’s
surgery with a very real grievance. I hope that the Government will
take that into their calculations when considering whether to press

would be very surprised if there was not widespread sympathy for this

magic words “safely”, “reliably” and so on,
while the other allegedly clarified 
<?notus-xml column=940?>what was meant by “virtually unable to walk” by confining

of these on the issue of 20 to 50 metres, assuring us that it made no
difference in practice. When they were pressed on the statistics,
however, the “no difference in practice” turned out to be
a very real difference. Although the noble Lord, Lord Freud, suggested
that of the 1 million, 600,000 would retain it and 400,000 would lose
it, that was not the complete figure because 200,000 people who are
currently on the lower-rate mobility allowance—needing
psychological supervision and so on—would move up into the
higher group, so there was a net loss of 400,000 but a gross loss of
600,000 people in higher-rate DLA who would now lose it, although to
some extent that would be compensated for by the further 200,000 coming
in from the lower group. Still, the gross figure is something like
600,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T21:21:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000127" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0003.htm#13022533000127">Like
the noble Lord, Lord Alton, I am delighted to acknowledge that I am
drawing on the Oxford Economics report that came out in December 2010,
which is full of very valuable figures on this. We know from that
report that about 28% of people on higher-rate DLA turn that mobility
component into a Motability car. There are currently around 543,000
people driving a Motability car on the basis of three-year leases, and
around 185,000 new cars are bought each year by Motability. It is the
largest purchaser of new cars in the country, accounting for about 10%
of them. This will have serious ramifications for jobs and the car
industry, which Motability does so much to
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T21:22:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0003.htm#13022533000128">However,
I am not even going to argue about that. I am arguing on behalf of what
Motability does for people’s independence. I remember being
struck many years ago, back in the late 1990s when I first met the
noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, by what she said about the Independent
Living Foundation. She said, and for me this was a mind-changing
moment, that the ILF, which gave people what we now call personal
budgets—generous, or at least adequately generous, sums of money
to enable them to employ their own carers and so on—put that
disabled person at the centre of the care system, not as a recipient at
the end of that system, so that people could determine what time they
went to bed and so on. The same is true of a Motability car; it puts
the person who is enabled to drive it at the centre of their mobility,
not dependent on the charity, good will, altruism, convenience and so
on of other people. Of those people who have a Motability car,
something like 76% of them drive it themselves, so it becomes their
means of movement. The result of that is that it frees not only them to
be mobile but their informal carer as well, because without that
transport they are totally dependent on someone else to take them to
places where they need to go. As one person quoted in the Oxford
Economics study said, if they are housebound—that is, without
that car—it makes their informal carers housebound too. Removing
the car locks two parties into immobility.</hs_para>

report goes on to show us how effective the Motability car has been in
enlarging the horizons of people’s lives. It shows that, for
example, most of the recipients had cars in the past that they could no
longer use by virtue of their arthritis or their heart problems.
Whereas before their disability two-thirds of the recipients of cars
were in work, subsequently only 16% were able to hold down paid
employment. The Motability car helped 12,500 of them get a job and
56,000 to keep their job. It was crucial for those who need specially
adapted cars that they could not provide for themselves or for people
in rural areas, such as my county of Norfolk where, frankly, public
transport is non-existent and a complete myth. That car took some of
them—16%—to work; it took younger ones into education and
training, allowing them, in due course, to get work; it took them to
their medical appointments, the shops, their children’s schools
and to see their families. It allowed them, as one of them said, to
access life. This is what the Government are apparently proposing to
take
away.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0003.htm#13022533000130">We
all accept that people’s disability needs can diminish over
time, or may increase over time, but for the most part, those who have
reached the threshold of higher-rate DLA continue to have very real and
substantial mobility problems wherever that line is be drawn, whether
at 20 metres or 50 metres. Therefore, like the noble Lord, Lord Alton,
I urge the Government before Report to hold discussions with the noble
Lords, Lord Sterling and Lord Alton, and the noble Baroness, Lady
Grey-Thompson, and come up with a way forward on this. We have to have
a transitional period—a period of grace—on this, either
to the end of the lease or for a two-year period, whichever comes last,
which would, at the very least, allow adequate time for the appeals
procedure to go through without people losing a car in the mean time
and then having to go through the routine that the noble Lord, Lord
Alton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, described to regain
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000131" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0003.htm#13022533000131">We had a
similar discussion with the noble Lord, Lord Freud, about adapted
houses. At one stage, if people were underoccupying a house that had
had £20,000 spent on adapting it, they were to move from there,
go somewhere smaller and have all the adaptation put in again, but good
sense prevailed. The Minister agreed that where such money had been
invested it was wise for those people to be allowed to stay. That
argument makes sense for the home, and it makes sense for the agency of
mobility which is the Motability car. That transitional period of
grace, whether it is to the end of the lease or for a two-year period,
whichever comes last, would prevent the awful situation of cars being
taken back in and piled up in scrapyards because nobody would will that
supply of used cars on the market when there will not be the purchasing
power to buy them. We would not see Ford and the rest of them finding
that they suddenly had closed order books, and we would not see people
losing their cars, appealing, regaining them and having to go through
all the trauma of these arrangements.</hs_para>

setting out our position. We certainly support the thrust of this

that there needs to be consultation between the Secretary of State and
Motability. The precise formulation of proposed new subsection (2) of
the amendment needs careful consideration of the idea of benefits being
on an individual basis rather than more generally, but I do
not think that particularly concerns the noble Lord, Lord Alton. I

access to work would be substituted for in some way. The
Minister’s response at that time was that it was under
consideration. Having thought about that, if access to work can be a
means of providing support, it would deal with only one of the reasons

arguments in favour and understanding of the importance of

That is something which the Government should

the Government have failed to allay the alarm about access to the
enhanced mobility rate of PIP, given the new 20-metre walking criteria.
Although we know that it is the Government’s position that, as a
practical matter, they do not believe that it makes a difference, that
is not how it is seen by people currently in

their life would be diminished. It is not only a question of the
individual’s quality of life. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, cited
a number of figures about the savings to society—the costs that
society does not have to incur because of these arrangements and the
freedom they give to people who would otherwise potentially remain
isolated and not be able to live so

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to all noble
Lords who have contributed to this debate. In responding, first, I will
address the points that I have put under the heading of
“uprating” and then come to issues linked specifically to
Motability and PIP. I want to make it clear, as I think the noble Lord,
Lord Alton, acknowledged, that this Bill, which is about capping the
annual increases of certain benefits to 1%, does not include DLA or
personal independence payments. It is really important that that is
properly understood by everyone when we are discussing this
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T21:35:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13022533000141" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225-0003.htm#13022533000141">If
I understood the noble Lord, Lord Alton, correctly, having acknowledged
that PIP is not part of this Bill, his amendment would seek to require
the Secretary of State to consult Motability every year before he sets
the annual rate of increase on PIP. However, I do not think that that
is necessary. As I have said, PIP is excluded from this Bill and would
be subject to a CPI increase. If there were any shortfall in the
benefits over the course of a three-year lease and if the PIP annual
uprating was to affect the level of benefit that a person was due to
receive, any change in the rate of the enhanced mobility component
would not impact on a claimant with a Motability lease directly because
that would be borne by Motability as part of the risk to it of
operating the
lease<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T21:37:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

with Motability for more than 30 years and, as I understand it, thus
far we have never required protection for Motability leaseholders in
the way that the amendment suggests. As noble Lords are well aware, the
Motability lease is a private agreement between the claimant and
Motability. It is entered into without any influence from the
department. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, said, just under
one-third of eligible claimants uses
Motability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-25T21:38:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

absolutely understand the points made in this debate about how those
who take advantage of the Motability scheme value the vehicle provided.
Therefore, it is essential that Motability remains available to those
deemed eligible to receive it. Sometimes, as regards the way in which
noble Lords talk about the changes that are being made, the impression
could be given that the Motability scheme is coming to an end for
everyone. We absolutely understand the importance of Motability. It is
an important scheme and people must continue to have access to it,
albeit that fewer numbers will have access than up to
now.</hs_para>

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> This is the Committee stage, not
Report. The Minister said that we were suggesting in the way we talked
about the numbers that this was in some sense a catastrophic
activity—that the Motability scheme might come to a close, and
so on. But on the figures that she has more or less confirmed for us,
something like 600,000 people currently getting a higher rate of DLA
will not get the enhanced rate of PIP. Just under 30% of all those on
higher rate DLA turn that into a vehicle; that is just under one-third.
So of the 600,000 people who lose the benefit, something like 185,000
or thereabouts of people who currently have a car will lose their car.

face is that we are all debating in the dark, because the Government
have not been able to provide figures to tell us how many people are
likely to lose Motability. It would be extremely helpful for us to know
that. Perhaps the noble Baroness could also confirm that in this
year’s annual report Motability said that about
£17 million was given by way of government aid, and
that the Government will support the scheme by about the same amount
during the next 12-month period. By what amount will it be reduced in

purchasing, all the evidence suggests that a Motability car in effect
acquires through its VAT exemptions and tax exemptions something like a
40% discount on what it would cost to hire a similar car in the private
market, and that is before any adaptations. Given the level of income
of disabled people and the poverty that we know so many of them face by
being out of the labour market and having the additional costs of

the noble Lord, Lord Low, and, above all, the noble Lord, Lord Alton:
that what is needed, at the very least, is a decent transitional period

that the noble Baroness has offered is the existing 28 days. That
applies now, so there is no change. What movement, if any, is the
Minister willing to offer us on the key point about having a
transitional period of grace for those who will lose? Some 100,000
people—or 185,000, which is my crude estimate—could lose
their cars in a relatively small space of

Minister is quite right that this would not be the ideal vehicle; it is
not the ideal amendment. No pun is intended. But you have to take what
you can in parliamentary life and this is the only Bill that is before
Parliament at the present time that is capable of amendment on this
crucial issue. I felt that it was incredibly unsatisfactory when we
debated this issue last, when it was lumped in with a number of other
unamendable regulations that we took one after another. As the noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie, rightly said, this is not an issue that has been
given sufficient attention in either House during the progress of all
the Bills and regulations that have been proceeding, yet it is one that
causes great anxiety outside your Lordships’ House. If the
estimate that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, has given is
correct—that 185,000 vehicles could be affected—that
should give us all pause for thought. We should all stop and think
about the implications for the owners and users of those vehicles. It
will place limitations on their freedom of travel and their ability to
get to work, schools, health appointments, shops, engage in social
life, and all the other issues that have been raised during the

the country and who is held in such high esteem here in your

unable to confirm whether the £17 million mentioned in the
annual report of Motability will be the figure for the following years.

figures are. That will give us some idea of where the balance of
responsibility then truly lies. Obviously, we cannot make a silk purse

only will there be no resources made available if this position
continues to apply but there will be no plans to fast-track appeals

testing may be carried out on an informed consent basis, and presently,

“written, objective, evidence-guided information is available
for women considering abortion to take away before the procedure.
Information should be available in a variety of languages and
formats”. It also says that services should identify issues
which make women particularly vulnerable including violence or abuse,
in particular girls under the age of 16 should be given “the
chance to disclose during a private moment when a parent or adult is
not present”. In practice, most abortion services have a policy
that all women should be seen on their own at some stage, without a
partner or family member present, to ensure there is no coercion or

to establish with certainty how and where illegal immigrants evade our
controls but we have observed that those who seek to enter the UK
illegally tend to do so either with the use of forged documentation or
clandestinely, often by targeting channel ports. However, we have tough
measures in place to combat these risks, which involve the border force
working closely with our French and Belgian partners in order to detect
and disrupt individuals seeking to evade border checks in northern
France and Belgium. Other preventive measures include research 
<?notus-xml column=188?>and analysis of migration trends, debriefing of illegal migrants in the

Effective Provision of Pre-school Education (EPPE) study found that
pre-school attendance improved the all round development of children
when they entered primary school compared to “home”
children with no pre-school experience and the benefit to children from
disadvantaged homes is the greatest. High quality provision has a
positive and lasting impact on child outcomes, which is why the
Government are providing significant investment in high quality early
years. On 29 January, the Government published More Great

Government following the consultation on “an early access to
medicines scheme in the United Kingdom” and the Government
expect to make an announcement as soon as these discussions have
concluded. As outlined in the consultation, the Government have
considered carefully the stage of development at which new medicines
might be considered and proposed that the scheme could focus initially
on widening access to particularly promising medicines, with a clear
positive benefit/risk balance, between the end of phase III trials and
licensing. This could avoid any potential difficulties of recruiting
patients into clinical trials if these were still ongoing in the UK.
The Government have not ruled out a review at an earlier stage (for
example based on phase II data) in exceptional circumstances where the
information available merits it. The scheme could therefore provide an
early access opinion on a new medicine around a year before the
regulatory process delivers a marketing
authorisation.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question">

places of worship in Kenya’s North East Province in recent
months. This is part of a wider increase in terrorist attacks by
domestic and

these attacks are linked to Kenya’s military intervention in
Somalia and that the risk is unlikely to diminish in the immediate

Currently, a person receiving certain passporting benefits may have up
to £16,000 disposable capital but is automatically deemed
eligible for civil legal aid on both income and capital. However, a
person who does not receive these passporting benefits and who has more
than £8,000 in disposable capital is ineligible for civil legal
aid. The Government believe that this is inequitable and intend that
all applicants should be subject to the same disposable capital test.
This will mean that any applicant who has disposable capital above
£8,000 will be ineligible for legal

by the inspector during the examination, as well as making minor

The agenda should build on the successes of the MDGs and retain the
focus on ending poverty), doing so through sustainable development. It
should be updated to reflect the changes in the world since the MDGs
were agreed, and promote the prerequisites for people to escape poverty
(the absence of conflict, effective institutions, the rule of law,
transparency and accountability, an enabling environment for economic
growth) and sustainable use of natural

Howe:</Member> A condition of signing up to the responsibility deal and
its pledges is that businesses will report annually on progress against
their delivery plans for each of the pledges they are signed up to.
Partner delivery plans and annual updates for all Public Health
Responsibility Deal pledges are published on the responsibility deal
website. This enables transparency of reporting progress against plan.
If a business failed to deliver on its pledge then the reasons should
be given in the annual update. If a business were no longer able to
deliver its pledge, we would expect the business to withdraw from it.
Annual updates for 2012-13 are due to be published on the

any nicotine-containing product (NCP) which claims or implies that it
can treat nicotine addiction is considered to be a medicinal product.

Directive (2011/92/EU), transposed nationally by legislation on

permitting. Applications or proposals may engage public consultation
duties under this legislation. We do not believe that there are
currently any environmental issues relating to the Court judgment which
engage these duties, over and above issues on which previous
consultations have taken
place.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13022514001960" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130225w0003.htm#13022514001960">Wildlife:
