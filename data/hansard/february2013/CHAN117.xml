important that we reach out to women to help to increase participation
even further. I have already cited the dramatic impact that hosting the
Olympics and Paralympics has had in raising participation among women.
Some sports have had a particularly successful track record in this
area. Netball is one of the fastest growing women’s sports in
the country, with participation having increased from 110,000 in 2005
to 158,000 last year. There are also examples in cycling and hockey.
There is some good success, but we need to make sure that it is echoed
in other areas

enough. We have had too many warm words and too much waffle from
Ministers on this subject. It is no good saying that schools are free
to teach about sexual consent. All schools should be teaching our
children and young people not to harm each other and to have respect
for themselves. They should be teaching them that sexual violence is
not normal. The Department for Education has blocked for three years
any movement on legislation to introduce compulsory sex and
relationship education with zero tolerance of violence in schools. It
has been looking at it for three years and has done nothing. It must
act. Will the Minister now support that action and our debate today on

providing the House with very regular reports on the adulteration of

it is not possible to give a running commentary on active
investigations. Therefore, for operational reasons, we were unable to
inform the House of the Food Standards Agency’s plan to enter
the two meat premises in west Wales and west Yorkshire earlier this
week. As part of its audit of all horse abattoirs in the UK and the
ongoing investigation into the adulteration of meat products, the FSA
gathered intelligence that led to it and the police entering the two
meat premises and seizing horsemeat. The FSA also seized all paperwork
from the two companies and is investigating customer lists. The FSA
suspended activities at both plants
immediately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T10:35:20"></hs_TimeCode>. The

am glad that the FSA is investigating the concerns about horsemeat
entering the food chain that I first raised with Ministers last month.
Action must be taken to deal with any criminals whose activities have
so badly damaged consumer confidence in the UK food industry. I raised
the problem of bute-contaminated horsemeat being released into the
human food chain with the Minister at Department for Environment, Food
and 
<?notus-xml column=1048?>Rural Affairs questions last month. What action did he take with the FSA
to reassure himself after I raised those concerns? Was he aware of bute
contamination before that day? Will he explain why, up until four days
ago, all horses were being tested for bute in this country but were
still being released for human consumption? I am astonished to hear
that a further three could have entered the food chain in France, given
that I raised this issue with him last month. That is astonishing. We
were in the middle of a horsemeat adulteration scandal; this is just
catastrophic complacency from him.</hs_Para>

the UK for human consumption abroad last year, we must make sure that
horsemeat intended for humans is not contaminated with bute—it
really is as simple as that. So why did the Minister not act
immediately when I raised this issue three weeks ago in this House? Why
did he not order full testing, and order that horses should be released
only when clear from bute, the moment I raised this with him? We need
to know whether the horsemeat entering the UK in these adulterated

We hear from the media that they went to 16 countries, so why have they
been withdrawn in only six countries—Britain, Ireland, France,
Sweden, Switzerland and Norway? What has happened to the products in

behaviour that has ever been conducted

Secretary of State. He instigated the meeting of Farming Ministers of

co-ordinating role, brought forward the labelling of ingredients for
products as an emergency item within the EU, exchanged data at a speed
that was never done under the Government whom the hon. Lady supported,
brought forward an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee on the
Food Chain and Animal Health to consider probable thresholds, and got
the matter on the agenda for Council on 25 February. That is a quite

one batch have come back negative, but of course there is an awful lot
more horsemeat in circulation, some sourced in the UK and some sourced
elsewhere. My concern, which I put directly to the Minister, stems from
the very good report published by the Environment, Food and Rural

it adequate? Will the Minister give the House an assurance that there

be confident in the integrity of their supply chains. We will do
everything we can to provide regulatory support for that, so that cases
in which they are defrauded are brought to light. The crux is that they

Backbench Business Committee to schedule a debate this afternoon on
violence against women and girls. The campaign states that three

year, and that one third of girls in relationships aged between 13 and

three women will be beaten or raped in her lifetime. Today’s

and the EU’s determination to seek free trade agreements.
Today’s agreement to commence EU-US free trade discussions is
only one part of the EU’s ambitious agenda. That is absolutely

precisely that. The Minister agrees that we must make sure food
labelling delivers to consumers the information they need. As I know
from my experience, we are making good progress in respect of the
nutritional content of food and helping people to construct a good
diet, but the provenance, origin and composition of foods must also be
made very clear. My ministerial colleagues have reported to the House
on that, and I know they will find further opportunities to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000377" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0002.htm#13021465000377"><B><Member PimsId="-1" UID="13021465001372" xid="-1" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0002.htm#13021465001372">Several

significant deviation from the standardised mortality data and too high
a level of apparent mortality is recorded that is an indicator that

the point of view of the Department and the Care Quality Commission,

contamination is breathtaking. This is a European crisis

chose this subject for debate because activists in the One Billion
Rising campaign around the country have been running workshops about
what would make the most difference in addressing domestic violence.
Over the course of history, quite a lot of things have been done in
that regard. We have better prosecution rates, IDVAs—independent
domestic violence advisers—and refuges to help victims of
domestic violence. However, the workshops concluded that the most
important thing to do is make the next generation safe, and that the
shortfall in our response to such violence is caused by a lack
of education to prevent it. That has led to a situation where one in
three women will experience violence in her lifetime, and that is
unacceptable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T12:27:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000457" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0002.htm#13021465000457">Others
have reached the same view. Although the recent cross-party inquiry
into unwanted pregnancies focused on preventing teenage pregnancy, it
also argued the importance of teaching young people in
school to make informed choices and to resist being coerced
through peer pressure into sex or risky sexual behaviour. The Schools
Safe 4 Girls campaign, which was launched by the End Violence Against
Women Coalition last autumn, echoes that message. Almost every Select

not report it, because they are not taught in schools about
relationships and the importance of consent. The interim
findings of the exploitation inquiry undertaken by the
Office of the Children’s Commissioner and the university

I have said, I used to be a teacher and a teacher educator in the days
when things were much worse. I remember a teacher education resource
about computers in education. In those days, computers were rather new
in the classroom and the resource stated how the boys would be really
excited about them and how the girls’ ribs would be bruised as
the boys pushed past them to get to the computers because they enjoyed
the lesson so much. That was a resource for people learning to teach.
It indicated a tolerance of violence in the classroom that is utterly

can change things. Some of it is successful and some of it is very bad.
Ofsted’s report says that about three quarters of the lessons
observed were good and about a quarter were poor. Of the good lessons,
Ofsted noticed that the bit that was not so good was relationships
education. I think that we have created an education system that
focuses far too much on the mechanics of sex and not sufficiently on
autonomy, the right to say no, positive relationships and empowering
young women in that

consent. Only 6% of respondents said that they got the information on
relationships that they needed in PSHE. It points out that good quality
PSHE teaching not only helps to raise young people’s awareness
of abuse, but supports those who experience abuse to develop practical
strategies and skills to stop it, and that it challenges prevailing
negative attitudes towards women and
girls<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T12:39:17"></hs_TimeCode>. We know

was interested to read an attitude to violence survey conducted among
young people in Wiltshire in 2009—the latest research that I
could find—in which a quarter of the children surveyed said that
they thought that violence was okay in some or all cases. They thought
that it was particularly okay in relationships, for example if somebody
found out that their partner was cheating on them. I find that
shocking. I find it particularly shocking that one in five young girls
agreed with that statement. I also noted that 56% of the young people
questioned said that they had witnessed domestic violence. Although
some of the methodology was a little suspect—the categories
included “parents checking up on my movements”—the

internet service providers to a point where they will all introduce
filters that provide protection on all devices in the home by the end

centre, including follow-on psychosocial support, in the belief,
supported by evidence, that if victims feel supported they are more
likely to have confidence and therefore continue with
the criminal justice process. There are concerns, however, that
changes as part of the restructuring of the NHS in April 2013, and
changes in police funding in 2015, will result in deficit funding and
the fragmentation of services that are currently offered at St
Mary’s. Without those services, an 80-year-old woman would not
be able to talk about the abuse that she has kept secret for years, and
children who have been sexually exploited would not get the support
that they need to feel confident enough to be a witness against their
abuser in court. I would be grateful if the Minister could look

course it would be better if children never had to be referred to St
Mary’s, as the team there would agree, but that means that we
need much earlier intervention in children’s lives. I have
talked to the team working with sexually exploited children referred by
the police as the result of an investigation, and they told me that
children were sometimes reluctant to talk to them as they did not
initially see themselves as sexually exploited. It is horrifying that
many sexually exploited children are subjected to intimidation,
coercion, blackmail and threats of violence, but it is equally shocking
that others think their abuser cares about

understand what we need to put in place to prevent violence and the
abuse of children, we need to understand the long, sad journey of some
children to becoming victims of sexual exploitation. They are often the
type of neglected children about whom Action for Children talked in its
recent report—children who feel so alone and so lacking in
self-esteem that they welcome any attention, and who have no
understanding of what a caring relationship is about because they have
never seen one. Often, such children never reach the threshold for
intervention by any services, so their neglect goes undetected. We can
see why they are vulnerable to sexual grooming and how important it is
to identify vulnerable children in their early
childhood<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T12:54:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

early detection of children who are

the moment, the model that we have means that children have to reach a
certain threshold to be referred to services, and that threshold is
often reached far too late in a child’s life. The sharing of
data across all agencies would enable a vulnerable child to be
identified much earlier. The question would then be not whether their
need was great enough to access services but what would be the most
appropriate intervention that we could make to help

pornography on young men who commit sexual and relationship violence.
I was also concerned to read in a report by the chief

combat sexual offending by children because they miss warning signs.

They do not want to hear anyone who does not agree with them. One could
be forgiven for thinking that the perpetrators of all these crimes were
men and not often women, but again, that is not true. There are many
female perpetrators of violence against both women and men, and
according to official Ministry of Justice figures, the most common
offence group for which both males and females were arrested during a
five-year period was violence against the person—34% of females
and 31% of males arrested in 2010-11 were arrested for violence against
the person. Again, that is not restricted to women but applies also to
girls. In 2010-11, violence against the person was the most common

end violence against women and girls, but—unlike some others, it
seems—I want to end all violence. I do not take the view that
violence against women and girls is somehow worse than violence against
men and boys. As far as I am concerned, all violence is unacceptable
and all violence against the person should be punished by law. We
should not try to segregate men and women in the criminal justice
system. Both men and women are victims, and both are perpetrators of
crime. I believe in true equality and want people to be treated equally
when they are a victim of crime and when they are a perpetrator of
crime. At the moment, whether people like it or not, men are treated
more harshly than women in the criminal justice system, certainly when
it comes to sentencing. That is an inconvenient truth for many

real terms, three or four children in every classroom experience
domestic violence. Humberside police respond to some 55 incidents of
domestic violence every month, and 81% of victims are female. Children
who live with domestic violence have an increased risk of behavioural
problems and emotional trauma. Mental health difficulties will
definitely arise in their adult lives as a result of their
experiences.</hs_Para>

motivated only by the need to control women. It is bullying, and the
most grotesque abuse towards women. Female genital mutilation has been
a criminal offence since 1985. It is shocking that we have not yet seen
a single prosecution. We have seen some positive steps in recent weeks
and months, with the Crown Prosecution Service refocusing on this area,
and I welcome the publication of its action plan. However, to eradicate
this practice we need cross-departmental work involving the Home
Office, Department for Education, Department of Health and the Foreign

to challenge the stereotypes in the press and media and to teach both

need these statutory provisions to make personal, social and health

murder her was charged with those nine counts of rape, and four counts

judges and magistrates should take account of previous offences as
serious acts of aggravation. Raping, like stalking, is characteristic
of obsessive behaviour that is likely to escalate if it is not stopped

just words on a piece of paper; it has genuine heart and intent behind
it, and I hope it will lead to real progress. The all-party group on
female genital mutilation has had some very productive meetings with
Ofsted over the past year or so. It has seized on this subject, and has
agreed to ask specific safeguarding questions around FGM when visiting
schools that have girls from identified at-risk communities. That will
also drive change.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Walthamstow (Stella Creasy) has very passionately
brought to our attention the One Billion Rising campaign. She and I
have debated that campaign, because as a result of my experiences in
addressing FGM, I have become a little jaundiced about the possibility
of changing things solely through education. Over the almost 25 years
that FGM has been illegal in this country, there have been almost no
referrals through the education system. In fact, it is quite difficult
to get people working in education to talk about FGM issues. At the
recent Home Office roundtable, a senior local government leader in
London admitted that when she trained the teachers in her local
authority about how to deal with FGM in schools, many of them
point-blank refused to teach that it was a crime, saying that that
would infringe on some people’s cultural values. That is
absolutely not on. As a result, particularly in respect of FGM, I am
cautious as to whether we can rely solely on education. We must instead
have a multi-agency approach and massive cultural
education<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:54:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000625" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0002.htm#13021465000625">I
will support the motion, of course, but we must not give the message to
the people who are listening so intently to this debate that we think
the One Billion Rising campaign is the only answer, because we know
there is so much more to do. It might be part of the answer, but I know
the Minister will talk about some of the other things that are going
on, too, and we must make it clear that it is not a silver bullet and
that there are lots of other steps we need to take—many of which

Dutch health passport on FGM and in less than a year—this must

the statement against FGM, into use in the UK. I have spoken to FGM

they say to extended family members, “You’re not going to
do to my little sister what you did to me, and here’s something
that will tell you what the consequences are if you do.” The

hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Claire Perry) referred to cases
involving two of my constituents. One was the tragic case of Chevonea
Kendall-Bryan. She died in terrible circumstances, with lots of
dreadful sexting and other things circulating about her. It was a
dreadful incident. The other incident my hon. Friend mentioned involved
a little girl who, for obvious reasons, 
<?notus-xml column=1107?>I will not name. I spoke to her mother this morning. She re-emphasised
that the problem of sexual texting and imagery going around in schools
is horrendously widespread. I return to an earlier point: what do we do
if we cannot stop it happening even in school, and right under the nose
of teachers? This little 12-year-old girl was physically penetrated by
a 12-year-old boy with his fingers in class under the nose of the
teacher. We have got to get a grip on what is happening right now. It
is not just about education; it is about stopping crimes being
committed in
class.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000629" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0002.htm#13021465000629"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:57:13"></hs_TimeCode>Most—although

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:57:47"></hs_TimeCode> mother of
that 12-year-old girl said to me that some of the other girls in class
were jealous of her daughter because they thought she had been singled
out for sexual attention. If I were to send just one message out to
these girls, it would be this: “Please stand together. It is not
cool. It is absolutely dreadful. Make sure you don’t speak to
those boys or have anything to do with them if they do this to your

One Billion Rising campaign reminds us that one in three women will be
raped or beaten in their lifetime. Today’s debate gives us an
opportunity to commend the women and men who in so many different ways

the victims of sexual violence or to change laws, attitudes, customs

a day when so many people around the world are celebrating loving
relationships, it is important to highlight the extent to which
violence against women and girls blights our individual and collective
lives and to acknowledge the systemic nature of violence against women.
It affects all of us, directly or indirectly, whatever our age,
nationality and religion. I am sure all of us will have experienced
gender-based violence or will know a friend, sister, mother, aunt or
work colleague who has experienced
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:59:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000633" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000633">It
is also important not to be overwhelmed by the dimensions of the
problem and the scale of the challenge of ending the culture of
violence. Some 20 or 30 years ago domestic abuse was seen as a private
family matter. Too often criminal violence in the home was not pursued
as it ought to have been. It was a taboo subject. Breaking the silence
around abuse has been an important milestone on the road to taking the
issue seriously and tackling it. It is a multifaceted problem, but I
believe it is underpinned by inequality between women and men, and is
perpetuated through unacceptable abuses of power. One reason why it is
so difficult to address is that it challenges deeply 
<?notus-xml column=1108?>held attitudes and beliefs, understandings of justice and ingrained
cultural perspectives—yet it is neither inevitable nor
intractable.</hs_Para>

legislators, we have a special responsibility to tackle the grave and
serious human rights abuses happening in our own community. We also
need to recognise that we are not impotent to deliver meaningful
progress. Today’s motion has focused largely on prevention
within the formal education system. Obviously, education is a devolved
issue in Scotland, and the structure of the curriculum does not mirror
the situation in other parts of the UK. Nevertheless, I wish colleagues
well in their efforts to improve the curriculum in England and Wales,
and I hope there will be reciprocal learning on how the respective
education systems can rise to the challenge, especially given the
alarming attitudes to sexual violence recorded among young people, to
which Members have
alluded<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:00:33"></hs_TimeCode>.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:00:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

example recently brought to my attention in the Scottish
context was a pilot scheme initiated by the Dundee violence against
women partnership, which was an attempt to embed preventive measures in
the curriculum for excellence in nursery, primary and secondary school
settings. Working with a range of partners and using a rights-based
approach, it tries to embed the idea that children and young people
have rights and that their dignity is important. The project workers
commented on how relatively easy it had been to integrate preventive
measures across the curriculum. They used a thematic approach so that
the issues could be addressed in an English class or a statistics
class—not just in the timetabled slot for health, well-being or
relationships education.</hs_Para>

key part of addressing sexual violence is ensuring that perpetrators
are held more accountable for their actions within the criminal justice
system. Changing attitudes and beliefs will not be enough on its own if
people cannot realise their rights. I do not think it would be
controversial to say that the historical track record has not been good
in domestic terms.</hs_Para>

I would like to share some perspectives from the Scottish context,
which I am sure will resonate with hon. Members from other parts of the
UK. I pay tribute to the Scottish Women’s Aid and Rape Crisis
Scotland for its campaigning and advocacy to raise awareness and
improve our legislative framework. Only one in four rape cases reported
to the police in Scotland results in a prosecution; three out of four
people who seek access to justice are still denied it. We know that
huge numbers—perhaps a majority—of people who have been
raped do not report it to the police. In that respect, confidence in
the system remains far too low. Conviction rates have historically been
woeful; they are improving, albeit from an abysmal starting point.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> is easy to
understand why many people who have experienced serious sexual assault
are reluctant to put themselves through further trauma at a time when
they might feel exceptionally vulnerable. Given the fairly low prospect
of securing a conviction, it takes immense courage for women to come
forward.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021465000638" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000638"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:02:44"></hs_TimeCode>Our
criminal justice system has failed and continues to fail far too many
victims of rape and sexual assault. Many of us have been deeply
saddened by the dreadful revelations about the suicide of Frances
Andrade. Back in 2002, an equally tragic death took place in Scotland 
<?notus-xml column=1109?>when 17-year-old Lindsay Anderson took her own life shortly after giving
evidence at the trial of a person subsequently convicted of raping her.
What was particularly appalling was that in court Lindsay had to hold
up the underwear she had been wearing at the time of the attack. It was
sickening and, frankly, it still leaves me speechless. In spite of real
efforts to move away from using women’s character and sexual
history in court, people subjected to sexual violence are still
traumatised by the process, which can compound the very real harm done
by the original offence.</hs_Para>

do not have much time left. Before concluding, I echo the points made
earlier about the way in which women are portrayed in popular culture
and about the misogyny often expressed in social media. We do
not have any room for complacency. Prevention and
accountability must go hand in hand. Together, we really can make
progress and

violence. We have a moral duty to protect our citizens, especially

to consider how we, in our schools, our curriculums, our
children’s services and our local authorities, are actively
seeking to educate young people and safeguard them from dangerous and

those exposed to violence and abuse, we need to examine the widespread

Grooming for sexual exploitation, the increased normalisation of sexual

grooming involving violence—often sadistic violence—for
the purpose of sexual exploitation,

In my role as chair of the all-party group on prostitution and the
global sex trade, I have been struck by the measures taken by some good
local authorities to introduce strategies to tackle violence against
women and girls in their own communities. Introducing measures to
tackle domestic violence, sexual violence, prostitution and female
genital mutilation under a comprehensive strategy, with direct
support and enforcement of the law, is a real step towards the goal of
a zero-tolerance approach to violence against women and girls. It would
be interesting to hear the Minister’s view on whether other
local authorities should also adopt such strategies to work across
their own communities. If such strategies were replicated nationally
across local authorities and prioritised as a matter of urgency, that
could go a long way towards ensuring that vulnerable people do not fall
through the cracks.</hs_Para>

finishing, I wish to make a few brief remarks about one of the groups
at greatest risk of violence against women and girls. The alarming
statistics on adults involved in prostitution who were sexually abused
as children, experienced domestic violence or entered prostitution
before the age of 18—the age at which they could
consent—highlight the urgent need for preventive education and
support services for young people at risk. According to Home Office
figures, 70% of those involved in street prostitution had a history of
local authority care, and nearly half report a history of childhood
sexual exploitation. Highlighting issues of vulnerability and the
consent of children sheds light on the continued vulnerability of women
into adulthood. The legislation on commercial sexual services currently
sends no clear signals about the nature of this trade—these are
signals to be picked up by the police and the Crown Prosecution
Service. Perhaps a debate such as today’s is an important time
to assess the impact that these industries have, not only on those
directly providing these services or being exploited, but on our
society’s attitudes towards women and girls.</hs_Para>

our group’s call for evidence for our inquiry into the law on
prostitution, I have been struck by the fact that much of the language
from those who purchase sex completely fails to challenge, and in some
places continues to perpetrate, the idea that access to sex is a
man’s right. In normalising and legitimising occupations in this
way, we not only maintain the prevalence of an industry that will be
sustained by future generations, but we communicate attitudes accepting
and promoting the commoditisation of women. It is notable, for example,
that violence against women involved in prostitution is part of one of
the most popular video games in this country. Inherent in this attitude
is the idea of the entitlement of men to pursue sexual pleasure, no
matter what the cost. That attitude continues to reinforce the power
imbalance at play behind many of the issues we have heard about today.
We need to assess how widespread the acceptance of
such<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:28:52"></hs_TimeCode>—</hs_Para>

The Department for Education is the villain in the piece today, because
there is general acceptance across the House that although making PSHE
statutory is not the whole answer, it is part of the jigsaw. It fits in
with what the Government are saying and the steps they have taken since
they came to power, as well as those taken by the Labour Government, to

was a little flabbergasted when I heard that the Department for

the Department knows that that is important and wants to give young

rather ironic that it does not accept that young people also need the
skills, experience and knowledge to deal with relationships and sexual
matters. The Department argues that it does not want to prescribe what
schools have to do, but it seems to me that if the Department can be
prescriptive about financial education it could be a bit more

routinely placed next to pictures of half-naked women. Cases of forced

one is suggesting that the media are solely to blame for these

answer to that question is, of course, yes. That is why our schools
should be taking a lead. Work to prevent violence against women and
girls must be an integral part of education policy, delivered in every
school as part of the statutory curriculum. It is astonishing that in
2010 40% of 16 to 18-year-olds said either that they did not receive
lessons or information on sexual consent, or that they did not know
whether they did. Although PSHE education must now teach about consent,
it needs to go further and cover all forms of violence against women,
including teenage relationship abuse, forced marriage, FGM and sexual
exploitation. It should also be linked to work on gender equality and
challenging gender stereotypes; otherwise young women and men will
never be exposed to education designed to reduce gender violence and to
counter the damaging impact of cultural factors, such as the
media<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:42:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000711" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000711">The
1 billion women rising today want a world that empowers young people,

dictated to by the media or advertising. Crucially, it must address
harmful notions of masculinity and present boys with positive
alternatives. The Director of Public Prosecutions and the Deputy

against women and girls aged 15 to 44 cause more deaths and disability
than cancer, malaria, traffic accidents and war combined. More than 53%
of children aged five to 18 in India have been sexually abused, and 57%
of Australian women reported experiencing violence in their lifetime.
In 2010-11 728,145 incidents of domestic violence were recorded by our

partners in certain circumstances. The Girl Guides attitude survey
found that 39% of girls and 43% of boys thought it was all right
“to make you tell your boyfriend where you are all the

a boy to tell his girlfriend what she can and cannot wear; and 2% of

that they have to do what they are told to do by their partner. Just
think about where young people currently get much of their education
about sex and relationships. Some may come from parents, but much more
will come from peers and pornography. When I worked with young people,
I was horrified by the publications they were reading and the films

does not talk about loving relationships or about young people waiting
until they are ready to have sex. It does not talk about safe sex. It

women as sexual objects to be used. I was deeply shocked when one young
woman told me about being with a group of girls and boys in the bedroom
of one of the boys. This boy was masturbating while looking at
pornography in full view of the group. This was deemed to be

they were a better girlfriend, wife, mother, lover, worker, cook,
cleaner, this would not be happening to them. The reality is that
whatever they did, however they behaved, the violence would still
happen, because in the end that partner becomes the whipping boy, the

believe sex and relationships education is essential in talking about
good relationships, positive relationships, equal relationships. It is
essential in building assertiveness in girls so that they do not accept
that they should be hit and controlled. An Irish study showed
that 12% of year 11 and 12 pupils think that boyfriends who hit
girlfriends deserve a second chance. For me, that decision to stay,
that excuse that “he only did it because he was stressed/upset/I
was bad/he’ll never do it again” is far too often the
start of a journey into long-term domestic

abuse is not only, and may not even be, violent, but it is
psychological. It is controlling, threatening and bullying. The normal
journey is one where the woman becomes more and more isolated because
the perpetrator makes it impossible for the victim to maintain
relationships with family and friends. Her self-confidence is stripped
away and she can no longer see a way out. The fear of the perpetrator
does not disappear if she manages to walk out. That is why refuges do
not publish addresses and why women often have to move many miles away
from their previous home and from any remaining support
network.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000723" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000723"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:48:36"></hs_TimeCode>Relationships

our communities is still for the most part hidden and not really openly
spoken about, even by the women subjected to it. Why is that? We have
heard a mixture of reasons today, not least of which are the fear of
talking openly about it, the shame victims feel and their belief that
they somehow brought the violence upon themselves, which is not the
case. The real shame is that society still allows it to
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:50:03"></hs_TimeCode>. In my

one deserves to be abused. No one should have to put up with abuse

women, regardless of class, race or age. There is no typical abuser

experienced domestic abuse. The previous year the figure stood at just
over 28,000. It can be a continuous cycle of violence, with women and
children forced to flee their homes to seek sanctuary—many of us
have difficulty understanding this —only to return to
the abusive partner. Why? Again, the reasons are many: desire to try to
maintain a resemblance of family life; they might have nowhere else to

I said, I have visited and spoken with those involved with the
Women’s Aid project in Inverclyde. They believe that the causes
of domestic abuse go back historically to the days when—believe
it or not—a man was legally allowed to beat his wife. In
Scotland, the problem can more usually be traced back to alcohol. For
some, alcohol is the elixir that releases held-back pressure and
frustration, allowing their rage to turn violent and leading them to
lash out at those nearest and dearest. I always think that it is no

There is always a motivation behind the violence, whether it is
physical or emotional: it is a way of maintaining control through fear.
The woman becomes isolated from her family and friends. Many victims of
domestic abuse blame themselves for the abuse, as I have

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:56:13"></hs_TimeCode>my adult life,
women have made lots of progress in many respects. We have made
progress at work, in education and public services, and in pensions and
child care, but we seem to have gone backwards in the public portrayal
of women and the impact that that is having on our self-esteem and on
the way that men treat us. The all-party group on body image has looked
into women’s attitudes to their bodies. That can appear to be at
the soft and fluffy end of the scale, but it often drives into
women’s sense of themselves and levels of self-esteem.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:57:22"></hs_TimeCode>People who have
negative self-images can 
<?notus-xml column=1124?>become extremely depressed and subject to mental health problems and
eating disorders—so much so that 80% of women are unhappy with
their bodies, 40% of children are concerned about their bodies, and 1.6
million people have eating disorders. People’s anxieties are
strengthened by their being faced with a constant bombardment of images
of
perfection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:57:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000736" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000736">I
thought it would be interesting to talk to two groups of young people
about these issues. I went to a school in London to talk to a group of
girls in year 10 and to a school in my constituency in County Durham to
talk to a mixed group of boys and girls, also in year 10. They
agreed that these were significant problems. The girls, in particular,
drew a connection between the images portrayed in the media and the way
they are harassed on the streets by complete strangers. They have now
begun to airbrush their own photographs on

was appalled as well.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:58:29"></hs_TimeCode> are
some practical things that we can do about this. It is
impossible to ban airbrushed photographs in advertisements, but we
could label them as
such.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000737" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000737">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:59:34"></hs_TimeCode>
young people told me that they find such discussions valuable. As I
said, they saw a clear link between sexualised imagery in the media and
how they were treated in real life. The portrayal of such images should
be covered in the PSHE
curriculum<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:58:59"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Girl Guides have produced a fantastic pack about these issues. Another
important aspect is that this is reducing trust between the genders.
That is not a good thing, because obviously we want people to have
happy, fulfilling long-term relationships, and they will not do that if
they feel anxious and insecure.</hs_Para>

that most worried them was music videos that glamorise violence. They
were particularly scathing of Eminem and of Rihanna’s video,
“Love the way you lie”, which is about a woman who is

need to take some positive action, so I suggest that the Government
consult urgently on introducing age-rating for music videos, which was
one of the Bailey review’s proposals; that Ofcom look again at
its rules for radio stations to keep sexually explicit and
inappropriate lyrics to particular times of the day; and that we reduce
the amount of on-street advertising containing sexualised imagery in
locations where children are likely to see
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:00:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000740" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000740">A
further problem that has been brought to my attention by
ATVOD—the Authority for Television on Demand—is that R18

Ipswich, Corby, Bute, Norwich, Manchester or Kirklees, or whether in
Manila, South Africa, San Francisco, Tel Aviv, the Lebanon or
Afghanistan, women and men are coming together to say that they do not
want to live in a world where one in three women will be raped or
beaten in their lifetime. They are turning those billion women who
would be assaulted into a billion people calling for

question for us today is whether the British Parliament has done
justice to that call. Having listened to the debate, I think we have. A

Committee that one of the best ways to get children not to indulge in
risky behaviours was to educate them so well that they had hope in the
future. He seemed to be suggesting that it was about improving

forces continue to operate those protection orders. The Government were

Mactaggart:</Member></B> I will be brief, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to
thank everybody who has contributed; it has been an excellent debate. I
am grateful to hon. Members for pointing out that sex and relationships
education based on zero tolerance to violence might be part of the
solution. However, it is by no means all of the solution. We have had
many excellent contributions about the other issues that need to be
taken on board to bring to an end to violence against women and
girls—we need to bring this violence to an end.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:25:59"></hs_TimeCode> have made
progress on some of these issues. We have to make practical progress
now, and that is why I tabled this motion.</hs_Para>

want us to vote on the motion, because we have heard one voice against
it, and I will speak to the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies). In
my political life, I have campaigned strongly for all victims of
violence. In the past year, 109 women have been murdered by the people
they loved. Domestic violence, the violence we have talked about in
this debate, and the control that goes on inside ostensibly loving
relationships, terrorises all of women. That is why this is a specific
issue, and that is why we need to deal with it. Unless we can teach
young men and young women that wherever we go, however we dress, no
means no and yes means yes, we will not have a society in which women
are
safe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000798" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000798"><I>Question

that year, 14,591 new cases of sexual violence were reported in DRC.
Since 1998, it is believed that more than 200,000 Congolese women have
been raped. Today, we still hear of widespread sexual violence in DRC,
Syria, Sudan and South Sudan. Just last week, there was a report of a
Somali woman who spoke up about being gang raped by state security
forces only to be sentenced to a year in prison, along with the
journalist who reported her story, for daring to speak up. This
reflects the exponential growth of conflicts that target civilians,
especially women and girls, as a means of intimidation and ethnic
cleansing. Films such as “Hotel Rwanda” and
“Shooting Dogs” mean that most people now know that the
abuses that these women suffer are among the most horrific that any of
us can imagine. Nevertheless, as if the failure to prevent this
violence in the first place was not bad enough, these women are still
routinely denied access to any form of justice, or any engagement with
the peace processes that follow.</hs_Para>

House will forgive me, however, given that I am chair of the all-party

the issues affecting women in conflict. It is meant not to imply that
the abuses suffered by male victims are less grave, but only to
acknowledge that the protection challenges are different and that it is
not my area of expertise. Whether the victims are male of female,
however, the unpalatable fact is that the perpetrators prosper with
impunity and that there remains little if any deterrent against sexual
violence in most fragile and conflict-affected states.</hs_Para>

building and challenging those states over the need for justice and

it is hugely to the Government’s and particularly the Foreign

was in Tawila town when a girl’s primary school was attacked.
The little girls in the school were raped, some in front of their
families. Many were less than 10 years old. How do you stand being made
to watch while someone rapes your daughter, or your mother or your
sister? It is better to die than that. They use rape as a weapon. Now
the women who were raped are pregnant they are unacceptable

raped because of the stigma. If there is no justice, if there is no

women who speak up after they have survived sexual violence and who

even primarily victims. Many whom I have met have become exceptional
human rights defenders and leaders in their own countries, calling for
their right to live free from the fear of all kinds of violence, for
their right to access services and, just as importantly, for
sustainable stabilisation. They are calling for women to be considered
and included in peace processes so that they can hold their own leaders
to account. Those women are indomitable agents for change whose
determination and strength of purpose is a resource for peace and

is a problem in every country, and every country needs to take
responsibility for tackling it. It is also a fact that in certain
countries the rule of law has entirely collapsed, and in those

practical measures that the PSVI offers are the missing link in our
international response to the risks that women face in conflict. A
frequent problem is the failure to understand the risks in the first
place. Much of the rhetoric around women in conflict-affected states
fails to address the full range of roles that women might have played
in the conflict. Some take part as combatants, others as field
operations supporters and some as sex slaves. Their inclusion in peace
processes, in disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration, repatriation

education, social and justice services if they are to protect
themselves and, if they are already victims, to recover.
However, post-conflict reconstruction and development analyses rarely

is a matter of seeing the protection and inclusion of women as an
integral part of the security challenge of stabilisation. For example,
roads and ports are needed for commerce, but they might not help women
to access local economies if they do not connect to the smaller, rural
markets that the women frequent. Employment programmes almost always
target young men, to absorb them, away from conflict-related activity,
but that can leave women without assistance of any kind. One capacity
solution is to focus on recruiting women to front-line services such as
criminal justice, health or education. That would serve the dual
purpose of ensuring that women found the employment that they needed to
prevent poverty and vulnerability, as well as ensuring that they had
access to those services. Both those outcomes would offer stability and

recurrences of conflicts after peace settlements had been concluded,

first ever special representative of the UN Secretary-General on sexual

something that just happens—that it is a “fact of

tackle it. In preparing for this debate, I unfortunately stumbled
across some truly horrifying discussion boards, with comments
illustrating appalling attitudes towards rape. While we are absolutely
right to shine a light on these issues in a conflict setting, it is
also true that the attitudes that lead to this behaviour exist in all

was routine during Liberia’s war for women to be raped at check
points. Men who committed these crimes never faced the law and were
allowed to act with impunity. Today we have had reports that at least
one even became a Member of Parliament, representing the country, while
the women he violated still wait for
justice.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13021465000843" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000843">It
is no wonder that women have no confidence in their ability to seek
justice in the aftermath of such conflicts. Justice for crimes of
sexual violence remains far too distant for far too many women, and
they are often marginalised during the subsequent process of
resolution. In far too many cases, the rights of women have been
sacrificed in attempts to secure formal peace deals. In only 18 of more
than 300 existing peace agreements is there any mention of sexual,
gender-based violence, and even in modern peace agreements, the
position and rights of women in society are still being threatened. I
agree with ActionAid, which suggests that that is partly because women
are not at the table during discussions, and considers that we should
make it a priority to seek to guarantee places for them. Organisations
such as ActionAid, Amnesty and Oxfam are working around the globe to
try to tackle these issues, and I think that we should try to make
progress by harnessing their knowledge and their networks on the
ground.</hs_Para>

fragile states and, when we can, intervene to stop them from falling

it. There are parts of the SDSR in which it would have been entirely
appropriate to raise the issue. Sexual violence is a weapon of war. It
is about power, and about the abuse of power to humiliate and degrade.

a lasting legacy there in the context of women’s rights and, in
particular, their basic security, which is the cornerstone of their
rights. I do not doubt the sentiment of the Ministers who are involved
in the discussions on Afghanistan’s future, but I am sure they

have set ourselves a very important and very practical goal: to use the
United Kingdom’s diplomatic influence and resources to increase
the number of perpetrators of sexual violence who are brought to
justice and to help to build up the legal and practical capability of
other countries to tackle these crimes. We are determined to confront
the culture of impunity, to overturn the age-old assumption that rape
is somehow an inevitable by-product of conflict, and to rally the world
to do more to help survivors. I have made it my personal priority, as
has been said, during the UK’s presidency of the G8 this year to
ask all the G8 nations to make practical commitments to help us towards
that goal. We have had representatives of the G8 here in London this

pursuing this initiative for many reasons, many of which have been
mentioned already, so I shall not dwell on them. In our lifetimes,
millions of women, men and children have endured the horror of rape and
sexual violence in conflict, including in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Bosnia, South Sudan, Colombia and Afghanistan, and in Syria
today. The sad truth is that the perpetrators of these appalling,
life-shattering crimes still go unpunished far more often than not. In
many situations, survivors endure the fear and torment of their abusers
living freely in their communities. This shocking culture of impunity
is a moral issue. Survivors face emotional and psychological pain,
physical injuries, disease and social ostracism. They have a right to
justice and support, and to live dignified
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000854" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000854">As
my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford West and Abingdon pointed out,
tackling<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:57:12"></hs_TimeCode> the use
of rape as a weapon of war is also central to a just foreign policy,
because the psychological and physical trauma suffered by survivors
affects whole communities, exacerbating ethnic, sectarian and other
divisions long into the future, and preventing reconciliation. I have
seen the consequences with my own eyes in some of the countries I have
visited as Foreign Secretary and that has left a deep impression on
me.</hs_Para>

country that can actually do something about this issue. Many countries
might feel powerless in the face of it, but we have one of the largest
diplomatic networks in the world and one of the largest development
programmes of any nation, and we have a permanent seat on the United
Nations Security Council and play a leading role in UN agencies. Given
that we have those assets and resources, and that concern for human
rights and development in other countries is part of our national DNA,
we should use those resources. I am absolutely convinced that
shattering the culture of impunity for sexual violence in conflict is
one of the great global challenges for our generation.</hs_Para>

for Oxford West and Abingdon (Nicola Blackwood) on securing this
important and timely debate in the House today. It is timely, not least
because of recent developments at the United Nations and in the Foreign

advancing work on this issue and recognise his personal efforts to
raise the issue on the international agenda. Where there is agreement
in all parts of the House, it is only right that it be acknowledged,

efforts that he has made to prioritise the prevention of sexual
violence in conflict both for the United Kingdom and for the wider

the recent work of the Foreign Secretary builds on decades of vital and

the Foreign Secretary would agree with me when I say that their
unrelenting commitment to this issue is what 
<?notus-xml column=1145?>has helped ensure that the issue today is becoming more of a focus for
Governments right around the world. Our efforts today build on the work
of many and it is only right that we pay tribute to their contribution.
In particular, it is right to single out the work that women human
rights defenders do on this crucial issue. Those working in this area
are often subject to the gravest threats and risks, facing
intimidation, abduction and even killings by those who oppose the work
they do. They do it simply because they are there to do the right
thing. Much more must be done to support these groups and promote their
agenda so that theirs is not a struggle they face
alone.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000876" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000876">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:11:25"></hs_TimeCode>

the degree of cross-party support on the issue, I will echo some of the
sentiments already expressed by colleagues in the Chamber before
turning to the specific package of measures the Foreign Secretary has
set out. When debating policy responses on this issue, it is only right
that we first take time to acknowledge the sheer scale of the
challenge, and indeed the extent of the suffering, that we are seeking
to address. More than 75% of rapes in England are never reported to the
police, so it should come as no surprise that we know very little of
the true extent of sexual violence committed in conflict. However,
there must be no doubt that rape and sexual violence are used today as
weapons of war, and indeed as weapons of torture and mass persecution.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, has rightly described sexual
violence
as</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13021465001032" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465001032">“the

is time for the international community to step up its efforts to
respond to that harrowing
truth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000879" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000879">The
conflicts that have in part defined the last decades of war have
themselves in part been defined by the prevalent and tragic use of
sexual violence as a weapon of war. During the 1994
Rwandan genocide, more than 250,000 women were raped, and 50,000 women
were reported to have been raped during the war between Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina. During the post-election violence in Cote
D’Ivoire in 2010-11, sexual violence was widespread, with over
50% of reported incidents involving children.
Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:11:51"></hs_TimeCode> deeply
disturbing, the statistics cannot do justice to the scale of human
suffering involved; it is only the personal accounts that come close to
beginning to shed light on the scale of the horror that the use of
sexual violence in conflict inflicts on its victims. The horrors
continue today in the conflicts that still rage across the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000881" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000881">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:12:20"></hs_TimeCode>
is therefore right that the UK has made the issue a priority
for our presidency of the G8. We sincerely welcome the steps that the
Government have taken to help direct efforts at both UK and
international level towards addressing the issue. The Foreign Secretary
will therefore have our continued support in his efforts to ensure that
tackling sexual violence in conflict receives the attention and,
crucially, the resources that it rightly
deserves.</hs_Para>

sure that the Foreign Secretary would agree that the real challenge we
face collectively is how to influence the facts on the ground in
conflict areas. The true measure of the success and effectiveness of
any steps agreed by the G8 will be their capacity to effect change in
some of the most difficult and dangerous regions of the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000883" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000883">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:12:53"></hs_TimeCode>
me turn to the specific package of measures the Foreign
Secretary has set out. We welcome the Government’s preventing
sexual violence initiative. It is right that one of its key components
is trying to overcome the apparent impunity that has existed on the
issue until today. Sexual violence as a tool of war remains one of the
least prosecuted crimes. We need to do more to improve accountability
on the issue more generally. That is why the work of the specialist
teams the Foreign Secretary spoke about, which will be deployed to
conflict areas, is welcome. The work they do to gather evidence, help
build local capacity and help civil society to investigate alleged
crimes will be vital. Tragically, however, demand will always outstrip
the capacity of even those groups when documenting and prosecuting
crimes on such an horrendous scale. That is why we support calls to
ensure that this UK-led taskforce is also focused on building up local
in-country capacity to deliver the necessary accountability without
leaving countries totally dependent on welcome but necessarily outside
support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000884" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000884">Also
key to any effective response are efforts to improve international
co-operation and co-ordination to prevent sexual violence in conflict
on the ground. That level of co-ordination is best achieved through the
United Nations, so it is vital, as we have heard, that the necessary
resources are made available to the relevant departments so that
well-meaning objectives can be turned into concrete outcomes. That is
why we hope that the Government will consider recent reports that the
gender-based violence area of responsibility within the United Nations
remains chronically underfunded. Effective prevention must also extend
to regulations on the supply of arms and trade in arms, which are too
often ultimately used in so many of the conflicts where sexual
violence becomes prevalent. In effect, the irresponsible transfer of
military equipment across borders fuels gender-based violence within
global war zones, and the equipment is also transferred outside war
zones, remaining in operation long after conflicts have officially
ended.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021465000885" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000885">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:15:35"></hs_TimeCode>
that regard, we will be encouraging the Government to clarify their
position in relation to the upcoming negotiations on the arms trade
treaty at the United Nations. As the Foreign Secretary will be aware,
article 4.6 of the draft text, which explicitly refers to
gender-based violence, requires states only to “consider”
taking measures to prevent arms sales from facilitating such abuses.
Many argue that this provision must be strengthened if the
treaty is to have a hope of providing effective prevention, and must
therefore stipulate that all practical measures to ensure weapons are
never used to perpetrate or facilitate acts of gender-based violence be
included in the treaty.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021465000886" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000886"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:15:35"></hs_TimeCode>Let
me turn to the specific regions where I am sure that the Government
recognise that we have not only a strategic interest but, potentially,
an operational advantage. It is only right to acknowledge that the
prevention of sexual violence in conflict is not confined to those
countries that are technically defined as being at war. 
<?notus-xml column=1147?>Afghanistan still reels from the effects of conflict
in recent years. Given our operational capacities on the ground there,
I would welcome the Government’s making it a priority area for
UK efforts on this issue. The Government’s stated objective of
making Somalia’s stabilisation and development a UK strategic
priority means that any UK-led initiatives in that country should focus
on responding to the reported use of sexual violence during decades of
conflict and on ensuring that everything possible is being done to
prevent its re-emergence in
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000887" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0003.htm#13021465000887"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:16:25"></hs_TimeCode>No
one can deny that at its core the issue we are debating is a moral one.
The suffering and scale of the terror alone should be justification
enough for the international community to act. However, the Foreign
Secretary is right to say that it is also a foreign policy issue and
therefore a strategic imperative for the United Kingdom in working
together with the international community in its efforts to do more.
The use of sexual violence in conflict not only makes the conflicts
themselves harder to resolve but contributes to making their legacy
even harder for local communities ever to overcome, in turn
perpetuating precisely the type of insecurity that it is in our
collective national interests to prevent.</hs_Para>

the best remedy to prevent the use of sexual violence in conflict is to
put an end to conflict. That might seem to be straightforward common
sense, but it should inform all our efforts on this issue, because that
means that any approach to tackling it will always be embedded within a
broader strategy for preventing conflict, promoting stability, and
protecting against insecurity. Where the Government are taking steps,
as they are, to advance this kind of approach, they will have our full

ago. I feel some shame that it happened so close to our doorstep. It is
also shaming that so few people in Bosnia-Herzegovina have been brought

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:23:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Thurrock (Jackie Doyle-Price). I am particularly glad that she
referred to the war in Bosnia. Amnesty International’s report,
“When everyone is silent”, was published last October and
sets out for the Foreign Secretary—I am pleased that the
International Development Secretary is also present—the scale of
the challenge that we face in ensuring, first, that women feel able to
come forward and tell their stories and, secondly, that justice will be
done if they find the courage to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000905" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0004.htm#13021465000905">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:24:28"></hs_TimeCode>
also congratulate
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:24:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Oxford West and Abingdon (Nicola Blackwood) on securing this
debate, and I am sure she will not mind me mentioning that, although
the Order Paper does not reflect it, there was cross-party support for
it. She should not apologise for not talking much about violence
against men, because I remember following her when she made her maiden
speech in the Chamber in which she spoke with passion about a project
in her constituency for men who were suffering domestic
violence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:24:59"></hs_TimeCode>.
Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:26:20"></hs_TimeCode> the
prevalence of men who suffer sexual violence in conflict zone is
not as great, the stigma for them is considerable. They can
even find themselves criminalised and imprisoned because they are
deemed by the nation to have taken part in an immoral
crime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:25:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000906" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0004.htm#13021465000906">I
am pleased to be speaking in this debate because I am a member
of the International Development Committee, which is currently
undertaking an inquiry into violence against women and girls. I know
that the Foreign Secretary said that it was important to realise that
we are talking specifically about sexual violence in conflict zones,
but we wanted to broaden our report to make it more general. I do not
feel like we have had two separate debates this afternoon because every
issue that was raised in the last debate affects our capacity to have
an impact on sexual violence in conflict zones. If women are not
supported by the justice system in their state or know that they will
have to return to a community where they will be stigmatised, they will
not come forward or seek
justice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000907" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0004.htm#13021465000907">I
wrote to a Minister in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office about a
woman who was raped in Egypt. When the doctor was collecting the
forensic evidence, he could not find the correct instruments and used a
pair of scissors to try to take swabs. The woman said that that
examination was worse than the rape. We need to be honest and admit
that that is the situation in many countries. Although we want to
support women, there is a lot of work to be done not just by the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but by the Department for
International Development and the Ministry of Defence to ensure that
women, girls, boys and men who are victims of sexual violence get the
justice that they seek when they come
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:27:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Foreign Secretary’s speech and his commitment. It is clear that
he has real passion for this issue. However, I have some questions and
hope that we can get a bit more detail about how he intends to achieve
his aims. I am glad that he told the House that he will be working
closely with DFID. I do not intend to be critical or to score party
political points, but it is important that we are honest. What does he
believe would be an indication of success? Does he have any numbers in
mind or any particular areas that he wants to concentrate on? How is he
working with DFID? It is important that the resources are given
directly to projects in other countries that support women and girls
who are the victims of sexual violence. It would be helpful to
have more detail on how the two Departments are working
together<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:28:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000909" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0004.htm#13021465000909">It
is important, unpleasant as it is, for us to try to get inside the
minds of the men who carry out these dreadful violent crimes. We must
understand that when a soldier comes from a country where there is no
respect for women and where women have no rights and are excluded in
every way, it is much easier for them to take the final step of
committing an act of sexual violence. That is why it is vital that the
work with DFID continues. We must try to effect change in those
countries. If we do not change the situation with regard to sexual
violence against women and girls in peace and in conflict, at home and
in developing countries, we will not achieve the laudable aims that the
Foreign Secretary has set
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:29:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000910" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0004.htm#13021465000910"><B><Member ContinuationText="Margot James" PimsId="5592" UID="13021465001572" xid="1202" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0004.htm#13021465001572">Margot

violence against women, girls, boys and men. We have to acknowledge
that the most effective way for us to improve the lives of women and
girls, so that they can live free from the fear of violence and its
devastating effects, is to work to bring about change across a whole
range of issues—education, training, employment, access to
finance, health care and justice. Those are the ways in which we can
protect women and make it possible for them to come forward and tell
their stories, so that we can deliver justice and so that their

are two major areas in which girls and women who are raped in
situations of armed conflict are repeatedly discriminated against. The
first is the routine denial of safe abortion services to those victims
of war, in violation of their right to non-discriminatory medical care
under international human law, and the second is the failure to treat
rape and the deliberate transmission of HIV as prohibited weapons or
methods of war.</hs_Para>

denial of abortions to girls and women raped in armed conflict was
recently the focus on debate in the House of Lords, and it has been the
subject of many parliamentary questions. The Government responded by
acknowledging that they considered girls and women raped in armed
conflict to be the “wounded and sick”, and that they are
entitled to non-discriminatory medical care, including abortions. They
have also acknowledged that international humanitarian law, not
national law, is the legal framework that must be obeyed in the
provision of humanitarian aid. However, those acknowledgments are
insufficient without concrete action to ensure that that right is
granted to the wounded women who need
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:31:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000916" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0004.htm#13021465000916">What
concrete action could the Government take? To begin with, they could
recognise that the right to abortion for girls and women raped in armed
conflict is protected under humanitarian law and is not subject to
national laws on abortion. That should be explicitly included in all
relevant Government policy guidance, including the Department for
International Development’s “Safe and unsafe
abortion” practice
paper<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:32:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000917" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0004.htm#13021465000917">Rape
and the deliberate transmission of HIV are acknowledged as being used
as weapons of war, but neither is treated as a prohibited weapon or
method of warfare. Despite global recognition that they are used as
weapons of war, they are invisible in weapons regulation. They none the
less violate core principles of humanity in international humanitarian
law, and as such they should be treated as prohibited weapons of war.
The failure to treat war rape like other illegal weapons prevents
victims from being entitled to reparations for their injuries. Victims
should be entitled to have the perpetrators held accountable for their
crimes. For that reason, the failure to treat rape as part of the
international framework that regulates the means and methods of warfare
is particularly confounding. We regulate starvation under that
framework, so why not rape and sexual
violence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:33:16"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000918" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0004.htm#13021465000918">In
April, the Government will work to secure a clear political statement
from the G8 of its determination to make real, tangible progress on
combating the use of sexual violence in conflict. However, if we are
truly to lead, we must speak up for those who do not have a voice and
bring awareness to issues that are often neglected or left out of the
conversation. Acknowledging the issue is not enough, and talk is not
enough. The UK must take concrete steps to ensure the provision of
abortion services for women raped in war and to bring rape into the

V-day campaign, which continues to drive the global movement to end
violence against women and girls, has a strong history. In 2009 I
joined its campaign to end sexual violence in the Congo and signed a
letter urging the G20 to take steps to stop the war and violence. I
extend my appreciation to all those who tackle violence against women
and girls in our local communities and across the world, often placing
themselves at risk. In Feltham and Heston I mention especially the new
Hounslow one-stop shop, which last November launched a free advice
service for victims of domestic violence and those who have suffered
violence in other ways. The project is run jointly by the Met police,
Hounslow community safety unit and the Hounslow domestic violence
outreach service. Our communities also contain those who have suffered
from sexual violence in conflict—I had a constituent who came to
see me; the war has stopped, but her suffering, and that of her
family, continues.</hs_Para>

know that in war zones, victims of sexual violence do not have their
own local support networks or local crime prevention teams. For many,
however, there is no protection, which is why the international
community must stand together. Sexual violence in conflict is, of
course, a moral issue and, as has been discussed, central to foreign
policy. I am glad that the issue finds agreement on all sides of the
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:36:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000922" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0004.htm#13021465000922">Rape
in war is the darkest of military tactics, used to degrade and
humiliate victims and undermine their families or the ethnic, religious
and political groups to which they belong. Last year’s annual UN
report on sexual violence during conflict provided horrific examples of
how sexual violence has threatened security and impeded peace building
in post-conflict situations such as those in Chad, Sri Lanka and Sierra
Leone. In addition to the thousands of women who we know have been
raped, it has been estimated that 50,000 women were raped in the war in
Croatia and Bosnia Herzegovina, 250,000 in Rwanda, and 64,000 in Sierra
Leone. From Syria we see in our newspapers today examples of women
being raped in prison and in their homes.

we move forward with the G8 this year, I am sure we will continue the

and I hope that in his remarks he will answer a few questions. First,
what support has he achieved from the international community? It
should be not just on the agenda, but high on the agenda. Secondly, how
will the strategies that are beginning be sustained by the G8 and other

visiting Bosnian-Serb soldiers when they felt like it. My wife, Claire

were children. It was foul, it was ghastly, and it was most definitely
something that we should campaign to stop. I applaud what the Foreign

soldier, “I am planning our withdrawal.” He said,
“We’re not withdrawing, sir.” I said,
“Well, we might have to if I am ordered by the Government to do
so.” He said, “Not me, sir.” I said, “Why
not?” He said, “Our duty is here protecting these women,
children and the vulnerable. That is what we are here to do.” We
never did withdraw, but my goodness that shows the quality of our

Gilmore</B> (Edinburgh East) (Lab):</Member> It is a privilege to
follow the hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart), who knows exactly
what the situations are like, and can tell us so graphically the
experiences he has seen with his own eyes. It was important that this
debate was secured, and it is appropriate to pay tribute to
the Foreign Secretary, the shadow Foreign Secretary and the Secretary
of State for International Development. I mention the first two in
particular, because they have given up their time to be here for the
whole of this important debate. That is significant, and it sends a
message that we see this as a very important issue. Some people may
watch this debate, possibly at some unearthly hour of the morning on
the Parliament channel, and think that there were not many people
present, that it looks a bit thin, and that we cannot really think of
the subject as important. However, the fact that senior figures have
given up their time shows that it is very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:48:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000938" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0004.htm#13021465000938">As
several hon. Members have said, this subject challenges those of us who
would prefer no conflict at all, who would like to say that the answer
is for there to be no war and that we should not get involved. It is a
challenge to decide when to intervene, how to intervene and what ways
there are to intervene. The examples we have heard from the
former Yugoslavia vindicate intervention. The violence was occurring
anyway; it did not happen because we intervened. Hopefully, some women,
who might otherwise have been affected, were saved The challenge
remains, because in all situations 
<?notus-xml column=1155?>we have to ask ourselves whether it is right to intervene, or whether we
would provoke an existing conflict. Some conflicts arise from some of
the gross inequality in the world and its resources, so there are many
things that we can do to prevent such
situations.</hs_Para>

Gilmore:</Member></B> I agree absolutely. With a subject this big, it
is sometimes tempting to think, “Well, it’s always been
there throughout history.” We know that. The history of conflict
going back hundreds of years contains examples of such behaviour, but
40 years ago, when the big campaigns on violence against women started
in this country with the setting up of domestic violence refuges and so
on, people said the same thing: “You’ll never change it.
It’s always been there. It’s endemic.” Although we
heard earlier how far we have left to go, even in our own country,
progress has been made. Sometimes, when dealing with difficulties in
the justice system and so on, it feels like three steps forward and two
steps back, but nevertheless we have made some progress and changed
attitudes. I do not wish to sound complacent, but
those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:50:13"></hs_TimeCode> of us who
started campaigns in the early days have seen a difference. If we make
an effort, we can begin to change how people think and behave and how
they are treated, so although, with a subject this big, people might
think, “What can we do? What can anybody do?”, we must
make an effort and start to change things.</hs_Para>

of peacekeeping forces have a particular responsibility when it comes

field. One way to change things is by involving far more women in the
process of change in their own countries and peace processes. As many
people have said, far too few women feature in the big meetings and
peace conferences. Where are the women? It is important that their
voices be heard and that they be encouraged and given the tools to

hon. Friend the Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Nicola Blackwood)
on securing this important debate, which I was happy to co-sponsor. She
knows the enormous interest I take in this issue, and not only in the
international context; I have also spoken about domestic violence in
this country, and as I have said before, if men knew the odds
of getting caught and prosecuted—the prosecution rate is 6%, so
they have a 94% chance of getting away with it—they would
probably go for
it.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T16:54:37"></hs_TimeCode> The
international statistics are even more dramatic. In the former
Yugoslavia, men have a 1:20,000 chance of being prosecuted, and in
Rwanda, where I have spent the past seven years travelling, the figure
is 1:50,000. That is a disgrace, and the Foreign Secretary is
absolutely right to take a lead in this important initiative.</hs_Para>

I have seen in Rwanda, the by-product of rape as a weapon of war are
the orphans who live on after the conflict, infected with AIDS. I have
spent time over the past seven years working with such children in a
school in Kigali. Their mothers have been killed off by AIDS, but the
children live on with the condition; they effectively have a time bomb
within their bodies. They could die at any time. It is important to
consider not only rape itself. We must investigate and prosecute the
perpetrators of rape, but we must also think about what happens
afterwards. We need to think about the children who were born
as a result of rape, many of whom have AIDS. Perhaps through
the International Development Secretary of State, we can see
what we can do to give them more support.</hs_Para>

supporting the excellent work of the commission in Bosnia over the past

Coventry and Warwickshire city deal meets all three criteria, and is an
example of how a city deal can make a significant difference to the
local economy. The bid focuses on advanced manufacturing and
engineering. As co-chair of the associate parliamentary manufacturing

other hon. Members have said repeatedly in debates in the past,
manufacturing has the potential to bring jobs and to rebalance our
economy towards a more export-orientated economy. This city deal
recognises that the next 10 years are not going to be like the last.
That kind of forward thinking is to be applauded. We need proposals
that can adapt to the changing economic circumstances—national
and international—that we face. I think this city deal does
exactly that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T17:06:15"></hs_TimeCode>.

all recognise that the bedrock of a strong manufacturing sector is
skills. If we are going to grow advanced manufacturing and engineering
in our region, we need to have the skills in place to enable businesses
to grow and make the products that are wanted around the world. This
city deal cuts right to the heart of this problem, and highlights the
skills shortage that is holding back our local economy. According to
the latest estimates, there is a shortage of about 18,000 high-level
engineers in the west midlands. The Coventry and Warwickshire area is
likely to need up to 25,000 level 2 and level 3 engineers to replace
our existing work force. If we are not able to meet that demand,
businesses will not be able to grow and we will have to spend more
income trying to retrain staff or poach them from other businesses,
reducing funding for investment, research and development

generation

academic cycles. The board will work on new courses to meet the
specific requirements of local manufacturers, and to build on local
successes such as the advanced skills accreditation scheme chaired by
Jaguar Land Rover. The proposals sensibly focus on the upskilling of
existing engineers and the retraining of unemployed people, which would
enable us to use the labour resources currently at our disposal to

hon. Friends will know that I visited Coventry last month to discuss
the evolution of the city deal bid, and I was particularly impressed by
the level of representation from all the local authorities in the area
and businesses at the highest level. Sir Peter
Rigby, the 
<?notus-xml column=1162?>chairman of the local enterprise partnership, chaired the meeting, and
other business organisations were represented, as were the universities
and people from right across the board. It was clear that this is a
united bid, very much looking to a very positive future for the area.
It was particularly impressive to see everyone working together in that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T17:15:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000988" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0004.htm#13021465000988">It
was also impressive to see the laser-like focus on manufacturing and
skills there. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that one of the
proudest traditions of the area that he and his colleagues represent is
that of being the heartland of British manufacturing. Far from
that being a story just about the past, it is very much a story of
today and of the future. The people behind this bid were
prescient in emphasising that the undoubted opportunities that
will flow through the increasingly internationally competitive world of
advanced manufacturing can be grasped only if we make sure that the
work force in the area are equipped with not only manufacturing skills,
but the particular skills that the new technologies of the future in
this field will offer. The support of the universities, in particular,
and of the research institutions make it clear that this is a very
high-quality offer that is being made.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend will understand that it would be invidious of me to give
any kind of nod or wink to him this evening—tempting though that
might be—not least because this evening’s proceedings
will doubtless be being viewed by 19 other places around the country.
They will be very envious of his good fortune in securing this debate,
so he will forgive me if I do not do that. Let me instead take the
opportunity to reflect on the city deals process and the arrangements
we have put in place. I start with a point that my hon. Friend made,
which is that we should recognise the importance of local strengths in
the future of our economy.</hs_Para>

it is of prime importance that our country has the right macro-economic
conditions to sustain growth and prosperity in the future. Paying down
the deficit we inherited and having an economy in which international
lenders can have confidence is the foundation of any future economic
success. All Government Members are engaged, day after day, in making
the changes necessary to secure that. However, it is also important
that we have the right micro-economic conditions: a tax system that is
supportive of business and enterprise, and that encourages investment;
and flexible labour markets that allow people to go into the places
with an expanding number of jobs and allow employers to expand
employment with confidence. Again, the work being done in not only my
Department, but the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and
the Department for Work and Pensions is very much geared to having
those conditions in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T17:18:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021465000991" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/debtext/130214-0004.htm#13021465000991">If
we do all that, it is still necessary to reflect that our economic
prosperity ultimately depends on local places prospering. Economic
growth does not happen in the abstract; it happens in particular
places, when employers locate, expand their production and take on
people. These are places that people can visit and address; they are
tangible.</hs_Para>

long—over many decades—how we have conducted our economic
policy has paid too little heed to the importance of locality. It is
tempting for politicians in Westminster and our officials in Whitehall
to peer out from London SW1 and assume that the rest of  
<?notus-xml column=1163?>the country is uniform, when we know that one of the
glories of our country is that it is full of areas, towns and cities
with proud traditions that are the foundation of our future economic
success. The city deals programme is intended to ensure that that sense
of place is part of our economic policy.</hs_Para>

soon as one considers that we should have a sense of place in economic
policy, it becomes obvious that every place is different. We have
already discussed the importance of manufacturing in the traditions in
the west midlands, but that is true across the country. Everywhere has
its local traditions and capabilities. Even cities as close together as
Liverpool and Manchester are very different in their economic
character, their skills, trades and industries, their politics and in
almost every respect, so to treat them as if they are identical seems
to me to deny them the possibility of living up to their potential and
planning for the future.</hs_Para>

city deals programme was designed to reflect the differences between
places. We started with the eight bigger cities outside London and in
July 2011, when the Prime Minister asked me to become the Minister
responsible for cities, we gave each of those cities the right to take
the initiative and set out to negotiate what, in their view, would be
the measures that would best unlock their potential. There was some
scepticism at the time about whether it would be possible to break the
monopoly of Whitehall in determining how things should be done, but in
less than a year we were able to conclude a city deal with each of
those eight places, which were transformational. In Greater Manchester,
for example, £2 billion of local investment in infrastructure is
being made in return for the city’s share in the resulting
prosperity. In Leeds, apprentices and school leavers are being trained
in the skills that the city’s future economy needs, as Leeds and
the authorities around it have identified needs that should attract a
particular
focus<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T17:22:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

important point about locality and the need to ensure that we tailor
the Government’s support package to each area. Does he agree
with me that that is a far better and more effective approach than that
taken by the previous Government through regional development agencies
such as Advantage West Midlands? Private sector employment fell during
that time rather than increasing. I appreciate that, as he has told us,
my right hon. Friend will not be able to tell us the result today, but
does he agree that if the Coventry and Warwickshire city deal was

Clark:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The problem was
that the regional development agencies were branch offices of Whitehall
in the country, which seems to be the opposite of the approach we need
to liberate the entrepreneurialism and local strengths of particular
areas. The areas should be coming to Whitehall, as they are—as
the Coventry and Warwickshire local enterprise partnership
has—and saying what they want to do. The problem with the RDAs
was that it was the other way around.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=1164?>The west midlands is one example, but the north-west is another. The
identities of world-renowned cities such as Manchester and Liverpool
were subsumed and became totally anonymous in the Northwest Regional
Development Agency, so it is absolutely necessary to make these
changes. My hon. Friend is right to point out that even in their own
terms the regional development agencies were a failure because the
differences between London and the south-east and the regions widened

of the contrasts between our country and other countries on the

unbalancing of our economy. What he says is absolutely right. With the
city deal that we hope to get for Coventry and Warwickshire, we could
see that manufacturing base start to increase again, accompanied by an
increase in gross value added and a better average income in our area,

such. It is not the final word. Those that are invited to go forward
will be asked to engage intensively with me and my officials so that we

increase in eating disorders has been among young men. As well as
facing the mental health problems typically associated with female
sufferers, they are coming under more pressure than ever before to
conform to a stereotype of the body beautiful. Imagery in magazines and
advertising plays a significant role.</hs_Para>

concern is the prevalence of eating disorders among gay and bisexual
men, who are twice as likely to be sufferers as heterosexual men. I
understand that eating disorders in gay and bisexual men are even more
linked to concerns about body image than in heterosexual male or female
sufferers. Although males account for only 11% of the total of those
with eating disorders, the percentage is increasing, and we should be
conscious of that. In the 10 years up to 2011, the number of hospital
admissions for men suffering from an eating disorder rose by 67%.
Furthermore, there is evidence that undiagnosed disorders are even more
commonplace among men than among women. The scale of the hidden problem
could be
immense.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000017">It
is not only the young who are afflicted, although there is certainly a
trend towards eating disorders manifesting at an earlier age than ever
before. I was particularly moved by my contact with a woman whose
daughter started suffering from anorexia nervosa at 10 years
old but was not diagnosed for years, as her GP and other medical
practitioners thought that she was too young to have the condition.
Eating disorders are also being diagnosed much later; some sufferers
present in their 50s and 60s, and there is evidence that increasing
numbers of sufferers manage their conditions not just over the average
of seven years, but for decades. An increasing number of people in
their 30s and 40s have lived with their eating disorder for more than
20
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000018">“Eating
disorder” is a term used to describe a wide variety of
conditions, some well known and others far less so. Obviously, the best
known and most recognisable is anorexia nervosa, in which a sufferer
intentionally deprives themselves of food and has a body
weight  at least 15% below the recommended minimum. People 
<?notus-xml column=325?>with anorexia have an extremely distorted view of their own body and a
fear of gaining weight. However, anorexia is but one condition among
several. Eating disorders also include bulimia, which in many cases is
harder to detect, as sufferers may maintain a normal-looking weight.
However, it is achieved through bingeing, purging and fasting, and like
anorexia it can cause long-term
damage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000019">From
my research for this debate and my conversations with many sufferers of
eating disorders, I have learned of many other conditions: binge
eating; compulsive overeating; food neophobia, an extreme fear of
trying new food; and compulsive over-exercising. A year ago, I met a
young man who ran up to 30 miles every day. There is also selective
eating: sufferers eat only an extremely limited range of
foods.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13021463000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000020">Bulimia is a
disorder linked closely to low self-esteem, emotional problems and
stress. The sufferer may think constantly about calories, dieting and
ways of getting rid of food that they have eaten. It is actually more
common than anorexia, but it is more hidden, because people with
bulimia usually maintain an average or just-above-average weight.
Bulimia can go unnoticed for a long time while sufferers feel
incredibly ill and
unhappy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000021">Those
with bulimia become involved in a cycle of eating large amounts of food
and making themselves sick, cutting down or starving for a few days, or
trying to find other ways to make up for the food that they have eaten.
It can cause them to become so hungry that they eat large amounts of
food because their bodies crave nourishment. Some people do not vomit,
but instead take laxatives, which are especially dangerous. Just
because bulimia does not cause the extreme weight loss of anorexia does
not mean that it is less serious. Sufferers need help and support, as
the side effects and consequences can be serious. I appreciate that I
have given a very rapid description of some eating disorders, for which
I apologise, but I am sure that other Members will wish to discuss some
of them in more
detail.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000022">I
do not wish to generalise, and I apologise if my next remark causes any
offence, but in many instances, due to the extreme control with which
sufferers approach their food consumption, eating disorders are a type
of addiction. However, unlike addictions to alcohol or narcotics, a
fixation with how one controls one’s calorie intake must be
faced and addressed every day of a sufferer or recovered
sufferer’s life. They cannot simply remove food from their lives
in the way that others might develop strategies to avoid alcohol, for
instance. They must eat to live. For sufferers, by necessity, that
battle will occur three times a day for the rest of their
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000023">Eating
disorders are not trivial conditions. Anorexia kills about 20% of
sufferers, and 40% never recover. It is the single biggest killer of
all mental illnesses. It has been dismissed for too long as a problem
of teenage girls who just need to get a grip on their eating patterns.
That is far from the truth.
Eating<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:39:43"></hs_TimeCode> disorders
are serious, potentially fatal, mental illnesses, which, even long
after a sufferer has recovered, can have long-term implications for
their health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:39:39"></hs_TimeCode>.
The impact on fertility is well known, but there are many other serious
implications. Abnormal heart rhythms are commonplace, even in teenagers
with 
<?notus-xml column=326?>eating disorders. In fact, heart damage is the most common cause of
hospitalisation for those suffering from eating disorders, but the
kidneys and liver are also badly affected, and reduction in bone
density leading to osteoporosis can happen in sufferers, even before
there has been any physical manifestation of a
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T13:40:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000024">As

death or divorce, academic pressure, and cultural and social pressures,
can all contribute. For every sufferer there will be different triggers

live in a complex, changing world where higher numbers of people than
ever suffer from mental illness, and so it is with eating disorders. It
is not just the number of sufferers, but the severity, that is
increasing. What would have been considered an eating disorder 
20 years ago might now be regarded merely as a bit  of
disordered eating. I do not say that in any way to dismiss the
seriousness of disordered eating, but to demonstrate that the

their child, and as if they are somehow to blame. They are not, and I
find that in the majority of cases, parents were the fastest to
identify the condition. They instinctively knew that something was
wrong with their child, even though they might not have been able to
put their finger on what exactly it was. I have heard some terrible
tales from parents, which I will come on to—I assure you,

mother said to me on the phone just yesterday, there is nothing that

communication between the home GP and the GP with whom the student is

want to speak about an eating disorder that affects young people with
type 1 diabetes. It is informally known as diabulimia, but the medical
profession does not recognise that title and, to be fair, it is not an
accepted name. In so far as I use it, I do so as shorthand to describe
a quite complex phenomenon. I pay tribute to Diabetics with Eating
Disorders—DWED—and particularly Jacqueline Allan who
provided me with briefing to enable me to take part in this debate.
Diabulimia is a condition, although not officially recognised as such,
that affects mainly but not exclusively young diabetics. For clarity, I
emphasise that I am talking about type 1 diabetes, which people are
born with a predisposition to, and which has nothing to do with
lifestyle. Some people are born with something that is likely to
trigger diabetes at some stage, and too often we confuse type 1 with
type 2 diabetes when they are absolutely not the
same.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000062">Sufferers
of type 1 diabetes are exclusively prone to suffer diabulimia. If a
young diabetic does not take their insulin, their level of blood
sugar—glucose—increases, 
<?notus-xml column=332?>as medical science has known for a long time. However, young people have
discovered that when that happens, the glucose cannot be converted into
energy, and in turn the glucose is removed through the natural process
of urination. Consequently, necessary calories are also lost, so
manipulating their insulin intake may lead to rapid weight loss. If the
intake of insulin, which is needed to stay alive, is manipulated,
diabetics can achieve rapid weight loss. That information is circulated
all the time in the social media on Facebook and Twitter, and young
diabetics who want to lose weight are learning from other young
diabetics how to lose weight rapidly. I will move on shortly to the
consequences for those young
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000063">First,
it is important to give some context for diabetes and associated
problems. Young female diabetics aged 15 to 30 have a nine times higher
death rate than their non-diabetic counterparts, which is an alarming
statistic. According to a BBC report last year, of the
26,000 avoidable deaths from diabetes, the highest increase
is among young women in that age range, which bears out the
point made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:04:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Romsey and Southampton North. According to the Joslin Diabetes
Center and DWED, having type 1 diabetes increases the chances of
developing an eating disorder twofold, and 40% in that age range

survive, in order to lose

first glance from the perspective of young people who want to lose
weight, that seems like a way of using their condition as a means of
doing so easily. However, the problem for people with type 1 diabetes
is that deliberately increasing their blood sugar levels may have
serious consequences and lead to early death. In the long term, as the
hon. Lady said, there is a risk of fertility problems, which are common
in relation to other eating disorders, but for diabetics there is also
a risk of loss of limbs, kidney damage, blindness, heart damage and
many other serious
complications.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000065">There
may also be serious short-term consequences. When a type 1 diabetic
stops taking sufficient insulin to balance their blood sugar levels,
the body produces ketones, which are highly acidic and dangerous, and
above a certain point might lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or DKA, which
is always fatal if not treated quickly.</hs_Para>

system is very poor at dealing with this problem because it is not
officially diagnosable and the reaction of health professionals is
often confused, at best, which might lead to courses of action that can
have serious consequences, including death. Sufferers report being told
that diabulimia does not exist—it does not exist as an official
medical term—and consequently they have been discharged with no
treatment. Sometimes they have been designated as non-compliant. If the
health professional does not recognise what they are looking at, they
assume that there is a problem with lack of co-operation from the
patient and simply discharge them, which may have dangerous
consequences. I will give an example in a
moment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000067">In
other cases, such people have been diagnosed as anorexic or bulimic,
and treated for a condition that they do not have, often with fatal
consequences. DWED reports that sufferers have sometimes been treated
by eating disorder specialists who have little or no knowledge or
understanding of diabetes, or by diabetes specialists who have little

was very light, but she did not meet the criteria for being light
enough to have an eating disorder, and was consequently told that she
did not qualify for any support. The advice that she was given was that
she needed to relax about food. Anybody who knows anything about
diabetes knows that the relationship diabetics have with their
carbohydrate intake is crucial to their well-being, so to say to a
diabetic, “Go away and get more relaxed about eating”,
could put them in a position where their life is threatened.
Subsequently, the young woman concerned had to be admitted as an
emergency case to hospital with ketoacidosis, which, had it not been
treated quickly enough, would have been fatal. That was somebody who
had presented themselves in the health system, looking for help, but
was told to go away and get a better relationship with food.</hs_Para>

which is what is commonly said to them at the moment. That comes back

for type 1 diabetics with eating disorders—what I have termed as
diabulimia—the condition needs to be properly recognised as a
serious and complex mental health problem. I do not think
that it is controversial for the hon. Lady to refer to it being a
mental health problem, because although, in all the cases
that she gave, there are serious physical consequences, the
springboard often relates to mental health, relationship with body
image, and so on.</hs_Para>

those who seek treatment should receive the correct treatment with
respect and compassion, on the basis of a multidisciplinary approach.
In the example that I gave, there was not enough expertise in one
specialism to be able to satisfactorily deal with the problem. Such an
approach requires the Department actively to promote an understanding
of the problem, so that health professionals catch on to what is
happening. Protocols probably need to be in place, so that when
somebody presents themselves with such a condition, health
professionals know what to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:13:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

people raising this problem, apart from me in today’s debate,
are DWED, who work together with other bodies, such as Diabetes UK.
DWED currently exists on an income, in the last financial year, of
£9,000, which is not even enough to employ one full-time member
of staff. DWED operates on the basis of having previous sufferers who
are volunteers, under the co-ordination of Jacqueline Allan, who I
mentioned earlier. I do not know whether it is more appropriate for
support to come from foundations or the Government, or somebody else. I
am not talking about needing hundreds of thousands of pounds, although
I am sure that DWED would welcome that, but some way needs to be found
to support the one organisation that is campaigning on, and raising and
dealing with the problem.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:15:01"></hs_TimeCode>Given the
importance of its unique role, I hope that the Government can find some

just as it is vital that health professionals take a more
multidisciplinary approach to this and other eating disorders, it is
equally important that the Government take a more joined-up approach. I
could have made the same criticism of the previous Government, and I
realise how difficult it is to get a joined-up approach to eating
disorders and many other things. However, on medical cases, there needs
to be co-operation between different Departments, because a stronger
push is required on the issue of body image and how that is dealt with.
Perhaps it is not best dealt with by the Department of Health, but at
the same time, some of the health issues involved need to be
addressed.</hs_Para>

this idea of politicians wagging our fingers and saying, “This
is what you should do”. For a couple of years in the previous
Government, I had the responsibility in the Home Office for drugs
policy, and one thing I know is that middle-aged men like
me—perhaps I am flattering myself there—are probably the
worst people to go into the media and say, “Actually, you should
not be taking drugs.” A subtle, sophisticated approach is
needed. A lesson from that, which applies equally here, is to provide
information to young people so that they know the consequences of what
they do. One problem we are dealing with is that people think there is
an easy way to lose weight and to get to be the shape that they, or
others, think they should be. Action has to be taken smartly, on the
basis of real information about consequences, but it still has to be
done.</hs_Para>

Several people around the room well remember 
<?notus-xml column=335?>what it is like to be a teenager, and one experience that we probably
all share, and that every teenager in history has shared, is
insecurity. They have not developed into who they are going to be, and
they are insecure about everything, including their
appearance—as is obvious, I have long since given up worrying
about my appearance—the way they present themselves to the
world, what it is to be cool, and all those things. A lot of that is

“Well, that’s a matter for the Government.” They
have a responsibility to provide for young people role models that are

people that they do not have to look like those images to be an
acceptable, successful and attractive member of society. That
responsibility is not just for Government or politicians, but for
everyone who is in a position to influence how these things are
presented to young people in particular, and to society in general. I

age<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:25:18"></hs_TimeCode>. That final
point is, for me, the most important one and the one on which I shall
focus in the few seconds that I have left. I am referring to how we
raise awareness of disordered eating behaviour in such a way and at an
early enough stage that recognition and treatment are possible and at a
time that predates the long-term physical health problems that eating
disorders can
cause<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:25:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

suffer from eating disorders start to experience their troubles as
children and adolescents. Many suffer in silence, and in so doing curse
their lives, not just with a disordered relationship with food, but by
destroying both their physical and their mental health in the process.
That will probably affect every aspect of their lives: their career,
their relationships and even, sadly, in some cases, their ability to
become parents
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:26:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000093">The
underlying cause of much disordered eating behaviour is a person
struggling to cope with anxiety, stress and poor mental health. The
cause of that anxiety and stress may be bullying. It may be an escape
from abuse or traumatic events. The cause may be a lack of control,
bereavement, poor parenting or simply uncertainty over one’s
place in the world. However, the cause is undoubtedly psychological.
The illness therefore deserves genuine sympathy and understanding, not
dismissive attitudes, which compound the problem.
Perhaps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:26:33"></hs_TimeCode> over
time, the disordered eating behaviour may be modified through
self-discipline or self-awareness. The sooner someone gets the
treatment they need, the more likely they are to make a full
recovery.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000094">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:26:47"></hs_TimeCode>
the reasons that I have set out, this issue deserves at least equal
priority with other physical and mental health problems. We cannot
ignore or be indifferent to the obvious consequences of eating
disorders. We have only to look at those who so bravely suffer them to
see why we as a society must do more to tackle them, and we must start
by raising awareness of their existence, their causes and their
cures.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13021463000269" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000269">2.27

I would like to be quite parochial and speak about services in the
north-east. When looking on the internet to find out where these
services were, I was quite concerned to find out how limited they are,
but, fortunately, in the north-east we have a unique service; it is the
only specialist provision outside hospital services 
<?notus-xml column=338?>in the north-east. The Northern Initiative on Women and Eating has
worked in the area for 24 years; it is referred to as NIWE. Last year,
according to its annual report, it helped 1,344 people with eating
disorders. For the rest of my speech, I shall refer to them as people
with eating distress, as NIWE feels that it is a more appropriate way
to describe how people suffer when they have problems with eating. It
has also helped 141 carers and supporters of people with eating
distress and 636 professions have called on its expertise.</hs_Para>

has been said, 1.6 million people in the UK have eating distress, more

or being treated as out-patients or in the community.
Eating<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:39:32"></hs_TimeCode> distress
is a general term with which people are more comfortable. It covers
those diagnosed with conditions such as bulimia, anorexia, eating

people have not even shared their disorders with others. The high
levels of stigma have already been pointed out. When people have eating
disorders, it often goes unreported to GPs or other medical services,
due to shame and the fear that people’s futures could be
jeopardised if anything were recorded in health records. That fear
needs to be removed. Sometimes people have lived with eating issues for
many years, managing in secret and suffering in
silence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000101">Under<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:30:53"></hs_TimeCode>-reporting

of self-esteem, which can be brought on by bullying or abuse. They are
difficult to diagnose medically and not all GPs have enough specialist
knowledge, as we have learnt this afternoon. I do not apologise for
repeating some things that have already been said; I do not think we

works, 61% are under 30. NIWE was keen to stress, as was my
constituent, that there is a greater chance of recovery with early
intervention. Sadly, NIWE also tells us that 70 people are on its
waiting list for group therapy. Waiting times are too long, but it

treatments target core eating disorder pathology, primarily weight
restoration, but there is a need to look at efficacy and effectiveness
in minimising harm and reducing the personal and social costs of
chronic illness. NIWE has therapy groups, which are proving successful,
that address the underlying determinants of eating distress, but I have
to keep returning to the fact that it is
underfunded.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T14:35:33"></hs_TimeCode>
NIWE has found that people from across the area who are recovering from
an eating disorder want recovery groups to be set up, because they help
them to progress and maintain their recovery, which must be the
ultimate aim of anyone who comes forward to address a problem. The Stay
Well group helps such people, but NIWE is, again, trying to raise more
funds to support that vital service. It tells me, as I think we all
know, that such services need more provision and we need more to be
spent on recovery, because, sadly, there is a high relapse rate and
many people go through a revolving door. It makes sense to invest in
support for people in recovery, because bed rates for those with eating
distress are between £450 and £750 a day. In terms of
economics, the Government should look at supporting people in
recovery.</hs_Para>

families and friends who are carers and supporters is important. There
are effective family-based interventions. NIWE offers an initial
listening and signposting service to under-18s and their families, but
it wants to do more. I know that I am pleading for NIWE, but I am sure
that those here today know of many other organisations in a similar
situation, with the ability, but simply not the capacity, to help.
People call NIWE wanting an appointment or asking for other services,
but it finds that need far outstrips capacity.</hs_Para>

specialised commissioning frameworks, and will often be large regional

complex and contradictory, and in many ways there is ambiguity as

illness, mental illness and recovery. They are highly resistant to
change; unlike with a physical illness, the patient wants to hold on to

better treatment, but profoundly better education and prevention, as

months or even a year to receive treatment. That is profoundly damaging

emotional needs of patients, who require time and cannot simply be
moved on quickly. They need a proper rapport with GPs and

the past 25 years, the incidence of eating disorders has increased
enormously. There are many possible contributory factors. I observe the
tiny size of models, actors and actresses, and screen, tabloid and
magazine heroines and heroes; the cult of celebrity; the obsession with
gyms and exercise; the constant barrage of advertising through every
medium; the pressure on us to diet and to eat low-fat, low-calorie
food; the ranges of “light” foods on sale and the
so-called “healthy eating” regimes. There is bullying and
name calling in the playground, in the workplace and during our
leisure, and pressure to remove what is called excess weight and
achieve someone else’s idea of a perfect body shape. We have
life on the run. Eating on the go is now more common. There is an
absence of what I used to have: formal lunchtime at school, at which a
teacher sat at my table and watched me eat—even the semolina. If
a child takes in a packed lunch, they can give it away or bin it, and
no one has any control or sight of what they are eating.</hs_Para>

feeling inadequate, worthless and lacking in self-esteem are common

want to concentrate particularly on the problems facing children and
young people with anorexia and bulimia. In hospitals all over the
country, there are children and young people—some as young as
seven or eight—who are being treated by doctors and nurses who
have very little training in dealing with eating disorders, and who
often have no knowledge of how to set a safe target weight. Sometimes,
they weigh patients who still have their clothes on, or who have their
pockets filled with kitchen weights, or who have their stomachs filled
with three or four litres of water. Families are not given the support
they need, or clear-cut advice. Patients see a different doctor or
specialist at each appointment, and the appointments are too far apart.
Little heed is paid to the patient’s physical condition. I have
heard about children attending out-patient clinics because of their
weight loss, but having neither their pulse nor their blood pressure
taken. Monitoring pulse and blood pressure is vital if we are to
prevent a child from collapsing, and if we are to know when a child
needs hospital admission.

are very few doctors who specialise in the treatment of children with
eating disorders, so the waiting lists for children who need to access
those doctors are often dangerously long. Eating disorders must be a
condition that students are taught about in medical school, and
awareness of them must be included in the postgraduate
training of GPs, psychiatrists and paediatricians. If children were
seen early in their illness by professionals working as part of a
multidisciplinary team, so that parents were given the consistent,
sensible advice they needed on how to re-feed their child, and if
patients were seen by a family therapist and an individual therapist,
as well as having a medical doctor who understood the long and
short-term risks, and who could make a referral to an in-patient unit
before the patient became irreversibly damaged, we would have fewer
chronically ill adults in later
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:03:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000151">No
one should die from an eating disorder. At present, however, there are
more deaths from eating disorders than from any other mental illness,
and it is estimated that 10% of all sufferers of eating disorders die
as a result of their condition. For adults, the courts always support
an application for nasogastric feeding, but tragically the request for
a court order is often made too late, or not at all. However, working
with children with eating disorders reveals another serious problem,
one that interferes with the ability to help them. That problem is the
implications of the Children Act 1989, which deems children of 16
capable of making their own decisions about treatment. However,
anorexic patients rarely want to eat voluntarily. Although many of them
are crying out for help, the guilt wrapped around food and eating means
that they need someone to help them to eat, and not someone to ask
their permission as to whether they would like to
eat<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:04:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000152">Despite
an excellent ruling a few years ago, which in summary states that
anyone who seeks to starve themselves to death is not competent to make
decisions, we nevertheless require 16-year-olds to give written consent
before they can be admitted to a medical unit. There are some units
where, in order to protect themselves and their staff, this permission
is sought from 14 and 15-year-olds. Once children are in the unit, if
they refuse to eat, no staff member would dare use a nasogastric tube
for fear of being sued. Until the passage of the Children Act 1989,
units treated anyone under the age of 18 and fed them if and when
necessary, requiring only parental
consent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:05:12"></hs_TimeCode>. What a
ridiculous situation we are now in. The reality of the current
situation leaves parents feeling completely ineffectual and frustrated.
It also leaves the child feeling quietly victorious, as they go on
their way home with medical permission not to eat.</hs_Para>

we find ourselves in the ludicrous situation whereby staff have to tell
parents of often very ill children who will not consent to eat that
they must wait until their daughter or son loses another x number of
kilos, whereupon that young person can be sectioned under the Mental
Health Acts and treated compulsorily. That puts lives at increased
risk, and being sectioned is an overly serious response to the problem.
We should seek a more appropriate solution. Being sectioned jeopardises
any hopes that that child in recovery might have of joining the armed
forces, for example, or becoming a doctor or nurse, which is
particularly sad, because when they have recovered, many of these
children are attracted to working in the caring
professions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:06:26"></hs_TimeCode>,

second charity is, of course, Anorexia and Bulimia Care, or ABC, which

governed, run and supported by people whose lives have been touched by
eating disorders. It offers kindness and compassion to sufferers at a

advisers and a national network of volunteers, all of whom are carers

have been referred to many times this afternoon, but what strikes me is
that although 2,500 people in my constituency may suffer
from an eating disorder, not one has contacted me, either before the
debate or  in the two and a half years I have been a Member of
Parliament. I hope that is because the services they receive
from the primary care trust and the mental health trust are exemplary,

want to say a little about what my children said, and about what I
think the reasons behind what they said were. My son, Tom, is 22. He is
a fitness trainer and he runs a gym. He is a health fanatic: he is very
fit, he is always at the gym and he plays rugby football. He recognised
some time ago that he was getting to the point where, however much
exercise he took, he still felt there was too much fat on him. He was
deliberately avoiding food and certain other things to try to slim
down. There is not an ounce of fat on him, and he does not need to do
that. He knows that now, but at the time, for whatever reason, he felt
he had to change his body shape.</hs_Para>

daughter, who is 20, is incredibly slim. She suffered the reverse
problem from my son: people would accuse her of perhaps having an
eating disorder, when she did 
<?notus-xml column=349?>not think she had one. The problem was that that gave her cause for
concern and made her ask whether she perhaps did have an eating
disorder. As it happens, she does not; she is fine—she is just a
slim girl. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:15:20"></hs_TimeCode>Both

know the reasons behind eating disorders are complex, and we have heard
about them, but the thing that concerns me most is the idea of body
image, of perfection and of trying to be something that we cannot be.
We know the numbers: only 5% of us could ever get close to the perfect
image we see in the press and the media. The rest of us are struggling
to conform to that or just to be comfortable in ourselves. That is one
of the main drivers of this issue. Those who get past their brush with
an eating disorder may do so because they see through that. However, if
there are other pressures in people’s lives—pressures
relating to relationships, family breakdown, the future, money and
education—they might trigger the body image issues that push
people towards having a fully-fledged eating disorder.</hs_Para>

other thing that surprised me is that eating disorders are on both
sides of the gender divide, and they affect old and young

felt under pressure to change his image.</hs_Para>

we have any confidence that those figures are accurate, given that one
is more than double the other? We do not know how widespread this

am 14 stone, but as a 17-year-old I was not. I had many issues that I
did not understand, which caused me, one day, simply to stop eating. I
had no support. I was at boarding school, and boarding schools in the
’70s were not exactly sympathetic to young boys who had
problems. I felt, for whatever reason, under enormous pressure, and my
weight plummeted to 8 stone. I did not know what was happening. All I
knew was that I could not eat. I just stopped eating. A memory that has
always stuck with me is being at school with a plate of food in front
of me, and knowing, in my head, that I wanted to eat. I said, “I
want to eat this: I know there is something wrong with me.”
Intuitively, I knew that, but I could not eat. I remember taking a pea
and putting it in my mouth, and simply not being able to swallow it. I
want people to imagine how frightening that is. I was not hungry, but I

was only years later that I began to understand what I was then going
through, and I shall explain later how I got out of it, but it was not
through the help of any outside party. I was under a huge amount of
stress. I would get blinding headaches, and take aspirin to try to deal
with them. That lead to addiction to the aspirin, and they did not
help. I knew I was under a lot of stress because I would vomit every
day. It was not bulimia. I did not have anything in me to be sick; but
clearly I was under huge stress. I have five children, and thank God 
<?notus-xml column=351?>nothing has gone wrong with them, but when they have stress symptoms
such as tummy aches I can relate to that. I understand that the tummy
ache may not be from eating something wrong, but from some sort of
stress. I think that that has made me a little more empathetic as a
parent.</hs_Para>

factors are fear—fear of failure in school or of letting down
parents, for whatever reason; relationships that do not work; and,
probably, a huge amount of anger, as a teenager. For reasons that,
again, I did not understand at the time, there was a lot of anger. I
know no one ever saw me smile. I suspect that a strange combination of
stress, fear and anger created a tipping point for me, as a
17-year-old, when I just stopped eating. The reactions were varied, and
none was particularly helpful, with a lack of understanding from my
school. My parents did not know what the hell was going on, but they
were concerned. My mother, who is a Jewish mother, would say,
“Eat, eat.” That is the Jewish mother’s solution
to everything: “You must eat more”.</hs_Para>

eating was not going to work, because I had not sorted out whatever was
going on up there in my mind. I did not get much sympathy from the

am aware of other stories. A girl in my constituency had huge problems,
one of which was that she could not get the care she needed, because at
certain times her body mass index was not quite right. I thought that
was a stupid reason for not looking after her. One could tell straight
away that she had a problem. It is a bit like what happens with speed
bumps in the road. A lot of traffic goes up and down a road, but unless
a certain number of people are killed we will not put speed bumps in
it. That seems a little counter-intuitive to me. My
constituent’s parents told me that her second problem was that
she would go in for four or six weeks and be given a quick fix, and hey
presto suddenly everything would be sort of all right. She would be fed
up a bit, and her BMI would be got over whatever the magic mark is,
then she would be sent back out again. That was three or four years
ago—so it is a recent example of the problems and the lack of
understanding of the issues.</hs_Para>

was lucky. Eventually, after three or four months of being able to eat
hardly anything, I found one thing I could eat. If I went down to the
Chinese restaurant I could eat fried rice. I found something I could
start to take in. That is how I began to repair my body
slightly—through an attraction, for whatever reason, to fried
rice from a Chinese restaurant. However, the big positive thing for me
was a change of environment. I was lucky enough to get into Harvard,
and that different environment outside the UK gave me, suddenly, a lot
of self-confidence. It gave me a place to go from an unhappy space in
my life. Even today I probably do not understand what was going on
there, but I was clearly unhappy, so moving to a more friendly space
where I could almost reinvent myself helped me to get a lot better. One
of the advantages 
<?notus-xml column=352?>of being skinny was that when I got to Harvard—and I was very
skinny—they said, “Why don’t you come and cox the
Harvard crew?” I was a crewsman and coxed at 120 lb, which is
the minimum weight. I was certainly the tallest cox on a national level

have come up with some thoughts on what we can do for people who cannot
help themselves in the way I was lucky enough to. First is
education—for those in the health care profession, who I still
do not think are up to speed. I get the sense that many general
practitioners do not understand the issue or are not sympathetic.
Teachers also need to be educated. They need to spot what is going on
and to respond. Parents need to be better educated to spot what is
going on, to see what the symptoms are and to try to ensure that their
child, whether a boy or a girl, receives the help they
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000182">The
problem is a mental health issue; it all starts with the mind. There
are no short-term fixes. An individual needs long-term help—it
is not two, four, six or eight weeks. There is no timeline to this. I
appreciate that we have budget constraints, but mental health care is
almost the orphan when it comes to health care in this country. There
are many forms of mental illness, which we have talked about in other
debates, and eating disorders are a mental health issue. I ask the
Minister to look into the issue to see how we can provide more support
for people.</hs_Para>

eating disorders charity, and it would be unfair not to mention also
Anorexia and Bulimia 
<?notus-xml column=353?>Care, and some of the other local charities that hon. Members have
mentioned. According to Beat, eating disorders affect 1.6 million
people in the United Kingdom, which is one in 39 people or 2.6% of the
population. Statistically, that means that around 2,000 people at a top
premier league club home game will have an eating disorder; 11
passengers on a jumbo jet; or more than 200,000 people here in Greater
London. Therefore I am pleased that, throughout eating disorders
awareness week 2013, Beat will highlight that the illnesses are far
more common than perhaps most people would think or appreciate. The
theme of this year’s campaign is “Everybody knows
somebody”. It is a laudable aim of the campaign to encourage
people to reach out to others—whether a partner, work colleague,
best friend, brother or sister—to talk about the illnesses, to
express their concerns and to seek help before they reach
hospitalisation stage.</hs_Para>

disorders primarily affect young women aged 18 to 25, but of
course not exclusively. Most people would consider them as a young

mortality rates for mental health illnesses. Up to 20% of those
affected may die prematurely. I was interested in the contribution of

have a central role to play in the issue and, in many ways, have a
great responsibility. Some media images of excessive thinness must play
a large part in encouraging, particularly, young people to aim for an
unrealistic body weight and risk becoming anorexic. What has perhaps
been more worrying is the recent trend in social media that could
encourage eating disorders.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:37:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Romsey and Southampton North and others have raised that issue in
their contributions. I am a father of three young children. I have two
sons—one has a birthday today; he is a teenager, because he is
13—but I worry particularly about my daughter, who is 11 and
very conscious of some of the unrealistic images that she gets
bombarded with. It is a concern of mine, as a father, and no doubt of
other hon. Members who have children. I can see how the problem could
start to escalate. There were concerns earlier this year with online
sites such as Instagram, which appeared to allow users to view pictures
encouraging eating disorders and self-harming. According to press
reports, some of the messages on the website encouraged people not to
eat. That is incredibly concerning, because Instagram has more than 80
million users worldwide. The growing influence of a variety of social
media and the popularity of phone apps give people, especially young
people, 
<?notus-xml column=354?>access to images that encourage the individual to believe that an eating
disorder—we have heard this in the debate—is a lifestyle
choice. Surely that is wrong, especially as the number of hospital
admissions for eating disorders is growing.</hs_Para>

year from the health and social care information centre shows that the
number of hospital admissions for eating disorders has risen by 16% to

were men or boys. The statistics also reveal that more than 50

which are up 69% since

recognise that social media and pro-anorexia sites can affect those who
may already be vulnerable to eating disorders and who already feel
pressured. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:40:23"></hs_TimeCode> am
pleased to see that there have been at least some positive changes in
the media. Last year, <I>Vogue </I>announced that it was banning models
with visible signs of eating disorders from its glossy pages, and the
editor of British <I>Vogue </I>pledged not to use any models under the
age of 16, thereby helping to project an image of healthy
models<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:40:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000190">I
also notice that Channel 4, alongside other broadcasters, has actively
sought to raise awareness of body image issues, including a wide range
of eating disorders, among its audiences through a number of programmes
and online projects such as “Gok’s Teens: The Naked
Truth”, which looked at British teenagers and offered advice on
how to address their issues and anxieties, focusing particularly on
teens suffering from body dysmorphia and anorexia. The programme also
included an examination of the impact that the media and internet can

an eating disorder include finding reasons to skip meals, avoiding
family meals or expressing a wish to eat alone, being noticeably
self-conscious about body image or becoming very withdrawn. Those are
all known warning signs. Clearly, anything that can help to identify
the risk signs and help those affected to confide in parents or
teachers can only be positive. We know that the sooner people come
forward, the sooner treatment can start and the better the
outcomes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:42:52"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, we should also consider how to raise awareness in the national

is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Walker. You are an
appropriate Chair for this debate because of your interest in mental
health and your willingness to speak out about your own experience,
which meant an enormous amount to those who are fighting the stigma of
mental health problems. Indeed,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:48:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Braintree (Mr Newmark) has done the same today. Such
moments, when people are willing to speak out, are incredibly important
in challenging and addressing the stigma of mental health problems in

am deeply grateful to the members of the Backbench Business Committee
for convening this important debate. It is good that Parliament has
recently been willing to debate a number of different mental health
issues in a way that perhaps has not happened in the past.
Mr Walker, before Christmas you raised the issue of
schizophrenia, on which we had a useful debate. The great value of such
debates is that they force people to think about an issue, just as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:49:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for South Basildon and East Thurrock (Stephen Metcalfe) has
today. His experience of recognising the problem, perhaps for the first
time, and talking about it with his children demonstrates the great
value of such occasions, because they force all of us to think about an
issue. Indeed, they force officials in my Department to think about the
issue, too. I am grateful.</hs_Para>

refer first to the speech by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:50:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Braintree. I am so grateful that she persuaded him to
come speak in this debate, because he made an incredibly valuable
contribution. I was struck by his remarks about the huge stress
experienced by teenagers. As the father of two boys who have been
through the teenage years, I am acutely aware of the pressure on
teenagers and the impact that it can have on their mental and physical
health. He discussed huge stress, fear of failure and anger. I was
struck by what he said: unless the mind is healed, the body cannot
heal. We must look at the problem
holistically.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000200">One
problem with health care is that we have institutionalised
fragmentation. We have managed to separate mental health from physical
health, which is ultimately not a good thing. We must consider the
whole person. I know that the Opposition have been talking about that.
It should not be an issue for political disagreement; it is such an
obvious thing to recognise.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Braintree discussed the need for education
and raising awareness, including among parents. The strain, stress and
anxiety that parents go through must not be underestimated. Improved
awareness is needed in society of this range of conditions. He said
that mental health care was the orphan within the NHS, which is
absolutely true. There is an institutional bias against mental health.
The way that money flows within the NHS disadvantages mental health.
There is an 18-week target for physical health care and a tariff,
meaning that every patient takes money with them into acute hospitals.
Money is sucked through into acute hospitals, and there is great
political pressure from every side to maintain the 18-week target.
There is no 
<?notus-xml column=357?>equivalent in mental health. There is no right of access. Waiting nine
months to access care and treatment is completely unacceptable. We must
challenge that, and he was absolutely right to raise it. He ended on a
positive note. There can be life after anorexia, however tough it is to
get through it. Some, terribly sadly, do not. I will return to that
point in a moment.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Romsey and Southampton North made some incredibly
important points. She mentioned her local organisation, April House in
Southampton, and the fantastic work that it does, and she spoke about
the absolute importance of raising awareness in primary care. Some
people are lucky enough to find a GP who understands mental health and
is passionate about it, but some are not. Families with a GP who just
does not get it can be desperate; they have nowhere to turn. There is a
need to raise
awareness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000203">In
the first mandate, a set of priorities published by the Government for
the new NHS Commissioning Board, mental health has been given a higher
priority than it has ever had in the NHS. The mandate makes it clear
that the NHS is under a legal obligation to deliver demonstrable
progress towards parity of esteem by 2015. That means treating mental
health on a par with physical health. By placing the commissioning
board under that obligation and disseminating the message to clinical
commissioning groups, we will start to make progress on forcing the
system to recognise the importance of treating mental health and
physical health equally. It will not happen overnight, but it is a
journey that we must take to improve the condition of many people. The
hon. Lady discussed the impact on families and the unfair sense of
guilt that many experience. She also mentioned waiting times, which in
many cases are simply
unacceptable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000204">I

others about diabulimia. He discussed the rapid weight loss that can
occur with diabetes, and how some people use the condition to lose
weight in a dangerous way. He also said that in too many cases, a wrong
diagnosis is made and the wrong treatment given as a result, and urged
me to ensure that the condition was recognised better at a national
level and the knowledge disseminated through the system. I urge him to
engage with the commissioning board. I am happy to work with him on

hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Heather Wheeler) made a helpful
contribution and discussed the need to raise awareness of eating
disorders. She mentioned personal, social, health and economic
education in schools. All schools are encouraged to provide young
people with good, age-appropriate education about sex and
relationships, but we are reviewing PSHE to establish how teaching can
be improved. There is clearly a need to improve the teaching in many
schools.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mrs Glindon) mentioned her local
service, NIWE, and the important work that it is doing. She spoke about
the number of people who are not diagnosed but who none the less suffer
from eating disorders, and about the fact that they have the highest
mortality rate of any mental illness. She said that early intervention
was important.</hs_Para>

by what the hon. Lady said about recovery groups. This morning I spoke
at a conference on mental health. I spoke specifically about recovery
and a new way of looking at mental health. We must move from trying
simply to treat the condition to working collaboratively with
professionals and people experiencing the condition, and we must focus
on recovery. Fantastic results are being demonstrated from that shift
in approach. It is frustrating that in some parts of the country, great
things are happening, but it is patchy, as many hon. Members have said,
and improvement is needed. She also made the point that mental health
is the poor relation, as I have acknowledged. That must
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021463000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/halltext/130214h0001.htm#13021463000210">I

recovery. He has been committed to improving the experience of people

the growing prevalence of the condition among teenage boys, which
should worry us all.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-14T15:59:39"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Wells (Tessa Munt) spoke movingly. She mentioned the
cult of celebrity, pressure on youngsters, variability of services

my hon. Friend mentioned issues of consent, a difficult area about
which there are strong views on both sides. I am acutely aware of the
horrible position of a parent wanting to help, but being unable to
because of the legal constraints that prevent them from making an

night. I am so pleased that his television is broken, because it has
led to our being given a valuable insight that we might otherwise not

many cases, eating disorders stem from low self-esteem or are linked to
stress and emotional problems. That is why our support for local
organisations in improving mental health services locally is so
important. Our mental health and suicide-prevention strategies both
include actions that local organisations can take to improve mental
health in their areas: ensuring that children and parents get mental
health support from birth; that schools and colleges promote good
mental health, alongside targeted support for those at risk of mental

the potential to improve the position in many parts of the country

will develop a national service specification and encourage better

about mental health directly with members of the public. The transfer
of public health to local government, alongside children’s

wellbeing board, potentially gives it a prominence that it has not had
in the past. The funding settlement for public health has also
surprised many people, with significant real-terms increases this year

course, the problem cannot be fixed by tweaking the system. A huge
stigma remains around mental health, which means that in too many cases
children and young people are not getting the support that they need.
That is particularly the case with eating disorders, and people
affected often feel marginalised and excluded, unable to talk about
their suffering. The problems can be compounded if the sufferer is a
man or suffering from a less stereotypical but no less serious eating
disorder, such as atypical anorexia or a binge-eating disorder.

a powerful message, and challenge that

significantly in recent years and are represented on sites such as
Facebook. They do not cause eating disorders, but they play a
significant role in exacerbating and reinforcing illness. Limited
research is available, but what there is shows us that a significant
number of teenage girls in particular visit such sites, including a
substantial proportion of young people who already have an eating
disorder. Disturbingly, nearly all of them report learning new
weight-loss techniques from the sites. I am extremely concerned about
those sites but cannot take legal action against them as they are not
in themselves illegal and might also be hosted overseas, but we
continue to explore other, non-legislative courses of action. For
example, we recently worked with a media agency to run advertisements
directing youngsters to more appropriate sites, because there is much

suffer eating disorders when they need continuity of care. My strong
argument to the Minister is that there must be flexibility in both

In July 2012, the Prime Minister announced that the Government would
introduce a new benefit that would provide additional financial support
to seriously injured service and ex-service personnel. The Ministry of
Defence (MOD) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) are
working together to introduce the armed forces independence
payment (AFIP) on 8 April 2013. The respective

AFIP.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13021462000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/wmstext/130214m0001.htm#13021462000155">AFIP
is designed to support the most seriously injured. It will be payable
to service and ex-service personnel who have an armed forces
compensation scheme award that includes a guaranteed income payment of
50% or higher. The payment will be £134.40 per week, which is
the equivalent of the enhanced rates of the daily living and mobility
components of personal independence payment (PIP). Those receiving AFIP
will have access to other benefits in a similar way to those receiving
disability living allowance (DLA) now or PIP in the future. In
addition, they will not be subject to reassessment and their payments
will continue if their circumstances change, for example if they enter
hospital or a care home. Those receiving AFIP cannot claim other DWP
disability benefits such as DLA or
PIP.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13021462000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/wmstext/130214m0001.htm#13021462000156">AFIP

because of the urgency with which we have to deal with what is clearly

Arctic cod and exchanges with Norway fairly reflected the interests of
the different member states. The Faroes declared its intent to set its
own TAC unilaterally on Atlanto-Scandian herring. The Commission would
look closely into what could be done in response to this, including all
legal measures available. The Commission also reported that the EU and
Norway had agreed to take the traditional 90% of the mackerel TAG which
was to be reduced in line with ICES advice. There was a need to
consider further the possible introduction of trade sanctions against

necessary on geographical indications (GIs), enhancing protection of EU
GIs in Canada. These issues would have to be overcome in order to
finalise the EU-Canada FTA. On the WTO Doha development agenda (DDA),
developing countries would want movement on agriculture and the EU may
have to compromise on this, in order to secure a DDA trade facilitation

considerable instability in recent years, the root cause having been
changes in demand for its largest area of work, bankruptcies and
company liquidations. Difficult decisions will need to be taken about
jobs, given the fall in demand, and there needs to be a reduction of
overhead costs to put the service onto a more sustainable financial
footing. This will include decisions on the service's estate, which is
now considerably larger than required for the number of staff needed
going forward. These decisions will align with the service's business

export market. They can help develop strong companies, which in turn
will contribute to a strong UK economy, providing jobs and growth.
Research by the Westminster Business School estimated that £16
billion was invested in brand development in the UK in 2006. Further,
research published by the UK Intellectual Property Office in 2011
suggests that companies that regularly register trade marks, important
components of branding, experience more growth, create more jobs and

future Government policy towards investors. The UK Government is,

action to ensure the UK's energy-intensive industries remain
competitive. From this year, the Government is implementing measures
worth around £250 million over the spending review period to
reduce the impact of policy on the costs of electricity for the most
electricity-intensive industries. This includes an increase in the
level of relief from the climate change levy on electricity for Climate
Change Agreement participants from 65% to 90% and a compensation
package to help offset the cost of reducing carbon emissions. As set
out in the Energy Bill, energy-intensive industries will also be
exempted from the costs of Contracts for Difference under Electricity
Market Reform, subject to consultation and state aid

There is scope for pupils to discuss beliefs about the origins of the

the area in each time period, rather than mortality among those born in
each area. It is not therefore the number of years a baby born in the

value confiscation orders often contain hidden and overseas assets,

Government takes confiscating criminals’ assets very seriously
and during 2011-12 we recovered 8% more from all confiscation orders
than in the previous financial year. This year performance has
significantly increased again, and for the period April 2012 to the end
of October 2012, we have collected 13% more than the same period last
year. This means that, though there is still work to do, we are on
course to have our most successful year
ever.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021483001538" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/text/130214w0004.htm#13021483001538">During

issue, DEFRA has been clear that we will act in accordance with the
evidence. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reports published
on 16 January consider the risks to bees from these insecticides and
conclude that more data is needed to update the current risk
assessments. As the EFSA made clear in the reports, these assessments
used existing data against new regulatory requirements which have yet
to be finalised. As would normally be expected, the EFSA found
that new data requirements were not met by data produced earlier. The
reports do not state that these insecticides pose an unacceptable
danger to bees, although this impression is given by the accompanying
EFSA Press Release. It is also worth emphasising that the EFSA
conclusions are not new scientific information but report a stage in
the process of updating the developing new risk assessment and applying
it to these three active
substances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13021489000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130214/text/130214w0005.htm#13021489000005">The

not assumed that the existing controls are sufficient. The European
Commission has 
<?notus-xml column=883?>now indicated that it will propose measures on the three neonicotinoids

states. Our approach to any Commission proposal will continue to be
founded in a proportionate response to the science and so we will seek
clarity as to what the Commission are proposing, the basis for this and
the likely impacts. Our response will take account of advice from the
Advisory Committee on Pesticides, which considered the latest evidence
