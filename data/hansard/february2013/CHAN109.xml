explain the distinction. I will give him another example. The noble
Lord Mandelson is in receipt of a European Union pension and as a
former commissioner is under an obligation to campaign for the EU. He
has recently started a lobbying campaign against the UK leaving the EU.
Is that commercial lobbying? It is certainly driven by the noble
Lord’s financial interest as a former EU commissioner. Should
that be registered as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T09:40:01"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0001.htm#13020139000029"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T09:39:48"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Thomas Docherty" PimsId="5686" UID="13020139000639" xid="1052" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0001.htm#13020139000639">Thomas
Docherty:</Member></B> I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
raising that example. He will see that we talk about peers in later
clauses. With his indulgence, I would like to return later to the issue
of peers undertaking lobbying activities later. On the principle,
however, if we were to leave the European Union, the pension of the
Deputy Prime Minister, for example, as a former euro civil servant,
would not be affected. In the same way, that consideration would
probably not apply in the case that the hon. Gentleman

Davies:</Member></B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bear in mind
the fact that EU pensions are forfeitable, unlike most other pensions.
However, let me return to the point I raised initially. Where a
managing director of a small business, perhaps in my constituency, took
on a number of roles because of the nature of that business and one of
them was explaining to the local Member of Parliament exactly what was
necessary for the livelihood of his business, would that constitute
lobbying for financial gain—it would clearly be in the financial
interests of the company—and would it thereby be captured by the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T09:41:32"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0001.htm#13020139000031"><B><Member ContinuationText="Thomas Docherty" PimsId="5686" UID="13020139000641" xid="1052" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0001.htm#13020139000641">Thomas
Docherty:</Member></B> I am genuinely grateful to the hon. Gentleman
for raising that point. Perhaps I could present two separate examples
and then he can tell me whether I have answered his question fully. If
a local business person is the chairman or chairwoman of a local
chamber of commerce that meets regularly on behalf of its members to
lobby on issues of concern, they would not be covered by the Bill, nor
should they be. However, if a 
<?notus-xml column=1157?>Member of this House voluntarily or, as occasionally happens,
involuntarily loses their seat and sets themselves up as a sole trader
or limited company for the express purpose of being a
lobbyist—like, I am sure, many Members, I have had the
opportunity to meet former Members who are engaged in that
profession—they would be covered by the Bill. The Association of
Professional Political Consultants is the largest trade body for
third-party lobbyists. A large number of its members are small
businesses that are sole traders or perhaps employ only two or three

there is a grey area that has not been satisfactorily defined. That
involves people who, within their paid work, end up doing a bit of
lobbying. It would be hard to explain that they were

I served as a lobbyist, both in-house and as a third-party consultant,
for a number of years. He is right to suggest that someone could
undertake what most people would define as lobbying activity on a
part-time basis. For three years, I worked in the nuclear industry, for
British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. My official title was press and public
affairs officer, and I effectively ran BNFL’s operation in
Scotland. I was responsible for working with the local community on a
range of stakeholder issues, I drafted the press releases for the
Chapelcross and Hunterston sites, and I looked after
Sellafield’s inquiries in Scotland, which involved going to the
Scottish Parliament. I also recall spending two or three wonderful days
in the Western Isles doing a presentation to the council on technetium
discharges into the Irish

hon. Gentleman
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T09:51:35"></hs_TimeCode>is absolutely
right to say that someone can undertake lobbying activities without
that being their sole purpose. Any relatively reasonable
individual—I can think of no better description for the hon.

activities among the core functions, or the outcome of lobbying as a

definition is suitably robust. The Bill tries to strike the right
balance by using a definition that goes as widely as is reasonable

The largest single organisation is the Association of Professional
Political Consultants, which has been in existence for about 18 years.
It is made up of most of the well-known lobbying and public affairs
companies and many small companies, as well as political
consultants—that is, third-party lobbyists. The association has
a membership of about 50 companies and individuals who work as sole
traders. They all sign up to the association’s register, and
they have to abide by its code of conduct. They also have to publish on
a quarterly basis a list of their clients, including those for whom
they are doing paid work and those for whom they are working pro bono.
It is interesting to note that a number of companies undertake pro bono
work. They do so for various reasons, and I dare say that some of them
do it to get some good PR for themselves.</hs_Para>

2009, when the then Cabinet Office Ministers were considering their

only APPC members but representatives of the law firms that have public
relations arms and of the Chartered Institute of 
<?notus-xml column=1160?>Public Relations. They decided that they had a choice, and that a
statutory body would be set up if they took no further steps and failed
to recognise the significant problems that the PASC report had
identified, which Ministers were considering. That was one of the clear
outcomes of the PASC report. They therefore set up the body known as

it was set up, it has not worked. I will explain more about that later.

is a healthy part of our democracy. We have already heard some examples
of the roles that it can play, and no one has criticised them. We have
heard about local businesses or religious organisations being involved,
as well as companies being employed by individuals. In a parliamentary
democracy such as ours, it is every citizen’s right to lobby
their Member of Parliament, and I believe that it is their right either
to lobby their MP themselves or, if they feel that they do not have the
time or the skills to do that, to employ someone else either
individually or collectively to do it for them. That is not to say that
those who are so employed and who make a financial gain from lobbying
should be allowed to do so unchecked, without any rules whatever.

working in that field. I think it was the Library briefing note that
estimated that only 1% of those working in public affairs were
third-party lobbyists—that is, consultants—and that 99%
worked in-house. It is therefore vital that registration should cover
not only third-party lobbyists but all those who undertake commercial,
paid lobbying. Both PASC reports have acknowledged that, as have the
industry players and Unlock Democracy—not, perhaps, a natural
ally of the lobbying industry. Indeed, everyone—bar one

and in the regulatory burdens imposed by the state on the individual
company. All that is a broader aspect of being on a company board. On

Docherty:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his
clarification. I see where he has gone with that point, and I apologise
if I have not articulated the position clearly enough. Let me try to
explain it again. The finance director, in and of himself, would not
be—and 
<?notus-xml column=1162?>is not at the moment—a lobbyist according to anyone’s
definition. If a company secretary or executive officer has a job
description that includes a reference to being a
director of internal communications or to company
relations, for example, that individual would need to be on the
register. The hon. Gentleman is right about that. On the other hand, an
individual who has an interest in those areas in the course of carrying
out their normal duties, but whose job description does not refer to
lobbying activity as part of their paid role, would not need to be on
the register. He is entirely right to raise these questions, but I
refer him to the two Select Committee reports produced in this
Parliament and the previous one, as well as to the Cabinet Office
discussions on this matter under this Government and the previous one.
I also refer him to the discussions with the industry and with
champions of more transparent behaviour, none of which said there was a
problem. I hope that that provides some
reassurance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T10:05:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0001.htm#13020139000065"><B><Member ContinuationText="James Duddridge" PimsId="4769" UID="13020139000664" xid="881" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0001.htm#13020139000664">James

about people more senior than a public affairs director, but what about
more junior posts? A director of public affairs and a senior manager
will, as the hon. Gentleman has explained, need to register, but what
about other people within those teams? How low down in the organisation

declares to ASPA who works in the public affairs or public relations

definition of lobbying. Nevertheless, there was a genuine

posed by the APPC for the purpose of its register is “Do you
have a public-facing role in which you articulate a policy on behalf of
the client?” That applies to companies large and small. When I

would not always be me who telephoned the Member’s office or
drafted a letter to the Member, although it would be me who signed the
letter. It might be an account manager or an account executive who did
the chasing up or issued the request for a meeting, as is the case in
many organisations, and because that person would be dealing directly
with the Member’s office, according to the APPC’s own
definition he or she ought to be registered. The person who came in to
clean the office in the morning, or the security officer, would not be

have no problem at all with an individual making a comfortable living

should not prevent them from holding shares in companies. At present
there are specific rules about how Ministers must conduct their
financial affairs. I recall a meeting I had with a Conservative
Minister—regrettably, he has now left the Government. I had not
heard of him before, so before meeting him I looked up his register of
interests. He was appointed by the current Prime Minister to the House
of Lords, and he had a vast number of interests, some of which were
fascinating. For example, he was director of “Wisden”,
which is a very sound organisation. Although he had a long list of
interests, however, we all had confidence that he had placed his shares
into a trust. It is entirely appropriate that Members of either House

Docherty:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point.
Let me segue slightly into that. For the benefit of hon. Members,
“segway” is a type of transport that is currently
fashionable with many younger people who work outside the House. More
and more planning companies are setting up public affairs arms to lobby
on planning applications. That is particularly true in Scotland under
the new Scottish planning  policy, where for a development over
a certain size—say,  50 houses—a public
consultation must be
undertaken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T10:36:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0001.htm#13020139000126">The
hon. Gentleman is right to say that if a planning consultancy is
directly undertaking the lobbying to influence and shape the policy of
the councillors, it should be covered, but if a planner attends a
meeting to provide technical answers, that is factual, in the same way
as architects and transport consultants would provide technical
answers. To return to my example of retailers, if Sainsbury brings its
head of sourcing along to answer technical questions, nobody outside
the House believes that they should be captured by the legislation. I
hope that answers the hon. Gentleman’s
question<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T10:37:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

to the example of Mr Cummings. There is an assumption that a person who
is going to meet someone should be transparent about their status and
the purpose of the meeting. So
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T10:37:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Carlisle has agreed to meet someone because they purport to be an
employee of a company that he would trust. Trust is an important
factor. I know that many hon. Members have a principled view that they
will not meet third-party lobbyists. I respect that viewpoint; they are
entitled to it. It is vital that both in-house and third-party
lobbyists are registered, so that others can go on to the
company’s website, type in such-and-such a name and see if they
work for Taylor Wimpey, in this example, or if they work for a third
party<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T10:38:20"></hs_TimeCode>. The hon.
Gentleman may not have agreed to the meeting if the person was a
third-party
lobbyist<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T10:38:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0001.htm#13020139000128">Once
the hon. Gentleman has agreed to a meeting about a particular planning
application—he might serve on a Select Committee and be
approached in that role, or he might be a Front Bencher with a
particular policy responsibility and a company might approach him and
say, “That is within our bivouac. I am keen to meet to make our
points to you,”—it is crucial that the hon. Gentleman is
comfortable that he knows who that individual actually works for. What
should not happen is for the first 45 minutes of the meeting to be
spent on the subject matter on which he has agreed to meet, but then he
is ambushed for the last 15 minutes because the person says, “By
the way, I also happen to represent another completely different
company—“Landmines R Us” in my made-up
example—and while I’ve got you here, I just want to say a
few words about
it.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0001.htm#13020139000129">That
is inappropriate
behaviour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T10:39:24"></hs_TimeCode>. Under
the APPC code, which to an extent is motherhood and apple pie, but none
the less is a step in the right direction, that is not allowed. When a
meeting is requested, it must be clear whether a consultant works for
the company that they purport to represent or is employed as a third
party on its behalf, and the meeting should be on the agreed subject
matter only. If an hon. Member wishes to raise a further matter, that
is for them, but Members should not be
ambushed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T10:40:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0001.htm#13020139000130">When
Mr. Cummings is pitching to clients or has a client, he will often play
off his contacts. To use a legal analogy, we would expect that in
advocating a case the success of those who are fortunate enough to be
lawyers—I use my brief loosely—would be based on the
strength of the argument, not on whether they know the judge. If a
lawyer told a constituent that he should hire him because he knows the
judge and has another case in front of the same judge and so can have a
bit of a word with him, I think the Minister would probably agree that
that would not be acceptable. It is unethical and immoral to both
clients falsely to purport to have a level of influence or access to a
Member of Parliament or councillor on one case and to use it for
another case. Having spoken to colleagues on both sides of the House,
it is probably fair to say that if they were aware that people such as
Mr Cummings were using their access to raise other issues,

Spiritual. The following day, on the chair in my office was a brochure
from the National Secular Society. I thought it had come in the post
and did not think much about it. It went into the round filing cabinet
shortly afterwards. Later my researcher asked if I had seen it and told
me that it had been on the desk when he came into work. I should
probably confess to the Serjeant at Arms that I had not locked my door
overnight. A lobbyist employed by the NSS had been given a pass to the
House of Lords by a peer, whom I shall not name. It turns out that he
was using his pass to walk up and down the corridors of the House of
Commons, dropping off materials to Members. He knocked on my office
door two or three times, just dropped by, without any invitation at
all, looking to have a word with me because I had spoken in the debate.
I think you would probably agree, Mr Speaker, that that is
unacceptable. Here was somebody with privileged access to the House in
a way that other individuals did not have, and used it to obtain undue
influence. I hope that you will look carefully at this issue of peers
providing passes to lobbyists outside. I know that you have established

Mr Cummings’s worst offence. The House will be aware that
particularly in local government there are rules about what councillors
can say publicly and privately during a planning application. That is
true throughout the United Kingdom and there are good reasons for it,
but there are also reasons why a Member on a Select Committee or
considering a matter before the House may wish to keep their counsel on
a particular matter. From time to time, we receive phone calls from

whether there are too many Tescos in the area. The politicians do not
know that that is a complete pile of cobblers. This is an employee of a
lobbying firm who is trying to establish the views of politicians,
either during or before the lodging of planning applications for a
major supermarket, for some housing developers. The problem is that it
is not a crime to impersonate a journalist. I am not sure why someone
would want to impersonate a journalist in particular, but that is the
kind of behaviour that the House would regard as completely
unacceptable. Many developers are not aware that Mr Cummings is using
that tactic, but it needs to be brought to the public’s

Cummings also seems to revel in bullying. He likes to intimidate people
who disagree with his clients’ views. He believes that it is
perfectly acceptable to plant employees in public meetings, to support
his projects. He does the same if there is a rival project. If two
supermarkets or house builders are going for the same development in a
town, for example, and the council has only a limited allocation to
grant, he will put plants into meetings to heckle those who oppose his
clients’ schemes or to whip up opposition to other

amounts of money from local authorities to spend on flower beds and
clean-up-the-village campaigns. It is a statutory consultee on any
planning application. Mr Cummings will find supporters early in the

close with an anecdote about something that affected me personally. As

north of Dunfermline. I supported the local residents near the

things happened that the Minister might want to reflect on. Mr Cummings

adjust the plans. He did not tell the residents who turned up for the
meeting that the so-called independent facilitator was his live-in

support the concept of a register but oppose this Bill. This is a very
complicated issue, and, in all candour, the Bill sidesteps all the
important aspects and all the controversy by kicking that into the long
grass and leaving the Government to do the hard work on the nature of
the lobbying registration council and what should go into a code of
conduct, if there is one, as that could form part of a broader piece of
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T11:04:49"></hs_TimeCode>. The
hon. Gentleman gave examples from elsewhere around the world which,
laser-like, address some of the issues that this Bill fails to go into.

wrong thing, or the flawed thing, in haste. We have seen that far too

and open data alongside lobbying are at the heart of the

statutory register of lobbyists. I welcome that commitment, despite
there being opposing ideas from other individuals in the House and in
Select Committees. I am pleased that the Government have stated that
they will regulate lobbying by introducing a statutory register and
ensuring greater transparency. Transparency in lobbying is important 
<?notus-xml column=1176?>for building the public’s trust. Where lobbying is not
transparent, it can erode public confidence in the political
process—a problem we have seen time and again across a range of
issues. Politics works better when legislators listen to the opinions
not just of constituents but of interested parties such as businesses,
charities, and a wide range of other organisations. That is why I
intervened on the hon. Gentleman to probe the use of the word
“commercial”. The world is more complex than a simple

take the hon. Gentleman’s point, but the reason for using the

putting the wrong legislation in place that does not do the job could
be more damaging than not acting at all. I am not sure that either
“commercial” or “financial” is right.
Probably, looking at international examples, we need to go into
specific detail and potentially exempt organisations rather than define
them in relation to the Bill. Sometimes when we go backwards and
forwards in debating these issues in the Commons, we intuitively think,
“No, those people shouldn’t be included”, but
struggle to find a definition that excludes them. Instead of struggling
with that problem, perhaps a better way
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T11:08:33"></hs_TimeCode> is to
exempt people, in the way the hon. Gentleman suggests lobbying MPs
should be exempted.</hs_Para>

a clear function. It allows the concerns of businesses, charities and
voluntary organisations to be expressed, and it is perfectly acceptable

benefits only the advantaged. The hon. Gentleman referred to a
fictional company, “Landmines R Us”, that we could all
rally against. Equally, though, there are powerful lobby groups that
represent the disadvantaged, Shelter being an obvious example. There
are also charities that represent the third world and developing
countries, not only helping them directly but lobbying Government for
financial gain—not for themselves but for people in those
countries. That is perfectly legitimate, and we would not want to
exclude them or to put additional costs on to them as a result of this

Under the previous Labour Government, commercial lobbyists were
employed by quangos to lobby central Government. This Government feel
that that is inappropriate for a financial reason. It may well also be
inappropriate for reasons of transparency. If 
<?notus-xml column=1178?>future Governments were to do as the previous Government did and
use lobbyists to lobby other parts of the

also a good one. I reel with discomfort at the idea that the body
should involve only lobbyists. It is important for corporate structure
and governance to involve a wide range of people. I would encourage the
body to include people not only from outside, but from within
Government, by which I mean from the civil service or, perhaps, the
House of Commons, to give their perspective. One of the anecdotes used
by the hon. Gentleman was that of someone roaming the corridors with a
pass for one thing but lobbying on another. I do not think that anyone
outside this place would envisage that type of problem, even if it is
not too dissimilar from gaining entry to a tenement block. I think that
a Member of Parliament, alongside a policy-related civil servant, would
add an awful lot of value.
When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T11:15:40"></hs_TimeCode> we set up
these rules, we need to think about how a lobbyist or organisation

we debated who should be registered—whether it should be the

deployed by the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T11:29:59"></hs_TimeCode>that things have
been sufficiently thought through. The examples of the finance director
or board lobbying at a more senior level and a secretary or someone who
had non-contact time but who worked in public affairs were not
considered adequately. The hon. Gentleman spoke of some Members of
Parliament accepting meetings with organisations directly, rather than
lobbyists. I must admit, however, that when I go through my invites I
am much more inclined to meet someone with a solid business title, such
as a chief executive, a finance director or a regional head of a
business, than someone whose title relates to public affairs or
corporate affairs. Inadvertently, I suppose I am pulling those
individuals into the lobbying sphere.  I would worry if this
Bill progressed and the code of conduct remained as defined by the hon.
Gentleman. That would make it less likely for those chief executives
and business leaders to be prepared to lobby me, because they would
need the protection of having to go on the register, which would be
very costly. They could not be fleet of foot. I had a meeting arranged
with a chief executive earlier this week to discuss an issue. They
wanted to lobby me and I wanted to hear about their industry, but their
claim was delayed. They are based 
<?notus-xml column=1179?>overseas and, according to the method that has been

am also unsure about individual registration—giving a
“get out of jail free” card to some of the senior

it the company’s chief executive? These are not insurmountable

I looked at the job titles at a couple of lobbying organisations, I
found them a little confusing. I understand the titles “account

organisations are proud to hire “consultants”. I am not
sure whether that is because they do not have the critical mass
required or because they bring in additional people for certain
clients. However, it is essential that we look at the consultants who
work through such
organisations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T11:19:47"></hs_TimeCode>.

am not convinced that publication every three months is sufficient,

lobbying, although an issue may be long standing for those in the

hours in advance. We will receive a plethora of publications, some of
which are produced not by full-time employees, but by a so-called
consultant—somebody on the lobby firm’s books—whom
they phone up. Such consultants are often the people who are well

unions are lobbyists, but they are certainly not commercial and nor, on

have looked at part of those responses, although not at them all.
Perhaps in her concluding remarks she will indicate when the Government
will respond to the consultation as that would be helpful for the
House. I would certainly find it interesting to read the
Government’s response alongside the summary of responses to the
Cabinet Office consultation document, “Introducing a Statutory
Register of Lobbyists”. The majority of respondents welcomed the
Government’s commitment to achieve greater transparency and were
supportive of a statutory register of lobby interests. However, there
was a definite overlap between the responses on definition and scope;
the definition presented a particular issue for many respondents and
there was a widespread recognition that arriving at the right
definition would be fundamental to the register’s effectiveness.
The Bill completely side-steps that issue, despite making an attempt to
define lobbying.</hs_Para>

overarching theme that emerged from the consultation was that the
proposed definition was narrow, and a number of respondents stressed
that until the definition was clear it would be difficult to determine
other factors raised by the subsequent questions, especially scope.
There was also considerable support for consistency in application to
ensure equal treatment of all parties. In keeping with the emerging
theme on definition, the predominant view expressed under the question
of scope was that a wider scope was preferred but that that should not
result in disproportionate burdens. That is very difficult to do; I
suspect that a balancing act will be needed in relation to scope, and
what is in the code and who should be subject to it.</hs_Para>

general consensus among respondents that it was difficult to address
the question of the information to be provided without clarity on
definition and scope. The majority of respondents favoured the
disclosure of financial information alongside other information. Such
an approach is entirely right; it is insufficient simply to say,
“You are lobbying on behalf of A, B or C.” Although I
said that more information should be available, people can become
bogged down by information if we are talking simply about volume over a
small number of categories and they might not be able to see the bigger
picture. One can imagine lobbyists listing client upon client and our
then finding that they are billing some of them only a few thousand
pounds, whereas they might 
<?notus-xml column=1185?>be charging some of the bigger clients £1 million. Such
information allows us to estimate the size of the work that they are
doing, which then allows people to track things down. They can ask,
“Why are X, Y and Z companies getting £1 million? Why are
they on a £1 million retainer for this?”
People would be able to examine the marketplace, see what lobbying
activity they have said they have done and see press speculation. If
there is any gap, people could investigate further, so that information
would be very useful.</hs_Para>

have already discussed when the register should be updated. The idea of
a formal publication quarterly could work, although we could force
people to register slightly earlier and put things on the internet. The
idea that we should have a quarterly written publication that is
produced and pumped out to all interested parties is somewhat
old-fashioned. It would be quite possible to have a rolling register on
the internet. That may be more appropriate, even if it were to contain
only a rolling number of names of individuals and amounts, prior to a
formal publication each quarter, if indeed that were needed. In the
case of some of the specific examples discussed today, it would be
essential—this is more than a preference—for us to have

have already discussed the issue of funding, so I will not detain the
House any longer on that. Interestingly, there was support for strong
sanctions to apply to the register, so we must ask what happens when
things go wrong. We have not debated that at great length, but it goes
to the heart of the matter. If someone could carry on acting in the
same way, there would be little point in the register. This is not a
monitoring exercise. We should not feel better about ourselves just
because we catch people doing wrong—or what we perceive to be
wrong. That is what we legislate for; this should be about improving
the quality of democracy. We need to consider the sanctions. We need to
consider how we fine people and whether it is purely a matter for the
lobbying registration council or whether the state should take a
greater view. Are we going to say that in some cases it is a criminal
offence to do certain things in respect of lobbying rather than saying
that it is an offence against the lobbying registration council that
will be punished internally? Are we saying that the law is sufficient
at the moment? This matter is crucial and, as on the code of conduct,
it will be incumbent on the Government when they publish a draft Bill
to give us a copy of the documents that they are proposing, even if
some of the detail is not included and even if the documents are only
in draft. Without that information it will be very hard to see from the
Government Bill whether it is indeed the appropriate way forward.
Cross-party support would be encouraged by the publication of as much
information as possible, particularly on the issue of sanctions, which

before I do so I shall touch on issues in the United Kingdom. The UK
has a specific problem with commercial lobbying in the House of
Commons, and it relates to all-party groups. We have not discussed this
matter in detail, but we have touched on it tangentially. I am sure
that many of us here are members of all-party groups, which provide a
strong function for the House of Commons, despite confusion among the
public as to what an all-party group does and what a Select Committee
does. Sometimes, these groups are sparsely attended by MPs and Lords,
but are very professional operations, and sometimes at their heart are
industry

all-party groups; for instance, they might want a genuine debate on
their broad subject area. I am sure, however, that we have all felt
uncomfortable about the dominance of funding in certain all-party

will try to be brief, but there are a number of countries with really
interesting examples. Just before I leave the European Union, I want to
point out that it has gone for a wide scope, yet it leaves out certain
organisations, one category of which is described as “social
partners”. I was not quite sure what social partners were,
particularly in the light of the debate that we will have next Tuesday,
but it turns out that they include trade unions and trade associations,
both of which I would like to see included in the register. So if four
or five companies in, say, the concrete industry had their own lobbying
organisations, those organisations would have to be in the register,
but if they spent the same money employing a trade association to do
the same job, that trade association would not have to be in the
register. That is absolutely bonkers, but it illustrates how the
European Parliament has done what I fear the Bill might do, and what
the Government might be tempted to do. I fear that, in the interest of
trying to do the right thing, they might actually cause a lot more
confusion and complexity.

subject is much greater than mine. The arrangements are even more
ludicrous than I had thought. Even here in the UK we have some
ludicrous examples. One person on the Greater London assembly has told
me that, when they are invited out to lunch with someone who might be a
friend but who might also be lobbying them, they look down the menu and
pick whatever ensures that they stay below the threshold, simply to
avoid the administrative hassle, rather than to avoid declaring the

area in which the Americans have got it right is setting out details of
punishment for people who do not comply with the regulations. The Bill
does not touch on that matter, and it has not been discussed today.
Turning to neighbouring Canada, its first attempt to regulate lobbying
was the Lobbyists Registration Act, which came into force in 1989. It
was not the first such attempt in the world; I will come to the
Australian example later, if time permits. That 1989 Act provided for
the public registration of individuals paid to lobby public office
holders. It covered consultant lobbyists, commercial in-house lobbyists
and not-for-profit organisations. It is interesting that it included
that last category; the Bill does not do so, and I think that that area
needs much greater consideration, particularly as not-for-profit
organisations sometimes have commercial arms that cross-subsidise their
other work. The lines between each type of work are often
unclear.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000266" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0001.htm#13020139000266">In
Australia, the first attempt at regulating the lobbying industry was
the lobbyist registration scheme of 1983. The scheme set up two
confidential registers: one for lobbyists representing foreign clients
and a general one for lobbyists representing domestic clients. It is
fascinating to think about how that worked; I cannot really see the
need for two registers. The scheme required lobbyists to apply to
register each time they took on a client and to give a short
description of the task undertaken. Although I like the idea of having
ample information, I am concerned that some of it might be commercially
sensitive. A lobbying organisation might want to speak to the
Government and other people about a new product and how it would fit in
within existing legislation, but might not want to give competitors an
idea of what exactly is going

I conclude, I would like to mention some other organisations that have
registers and some of the issues they face, as a way of probing some of
the complexity and detail that surrounds any register. The General
Dental Council, for example, is governed by the Dentists Act 1984,
which provides for a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to
£5,000. This Bill, however, which is not self-regulatory, does
not state what the fines will be or, indeed, whether there
will  be a criminal fine at all. Costs to the GDC are about
£24 million, but we have had no indication of the
cost of the commercial lobbyist register; nobody has provided any
information. One of the weaknesses of private Members’ Bills,
alongside their many benefits, is that there is no regulatory
assessment and no clear statement of the burdens placed on businesses.
It is clear in the case of this Bill that there will be significant
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T12:08:02"></hs_TimeCode>. There are
about 38,000 dentists, but no one has identified how many lobbyists
there are, and this is particularly worrying given the lack of clarity
over whether chief executives, finance directors or secretaries of
public affairs departments need to register. The size of the register
has not been considered.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13020139000272" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0001.htm#13020139000272"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T12:08:19"></hs_TimeCode>Ofsted
is another interesting example. A vast number of cases and
concerns—whole processes—are at issue, including failing
to comply with a register, but we have not probed or even touched on
those points in this debate. If we allow this Bill to pass, I wonder
whether we will be in Committee for

we have heard, it is important that we have the right register and the

where we need to be. It is important that there is no cost to the
taxpayer. A register should therefore be funded by industry and it
should comprise all those who lobby, including agencies and in-house
lobbyists. Although meetings with third-party lobbyists make up less
than 1% of all meetings with Ministers, they allow vested interests to
hide their lobbying activity from the public eye. We therefore support
the inclusion of a code of conduct. It is necessary if the register is
to be enforceable, as my hon. Friend set out, and it is sensible that
it be drawn up by an industry council. A model similar to that of the

commitment to a statutory register is there, repeated on page 39,
although with no further details about when or what it might look
like—a commitment with no action associated with it. The
commitment was in the same box as the boundary review. Those of us on
the Opposition Benches are beginning to wonder whether the
Government’s plans for the register have gone the same way as
those for the boundary review. We sincerely hope that is not the case.
Whatever the reason, it is unfortunate that here we are, halfway

Nuttall:</Member></B> I start from the position that we jumped into
this debate this morning and overlooked whether we need a register in
the first place. It seemed to be accepted from the moment that the
debate started nearly three hours ago that it was all about how one
defines a lobbyist and lobbying, whereas I want to start with what is
the problem. The Bill’s promoter cited one or two specific
instances that he was concerned about, but as always I would argue that
one or two cases make bad law. We should not pick on one or two
instances, which seemed to border on criminal behaviour, to claim that
the solution is to introduce a register for lobbyists. Just as we
cannot rid society of theft or burglary by making them criminal
offences, if there is a problem with lobbying and lobbyists the answer
is not to provide yet more regulation. It is almost as though
legislators look around society to find a group that is not legislated
for and then come up with a scheme to bring them under the control of
the legislature.</hs_Para>

common ground among Members on both sides of the House and from all
parties that when one arrives in this place one soon begins to realise
that the real power lies with the civil service. In fact, it is often
the civil servants the lobbyists want to see, because they know that
influencing the thinking of the civil service can be far more effective

see what would be the benefit to society of having a register of
lobbyists. I can see lots of downsides, but I cannot see its purpose.
Would it really be the case that every time somebody rang up to make an
appointment with a Member, they, or their staff, would bother to
consult it? It just would not happen, and even if it did, I cannot see
what the purpose would be. Members of the lobbying profession are
often, by definition, in the business of promoting themselves. Their
websites often contain huge lists of their clients; it is not as though
they are trying to hide on whose behalf they are acting. When somebody
rings up, one knows straight away, or can quickly find out by asking
one or two questions, on whose behalf they are calling.

brings me on to the question of how the register would be arranged and
organised and, more importantly, who would keep it. The Bill suggests
that a new organisation, the lobbying registration council—not a
new quango but a new industry-funded body—would be responsible
for maintaining and supervising the register and keeping it up to date.
However, we have no idea of what particulars would be entered on it. It
is a blank canvas. Obviously, there would be the name and address of
the company or individual and details of their clients, but how long
would it be before someone said, “Well, frankly, that’s
not much use”? It would be the thin end of the wedge. I suspect
that those who thought that it was a good idea to have a register would
soon be saying, “What we really want is to know who these
lobbyists have met, and we want that recorded on the register. We want
to know for how long they met a given individual, where they met, what
was the purpose of the meeting, and what was its outcome.”
Before long, what started off as a simple register of names, addresses
and lists of clients would develop into an enormous database of facts
and figures and lists of meetings. It would become a bureaucratic
nightmare for those involved in the lobbying
industry.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-01?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_01_PT_1/F12C08B1544C7C71B5EA3991F3CB8AB63840942B" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="1 February 2013">Friday

that which the Bill proposes, which is statutorily based. The lobbying
registration council will be funded by those who will pay to be on the
register, so in order to determine the cost of registration we have to

According to clause 3, a breach of the proposed code of conduct will be
a criminal offence. I presume that the police would have to investigate
complaints of any breaches and that the Crown Prosecution Service would
have to consider whether to press charges, so the cost to the public

the chance later, I will address the fact that, before long, it will be
argued that he who pays the piper calls the tune. This is meant to be a
self-funded organisation, so it follows that, as soon as the first
scandal arises—and, as sure as eggs is eggs, it
will—everybody will say, “Ah! That’s happened
because the organisation that’s meant to be supervising the
register is paid for by the industry itself. It’s not an
effective regulator after all. It’s not keeping an effective
register. It’s not doing its job.” Before long, there
will be calls for the organisation to be removed from
“self-regulation” and for it to be paid for by the public
purse. As my hon. Friend has said, however, even before we get to that
stage there will be increased costs for the public purse, even if
complaints are unproven and the police say there is no cause for
prosecution. Given that we do not know what will be in the code, we do

likely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000322" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000322"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T12:44:19"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T12:44:13"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Philip Davies" PimsId="4767" UID="13020139000785" xid="887" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000785">Philip

other people are. In a healthy democracy, everybody lobbies their MP. I

going down the street and somebody will tap me on the shoulder and say,
“I know it’s the weekend, but I would like to have a

explain their point of view and to influence me. That is the nature of
representative democracy in this country; it happens every day of the

that, just as we saw last week with the Offshore Gambling Bill,
something that ostensibly starts out as a good idea will rapidly turn
into the opposite of that. Given that the Act would apply only to
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, we may find that
lobbying organisations faced with enormous regulation and fees will
move offshore. They will say, “I’m not staying here and
paying vast fees of thousands and thousands of pounds each year; I will
move.” They will move offshore, either to Gibraltar or indeed

isolation; that can be done only when we look at what we are trying to
deal with. Like him, I have not been persuaded today as to what problem

the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Dunfermline and West Fife, he did not put himself in this
camp—is some kind of view that lobbying, particularly commercial
lobbying, is a bad, grubby thing that should be discouraged. We appear
to be trying to find a way to clamp down on commercial lobbying. The
consequence—where we will end up with all of this
agenda—is that we will make Members of Parliament lobby shy. We
seem to be trying to get to the stage where Members of Parliament
avoid, at all costs, coming into contact with lobbyists—
particularly “commercial lobbyists”, as they are
described—and that would be a very dangerous
thing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000340" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000340"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>I

who would want to describe at length my ignorance on a range of issues.
I acknowledge that; we cannot be experts in every subject. We know more
about certain subjects than others, based on our interests and our
experience, but there are many, many issues where our knowledge is
limited. I have many such subjects. How on earth are we supposed to
learn about them? How are we supposed to learn about the different
points of view that people have in a debate?</hs_Para>

are many occasions when constituents contact me about issues on which I
have a very limited knowledge, inviting me to agree with them about

popular point of view, at least superficially. I like to say to my
constituents, “I understand the point you are making. You
appear, at face value, to be making a very good point. But before I
commit myself one way or the other I would like to hear the other
opinion.” If it is not a popular opinion, with no great
groundswell of public support for it, that does not make it any less
valid and it does not make it any less important that the voice is
heard. Occasionally, the only people prepared to put such a point of
view are lobbyists, and in order to do that they are often paid by the
organisation concerned. I think that is a perfectly respectable thing
for them to do. The view may well be completely unpopular and it may be

public—to clean it up. If I understood, that was also the case
that the shadow Minister made: the Bill would legitimise, not stop,
lobbying and make it seem more above board. That is a naive view. I do
not think it will happen. I see the merit of the view of thinking,
“Hold on. This lobbying is a bit murky, a bit behind closed
doors. I wonder what’s going on. Let’s try and open it
up, and all of a sudden the public will think lobbying a mighty fine
thing,” but I am afraid they will not think
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000345" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000345">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T13:01:28"></hs_TimeCode>
fact, I suspect that instead of combating that attitude the Bill would
make those points of view even noisier. If every MP had to register
every meeting with a commercial or any other lobbyist—how on
earth that would work, I do not know, but that is the agenda in the
Bill—does anyone really think that certain interest groups and
members of the public who take this cynical view would say,
“Well, that’s fine, because it’s now all above
board”? No, they will pore over every statement we make and
every meeting we have had, and say, “Well, they’re only
saying that because they had that meeting with that particular
group.” This would not legitimise lobbying or make it any
better. It would make it even worse, in terms of public opinion. It is
naive to think otherwise.</hs_Para>

have no problem telling them, and I would like to think that that would

Friend’s cynicism about fees, in the sense that we all know

fees that could be charged. Just to make a suggestion, perhaps the fees
would be no more than the £200 to £300 that

probably right. It is not an exact comparison, but we are seeing the
start of something similar with the Press Complaints Commission. It is
a self-funded body, but it is seen as being too close to the industry
it is supposed to be looking after, so people are asking whether that
is good enough and whether we need to do something else or get the
state more involved. We can see how these things develop, and there is

from one of my ministerial colleagues, I have certainly learned a new

interested in the opposite idea of consensus. I know we have all

careful to get such legislation

something about transparency. The Government already release a
significant amount of information—which Members and anyone else
who is observing our debate can find on the website
data.gov. uk.—and we have made a clear commitment to
increasing the transparency of what we do and making it easier for the
public to hold politicians and public bodies to account. That has
resulted in the quarterly publication of details of ministerial
meetings and Government procurement, and a number of other items of
public interest.</hs_Para>

what was said by, for instance, the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne
Central (Chi Onwurah) about the importance of transparency
and the efforts made by many Governments in that regard. In my view,
the present Government publish an unprecedented amount of information
about those who are met by Ministers and senior officials, but at
present it is not always obvious whom those people represent. The
Government therefore want a register that will bring more transparency
to the lobbying
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000378" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000378">With
that in mind, I accept that some elements of the hon.
Gentleman’s proposals have merit. I think he grasps the
importance of having a relatively simple register that does not impose
disproportionate burdens on those who are required to comply with his
Bill. The Government are also determined to avoid unnecessary
regulatory burdens which would prove detrimental to the United Kingdom
economy. I am very mindful of the costs that may be associated with the
statutory register, and I want to explore that issue fully as we
develop and introduce our own
proposals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000379" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000379">The
hon. Gentleman recognises the importance of avoiding ambiguity when
defining lobbying activity. That, too, is a view that I heard loud and
clear in the responses to last year’s consultation. The
Government are making it a priority to consider a wide range of
definitions, including international definitions. I pay tribute to my
hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend East (James
Duddridge), who gave us a tour d’horizon of the systems used
elsewhere. The parameters of the chosen definition will be made very
clear in the context of the UK lobbying industry: I intend there to be
no scope for ambiguity, so that we can ensure the success and
effectiveness of the
register.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000380" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000380">The
hon. Gentleman also recognises that there is little appetite for a
publicly funded register of lobbyists, and his proposals for a
fee-based system are certainly worth considering. A range of responses
to the consultation dealt with that point; they can be found in
“A Summary of Responses to the Cabinet Office's Consultation
Document ‘Introducing a Statutory Register of
Lobbyists’”, which has already been brandished by my hon.
Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend East.</hs_Para>

other parts of the Bill which I believe need further exploration. There
is, for example, the hon. Gentleman’s proposal for the
establishment of a lobbying registration council, for which he was
taken to task in some detail by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury
North (Mr Nuttall). I think that it is an interesting idea, but, like
others, I should like to know more about the council’s

Gentleman proposes that the Secretary of State should be able to
decide, through secondary legislation, what level of information
disclosure should be required of those who are on the register. I
should like to go into the matter in more detail with the hon.
Gentleman. I look forward to working with him constructively on that
and other issues, including the issue of the code of practice which his
Bill empowers the council to draw up. That is clearly a significant
role for the council, and I should like to know how the necessary
authority and expertise could be channelled in a way that would enable
the code to be effective and enforceable.</hs_Para>

Smith:</Member></B> That takes me to exactly the points to which I want
to return. As I have said, the Government are committed to the
establishment of a statutory register of lobbyists, which we think
would be an important step towards making politics more transparent. I
certainly think it important to open up politics and make it more
accessible to everyone. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that lobbying
has an important function in politics, namely the putting forward of
legitimate views when they are held. That helps in the development of
better legislation. However, we need to address the question the hon.
Gentleman raises: what is the gap that needs to be filled in this
case?</hs_Para>

consultation on introducing a statutory register of lobbyists, various
parties, organisations, individuals and businesses told us what the
register should look like and what the gap is. That information is
helping the Government reach conclusions on some very tricky questions,
such as how would we should define “lobbyist” and
“lobbying”, what sort of information should be held on
the register, and what penalties should be imposed on those who do not
register. The hon. Gentleman has made various suggestions, which I want
to take into account alongside those received from the Political and

point that the Under-Secretary makes very well in his book is that this
works both ways. The Chief of the Defence Staff and the Chief of the
General Staff have also made that point. The Minister of State will
recall that when we had the privilege of serving together on the Armed
Forces Public Bill Committee we discussed the difference between our
culture and that of the United States, which holds its armed forces in
great respect. On the rare occasions that you get away from the House
of Commons, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and travel to an airport in the United
States, you will often find a VSO office providing refreshments and the
opportunity to enjoy some relaxation. Regrettably, we have not yet
persuaded our airports to do something similar. Perhaps the Minister
will reflect on how we could do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000416" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000416">The
Chief of the Defence Staff makes the valid point that members of the
armed forces have not always helped themselves. There is an ill-judged
perception that some soldiers have gone looking for trouble. I think
that perception is false, but I welcome what Army representatives said
to the Defence Committee—that the issue is a cultural thing that
they are working on. That is why the Bill is so important. It says that
we recognise that the military have to do more, but we have to do more

military.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000417" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000417"><Member ContinuationText="James Duddridge" PimsId="4769" UID="13020139000814" xid="881" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000814"><B>James

nearly one in 20 of the 9,000 personnel surveyed had had experience of
violence or attempted violence in the previous five years. We should
put this into perspective by saying that the level of violence towards
other uniformed organisations—our fire service, ambulance
service and police service—is equally appalling. I understand
that there are differing circumstances. I also recognise that other

sending a message of support to our troops in saying that we want them
to be uniformed when off duty or going about their business, because

are in a peculiar position compared with an accountant or a banker in
making representations to Members of Parliament, and rightly

me turn to the detail of the Ashcroft report. We should not overplay
the scale of the problem. We have said that one is too many, but 80% of
our armed forces have not experienced problems or discrimination. In
fact, 56% had had strangers come up to them and offer support, 29% had
had strangers come up to them and offer to buy them a drink to thank
them for the very good work that they are doing, and 26% had had
spontaneous offers of discounts in shops and
businesses—something that I would fully encourage. There were
some problems at the other end of the scale, but there were many more
positive than negative responses.</hs_Para>

is important that we send out a message to the armed forces that we
support them and that we do take this seriously, but that in all
probability they will not experience problems when going out and about
in their uniform, which is a very positive thing to do in order to
create civic pride and ensure that there is no gap between citizens and
servicemen. It allows people to start conversations about what the
armed forces do, it encourages recruitment, and it helps to do away
with stereotypes in any way, shape or form. Although it is right to
have this debate, I would not want members of the armed services to get
the message that this is a massive problem which should deter them from
wearing their uniform in public. In fact, as the Ashcroft report
demonstrates, they are much more likely to be offered thanks, support,
drinks and discounts than to experience any

Rochford and Southend East there seems to be a worrying number of

to raise standards overall. It is unacceptable to shout abuse at
anyone, whether it be racist, homophobic or religious. The Ashcroft
report states that some of those who responded to its survey had
suffered absolute discrimination, such as being refused service in pubs
or hotels, and 6% suffered violence or attempted violence. We should
not necessarily distinguish between violence against someone in an Army

mentioned. I am pleased that the Government and Members from all parts
of the House—even our absent Liberal Democrat
friends—have supported making progress on the covenant, although
perhaps not as quickly as some of us would like. That reflects the
widespread support for our armed forces, which I think has increased
enormously in recent years. Perhaps that is because of their enormously
important and professional work in the military action that we have
taken in various parts of the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000445" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000445">A
key principle of the covenant is that no one in the service community
should face disadvantage because of their service. That needs to be
applied right across society. I therefore welcome the Bill because it
seeks to strengthen the covenant further by making a simple change to
the Criminal Justice Act 2003. It would add service in the forces to
the characteristics of a victim that can constitute an aggravating
factor when the offender is sentenced. That protection is in place in
relation to race, religion, disability and sexual orientation. We think

give up freedoms that their fellow citizens perhaps sometimes take for

other members of the wider armed forces community, succeed only in
diminishing themselves. In this House we can debate the best way of
combating discrimination, but there is no dispute about the
objective.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000456" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000456">Discrimination
can take many forms. Some of it is thoughtless or uninformed, for
example, when public services fail to take account of the special
circumstances in which armed forces personnel find themselves. Some of
it is based on myth and prejudice—a view that soldiers create
trouble or are unreliable customers. Like the hon. Member for
Dunfermline and West Fife, I do not believe that that is normally the
case, but we have to accept that some people have that misperception
and we must challenge it.

discrimination or abuse stems from genuine hostility to members of the

Bill would have the effect of amending section 146 of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003, which lays down circumstances in which the
criminal courts must treat an offence as aggravated, for the purpose of
deciding on the appropriate sentence. The aggravating factors currently
set out in section 146 are that the offender either demonstrates, or is
motivated by, a hostility towards the victim which is based on the
victim’s disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity.
Section 145 of that

contrast, converting the flexibility that the courts currently exercise
into a mandatory requirement—which is what the Bill
says—would present them with practical difficulties. For
example, in demonstrating to a court that the aggravating factor was
present and should apply, the prosecution would need to show that the
hostility was present. Perhaps that would be relatively straightforward
in the case of a soldier in uniform, but the Bill as drafted extends
the same protection to those not in uniform, which might be more
difficult to prove. As we have seen, this provision also includes the
families of service personnel and our veteran community—all 4.6
million of them, or about one in 10 of the adult population of this

the Bill as drafted, the court would presumably have to decide whether
the offender was aware of that fact and whether it motivated the
effect. The court might need to establish whether a victim was a
relative—“any relative”—of a member of the
armed forces. How are the courts to deal with a situation where an
offence is motivated by excessive rivalry between different sections of
the armed forces or, perhaps, a domestic dispute? A mandatory
requirement for a higher sentence reduces the courts’ ability to

the courts already have sufficient power to increase sentences if they
believe that such sentiments were an aggravating factor, but can make
that choice at their own discretion. It is not as though the courts
could not do that without the Bill. They already can; it is just that
the Bill would mandate them to do so, which might lead to some

to be considered part of those communities, and rightly so. We should
not necessarily put them in a position where they are forced to explain
why they require protection in law in a way that is not enjoyed by, for
example, firemen or ambulance staff. It is a firm principle of the
armed forces covenant that special provision for service people may be
appropriate in some cases, but I am not necessarily convinced at this
stage that the way the hon. Gentleman has drafted his Bill would
achieve the desired effect.</hs_Para>

we have to recognise that the criminal law is a devolved matter. The
hon. Gentleman is aware that this is a difficult area—in
fairness to him, the Bill clearly states that, as drafted, it extends
to England and Wales only, so he is definitely cognisant of
that—but the Bill opens the way to a situation where offences
against members of the armed services could be handled differently
across the UK. We have no interest in creating further anomalies of
this kind. I have no doubt that the Scottish Parliament would be as
firm as Westminster in its views on discrimination, but we also need to
acknowledge and recognise that the question is perhaps not as
straightforward when seen from the perspective of Belfast. The
introduction of a provision similar to the one we are discussing today
could, practically, be quite problematic in Northern Ireland under
certain circumstances.</hs_Para>

pointing out the problems with the Bill, I would not wish the House to
draw the conclusion that the Government are complacent or that we are
doing nothing to counter discrimination against service
personnel—quite the opposite. The armed forces covenant and the
principles that we enshrined in statute in 2011 have a high profile
across the whole of Whitehall and beyond. The first principle, that
members of the armed forces community should not suffer disadvantage as
a result of that membership, has given rise to many initiatives that
are making a real, practical
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:19:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000485" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000485">In
the first statutory annual report on the armed forces covenant,
published in December 2012, we described what we were doing to make
those principles a reality. Let me give the House some examples. We are
working to remove the disadvantage that the children of service
personnel can face in the schools system as a result of their mobility,
through the admissions code and through the service pupil premium. We
have been consulting on the disadvantages faced by reservists in the
workplace. We are ensuring that service personnel and leavers encounter
a level playing field in access to social housing or Government-funded
home ownership
schemes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000486" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000486">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-01T14:20:33"></hs_TimeCode>
the same time, we are working to build the links between the armed
forces community and the wider community, to improve the knowledge and
understanding that must be at the centre of that relationship. From
knowledge flows the esteem for our service men and women that is
ultimately the most powerful way to counter discrimination. The
community covenant has now been signed in over 230 local authority
areas from Cornwall to the north of Scotland, signifying a real
determination to strengthen ties with the armed forces. I am confident
that, during the year, it will continue to gain further support. The
grant scheme linked to the community covenant has allowed us to back a
range of schemes that will help to put those declarations into
practice. To that, we can now add the £35 million fund 
<?notus-xml column=1224?>created as a result of the LIBOR fines, which will support charities

are a blessed nation. When God made this great world of ours, He gave
India the Himalayas, He gave Brazil the Amazon rain forest, and He gave
South Africa the savannah. Then God thought to Himself, “What
can I give that great country, England? What can I give England that it
can be proud of?”, and He gave us 85% of the world’s
chalk streams. The world’s chalk streams are one of the most
precious previous ecosystems available, and God decided that we should
have custody of 85% of that resource; so we are indeed a blessed
nation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13020139000535" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/debtext/130201-0002.htm#13020139000535">As
I grew up with my grandfather in Hampshire and Wiltshire, I spent many
happy days trundling down the river banks, fishing rod in hand, with my
grandfather carrying the picnic basket containing the tomato soup and
my grandmother’s cheese and ham baps. We would sit there on the
river bank, looking at the sparkling water, the kingfishers, the
damselflies, the mayflies and the water voles, and the two of us, for
that moment in time, were kings. But now, I am afraid, the House must
hear the bad news. For the last 30 or 40 years, we have watched our
precious chalk streams die. We have watched them drain away, abstracted
to death.</hs_Para>

grandfather died in January 2012, I visited the River Kennet at Manton,
where we had had so many adventures together. I stood in that river
with the former Member of Parliament for Reading, West, Martin Salter,
and it was dry: dry as a bone. We stood in that river with my hon.
Friend the Member for Devizes (Claire Perry), in whose constituency it
falls. It was dry; it had gone. There was no more water, and there was
no more wildlife: no voles, no fly life, no fish, nothing. There was
just a tiny puddle in the weir pool. I said that there were no fish,
but in fact there were about 20 fish left in the weir pool, clinging on
for life.</hs_Para>

January 2012, when we were facing an environmental disaster. We were
only saved by a once-in-a-hundred-years event—the coming of the
great rains in the spring of last year, which lasted throughout the
summer and continued into the winter. Without those rains, there would
have been standpipes across the country, and we would have been in
crisis. Cobra would have been meeting. That is how close we were to the
water system failing and our losing many more of our rivers, not just
the upper Kennet.</hs_Para>

a result of this near-disaster, the all-party group on angling and

Yorkshire, as well as in Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire—held
a summit at Stockbridge. The mood was one of extreme anger because this

Environment Agency attended that summit meeting, and its civil servants
looked us in the eye and assured us that it had the highest regard for
our chalk streams, and that it was committed to conserving them and
making sure they remained for future generations to enjoy. I do not
want to say this, but I am going to: what total and utter rubbish. You
can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can’t fool
all the people all the time. I said to those at the EA, “You
come and visit our streams in Hertfordshire and
Buckinghamshire.” If they were to visit them today, they would
need a pair of waders, as we have had historically high levels of
rainfall, but if they had come last spring, they would not have needed
to bring waders, or even gumboots or ankle-boots. In fact they could
have brought their bedroom slippers and still not got their feet wet,
because these rivers have been abstracted to death, and some of them
are not even there any more. Last year, we lost three, and another two
were 50% dried up. They will come back, but there will not be any
wildlife in them, there will not be any fly life and there will not be
any fish.</hs_Para>

really sticks in the craw is that the EA puts out press releases

abstraction. The last major reservoir that was built in the south-east

litres of water a day across the region, and, as I have said, there are

are on the cusp of an historic event, as the draft water Bill will soon
come before the House. The Bill must be robust. First, it must deal
with Ofwat. I am not going to pull my punches: Ofwat is a really
shocking organisation. It really is a disgrace, and it has worked
against conservation in this country for many years. It has no regard
for conservation. It is not interested in what happens in the natural
environment. If a water company wants to install metering to try to
reduce usage, it will not happen if it is going to cost anybody any
money. Ofwat needs to be given some responsibility for the
environmental consequences of its actions. We cannot carry on in the

far better at capturing and storing water. We currently have an
abundance of water, but a lot of it is going down the rivers into the
sea. As a result, it is replenishing the aquifers, which is a good
thing, but the aquifers will be sucked dry again and in two or three
years we will right back where we started. That means rivers that
barely flow, rivers that do not support any life, rivers that are in
essence dead—environmental vandalism on a extraordinary scale.
As I said, how dare we lecture the developing world on its
responsibilities to its natural environment when we so casually
disregard our responsibilities to our natural

was educated in America, where people are far more aggressive in
pursuit of conservation issues. Trout Unlimited in America routinely
takes state and federal Governments to court when they are letting down
the natural environment. It mounts court cases, fights court cases and
wins court cases. I do not advocate direct action in this country.
Sometimes I want to man the barricades, break the water pumps, let
people know how I feel, burning tyres in the street in Stockbridge, for
example, to make the point, but that is not the way forward. It might
be tempting, it might be momentarily attractive to become a sort of
middle-class Swampy, but that is not the way forward.

Conservatives sweep the board in 2015, but I am almost sure that he has
another two and a half years in that Department and I will ask him to
do great things while he is there. This is not just about fishing, as
much as I love fishing and catching beautiful wild brown trout that
have swum our rivers since the ice age; it is about how we treat and

environmental body that brought together local authorities, parishes,
the local community, Thames Water, and the then National Rivers

river, to achieve better flows and to protect the environment. It was a
passion that I had then over 20 years ago, and it is one that I now

rightly says that our water resources are under pressure from
development and a growing population, changes in lifestyle and changes
in the climate, but there have been a number of changes in recent years
that may just put us more in the right direction. One of them is the
clear driver towards sustainable development. To me, that means
developers having to prove as part of the planning process that what
they are doing will at the very least have a minimal impact on the
environment. In terms of water usage, that includes the demand end of
the water supply in the home right through to the impact on the

described them as a divine gift, but whatever hon. Members believe,

1963 (“the Vienna convention”). The proposal
meets the criteria set out in the coalition agreement with regard to EU

proposal because it will be of general benefit to EU citizens but it
will not create any obligations in the

proposed decision authorises member states which are contracting
parties to the Vienna convention to ratify the protocol of 12 September
1997 amending  the Vienna convention in the interest of the
European Union, or to accede to it. The Vienna convention was
established to ensure fair and adequate compensation is available in
the event of a nuclear accident. The protocol amendments will be
beneficial to potential victims of nuclear accidents for which nuclear
operators in states that are contracting parties to the Vienna
convention are responsible. In particular, they mean that an increased
amount of compensation will be available in respect of a broader range
of damage across a wider geographical
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13020133000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130201/wmstext/130201m0001.htm#13020133000025">The

convention, that is Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,
Lithuania, Slovakia and Poland (Latvia and Romania have already
ratified the 1997 protocol). The proposal will not apply to the UK
which is party to another international convention on liability for
nuclear damage—the Paris convention on third party liability in
the field of nuclear energy of 29 July 1960 as amended—which is

Barker:</Member></B> The differences exist between the cashback scheme
in Scotland and the scheme in England and Wales because promotion of
energy efficiency is a devolved matter. Scottish Ministers opted to use
Scotland's share of the Green Deal incentive funds in order to design
and deliver its own scheme, to ensure that it could be integrated with
Scottish Government programmes and meet the specific needs of Scottish
householders. This also secured a pro rata share for Scotland. The
justification for the design of the Scottish scheme is a matter for
Scottish Ministers, and was not influenced by DECC. DECC has not
estimated the differences on take-up between the two schemes.</hs_Para>

the project, our starting assumption is that the funding and financing
of HS2 infrastructure would come in large part from central government
funds. While our base assumption is that Government is likely to have a
central role in driving forward investment in this vital infrastructure
for the country we would examine the potential for private financing to
reduce the up-front capital demand on the taxpayer and offer-value for
money. The construction costs estimated at this stage are for an
initial preferred route which begins the process of engagement to
determine the final route. The Government's initial preferred route,
station and depot options for Phase Two are estimated at around
£16.8 billion, without the spur to Heathrow. This cost figure
falls within the cost range that HS2 Ltd produced for Phase Two of
£15.7 billion to £18.7 billion, reflecting the necessary
uncertainty involved in producing costs at this early stage in the
project.</hs_Para>
