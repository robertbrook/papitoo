that of his constituents for what the coalition Government is doing.
Following on from the document “Signing the Way”, which I
launched in October 2011, we have provided every English authority with
a traffic sign authorisation to use speed limit repeater signs in place
of physical measures in 20 mph zones, and that will reduce the costs
for local authorities in Northamptonshire and elsewhere. This
authorisation also enables local authorities to place advisory
part-time 20 mph speed limit signs in the vicinity of schools without
the need for central Government approval. Councils can also now use
roundels on the road to replace some upright
signs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0001.htm#13022853000077"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Barry Sheerman" PimsId="663" UID="13022853000921" xid="531" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0001.htm#13022853000921"><B>Mr

the level of transport investment that the Government has committed to,

northern hub is being funded in its entirety. We are also seeing
investment in new and reopened lines such as the Oxford-Bedford line,
in redoubled lines such as the Swindon-Kemble line, and in new stations

Yorkshire and Coventry—six of which have already been opened. We

The Department for Transport has been championing the needs of bus
passengers very firmly since this Government took office. We have
introduced a whole range of new funding streams, as well as better bus
areas, money for the smart card roll-out and the fourth round of the
green bus fund. We have also made huge investments in bus corridors in
Manchester, Bristol and elsewhere. This is all designed to help
passengers, so I am afraid that the hon. Lady’s premise is
simply wrong. In regard to better bus areas and quality contracts, I

the issue, however, she is not right. The Prime Minister was quite
right yesterday and let me reiterate what he said. If we did not have

apply. The former Secretary of State,

principal rules for co-operation and competition would have applied in
the same way before the last election. If he and the hon. Lady look at
the regulations properly, which of course I have, they will see that it
is possible to proceed without a competition on a single tender basis.
The regulations, for the first time, create a structure that allows for
“any qualified provider”. That is exactly what was said
during the passage of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and what is
stated in the Act. There is no change in policy. The regulations enable
commissioners to go for whoever is best placed to improve the quality
of the services, meet the needs of people who use the services and
improve efficiency, including through an “any qualified
provider” route rather than a competitive tendering

Government’s intention to have a debate on that issue. He will
also know, however, that on 15 January he and his colleagues went to
the Backbench Business Committee to ask for time for a debate, but it
has not been scheduled. We must remember that as a general proposition
this House resolved that the Backbench Business Committee should take
responsibility for a wide range of debates, including general debates.
If we start to re-import an expectation that the Government will
provide time for such debates, it will by extension be impossible to
allocate the same amount of time to the Backbench Business Committee.
We will have a debate on the Francis report and discuss between
ourselves how that is to be accomplished at the appropriate moment. I
continue to make the general point of principle that the Backbench
Business Committee exists in part to enable the House to debate current
important issues, as it did with Hillsborough, for

In March 2011 I accepted an invitation to Cheltenham races from
Ladbrokes, which I properly and accurately registered in the Register
of Members’ Financial Interests. However, I failed to refer to
my entry in the register when I tabled three parliamentary questions on
problem gambling, when I led an Adjournment debate on problem gambling,
and during an inquiry into the Gambling Act 2005 held by the Select
Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, on which I serve and to which
the chief executive of Ladbrokes gave evidence. A complaint was
subsequently made to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. All
other complaints made by the person concerned were

was made aware of the complaint, I told the Parliamentary Commissioner
for Standards that I believed that I should have referred to my entry
on those occasions. My failure to do so was due not to a desire to
conceal it—if that had been my motivation, I would not have
registered my interest in the first place—but to an oversight,
as I had forgotten about it. I offer that not as an excuse, Mr Speaker,
because there is no excuse, but merely as an explanation. As soon I was
aware of the complaint, I also apologised to the Select Committee, and
offered to resign from it if any one of its members felt that I had
acted improperly. I am very grateful to them all for accepting that

raised the death penalty and human rights abuses in India in this House
last year, but I do so today with an even greater sense of urgency.
Why? India has started to execute people again. When India secured its
independence from Britain, it retained its 19th century penal code,
which included the death penalty for murder. Until the 1980s, capital
punishment was implemented regularly. From then on, although death
sentences were pronounced by Indian courts they were increasingly not
put into practice. In 1980, the Indian Supreme Court ruled that the
death penalty should be used in the rarest of rare cases, which led
eventually to an eight-year moratorium on the death penalty being
implemented within
India<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T11:35:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Naively, many of us thought that although India retained the death
penalty on the statute book the continuation of the moratorium
was an indication that it would eventually be abolished once and for
all. Unfortunately, that was a naive judgment and our hopes were dashed
in the spring of last year when reports emerged that the Indian
Government were moving to execute Balwant Singh Rajoana and, possibly,
to authorise the execution of Professor Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar.
That caused widespread concern among the Punjabi community in the UK,

me deal first with Balwant Singh Rajoana, a former member of the
Punjabi police. He has publicly acknowledged his role in the killing of
the chief Minister of the Punjab, Beant Singh, in 1995. He has refused
to defend himself and refused legal representation, and he has
not asked for mercy. However, Sikhs and Sikh organisations in gurdwaras

Singh was party to killing Beant Singh, the chief Minister of the
Punjab. We now know that Beant Singh personally commanded the police
and security forces in the killing and disappearance of possibly more
than 20,000 Sikhs—men, women and children. Faced with the
failure of the Indian authorities to take action against the former
chief Minister for his crimes against humanity, Balwant Singh and a
co-conspirator took the law into their own hands. Nobody, including
Balwant Singh, claims that he is innocent of the killing, but Sikh
organisations, human rights lawyers and human rights groups are urging
the Indian Government to take into account the context of his actions,
the scale of the human suffering that the Sikhs were enduring at the
time, and the anger that young men such as Balwant Singh felt at the
failure of the Indian state to bring to justice the chief Minister
responsible for the atrocities against the Sikhs in the Punjab. On that

period, Professor Bhullar symbolises the injustice meted out to Sikhs,
to be frank, over the 
<?notus-xml column=495?>years at the hands of the Indian police and the judicial system.
Professor Bhullar came to the attention of the Punjab police because he
investigated the abduction and disappearance of a number of his own
students. The disappearances were linked to the Punjab police. The
resultant persecution of his family, with the disappearance of his own
father and uncle and others, led him to flee to Germany for asylum.
Tragically, the German authorities believed the assurance of the Indian
Government that he would not face the death penalty, and he was
returned to India.</hs_Para>

German courts have now ruled that that deportation was wrong. Professor
Bhullar has been in prison for 18 years. He has been convicted
of involvement in an attempted political assassination solely on the

the court judges.

confinement for eight years and, despite his deteriorating health, his
plea for mercy has been rejected. Despite a further petition to the
Supreme Court, the fear is that the Indian authorities could move to
execute him at any time. This is a shocking miscarriage of justice

“riddled with systemic flaws”. According to the briefing
Amnesty International provided to Members for this debate, of
particular concern under anti-terror legislation is the broad
definition of terrorist acts for which the death penalty can be
imposed. In addition, there are: insufficient safeguards on arrest;
provisions that allow confessions made to the police to be admissible
as evidence; obstacles to confidential communication with counsel;
insufficient independence of special courts from Executive power;
insufficient safeguards for the presumption of innocence; provisions
for discretionary closed trials; sweeping provisions to keep secret the
identity of witnesses; and limits on the right to review by a higher
tribunal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T11:47:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000369" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0002.htm#13022853000369">In
its briefing, Amnesty succinctly sums up why we abhor the death penalty

arbitrary, discriminatory and can be inflicted upon the

people should also understand that the Sikh and Punjabi culture abhors

established and the Darbar Sahib, or golden temple, was founded, the
Sikh religion instilled in Punjabi culture a profound respect for life.
Sikhs are always portrayed as warriors, but they were only warriors to
defend their religion. During the period when there was an independent
Punjabi nation, the death penalty did not feature in the law or
governmental system and no one was put to

we head towards the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting and other
important multilateral and bilateral meetings where India sits at the

world’s largest democracy and a growing economy that is seeing
expansion in many areas, not least its military, the maturity of a
democracy is judged not on how big 
<?notus-xml column=499?>the army, the economy or the electorate are, but on how that democracy
treats its minorities. India certainly has an issue—if not in
reality, in perception—about how it treats its minorities, not
least Sikhs, and, indeed, other religious faiths, including the
Christian Church. While the federal Government may express their
concerns and underscore their commitment to religious freedom and
religious freedom of speech, it is important that the states themselves
do not ascribe powers to themselves that inhibit and restrict those
freedoms.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000387" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0002.htm#13022853000387">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T11:57:04"></hs_TimeCode>

widespread confidence into the events of 1984, when so many Sikhs were

the case. Many of my constituents do not feel that that has happened in
the cases that have been raised or over the wider events of 1984. They
do not believe that the various commissions that have been launched

countries. We should have a fundamental concern about the death penalty
not only in India, but wherever it is used around the world. Amnesty
International reports on its website that in 2011, some 20 states used
the death penalty. That is down from about 30 states a decade before.

projects throughout the world that campaign against the death penalty.
We continue to work actively towards global abolition, in line with our
strategy for the abolition of the death penalty, by raising the issue
bilaterally and through the EU and the UN. I believe we are closer to
achieving that goal than we have ever been. In its most recent report,
Amnesty International reported that 70% of the world’s

the death penalty, which had existed for more than eight years, ended
with the hangings of Mohammed Ajmal Kasab and Mohammad Afzal Guru last

out that the Indian Government have not ratified the United Nations
convention against torture. Central to the British Government’s
torture prevention policy is encouragement to countries such as India
to sign, ratify and effectively implement that convention and its
optional protocol. Not only does the convention define what is meant by
an act of torture, it obliges countries to take measures to prevent
such acts. Such measures include legislating to make torture a criminal
offence, educating officials on the prohibition of torture, conducting
prompt and impartial investigations where there are reasonable grounds
to believe that torture has taken place, and providing redress and
compensation to victims.</hs_Para>

optional protocol provides an important additional layer of monitoring
and reporting to prevent torture from happening in any place of

Government to expedite the ratification of the United Nations
convention against torture and its optional protocol, and adopt robust
domestic legislation to that effect. The United Kingdom made a specific
recommendation on that issue during India’s universal periodic
review in May last year. The EU delegation in Delhi has also hosted a

time, widespread abuse of human rights, much loss of life, and rape and
torture. Many disappeared, with their families having no idea as to

of orange flags in the midlands showing solidarity with their fellow

petition. I hope that the Government will have some success in
persuading those countries along that path. We also welcome previous
assurances from Foreign Office Ministers that these issues have been
raised in the annual India-EU human rights dialogue—the Minister
mentioned that this work was undertaken not only directly, but through
the EU. I hope that the Minister will be able to report progress in the
future on the discussions with the Indian authorities; let us know when
the next meeting for those discussions will take place; tell us what
progress we are making on India’s security legislation and the
reports of a significant number of cases of torture by police and
security authorities; and report on what progress has been made, not
only in ratifying the convention against torture, but adopting robust
domestic legislation to that
effect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000442" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0002.htm#13022853000442">I

Olympic opening ceremony that celebrated all that is great about our
open, multicultural society, when Tim Berners-Lee said, “This is

wish to make a couple of points that perhaps go a bit further than the
petition in making representations to our friends in India. Although a
moratorium is desirable, the intent should really be outright
abolition, because history teaches us that moratoriums are not always
an effective long-term solution. As has already been mentioned, India
has had a moratorium, and it has ended—the consequences of that
remain to be seen. We have also had the experience of the United
States, where the Supreme Court issued what was essentially a
moratorium. That went away, and before George W. Bush became president
he was one of the most excited and active executioners of people under
the US criminal code when he was governor of Texas. There are pressures
on politicians and the judiciary when there is still the option of
ending the moratorium. Modern societies need to strive to achieve
abolition if we are to accomplish both the in-principle benefits and
the practical benefits of the elimination of the death
penalty.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000449" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0002.htm#13022853000449"><B><Member ContinuationText="Bob Stewart" PimsId="5537" UID="13022853001183" xid="1011" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0002.htm#13022853001183">Bob

experience from before he became a Member of Parliament in dealing in
highly conflicting situations with people of different religious and
ethnic backgrounds in Europe. Those differences can lead to extremism
and the actions of governing authorities can create martyrdom
situations that exacerbate divisions. Any healing democracy always
wishes to heal the divisions within society. The death penalty is not a
friend of that aim; it is an opponent. As we can see from the petition,
there are real concerns that the existence of the death penalty in
India will exacerbate the tensions within Indian society rather than
achieving a better long-term

mentioned the recent reaction in India to the issue of rape. If there
is still the possibility that the death penalty can be applied, and if
its application would have political currency in certain situations or
be popular at a particular moment, politicians will use that as a
reason to bring it back. It may be completely ineffective, or out of
step with what is needed at the time, but it is always alluring to
politicians who believe that the death penalty has popular support to
seize on it as a remedy. A moratorium always leaves that possibility:

been said about the situation in India with regard to rape. The broader
point is that there are lessons for politicians of all countries about
the possible use of the death penalty in political discourse. The
hard-learned lessons in this country are that we end up with a more
effective and fairer criminal justice system if we abolish the death
penalty. There is no stopping point along the way to abolition that
will ultimately provide the security of those two outcomes: there has
to be outright

MacNeil:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving
way; he is being very kind. To back up his argument from history, again
from Steven Pinker, we can draw on the example of England. Some 800
years ago, the death penalty was commonplace and there was a
hangman’s hill in every village throughout the British Isles. An
Englishman was 50 times more likely to be killed by a fellow Englishman
in a society that had the death penalty than they are in the modern day

<?notus-xml column=510?>many people around the world see the British judicial system as a
reliable and trusted friend when they are in conflict situations. There
are issues relating to the Indian judicial system that exacerbate
concerns about the existence of the death penalty. I have mentioned the
implications for the mental health and well-being of people on death
row. With the case load in Indian courts so backed up, what is it that
says that a certain case should move forward or not? How are those

of mine who have had legal disputes in India have always made the point
that they have had to go back to India to deal with them. Without
putting too fine a point on it, sometimes that is because of issues to
do with money in the criminal justice system. I have no idea whether
that is true and certainly, of course, none of my constituents has been
involved in any of that, but it is interesting that there is that
question. Our friends in India, being part of a great hope for the

Minister kindly responded to the question of what India moving forward
with the death penalty would mean for UK relations in certain
circumstances. He was right to talk about considering individual cases
on an individual basis. However, if India became a more active
proponent of the death penalty, that would have significant
implications for how the UK would look at extraditing people to India.
We do not want the death penalty to affect our relationship when there
is so much that is positive that we want to talk about, and we do not
want to have ongoing disputes on this issue. I therefore hope that the
British Government would look very dimly on extraditing any person to
India that might result in their being subject to the death penalty,
and seek assurances that it would not be applied in any such
cases.</hs_Para>

us look at the background to India’s use of the death penalty.
On independence in 1947, India retained the 1861 penal code, which
provided the death penalty for murder. It has been estimated that
between 3,000 and 4,000 executions occurred in India between 1950 and
1980. It is more difficult to understand the impact of the death
penalty since the 1980s. The international community has moved further
towards abolishing the death penalty. On 19 November 2012, 110
countries approved a UN General Assembly draft resolution calling for a
moratorium on all executions. India was part of a tiny minority that
voted to retain capital punishment, arguing for it to be used sparingly
and in cases of particularly heinous crimes. On 21 November 2012, India
ended its unofficial eight-year moratorium on executions when it hanged
Ajmal Kasab and followed that up on 9 February 2013 by hanging Afzal
Guru. Both executions occurred in secrecy, with the families being

wish to discuss the case of Professor Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar a bit
more. Although many hon. Members have mentioned him specifically, I
know from my constituents that his case is a real cause
célèbre; he has been tortured and treated inhumanely in
prison, all for bringing to the public’s attention his concern
about the disappearance of 42 of his university students. Professor
Bhullar was a lecturer at Guru Nanak Dev engineering college in
Ludhiana, but he felt he had to flee India for a safer place in 1994,
following threats to his life and harassment from the police for
bringing this issue to the attention of the authorities and the media.
As we have heard, he went to Germany, arriving on 18 December 1994.
However, he was detained because the German authorities were not
convinced of his claim, mainly because he had false papers on him, and
he was deported, under escort, from Germany on 17 January 1995 and
handed over to the Indian police at Indira Gandhi airport, New Delhi,
by Lufthansa staff.</hs_Para>

Indian authorities gave specific assurances to the German authorities
that Professor Bhullar had nothing to fear if he was returned to India
and that he would not be tortured. However, as we know, he was arrested
on his arrival and has now been in prison for more than 18 years, the
past eight of them in solitary confinement, dealing with the daily
threat of hanging. The professor’s mental health has
deteriorated over the past two years and has now reached a
life-threatening state. By deporting someone to a death penalty-prone
country, Germany violated the European convention on human rights and
remains morally obliged to do all it can now to seek the
professor’s immediate release.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T12:52:48"></hs_TimeCode>Professor
Bhullar was examined by a police-assigned medical doctor recently.
Although the professor is a highly educated man, his medical

know that the case against Professor Bhullar is highly dubious; it is
based on information that has not been properly corroborated, with the
prosecution having offered no corroboration at all. None of its 133
witnesses identified Professor Bhullar. Many witnesses actually claimed
he was not the man they had seen. One prosecution witness, a rickshaw
worker in Delhi, informed the court that he had no knowledge of the
case but had been threatened and forced by the police to provide a
false statement. Almost every legal system in the world is based on the
idea of proof beyond reasonable doubt and respects procedures in order
to obtain safe evidence. The Supreme Court of India seems to have
departed from those things in the most important of all
cases—that of the death penalty—thus setting an
unfortunate new precedent for Indian law.</hs_Para>

sense of equality as we walked around. So it was really good to see the
Prime Minister of our country walking through the golden
temple—through that holy place—barefoot, as people have
to be, in his suit, as we had to be, and with his head covered.
Although, clearly, I am not a Sikh, I was so moved by my visit that I
rang one of my close friends in my constituency to tell him that I was

this debate is not about attacking our good friend, India; it is not

there should be a complete abolition. We want India to succeed. India
is growing in importance in the world. India is our close friend, and
many of us have close friends who are of Indian origin and who have
family in India. I have visited the place three times now, so I hope
that the result of this debate is that our Government will, as the
Minister has said, put further pressure on the Indian Government. I
hope that Members of Parliament will talk to their colleagues and
friends in India, including perhaps those in the Lok Sabha, the Indian
Parliament. I hope that we will talk to families we represent and that
they will talk to their friends and family in India to

despite the comments by the Indian Supreme Court in 1983, there are
nearly 500 people on death row in India today. For the record, it is
important to note that we do not condone the actions of people who

should not be part of any judicial process in any part of the

nation criticising another nation. We need to be careful not to appear
holier than thou, especially when we are criticising other democracies.
Yes, we have abolished the death penalty and we can therefore speak
with some authority on that matter, but we must be careful none the
less, because I believe that such events as the Iraq war
reduced our moral authority. It had many tragic consequences, one of
which was that it reduced our moral authority in the eyes of the
international community. Whether we are talking about arms sales,
foreign interventions or prevention of terrorism legislation, we need
to be sure that we can speak with authority, and we therefore need to
be careful about what we do. I was delighted to see the Prime
Minister’s statement about the deeply shameful event in Amritsar
in 1919, but we are still waiting for Tony Blair to make an apology for
what has happened far more

India’s response to the horrific case in Delhi has been a

people who can make a real difference. I am particularly concerned that

the death penalty. We are concerned not just about it continuing, but
about the way in which its deployment helps to divide communities in
India, making the country less safe and less stable.</hs_Para>

understand why countries have the death penalty, I understand why
countries have had the death penalty, as we did until relatively
recently, and I understand the difficulty of moving from having the
death penalty to not having it. Not having the death penalty looks like
a sign of weakness, and may be thought to make it more likely that
people will commit serious offences and “get away with
them”. I understand that events such as those of the 1980s
involving the golden temple, for example, have led to a culture in
which it is felt that people must not be allowed to get away with
activities of that kind. I understand how terrible terrorism is, in
India as in this country and anywhere else, and I understand why people
who are involved in and convicted of terrorism are thought to be in

should also reflect on the fact that, since India gained independence
in 1948, the death penalty has not deterred such people. It did not
prevent any of the events of the 1980s, and it did not prevent the
events referred to by the Minister when he was in India only the other
day. Bomb blasts, revenge killings and assassinations have continued,
as they have in other countries where the death penalty operates. The
hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar made the telling point that
Europe, where most countries do not have the death penalty, is the
safest place in the world. There is no link between a lack of crime and
the death penalty. Indeed, according to the most recent evidence that I
have seen, in the United States of America the states with the death
penalty generally do not have a lower rate of crime than those without
it.</hs_Para>

real problem for our friends in India, and for the Government of India,
is that justice has often ground to a halt there. That is not
just my view. The other day a bench of the Supreme Court in
India spoke of how slow the processes are, and in January last year a
Supreme Court bench said that people’s faith in the judiciary
was dwindling at an alarming rate, posing a 
<?notus-xml column=521?>grave threat to constitutional and democratic
governance of the country. It acknowledged serious problems such as the
large number of vacancies in trial courts, the unwillingness of lawyers
to become judges, and an inability to fill the highest posts. Dealing
with the backlog in the courts is one of the difficulties in India,

matters that need to be addressed—matters that can be
addressed—which could change the culture in India and give
people more confidence. There is, for instance, the need to deal with
corruption, which is sometimes a problem in our own country. We have
just seen an officer of the Metropolitan police convicted of corrupt
activities. Like other Members who have spoken, I am not trying to
pretend that we are perfect. However, it needs to be dealt with in
India and other countries where it undermines democratic values and

smaller democratic countries and later, we would hope, of currently
non-democratic countries such as China, so that they could all move on

the UN against the death penalty, but with the remaining countries

can be a first, or interim, stage before abolition. I understand, too,
that having people on death row is a dreadful and inhumane punishment,

Heads of Government conference. It is currently scheduled to be held in
Colombo, although that is controversial and has been the subject of
discussion. Ministers have recently been to Sri Lanka, and our country
has rightly not decided what level of representation we will give
because of recent human rights issues in Sri Lanka. I assume that there
will be such a conference this autumn, however, either in Sri Lanka or
somewhere else, and I would like our Government to see whether we can
put on its agenda the remaining issues to do with the death penalty in
Commonwealth countries, and see whether that could be linked with
questions of justice and the speed of justice. I ask the Minister to

other minority communities in India, and the Commonwealth needs to step
up to the plate and do better in making sure these issues are on the

late uncle was nearly killed, and it was only because he managed to
play dead that he escaped with his life. Punjab is the home of the Sikh
religion, and the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which I have also visited,
is a place of pilgrimage for many and a place of magnificence and
inspiration for all, whatever their faith. The stay of execution in the
Rajoana case was welcome, but the campaign to abolish the death penalty

More recently, the brutal and tragic rape and murder of a 23-year-old

violence against women in India in a far greater way than before. A

accountability. Concerns about the police in human rights cases

Jaspal Singh. Jaspal was an 18-year-old Sikh college student peacefully
protesting against capital punishment last March who was killed when
police opened fire on a crowd of just a few hundred to make them
disperse. There are concerns about the level of inquiry into how and
why that tragedy happened and why others were injured. There are

cannot always assume that the judicial system is faultless. Therefore,
using death, an irrevocable act, as a punishment for a crime,
puts the system at risk of punishing the innocent irreversibly. There
have been examples in the past of wrongful executions. It was the case
of Timothy John Evans that, among others, contributed to the abolition
of the death penalty in this country, after a long campaign by Labour
MP Sydney Silverman. Evans was falsely convicted of murdering his wife
and infant daughter, sentenced to capital punishment and hanged in
1950. It was three years later that the police discovered multiple
bodies in the flat of downstairs neighbour and serial killer, John
Christie, and realised their mistake. Can it really be just
to execute a person who, while at the time of conviction is
believed guilty, might well be innocent?</hs_Para>

is the mark of a modern civilised society that it does not tolerate

should adhere to these precepts. Every human being has an inalienable

justice cannot be provided with a reciprocal sentence. The justice
system cannot proclaim, on the one hand, to condemn the act of killing
and, on the other, exact punishment with death. This also establishes
an inappropriate link between the state and violence, thus brutalising
society and, to a degree, legitimising state violence. It is also
abhorrent to note that there are still countries that hand capital
sentences to individuals on the basis of their religious beliefs. We
should not tolerate the existence of the death penalty to punish those

Damini to be hanged. I have spoken many times in this Chamber about my
sadness and dismay at her tragic death, and I am heartened to hear
calls for justice on her behalf. However, the death penalty is in no

2,000 Kurdish villages and towns were destroyed, including the town of
Qla Dizeh, which along with its 70,000 inhabitants was literally wiped
off the map. Let me put that in context: that is enough people to fill

16 March 1988, Iraqi planes bombed the town of Halabja with mustard gas

thousand civilians died in incredible agony that day, and estimates
suggest a further 7,000 were injured or suffered long-term illness. For

me the events hold a personal significance. I am proud to be the first
British MP of Kurdish descent. It was the persecution of the Kurdish
people that brought my family to the safe haven of Great Britain. I
remember, as an eight-year-old boy, standing with my mother in Baghdad
international airport watching my father attempt to flee the country,
boarding a plane to the safe haven of Britain. The night before, he had
been tipped off that the regime was planning to come for him. As the
plane taxied towards the runway, we watched in horror as an army
vehicle stopped the plane and soldiers boarded it. It was only later
that we discovered that they had taken the man sat right next to my
father. That was the life of a Kurdish family in Iraq—waiting
for the knock on the door in the middle of the night, knowing that they
could be coming for you, living in

after that there was still scepticism from many, yet that was just the
culmination of a decade-long campaign against the Kurdish people, the
final stage of the regime's attempts to wipe out the Kurdish people in
Iraq. Saddam had unleashed all the resources of a modem, industrialised

Earlier this year the Norwegian Government, as we have just heard,
recognised the Anfal campaign as genocide, stating that the judgment in
Iraq, in accordance with international law, justified that decision.
Sweden followed, with the Swedish Parliament stating that, based on
research, statements from organisations and the 2010 judgment in Iraq,
it was legally able to make that declaration. In the Netherlands, we
have even seen a Dutch citizen successfully prosecuted for his part in
the genocide: Frans van Anraat was tried 
<?notus-xml column=532?>at The Hague and charged, among other things, with selling chemicals
knowing that they were to be used for genocidal purposes. Such a charge
required the court to decide whether the Anfal campaign was indeed
genocide. Unsurprisingly, it agreed that it was. Therefore, there
exists a judicial decision in Iraq, a decision at The Hague and the
decisions of other nations to support a declaration that the Kurds were
subjected to genocide. The United Kingdom can act to make it clear to
the world that this Government recognise the genocide committed against
the Kurdish people.</hs_Para>

After the no-fly zone was imposed over Kurdistan in 1991, people at
last had the opportunity to begin to develop their own democracy and to
make their own decisions, but sustained contact with the outside world
really began only after the 2003 invasion. Only then did we slowly
begin to understand the true scale of the horror. According to the

died in 1994, which the UN rightly recognises as a genocide? How is it
different from Darfur, for which the ICC issued an arrest warrant in
2010 for the President of Sudan on genocide charges, after 300,000
people were murdered and millions displaced? The UN recognises formally
that Yugoslavia and Rwanda have had genocides. Former US Secretary of

stopped the genocide was NATO intervention or what I have termed
“muscular enlightenment”. In April 1991, John Major and
his western allies established proper safe havens inside Iraqi borders
and a no-fly zone. It is good to see Lord Archer in this place given
that he was so instrumental in making that happen. Kurdish guerrillas
recaptured Irbil and founded the Kurdistan regional government, which
was ultimately recognised by the new Iraqi constitution in 2005. By the

but it is said that some of the organisers of the Anfal and
the pilots who dropped the chemical weapons remain at large and may
even be in Europe. Others are in positions of responsibility in
Iraq’s military and Government. To be fair, Iraq has now
officially recognised the genocide. It is the duty of the rest of the

debate, which, of course, has particular significance around this time.
For years, I have chaired meetings in the Grand Committee Room of the
House of Commons and we have commemorated Halabja year after year.
Indeed, in 1988 along with Members from across the House, I took a
group of women to a hospital in London where some of the survivors of
the Halabja incident were recovering. There were women who had been
badly burned by chemicals, and some could not speak because the
chemical weapons had harmed their windpipes. I hope that those people
survived, and I was glad that at least some of them had the opportunity
to be brought to London for treatment.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn), who was in the
Chamber earlier, attempted to protest at the Iraqi embassy about the
use of chemical weapons against the Kurds. At the time, the ambassador
told us that he knew nothing about it; it was all a mystery to him. He
said, “Would you like to visit Baghdad?” We said,
“No, we’d actually like to go and visit Kurdistan where
the chemical weapons attack has taken place.” He continued to
say, “I don’t know anything about it but I will get in
touch with Baghdad and see what we can do.” He played a cat and
mouse game with us for six months, at the end of which I sent a letter
to the <I>Financial Times</I> saying that it was obviously just a game.
However, it was not a game for us politicians who had followed the
Kurds for many years. We protested in this House in 1988, 1989 and
throughout.</hs_Para>

first became involved with the Kurds as early as 1977, before I was a
politician, when many Kurds were students at Cardiff university. One,
of course, was Barham Salih, and many prominent Kurds were at that
university. There were also Iraqi students, and they told us what was
happening in Iraq. It was difficult to get an accurate picture at that
time, and it was not until the chemical weapons attack that the public
in the west were made aware of the kind of weapons that Saddam Hussein
was prepared to use against his own people. The charge of genocide was
proved in the tribunal in Iraq, and many prominent Iraqis were tried.
Ali Hassan al-Majid, known as Chemical Ali, was subsequently sentenced
to death. The charge of genocide was made against him and it was

of us have campaigned over a long period. I chaired the Campaign
Against Repression and for Democratic Rights in
Iraq—CARDRI—which many Kurds and Iraqis living in London
were members of at that time. We continually published records of what
was happening to the Kurds and Iraqis, and what was going on in the
prisons. We had good but horrific accounts of the kind of
torture being used against the people of Kurdistan and Iraq. Some of
the kinds of torture were horrific. Later, I opened the genocide museum
in Kurdistan, and I remember relatives of those who had been killed 
<?notus-xml column=541?>during the Anfal campaign coming up to me. It was a memorable
day—it was snowing; it was grey—and going into that

had photographs and witness statements, and a few years later when
Indict was set up, for several years it collected evidence of Iraqi war
crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. I am glad to say that the

Baghdad.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000635" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000635">Many

about enormous abuses against the Kurds by government security forces

Kurdish rebels had spoken of 4,000 destroyed villages and an estimated

official military codename used by the government in its public
pronouncements and internal memoranda, was well known inside Iraq,
especially in the Kurdish region. As all the horrific details have
emerged, this name has seared itself into popular
consciousness—much as the Nazi German Holocaust did with its
survivors. The parallels are apt, and often chillingly
close…In…February 1990, Human Rights in Iraq, Middle East
Watch reconstructed what took place from exile sources, with what in
retrospect turned out to be a high degree of accuracy. Even so, some of
the larger claims made by the Kurds seemed too fantastic to credit. As
it transpires, this has been a humbling, learning process for all those
foreigners who followed Kurdish affairs from abroad. Western reporters,
relief workers, human rights organizations and other visitors to Iraqi
Kurdistan have come to realize that the overall scale of the suffering

government of…Saddam Hussein to destroy, through mass murder,
part of Iraq’s Kurdish minority…Two government
instruments…the…1987 national census and the declaration

foundations of this policy. These instruments were implemented against
the background of nearly two decades of government-directed
“Arabization”, in which mixed-race districts, or else
lands that Baghdad regarded as desirable or strategically important,
saw their Kurdish population diluted by Arab migrant farmers provided
with ample incentives to relocate, and guarded by government
troops…The logic of the Anfal, however, cannot be divorced
either from the Iran-Iraq War. After 1986, both the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), the two major
parties, received support from the Iranian government and sometimes

multiple sorties over several days, between 1987 and August 1988. Each
of those attacks were war crimes, involving the use of a banned weapon.
The fact that non-combatants were often victims added to the offence.
In the Anfal, at least 50,000 people—possibly
100,000—many of them women and children, were killed out of hand
between February and September 1988. Their deaths did not come in the
heat of battle: those Kurds were systematically put to death in large

My interaction with Iraq started in 2003, when I was the president of
Unison—the biggest trade union in Britain at the time—and

labour movement, I was completely and utterly opposed to the invasion
of Iraq. I believed that the reasons for going into Iraq were not
justified, that the argument about weapons of mass destruction was not
proven and that we had gone in far too early, with Hans Blix doing good
work on the ground, despite the obstacles put in his way. Nothing

remain convinced today that the leader of my party and the Prime
Minister at the time decided to go into Iraq alongside the Americans
for two reasons. First, he passionately believed that Saddam should be
got rid of, and, secondly, he wanted to keep good relations with 
<?notus-xml column=547?>the Americans. I believe that the Americans went in for different
reasons. They wanted to get rid of Saddam, too, but they also wanted to
gain control of the oil wealth in that part of the world and, even more
important for the American Republican party, they wanted to ensure that
George Bush got re-elected 18 months after the invasion. I remain
convinced that that was why, no matter what we did, the Americans would
have gone into Iraq around the time they did, as it was a perfect way
of winning the election that lay some 18 months ahead.</hs_Para>

active and one of the largest from Europe to Australia but that had
been suppressed. We took the decision as a trade union to do all we

She was the treasurer of NASUWT at the time, and she also chaired the

training programme was so successful that we ended up expanding it.
Instead of bringing people out of Kurdistan to London, we got them out
of there to Amman in Jordan, which was much easier in terms of the
numbers. I was really proud when we were finally able to establish a
trade union training school in Erbil in Kurdistan in early
2006.</hs_Para>

elected MP, I was delighted to receive the backing of the trade union
movement to take a delegation out to Erbil in early 2006. There were
eight of us, including members from the NASUWT, the journalists’
union, Unison, local councillors and others active in supporting the
Iraqi cause for many years.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:24:15"></hs_TimeCode> went out
there to see what we could do to develop trade unionism on the ground.
Straight away, I was immensely struck by the attitude of the trade
unionists we met. To me, they were comrades. The fact that they were
from another part of the world was irrelevant to me. They were my
friends, standing up for working people and trying to develop their
skills so that they could look after people properly.</hs_Para>

thing that those trade union members said to us was, “We need
your help. We need your Government to start investing in this country,
because if they do not 
<?notus-xml column=548?>invest we will not have work, and if we do not have work we do not have
a trade union movement.” That was a very simple equation. When
we asked what practical help we could give, they arranged for us to
meet their labour, equality and health Ministers and the Minister
responsible for matters relating to the Anfal genocide. That was the
first time I had really been exposed to what had
happened.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000678" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000678">The
other thing that those people said to us, very clearly, was “We
thank you, as a nation, for what you did for us in 1991, and we thank
you even more for what you did for us in 2003, when you liberated
us.” That was a shock for me: it was a slap in the face. I had
seen what happened in 2003 as an invasion. However, it was all very
well for me, sitting in the comfort of Blaydon, to say that it was
really, really wrong. It was not me who was being wiped off the face of
the earth, it was not my parents who were being buried alive, it was
not my village that was being flattened, and it was not my real
life—my community—that was being devastated and
destroyed. That was happening to these people. Listening to what they
said did not change my view that we went into Iraq for the wrong
reasons, but what became very clear to me, and has remained clear to me
ever since, was that we should have done it 20 years earlier. Why on
earth did we not do that? If we had, this disgraceful thing would not
have happened.</hs_Para>

doing 20 years earlier? Unfortunately, we were doing the bidding of
Saddam Hussein. We were, to an extent, sitting on our hands and
supporting the Americans yet again while they, and the rest of the
world powers, were sitting back happily watching the Iranians and the
Iraqis wipe out 1 million of their own citizens, using them as pawns.
If, as a by-product, we saw the Marsh Arabs being wiped off the face of
the earth and the attack on the Kurds, we just had to ignore it. It was
a price worth paying if Saddam was able to keep the ayatollah and his
acolytes under control. Was it worth it in terms of the international
situation? Well, other people will decide when it is history, but,
looking back and seeing what I see now, I think that it was absolutely
the wrong thing to do.</hs_Para>

just sitting back innocently. As was said earlier by my right hon.
Friend the Member for Cynon Valley and my hon. Friend the Member for
Islington North, we were actively engaged: we were selling arms to that
regime. In fact, we were selling arms to both regimes, and it was the
wrong thing to do. It may have been very grandiose in the big scheme of
things, but it did nothing to help the people on the
ground.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000681" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000681">Since
that first visit to Kurdistan, I have been back there, and have also
been to Baghdad. On both occasions, I was hugely impressed by the
generosity and warmth of the people. That is typical of people in the
middle east, but it is even more noticeable in Kurdistan. They were
like people from the north-east of England, who, as everyone knows, are
always much warmer, more generous, more humorous and more giving.
Everyone understands that, wherever they are
from.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000682" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000682">Other
Members who have been to Kurdistan have mentioned the “red
house”, the torture chamber in Sulaimani. No one who goes there
can fail to be struck by it. The first thing that struck me was what a
huge building it was. It is a huge building in the main street of one
of the biggest cities in that part of the world. No attempt was made to
hide from the public what went on 
<?notus-xml column=549?>in that place. Indeed, everything that was done was documented. The
holocaust was mentioned earlier; exactly the same methods were used in
this case. There were documents on everyone, and all the documents were
in triplicate. Wiping people from the face of the earth was seen as a
normal thing to do by people who did not care about them and just
wanted to replace them with their own people. It was absolutely
unbelievable.</hs_Para>

stuck in my mind particularly. In 2006, as we were walking out of the
“red house”, we saw five Kurdish guards in the reception
area, sitting around watching television. On the television screen,
live, was the trial of Saddam Hussein. I felt that that was real
history in the making. For those people, it was life-changing: it would
give them a chance to get their lives back. As I said earlier, for
people such as me who had not wanted this country to go into Iraq, it
was a huge wake-up call, making us ask what we could do. I think that
what we can certainly do is promote what we are doing
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000684" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000684"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:29:26"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Meg Munn" PimsId="2044" UID="13022853001239" xid="441" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853001239">Meg

these events. The most shocking aspect of the DVD I mentioned is the
fact that the footage of what happened—such as people being

saw—I am not sure why this was more shocking than seeing
somebody being killed—was a man being held by several other men

someone came along and moved his arm but there was no connection

never any attempt to pretend this was not happening; it was just hoped

well as visiting the “red house”, I visited some of the
villages in the north-east of the country, where people saw their way

away from their homes and kill them, but what really shocked me was
that many of these people were buried alive. They did not even give
them the justice of putting a bullet in their brain. They put them in
trenches and covered them over using bulldozers. That is how little

agricultural area, which had been the bread basket of Iraq and which is
now devastated. All these young people want is to go back home. Sadly,
however, if they go back home they will not know how to start getting
the farms up and running again, because they have lost contact with the

because of how the media failed to report things, we must be honest
that it took a long time for most of the media and the political
establishment in this country to cotton on to what was happening to the
Kurdish people in Iraq. To be honest, a lot of British Government
policy was blindsided by their obsession with supporting Iraq against
Iran in the dreadful Iran-Iraq war and Britain’s considerable
economic interests in Iraq at the time, not least in oil exploration
and exploitation and so on. We must have a sense of deep self-criticism
about the process. If we do not have that, it does us no

me say a few words in general about Kurdistan, the Kurdish people and
how we can move on. There is a complicated narrative in world history
of equating nations, ethnic communities and languages with nation
states, which does not always work. The end of the first world war was
a seminal point for the whole region—this is germane to the
history of the region. The Kurdish people had been part of and had
recognition within the Ottoman empire, and operated with a Kurdish
identity and language. They took at face value Woodrow Wilson’s
14 points, as did many people in the region, including Palestinian
people and many others, and assumed that they would achieve nationhood
as a result. The high 
<?notus-xml column=552?>point of Kurdish recognition was a sandwich between the treaty of
Sèvres and the treaty of Lausanne. Between those treaties there
was recognition of a Kurdish state. Modern Turkey was established, the
western interests were more interested in a buffer against the Soviet
Union and in the mandates that France and Britain achieved further
south, and the Kurdish people and their wishes were obliterated.
<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>Britain did not
have clean hands in this. We took part in the establishment of modern
Iraq and the first aerial bombardment of people using chemical weapons
was by Britain in northern Iraq in 1922 against Kurdish people. So
there is a history of obliteration of the Kurdish people, their
language, their culture and identity. What Saddam was doing was
the ultimate in oppression of a nation or people, but the

The break-up of the Ottoman empire led to that situation, and there has
been this passion ever since for recognition of the Kurdish. To a huge

Kurdistan that encompasses parts of the other countries in the future?

with American military power and military resources than anything
else—and I thought an awful lot of people would die and
an awful lot of money would be spent as a result of the war. Although
we will never agree completely on that, I think we all agree that

holocaust was about, but it is also important to understand that there
have been other genocides around the world. There is not time to go
through all of them or define them all now, but the European treatment
of native Americans during the colonisation of north America from
the 16th century onward, but particularly later on, was to all
intents and purposes a genocide against those people; other examples
are Cambodia and Rwanda—an abominable and appalling series of

the Armenian massacre in 1915.</hs_Para>

examine ourselves and what we as a country or one of a group of
countries did or did not do at the time. But doing that helps the next
generation to understand that not forgetting puts one in a position to
try to influence the future and protect minorities, wherever they are
in the world. Tragically, the genocides we have been discussing today
were not the first, and although I hope they were the last, I am not
sure that they were. It is recognition and understanding of peoples,
their rights, their identity, their culture and their traditions that
bring about a safer and more secure world. Achieving that is not

Kurdistan and heard many accounts of the importance of that
relationship. What is striking about the strength of the relationship
is that, despite the fact that there are aspects of it that bring shame
on Britain, as we have heard, because previous Governments of all

profoundly. The report showed a ferocity, an inhumanity and an
extraordinary inability to treat people with respect that it was

relevant, context to the debate. Earlier this year I attended an
excellent Holocaust memorial day service just across the road, and I
was very conscious of the constant emphasis that the Jewish community
places on the fact that the holocaust is not just about them. On that

dealt with collectively. We are an international community with
international institutions and, in international situations such as the
one we are discussing, the appropriate approach is to work through
international justice bodies to recognise when certain circumstances
amount to a genocide. We then need to use our institutions to establish
the facts and their implications in law. The legal implications of
recognising any set of events—not just those under
discussion—as a genocide are considerable. They constitute a
particular crime under international law, which imposes obligations on

Over time, my hon. Friend will have to get used to being congratulated

I—at the times of which we speak. They took part in these events
in a way that I did not, and spoke well and effectively about the
things going on that, alas, we knew far too little about. Both of them
spoke very graphically, and although the details of what happened

many Members have said, the UK’s ties with Iraqi Kurds are
significant. Historically, those ties were cemented in 1991 with the
United Kingdom’s strong support, led by the then Prime Minister
John Major, for protecting the Kurdish people by enforcing no-fly
zones. Since then, successive UK Governments have highlighted the need
to support the rights of the Kurdish people, as well as those of other
minorities in Iraq.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:12:47"></hs_TimeCode>I was in that
region a couple of years ago and people were looking forward to John
Major coming for a commemoration to mark 20 years since the
establishment of the no-fly zone and the relief of Kuwait. There was no
doubt in what esteem Sir John was held, which as a friend it was a
pleasure to see. Friends in the other place will also know full well
how Sir John is regarded, and others from that time also deserve great
credit for the way in which they spoke out on behalf of those who were
being persecuted.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:13:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Blaydon (Mr Anderson) confronted honestly the problems that are
occasionally thrown up by the twin difficulties of foreign policy and
hindsight. He is right to say that 
<?notus-xml column=559?>sometimes we do not know everything and make decisions as best we can at
the time. He asked whether we should have done more and earlier, but I
remember the 1991 Gulf war and the arguments at the time. Should forces
have pressed on to Baghdad? It is easily forgotten that there was no
mandate for that; there was a coalition to free Kuwait, but had a
decision been taken to press on to Baghdad and remove Saddam
Hussein—it became clear subsequently that that might have been
the thing to do—there would have been resistance to what would
have seemed an intervention too far. Interventions are so much easier
in hindsight than they are at the time. The hon. Gentleman and I know
that full well in relation to other issues we are dealing with at the
moment.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Islington North mentioned arms fairs in Baghdad and
rebuffs from Ministers at the time. Were my colleagues right at that
time? I can say from the Dispatch Box that they probably were not
right, but what might they have done with the wisdom of hindsight and
the knowledge that we have now? That is the spirit in which I confront
the difficulties of hindsight and foreign
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000738" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000738">As
a number of hon. Members have made clear, the Iraqi regime under Saddam
Hussein systematically persecuted and oppressed ethnic and religious
groups. No group suffered more than Iraq’s Kurds.
Saddam Hussein’s regime carried out a number of atrocities
against the Kurds over a quarter of a century. As many as
100,000 Kurds were killed in the Anfal attacks,
and many more were displaced. This year, we will remember
the attack on Halabja in 1988 as we reach its 25th anniversary in
March. Iraqi planes bombarded the town with chemical weapons, causing
the deaths of 3,500 to 5,000 people, as colleagues have described in
the
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000739" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000739">I

Iraq’s Kurds and the need to ensure that no people suffer a
similar fate, but, like other colleagues, I would first like to say a

crimes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000740" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000740">I

visiting were heard in all the right quarters. He can look forward to

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:16:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn), who piped up at that moment, for her
indefatigable work on building democracy in many different places, but
not least in that region. Efforts are now being made on the building
blocks of democracy and the institutions that must be
built—perhaps in recognition of so much that has gone wrong. As
she said, and as she knows from her work for the Westminster Foundation
for Democracy, an election is not democracy per se. We must ensure that
there is another election and that elections are free and fair, and 
<?notus-xml column=560?>that institutions support elections and that power changes. Sooner or
later, people will realise that power is invested not only in
individuals but in institutions. In some of the places where we are
working collectively, there is a way to go, but the efforts being made
in the Kurdistan region of Iraq make it clear that the work is being
done on fertile ground. I therefore pay tribute to her and her hon.

visit was rounded off with a tour of the 7,000-year-old citadel,
Erbil’s premier tourist location, which claims to be the longest
continuously occupied place in the world. I was pleased to note
the involvement of British archaeologists in the ongoing programme to
restore the citadel—that is another example of the UK’s
long-standing ties with the Kurdistan region. Any colleagues looking
for tips on being re-elected should simply go around Erbil with the
governor. We paid a visit to the market, where the response to him was
terrific. I wanted a piece of it to take back to Biggleswade to help me
in my next election campaign. It was a genuine and spontaneous outburst
of affection for the gentleman as we toured the market, and I thought,
“This chap knows what he’s
doing.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000744" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000744">Visits
are not all one way. Members of the KRG frequently visit the United

as we rightly remember those who lost their lives 25 years ago, we
should also think about how far the KRG has come. Those returning to
Erbil years later see real changes, and are struck by its relative
security and burgeoning economy. My hon. Friend the Member for Harlow
(Robert Halfon), who made yet another impressive contribution,
reflected on how those fleeing persecution as Christians from other
parts of Iraq were able to find a home in Erbil and in the Kurdish
region. It is a proper distinction to make. As we reflect on Christian
flight across the middle east—and the persecution of any
religious minority other than the majority in the locality at the
time—we realise how important it is that people’s rights
are recognised and protected, and that others are prepared to
acknowledge them. Tragically, across the region this evening, there are
many families camped out in the homes of others, seeking refuge from
the conflicts that rage about them. It is not inappropriate to
recognise the generosity of the KRG and the Kurdish region in this
regard.</hs_Para>

should also take a moment to remember, as the 10th anniversary of the
start of the Iraq war approaches, those who died during the war,

unresolved. Human rights standards are low, and public services,
infrastructure and employment opportunities are inadequate. But Iraq
has the chance to be one of the success stories of the coming decade as
a stable democracy, with the patient work being done on democracy
building throughout the rest of Iraq, the engagements we have with
Ministers there, and the efforts they are making to confront some of
the very difficult political challenges—I met a range of
Ministers, including my good friend Foreign Minister Zebari, who
chaired a ministerial trade council with me—and improve the
future for all in Iraq. As we remember the past, and consider the
challenges of the present, I hope we can also look forward to a future
for Iraq that is more stable, democratic and prosperous, and that the
UK can play a role in making that a reality in the years
ahead.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend and other Members will be aware of the Government’s
position on the principle of genocide recognition—indeed, he and
the hon. Member for Wrexham
stated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:24:41"></hs_TimeCode> it. I am
greatly sympathetic to the motion. The Government do not in any way
oppose it and I have no doubt that Parliament will respond to the views
expressed in the motion by my hon. Friend. It is currently the
Government’s view, as we stated in responding to my hon.
Friend’s e-petition, that it is not for Governments to decide
whether genocide has been committed in this case, as there is a complex
legal position.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:25:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Wrexham was quite right: it has implications for both today and
yesterday. An international judicial body finding a crime to have been
genocide often plays an important part in whether the United Kingdom
recognises one as such. Whether or not the term
“genocide” is applicable in this case, it is clear that
appalling atrocities were perpetrated under Saddam Hussein against the
Iraqi Kurds. His final conviction by the Iraq tribunal was for his
crimes against
humanity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:25:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

many suffered as a result of Saddam’s criminal activities, and
we should remember all the victims of the regime. I reiterated that
view in my foreword to the programme for the KRG’s recent
conference on the issue. It is also a reminder that any use of chemical
or biological weapons is abhorrent and that responsible countries
consider their ongoing production, stockpiling or use to be completely
unacceptable. It is our moral duty to join the international community

Government’s position is therefore clear, but it is not

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:28:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Wrexham, I am sure our briefs said exactly the same thing: be very
careful. There are implications and I make no bones about that. This is
not a casual decision to be made at 
<?notus-xml column=563?>the Dispatch Box while listening to a debate with an understandable
emotional undertone with all the horrors spelled out, and I am not
going to do that. However, I have listened very carefully and I
do not think that I would be respecting the mood of the House and the
way in which this issue has been debated if I were simply to say,
“Look, this is our position, which you all know very well, and
that is where we are.” I do not think that that is what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:28:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

read the debate with exactly the same sense. I am sure the Government

responded to the motion and said, “This must be done.”
Conscious of the obligations on the Opposition, he could not go that
far, and neither can I. However, I take on board his view that if there
is not an easy way to bring this matter to international judicial
tribunals—and there may not be at the moment —we need to
consider what more we might be able to do, taking into account the
other things that have been said.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:29:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

to and understanding the case gives one a sense that there might be
more we collectively ought to be able to do to recognise the horror and
severity of what was done, which was clearly targeted on a group of
people just because of who they were. If I may, I will accept the hon.
Gentleman’s offer to think collectively about how the United
Kingdom might be able to take things forward. There is no change in our
policy for now, and we are correct in taking that approach, but the
issues that have been mentioned will be raised again, so we may have to
think more about them. We will certainly have to talk to other
Parliaments and Governments about how things have been done and be
fully aware of the concerns. That is a reasonable way for us to
respond.</hs_Para>

I may, I will take a couple of minutes to address one or two of the
particular points that have been made. It is important that other
Parliaments have recognised these events as genocide, but that is a
matter of principle for them and, understandably, such decisions cannot
be internationally binding. However, we will try to investigate what is
behind them. As has been said, we have not been able to recognise the
Iraqi criminal tribunal’s decision to see these events as
genocide. The Government consider legal judgments by appropriate courts
in deciding whether such atrocities should be designated as an act of
genocide, but the judgment of the Iraqi criminal tribunal was that of a
national tribunal.</hs_Para>

hon. Friends the Members for Stratford-on-Avon and
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:31:43"></hs_TimeCode>for Harlow both
referred to the Dutch court. We have examined this issue carefully and
we are happy to look again at the Dutch court of appeal’s
decision in the van Anraat case, but we understand that although the
court considered the question, it concluded that there was not a
genocide. We understand that Mr van Anraat 
<?notus-xml column=564?>was convicted for complicity in war crimes. In a sense, that is a
detail; the point is made and we need to look at how these matters
might be dealt
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:32:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000764" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000764">In
conclusion, a debate such as this is particularly painful, as we all
know that even as we speak someone, somewhere in the world, is being
killed, not because of anything that they may have done but simply
because of who they are. They are being killed on the basis of their
clan, their faith or their ethnicity; above all, this is happening
simply because of their otherness. The ability of people to stamp some
grotesque caricature of power or superiority over others through
violence and torture is an unsated appetite. All too often that is made
still worse by the inability of others ever to do enough, or even to do
anything, to prevent it.</hs_Para>

may differ on our view of how atrocities such as those visited upon
Iraq’s Kurds come to be designated, but I made it clear that I
share the view of all hon. Members that Iraq’s Kurds suffered a
terrible and prolonged injustice under the previous Iraqi regime.
Accordingly, as we approach the 25th anniversary of the appalling
atrocities perpetrated against the Kurds at Halabja and elsewhere, it
is important that we take a minute to reflect on the suffering caused
and to reflect with some shame on that phrase “never
again”. However, we need to find, somewhere in our remembrance
and recognition of the past, a more meaningful way to confront the
horrors that form the raw material of the senseless killing that occurs
throughout the world all too regularly.</hs_Para>

Burstow</B> (Sutton and Cheam) (LD):</Member> I am grateful for this
opportunity to address the House and to explain to it and to the
Minister the disaster that is playing out in slow motion in the NHS in
south-west London. I am talking, of course, about a programme named the
“Better Services, Better Value” programme, which was
launched by the south-west London primary care trust cluster two years
ago. BSBV was set up to address concerns about quality and patient
safety. The argument is that London should lead the way to
all-consultant rotas to guarantee better
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:39:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000778" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000778">Taken
at face value, no one could argue with that proposition. We all want
great care, and we all want the safest and best care for ourselves, our
families and our constituents. BSBV’s answer to this quality
challenge, however, is a grandiose reconfiguration of acute care
costing over £350 million. It proposes the centralisation of
emergency care, maternity and paediatric care on fewer hospital sites
in south-west London. The result is the loss of two A and E
departments, two maternity units, three paediatric units and other
associated
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000779" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000779"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:40:35"></hs_TimeCode>Despite
quality and safety concerns being the driving force, actual quality
today has been discounted. It is assumed that quality will improve, but
there is no explanation or evidence to justify the assumption that
those things that are not good now will necessarily become better in
the future. How that can be made to happen has not been spelled
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:40:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000780" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000780">I
have to tell the Minister that BSBV is causing huge damage to the NHS
in south-west London. It is dividing medical opinion and demoralising
staff in hospitals such as my own St Helier hospital. It is also
distracting the NHS from the much bigger task of delivering the
productivity and quality gains needed to meet the Nicholson challenge.
In the wake of the Francis report, it is clear that BSBV has not
considered the impact of forced reconfiguration on patient safety. That
must be a risk, and it should be properly evaluated and taken into
consideration.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022853000781" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000781"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:41:33"></hs_TimeCode>I
said that BSBV had come up with a grandiose solution. At the top of
every list BSBV draws up comes my local hospital, the St Helier
hospital. My constituents are being expected to travel for longer and
further because of a dogma—that greater specialisation on fewer
hospital sites improves outcomes. Last year, however, a paper in the
<I>Health Service Management Research</I><I> </I>journal examined the
evidence to support this dogma. Anthony Harrison of the King’s
Fund reviewed a large number of studies, some of which were
commissioned for the Department, and concluded that there was no
evidence of a causal link between volume and outcomes. BSBV, however,
relies on that dogma, and tries to shame anyone who argues against it
by painting opponents as being “opposed” or in a position
of being prepared to support and tolerate poorer outcomes.</hs_Para>

I say, this view is being advanced without evidence. There is some
evidence that greater specialisation may well save lives—I do
not dispute that—and the reorganisation of hyper-acute stroke
care and major trauma across London appears to be a case in point. 
<?notus-xml column=567?>Those are examples where it certainly makes a difference and they have
made a difference across London. It is important, however, that we
await the results of studies of how those improvements have been
secured before we claim to have a full understanding of all the factors
that have played a part in delivering the gains that have been
realised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000783" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000783">Although
BSBV advances its view of the benefits of centralisation, it fails to
examine some of the important downsides. Shockingly, the proponents of
BSBV ignore evidence demonstrating a link between mortality and miles
travelled to gain access to emergency care. There is as much as a 1%
increase in mortality for every extra mile travelled. They ignore
evidence showing that St Helier has one of the safest
maternity units in London—a unit at which mums want to have
their babies. They also fail to consider the benefits of retaining A
and E, maternity and paediatric services at St Helier to ensure that
the NHS has the capacity to meet rising demand. Demand is
rising—birth rates are rising and the number of people needing
hospital services is,
too.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000784" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000784">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:43:52"></hs_TimeCode>
pursuit of this dogma, wildly optimistic assumptions are manufactured
about the extent to which demand for emergency care can be shifted out
of hospital or avoided altogether. Those involved assume, for example,
that 10% of A and E attendances can be avoided and that up to 60% of
such admissions can be shifted to urgent care, but the evidence for
that is weak and is contested by emergency care experts. There is, in
fact, a growing body of empirical evidence that calls into
question some of the diversion schemes that have been set in
place. Even the National Clinical Advisory Team’s evaluation of
BSBV last summer questioned the assumptions and urged caution. NCAT
says
that</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13022853000858" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000858">“experience

suggests that a more realistic assumption is that about 30% of A and E
patients will be shifted to urgent care. More damaging still, its
independent assessment warns that the data used to make the assumptions
are recognised in emergency care to “lack
reliability.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000786" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000786">Yet
those flawed assumptions are at the heart of BSBV’s grand
design. I think that they pose a significant risk to the safety of
patients, a risk made worse because those in charge of the programme
have not even worked out how to deliver the step change in
out-of-hospital care on which their heroic assumptions rely. Nor have
they worked out how much it might cost to deliver the changes in
primary and community health care. The reports of both NCAT and the
gateway review comment on that glaring gap in the BSBV case. NCAT
says:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13022853000859" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000859">“At
present attention is focused on hospital reconfiguration. There should
be at least as much concern shown to the developments in primary and
community care which are essential prerequisites of that hospital
reorganisation.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13022853000787" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000787">The
same zeal for centralisation runs through the proposals for maternity
services. Although St Helier’s maternity unit is performing
above the average in south-west London, although more than 3,400 mums
are choosing to have their babies at St Helier every year, and despite
welfare and health inequality concerns about women giving birth in more
remote locations, those in charge of BSBV are proposing the break-up of
an excellent maternity and paediatric team. Again, the evidence calls
that zeal into doubt.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=568?><hs_Para UID="13022853000788" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000788">I said that
BSBV was a distraction from the big challenge facing the NHS—the
Nicholson £20 billion challenge, which was identified by the
Department of Health back in 2008. The NHS in south-west London has
drawn up plans to find £394 million for quality and productivity
improvements out of a budget of £2.4 billion by 2016.
The money that it frees up will be used to meet rising demand and
improve quality. No one disputes the fact that it will be a tough
programme to deliver, and I must tell the Minister that BSBV is not
helping. In fact, it delivers very little for the Nicholson challenge:
just £18 million. Is all the pain that BSBV is inflicting worth
it? Those involved in BSBV want to spend a projected £350
million in capital in order to realise that £18
million. I calculate that, according to BSBVs figures, it will take
more than 20 years to get a payback on that capital investment.
BSBV’s purpose is to tackle quality and safety concerns which we
all want to be tackled, to fix consultant rotas, and to deal with other
related issues. According to its own figures, that will cost
between £4 million and £7 million.</hs_Para>

“do the minimum” or “do the least harm”
option been drawn up to find ways of delivering the benefits without
all the costs of BSBV’s grand design? No such plan has been
developed. To date, those in charge of BSBV have spent £5.5
million. They plan to spend £6 million more this year, and to
spend a further £2 million every year while the programme
continues. Surely there is a saving to be made
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000790" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000790">We
have a grand design in search of a justification: a classic
old-fashioned, top-down London NHS-inspired reconfiguration. The goal
has been to reach decisions before the old NHS structures are abolished
at the end of March, tying the hands of the new GP-led clinical
commissioning groups. Yet last year, during the passage of the Health
and Social Care Act 2012, it was made clear that there would be new
ways of designing health care, and that things would be different. The
new design was to be based on a detailed analysis of the current and
future needs of the local population, an analysis that would underpin
the development of local health and wellbeing strategies which, in
turn, would be reflected in the commissioning plans of
councils and clinical commissioning groups. The last
analysis of that kind that was conducted in my area, in
2009, did not support a wholesale change in acute care, but
BSBV is trying to drive a coach and horses through that. Rather than
designing services that fit its postcode, it is trying to shoehorn
south-west London into its
template.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000791" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000791">Because
BSBV has so clearly predetermined the fate of St Helier, it has caused
planning blight. It has derailed the de-merger of Epsom and St Helier
hospitals by causing huge uncertainty about the future of both. BSBV
has jeopardised the hard-won £219 million rebuild and
refurbishment of St Helier hospital, despite the former chief executive
of NHS South West London repeatedly stating that this was a fixed
point. That blight could be lifted today if the Minister made it clear
that it was no part of the Government’s design to allow the old
institutions of the NHS—primary care trusts and strategic health
authorities—to dictate how the new GP-led clinical
commissioning groups act. Furthermore, can the Minister confirm that
the NHS Commissioning Board is under a duty to secure the autonomy of
CCGs, and that she rejects any recreation of the top-down 
<?notus-xml column=569?>culture and will ensure that CCGs are empowered to
arrange local health care that fits and anticipates the needs of their
population<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:50:14"></hs_TimeCode>s?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000792" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000792">I
do not underestimate the difficulties that CCGs face in resolving how
best to arrange health care services in Epsom, Merton and Sutton, but
it is clear that BSBV does not offer a credible mechanism for meeting
the challenges. As the principal commissioners of services at the Epsom
and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust, the Sutton, Merton and
Surrey Downs CCGs should be able to shape acute health services for the
future. They must be able to commission those services in a way that
the three local health and wellbeing boards believe to be right,
unfettered by any legacies from the outgoing health
commissioners<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:50:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000793" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000793">I
hope that, as the new commissioners of acute and community health
services, my local CCGs will take the opportunity arising from the
current delay in the BSBV programme to bring it to an end. A clean
break from this flawed process will be a clear signal from the CCGs
that there will be a fresh start, and that they want to engage with the
Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust and the local
community, local councils and MPs to map out a future for acute health
services that has community and clinical
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:51:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022853000794" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/debtext/130228-0003.htm#13022853000794">In
conclusion, I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm the
following: first, that the local clinical commissioning groups are free
to scrap BSBV; secondly, that a “do minimum” option is a
must-do when it comes to reconfigurations; and thirdly that the
Department of Health will take a close and critical look at this
old-style, top-down reconfiguration from BSBV. BSBV is based on flawed
assumptions and poor data, and it is time to stop wasting money on this
discredited process. We need a fresh start in south-west London, not
tired, old, worn-out NHS reconfiguration of the very worst
sort. I hope the Minister can

hon. Friend the Member for Croydon Central argued in the same debate in
favour of the BSBV review on the basis that, according to one of the
many reports that form part of the review, Croydon Health Services NHS
Trust—in other words, his hospital—should have 16
whole-time equivalent consultants, but it has 4.9; St Helier
should have 12 but has 4.5; Kingston hospital NHS trust should have 16
but has 10; and St George’s should have at least 16 but has 21.
That suggests that departments across south-west London, with the
exception of the one at St George’s, do not have anything like
the recommended level of consultant cover. He went on, as we might
imagine because he, too, wants the very best for his hospital and his
constituents, to make the case that BSBV would deliver exactly what he

not want ever to be accused of not saying things I have been advised

right hon. Friend’s other question, in effect, was: would
someone at the Department of Health look at BSBV? As he knows, from 1
April the NHS Commissioning Board will have responsibility for
determining whether the four tests have been met, prior to a public
consultation on BSBV. The Secretary of State only becomes involved
quite some way down the line. I will not—I nearly said I was
going to bore you, Mr Deputy Speaker; I would not dream of doing such a
thing. However, the intervention of the Secretary of State can only
occur much later down the line, when the matter has been referred to
him by the overview and scrutiny committee of any local authority, by

Clive Betts</B> (Sheffield South East) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Ms Dorries. The
all-party report on the European regional development fund was
literally that, because all Committee members agreed with it. That is
the way it should be. We took evidence, and on the basis of that
evidence, we came to our conclusions. The attendance at this debate
probably reflects the fact that all members of the Select Committee on
Communities and Local Government are happy for me to speak on their
behalf about the report and raise the few issues on which we took a
slightly different view from those eventually indicated by the
Government in their response. The Committee was unanimous in valuing
the ERDF, which has clearly done excellent things in many parts of the
country, particularly the poorer parts, which, for the obvious reason
that that is what the ERDF is designed for, have benefited from the
scheme.</hs_Para>

first things that we examined is the fact that although everyone thinks
that the ERDF is good and has done good things in the areas where it
has been spent, no one can actually prove it. There was certainly
little hard evidence about the ERDF’s actual impact. What is
better because of it? What jobs and facilities exist now that would not
have been there if not for the ERDF? The Government gave us a helpful
response indicating that they are now doing more work to monitor and
evaluate this round of the ERDF. That should be done some time this
year, and it will then feed into any proposals for spending during the
next ERDF spending round. That is welcome. Does the Minister have any
further information on that evaluation study? What is  it
likely to cover, when is it likely to report and when is it likely to
be made public? I think he has promised that a copy will be sent to the
Committee for our consideration. It would be helpful to have that
further information.</hs_Para>

Betts:</Member></B> Absolutely, and I will say a little more about it
later. It is probably consistent with the European Commission’s
recommendations on trying to improve how European funds are spent by
pulling the various funding streams together at a European level, thus
enabling simplification within the UK, and allowing that funding to be
controlled and brought together with other funds at local level,
including through local enterprise partnerships. That would be entirely
compatible with and would boost the direction of travel for which Lord
Heseltine has been arguing. That is an important and valid
point.</hs_Para>

on to this, but it is critical to know how the now-secured ERDF funding

Sheffield city region level. I hope that he will encourage the Minister

that a bit later, but I am certainly happy to do so now. It is
important that the European Union has recognised that, and it is
important that Departments are prepared to do so. The challenge for
Ministers is getting an overview and ensuring that the totality of
available funding in the ERDF budget is spent, while giving local
flexibility to ensure that it is spent on the right projects and in the
right ways to benefit local communities. It is always a challenge for
those of us with a localist bent who want more decisions to be made at
a local level to ensure that that is done so as to keep national
commitments and spending budgets
intact.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022843000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022843000017">I
come to the issue of DCLG’s responsibility. The evidence that we
had—it was clear, and I do not think that there was any
dissenting evidence—showed that by and large, the switch from
RDAs to DCLG, as an administrative exercise, had been well managed.
However, there were one or two examples of potential delays. We asked
the Government to examine those, and the response was, “We
can’t find any evidence of delays.” The Committee was a
bit concerned—that concern has grown—that Ministers were
a little complacent in saying, “We’ve got 98% of the
money committed.” By “committed”, they meant
projects in the pipeline as well. It was not all contractually
committed; “committed” also meant projects that were
moving forward but had not been finally signed off. Historically, with
the ERDF and similar budgets, in order to hit the target of 100%
spending, it has probably been necessary to have more than 100%
commitment when moving forward.</hs_Para>

level, but it has now gone. Our attention was drawn to the problem
caused by the absence of match funding. The ministerial response was,
“There are local authorities, universities and
businesses.” It may have escaped Ministers’ attention
that local authorities are not overwhelmed with spare cash to find
match funding. Universities are in a slightly difficult financial

of our concerns is not merely that there may not be enough match

appreciate that the Minister was appointed after our report was
published and that he is new to the issues. We suggested that the
regional growth fund should have a ring-fenced element identified for
match funding because it would give the sort of flexibility that has
been lost with the abolition of the RDAs by providing a pot of money so
that the best value projects might more easily obtain the needed match
funding. There would then be the local flexibility mentioned by

removed such flexibility from the table and said, “It is not
something we want to do, and it is not our policy.” They should
have another look. The last two things Ministers would want are an
underspend or money being spent on things that do not represent value.

contribution to the total ERDF budget. We were supportive of the United
Kingdom as a relatively rich country contributing to ERDF spending in
the poor regions of the EU. That was accepted and not a

our total European economy and to give assistance to the poorest
regions. We did look, however, at the fact that the United Kingdom gets

there was a better alternative to passing money backwards and forwards

could make a commitment: “This sum of money we would be

seven years, to spend that amount of money in the UK. We commit to

European regional development fund is clearly an increasingly important
funding stream in a time of austerity, when funds from other sources
are under pressure. That brings about its own issues, and local
government funding cuts are making life increasingly problematic in
enabling local authorities to find the match funding necessary to draw
down the important ERDF funding stream. I regret to note that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T13:55:40"></hs_TimeCode>
Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon.
Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis), when he was on the
“Today” programme this morning, was urging even more
reductions in the years ahead, even though we have already had
unprecedented funding cuts to local government. That will obviously
make life even more problematic for those councils that seek to secure
the funding stream through the

have spoken to a number of colleagues in local government, and there is
some anxiety and cynicism about the possibility of an underspend. I am
reassured to some extent by what I have heard in my hon.
Friend’s contribution and by what I understand Ministers are
saying about ensuring that the fund will be spent in total, without an
underspend. That has not, however, stopped the anxiety or the cynicism
expressed to me by colleagues, who are concerned that under the terms
of the UK rebate any unspent European funding or a proportion of
it—two thirds of it—is clawed back by the Treasury. The
fear is that that might be an under-the-radar funding cut being sought
by Government over and above the cuts that they have already made to
local authorities around the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T13:57:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022843000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022843000046">Last
year, there was concern about an underspend of up to £1 billion,
but I believe that that is now not likely to be the case. Nevertheless,
as my hon. Friend referred to, there is significant concern about
projects falling behind or being in danger of collapsing altogether,
and a significant sum remains uncommitted at the moment. Two thirds of
local authorities are already anxious about their ability to
match-fund, so any further reductions in funding will be even more
problematic. With 50% of councils falling behind with projects, there
is obviously a major problem to be
addressed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T13:58:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022843000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022843000047">For

contribution

Union and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister’s
negotiations, which have delivered an extremely good deal for this
country. You would call me out of order, Ms Dorries, if I did so, but
the purpose of objecting to transition regions was that we

2006 programme. That quarter of a billion pounds would have to have
been met by the taxpayer. However, because of the excellent work done

ensure that the same procedures were followed right across England, so
that we can track our liabilities much more accurately than in the

the Chairman of the Committee will well remember, when the European
Commission gave evidence to the Select Committee last year, it was
asked how we had managed the transfer from the RDAs to the Department.
As the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, the European Commission said that
it had been “well managed” and considered that we had
done a good job in handling the transition. I was delighted that the
hon. Gentleman confirmed that, but as he said, it is not all perfect.
There are concerns in some parts of the country. He gave the west
midlands as an example, so I can help him by giving the most up-to-date
figures—I know that he always likes to be kept up to
date.</hs_Para>

£254 million of the allocated funding of £328 million,
leaving £74 million to be contracted. So far, we have created
7,404 jobs, and we are contracted to deliver 17,704, despite the target
having been only 11,550. From that information, I hope that the

the west midlands is now very much on track—not only to deliver,

targeted.</hs_Para>

Minister, but I got the point that £74 million was still not
contractually committed, and presumably there are similar figures for
other regions. Does the Minister have a total figure for money that is
not contracted, and if it is all right in every region, why are civil

and another one. He also asked, “Would it not make sense to
slightly overplan, in case there is some slippage?” In terms of
the £74 million, I can tell him that negotiations are under way
for some £83 million of contracts, so we are well on the way to
using up the money and getting the match funding, which he is concerned
about. However, because he has recommended it to us, and it is on his

me explain the background to my interest in this subject. Although I
have a specific interest in ICT legislation, I did not appreciate the
significance of the issue until a constituent explained his
predicament. A retired individual from Cowbridge in my constituency in
the Vale of Glamorgan, who is regularly at home during the day,
highlighted the fact that he could receive more than a dozen calls from
sales and marketing companies during working hours and throughout the
evening.</hs_Para>

initially assumed that the Telephone Preference Service would resolve
the matter, but after researching the issue, I started to appreciate
its complexity. Anyone who wishes to stop unsolicited calls can
register with the Telephone Preference Service, which makes it against
the law to call consumers who are registered on the list unless they
have prior consent to do so.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022843000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022843000110"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:02:46"></hs_TimeCode>Ofcom
has the responsibility for maintaining the Telephone Preference
Service, which is administered under licence by the Direct Marketing
Association. The Information Commissioner has the responsibility to
follow up consumer complaints and take action against those companies
that are breaking the law. That sounds pretty straightforward providing
that each party lives up to its obligations. However, the situation is
not so straightforward. To complain about an unsolicited call, we need
the caller’s telephone number. Caller display or dialling 1471
should enable a complaint to be pursued. The privacy and electronic
communication regulations require the caller to identify themselves
when asked, but it appears that most withhold their number, making it
almost impossible to identify them unless the receiver is prepared to
endure the marketing pitch, which is undesirable 
<?notus-xml column=157?>to many. In many circumstances, the caller will
simply hang up when the receiver asks for their identity at the
outset.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022843000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022843000111">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:07:35"></hs_TimeCode>
situation does not stop there. Many calls are silent or abandoned, and
that is because call centres use automated diallers. That technology
dials more numbers than there are agents available in order to maximise
the time they spend speaking to consumers. It is only when the consumer
answers the phone that an agent will be connected. If an agent is not
available there are two options: the automated system can leave a
message, which is considered to be an abandoned call, or it can drop
the call without a message, which is considered to be a silent call.
Both are irritating, but a silent call can be intimidating or even
frightening to some constituents. That situation is compounded when the
number is withheld, preventing a complaint from being
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:05:01"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:09:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022843000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022843000112">There
are two issues here. First, many call centres do not adhere to the
rules laid down by the Telephone Preference Service or the privacy and
electronic communication regulations. Secondly, withheld numbers
prevent a consumer from complaining. Even if a company is committed to
following the PEC rules, loopholes remain. If someone is registered
with the TPS, it remains legal to call them to conduct a survey as an
excuse. Another way of getting around the rules is to use the
“permission to call” loophole, which is where someone who
may have bought a product in the past has not ticked the box to exclude
their data from being passed on to “carefully selected
partners”. The reality is that their data have been sold on to
another company that might have some tenuous relationship with the
original company. It does not even stop there. There is also a third
dimension: calls from overseas. Calls being made on behalf of UK
companies should also adhere to the privacy and electronic
communication regulations. There is evidence that they do not, but
there is a further problem when they are not acting on behalf of UK
companies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:06:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022843000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022843000113">It
is little wonder that I received such a response to this debate given
the numbers of the complaints. Ofcom shows that 47% of adults
experienced the silent call treatment during the last six months of
2012, which is up by a quarter on the year before. In July 2012, there
were some 10,000 complaints; six months earlier the number was a third
of that, which shows that the problem is increasing at a remarkable
rate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:06:58"></hs_TimeCode>. A survey
by <I>Which? </I>magazine found that 76% of respondents were still
getting lots of nuisance calls despite being registered with TPS. It is
safe to make the assumption that there would be even more complaints if
the callers could identify the number from which they were
called.</hs_Para>

regulatory responsibility is split and not straightforward. The
Information Commissioner’s Office is responsible for enforcing
companies to comply with the rules, and Ofcom has powers to deal with
the silent or abandoned calls. Let me give credit to the Information

Cairns:</Member></B> My hon. Friend shows great interest in these
issues and makes an extremely valuable point. I have already mentioned
that Ofcom and the Information Commissioner’s Office have been
slow to respond to the problem, and as my hon. Friend highlights, the
position is ever changing. Not only are telephone numbers changing but
so too is technology. Although I welcome Ofcom’s five-point
plan, which it would probably cite in response to the criticism coming
from the Government Benches, it is not a game changer. The plan is
helpful and welcome, but it will not make a significant difference to
most people, particularly as it is an ever-changing
situation.</hs_Para>

have serious concerns about the regulatory responsibility being split
between two bodies. It causes confusion to the consumer and adds
nothing to the prevention or resolution of the problem. Having one
body—probably Ofcom—would be much more efficient. The
issue of withheld numbers, however, is central. Technology improvements
allowed caller ID to be introduced in 1994, and at
that time a consensus developed that callers should be able
to withhold numbers if they wished. Key reasons related to the need to
protect people receiving calls from charitable groups, such as those
supporting victims of domestic violence, and to the need for the police
to contact someone without disclosing their identity. At the time,
there was no major issue with nuisance calls, and it is fair to say
that contact centres have now abused the protection that was intended
for the greater good.</hs_Para>

calls could be compared to someone knocking at the door wearing a mask
or a balaclava. Would we answer the door to such an unknown caller? Of
course we would not. Why, then, do we allow the same thing to happen
over the telephone? Ironically, door-to-door salesmen from some of the
companies Ofcom has criticised must show identity cards. In recent
years, some of those companies have used them as a marketing ploy to
demonstrate how responsible they are. Salesmen are therefore showing ID
cards when they call at the door, but nothing similar happens when they
use the telephone.</hs_Para>

people have been forced to ask their telephone operators to block all
withheld numbers—for a fee, of course. That can leave
individuals in a vulnerable position. GP practices, police stations or
other essential service providers do not always display their
number—possibly with good reason, possibly not—so
constituents may refuse to answer the telephone.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13022843000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022843000120"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:10:58"></hs_TimeCode>Some
innovations and new telephones can overcome part of the problem, but
there needs to be a shift in policy to protect the consumer. One option
is that organisations that wanted to withhold numbers would need to
show they had good reason for doing so and to get Ofcom’s
agreement. That, of course, should not apply to domestic users.
<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>We need to
recognise that that will not always deal with certain situations, given
technological developments and the ever-changing situation. Voice over

particularly problematic.</hs_Para>

am not a fan of legislation for the sake of legislation, so I ask UK
firms to play their part voluntarily. They should not only adhere
strictly to the regulations, but go further and introduce higher
standards, possibly in the 
<?notus-xml column=159?>form of a code of conduct. It would be a good start, for example, if
they agreed to stop using withheld numbers, rather than being
forced to do so through legislation. Using withheld
numbers is in their interests, not the consumer’s interests, so
if they really want to react to consumer demands, that would be a good
start.</hs_Para>

network operators also have a part to play. They could establish a
system that made it possible to identify callers using withheld
numbers. That would allow complaints to be made to Ofcom or the
Information Commissioner. Legislation may well prevent the
caller’s number from being given to the receiver, but the
network operator will often know what the number is. A simple system
could be introduced to allow a consumer to make a direct complaint to
Ofcom, with the telephone operator advising Ofcom what the number is.
<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>Those
innovative, straightforward proposals would resolve many of the
problems.</hs_Para>

I said, the situation is extremely complicated. I have not even got on
to texting or calls to mobiles. However, my comments demonstrate the
problem, which has increased partly as a result of payment protection
insurance and partly as a result of the claims that have been made for
many other things. Given that the data that have been published show a
trebling of nuisance phone calls in one month alone last year, we can
assume the figure is even higher, and it would be much higher still if
the receiver of the call could complain because they had the telephone
number. I am grateful for Members’
support.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-02-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_28_PT_1/404E0ED4D0E637E1E27422C8B376DFE96E147D47" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="28 February 2013">Thursday

Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003,
which cover rules about unsolicited electronic marketing messages sent
by telephone, fax, e-mail or text. Regulation 19 requires organisations
making automated marketing telephone calls to have the prior consent of
the person being called. That means that live marketing calls cannot be
made to anyone who has indicated an objection to receiving

protect them.
Ofcom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:19:46"></hs_TimeCode> has fined
nine companies for making silent calls, but if the companies persist it
must be because, in spite of the fines, it is worth their while. Over

apparent general reluctance to act, the regulators tie their own hands
by the policies that they set. To give just a few examples of the
complexity of those policies, Ofcom uses the persistent misuse powers
only against those who it finds have failed to follow its policy that
no more than 3% of calls may be abandoned. All other reported misuse,
including making millions of silent calls within the 3% limit, is
tolerated. The ICO requires that the direct marketing purpose of the
call be explicitly declared. However, a caller collecting information

easiest and most fertile targets for nuisance phone calls are the
elderly, like me. About 30% of householders in my constituency are
retired home owners. They provide a happy hunting ground for
fraudsters. Rob Vale and his team in trading standards at Bromley
council suggest that the battle over nuisance phone callers is
constant, unremitting and growing. According to Bromley trading
standards two particular scams have been perpetrated over the past two
years. One is the Microsoft scam. The victim receives a phone call from
someone, often with a foreign accent, who says that there is a bug in
their computer. The fix requires the victim to log on to a website
where their computer is then under the hoaxer’s control. A
fictitious problem is then placed on the computer and the victim is
told that it will cost, say, £120 for it to be
fixed by a download or, indeed, that regular
maintenance by the fraudsters will be needed.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:23:01"></hs_TimeCode> second scam
involves debit or credit cards, and everyone has heard of it.
Fraudsters telephone claiming to be from the police and saying that the
victim’s debit or credit card has been cloned. The fictitious
police ask for details of the account, normally also giving a fake
police telephone number so the victim can check that 
<?notus-xml column=162?>they are genuine. However, they stay on the line until that phone call
is made, so they keep control and continue the deception
until they get the bank

the present and previous Governments have been more than aware of the
problems caused by nuisance phone calls. Ofcom and the Information
Commissioner’s Office as regulators have powers to act, and the
maximum penalty, as we have heard, has been increased to
£2 million. Ofcom set out an action plan on 8 January
for improving the service to victims. Generating unsolicited telephone
calls is an offence, but it remains planned and persistent. Only one
company has been fined £50,000; but I think everyone present
would want more fines. The problem

It is then difficult get a grip of the situation; but there must be

have inquired locally, and trading standards in Bromley have tried to
get a grip of nuisance phone calls with various measures. When they
hear of a problem they rapidly get hold of the originators of cold
calls and warn them off; they have set up a system for banks and
building societies in the Bromley area to contact trading standards if
elderly people begin to make unusual withdrawals or to do things that
are not typical of them; they have delivered 70 talks in the past year
to the elderly warning them about the dangers of nuisance and cold
calls; they have sent out packs to elderly residents also warning them
of the problem; and of course they use the local newspapers and radio
to alert people to scams. I mentioned Rob Vale, the head of standards
at Bromley, who does a very good job. He reckons that such measures
have probably saved the elderly about £1 million in the past few
years, which is great. Those responsible have done so well that <I>The

are concerned about a number of issues, and a range of constituents
have contacted me. An elderly couple wrote to me to ask for advice
about what they could do, because they were receiving persistent calls.
They said in their letter to me:</hs_Para>

might not seem like a lot of calls, but for an elderly couple such as
my constituents, who live in sheltered housing and who would normally
receive calls from family and friends but who are suddenly receiving an
influx of calls and do not know who they are from or what they are
about, it can be quite concerning.</hs_Para>

gave that couple advice at that stage. They contacted the Telephone
Preference Service and were told that that was the correct thing to do.
However, part of the problem was that the calls originated from
offshore and the TPS could do nothing about them. Of course, the couple
were then quite concerned because it seemed as though nobody was really
taking the issue seriously.</hs_Para>

well as the nuisance calls, of course, there are the other types of
calls that have already been referred to as scams. Again, one of my
constituents wrote to me to explain that a couple of years ago she was
constantly phoned for a few weeks by a company that said there were
problems with her computer. Eventually, after a number of those calls,
she gave in; she thought that what the company said must be correct.
She gave the company information, allowed it to log on to her personal
computer and then it started to tell her about all the serious problems
she had with her computer and began to ask her for money. Thankfully,
she then realised that something was wrong. None the less, she
continued to receive calls from the same company, despite making it
clear that she had no wish to receive any such calls in the future. Her
number was ex-directory, and she was registered with the TPS.</hs_Para>

issue was raised with me recently by constituents. I hope that the
Minister will consider it seriously, as he has done with the other
problems that have been raised. A number of constituents have contacted
me because they are concerned about what they say are companies calling
them about either the green deal or some of the energy offers that are
available. The problem for my constituents is that they are not
immediately able to identify whether those calls are genuine calls made
on behalf of—as they see it—the Government or, indeed, on
behalf of a company that is seeking to persuade them to apply for
Government grants before providing them with the business. There seem
to be some grey areas in terms of what is marketing and what is
actually selling. That is something that it would be useful to
look at.</hs_Para>

of my constituents, who is pretty savvy about these issues, received a
call telling her that she could miss out on lots of Government grants,
so she told the caller that, of course, the green deal is not about
grants but loans, etc. The caller then tried to continue with the call,
by claiming that they were not trying to sell her anything at all.
Afterwards, she googled to get the information about the company that
had called her and discovered that it was indeed a company trying to

calls are another issue that people will be familiar with. I know how
difficult it is sometimes when I am calling people, or when people are
calling me, for them to understand me; having a fairly broad west of

from the situation outlined by other hon. Members, the ICO has begun to
show its teeth. It issued fines for cold calling to three companies for
the first time a couple of weeks ago. Last year, the first fines were
issued for spam texts for a company that was part of the growing
industry that texts numbers to promote PPI and personal injury claims.
The ICO is doing much more, with a few initiatives in the pipeline,
including working with global phone companies to agree a memorandum of
understanding to allow information to be shared, as it has already done
with the claims management regulator, and considering intervention
points relating to personal data—all the points at which data
from someone who, for example, completes a survey while shopping online
are used<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:41:16"></hs_TimeCode>.
Working together, regulators can trace the data from the start to the

intervention points are and will highlight any gaps in
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:41:29"></hs_TimeCode>.
There is also an investigation into what changes need to be made in

want to focus on the activities of ambulance-chasing lawyers and claims
management companies, which are among the worst perpetrators of
nuisance calls and have had a boom with PPI mis-selling. It is becoming
abundantly clear that the next area of expansion is accident
compensation. As Members will realise after the Mid Staffordshire
report and as I know from being a member of the Public Accounts
Committee, the field of health compensation is growing like Topsy. It
is so cheap for companies to make randomly generated calls that that
will be the emerging
nuisance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022876000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000038">We

telephone. Which? reports that 74% of people have been contacted in

plagued the most by this menace. Let us call it what it is: harassment.

consumers unwittingly find themselves entering into contracts that
cause them significant financial detriment and are fleeced for payments
without any service being delivered. Which? told me of an 87-year-old
housebound gentleman who was quite deaf and frail. He was on the
Telephone Preference Service register, had not taken out any loans for
years and had no PPI, but during a call, he was persuaded to give his
credit card details to a claims management company, which promptly
relieved him of £250. I call that theft. The regulatory system

the time available to me, I want to highlight what consumers can do,
given that the regulators are being a bit lily-livered about dealing
with the issue. Richard Herman has fought back successfully against
being 
<?notus-xml column=169?>plagued by such companies. The man is a complete hero of mine. He hit

hon. Members that the even better news is that Richard Herman has done
it again. He was recently cold called about his accident. He played
along with the caller, who—illegally—would not say who
they were, kept plugging away and asking the question and eventually
discovered that they were from a 260-person firm of solicitors called
Scott Rees. Mr Herman contacted Scott Rees on the phone and advised
them that he would charge them £10 a minute for any further time
that he spent being contacted by the firm or its lead-generating
system. Sure enough, the firm called him again, so he took great
pleasure in invoicing it for £230 and received a cheque.
Consumers can fight back. Good luck to Mr Herman; he has obviously
found himself a nice little earner.</hs_Para>

set up a website at saynotocoldcalls.com, where he outlines a six-point
plan to deal with cold callers. It is probably much more use than the
advice that Ofcom gave to
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T15:52:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Edinburgh West (Mike Crockart) and a fraction of the
length.  Mr Herman’s first point of advice is to record
the telephone call and then to play along to find out the company name,
advise the company that it will be invoiced £10 a minute if it
calls again, wait for it to call again and then send it an invoice and
sue in small claims court if it does not pay. Thanks to Mr Herman,
there is a precedent.</hs_Para>

do well to advise our constituents that that is the way forward. When
cold callers get to Mr Herman, it will cost them, but he
says that it would deter them more if penalties were higher. That comes
back to what we have all been saying about the regulators taking more
action where detriment occurs. Much more should be done in terms of
spot fines to curb such behaviour. Until we start showing that we will
take action against cold callers, they will continue; it is just too
profitable for them not to do so.</hs_Para>

to examine the activities of companies that present direct debit
instructions to banks, which leaves consumers exposed, and to consider
codes of practice in that regard. Telecommunications providers that
allow scammers, particularly from overseas, to use our network have a
big role to play. We are aware of other abuses that involve re-routing

significant bills. I hope that the Minister will consider that bigger

we have discussed, there are lots of regulatory underlaps in this area,

challenge for the Minister. As we have heard, we have a good

It  
<?notus-xml column=170?>is obvious from the exchanges so far that the present system is failing

if it could be enforced, that would be a major step forward. I also

hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart) before he had to
leave, there is also an issue about ticking the box on other forms and
whether that counters one’s entry on the Telephone Preference
Service register. Clearly, when they have registered with TPS, people
think that that is job done. Many unsolicited and silent calls arise
through the use of automated systems used by commercial call centres.
Silent calls are of particular concern to the vulnerable and elderly.
Any automated calls—those where the recipient of the call does
not have the chance to speak to a real person—must be made with
the consent of the recipient, and the identity of the caller must be

silent calls a day from the same company, often over a period of days

(Cathy Jamieson) and for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah). The
calls are not only a nuisance; they can become threatening to some
people, and they can also lead to serious financial frauds and scams.
That is why it is important that the Government take serious
action<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:04:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022876000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000068">The
briefing from Ofcom on its work is interesting, but Ofcom, too, is
asking for changes to the regulatory framework. Ofcom would like to be
allowed to share information with the Information Commissioner’s
Office, which highlights the problem—we need a single regulator,
a single port of call. Sharing information will not be enough; we need
one place where people can go with the confidence that they will
receive a proper
answer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:05:22"></hs_TimeCode>. What
discussions has the Minister had with his colleagues in the Ministry of
Justice and the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills on introducing one seamless operation to address this scourge of
modern

also mentioned the difficulty of addressing the problem of nuisance
calls given its limited resources. The Minister is responsible for
cutting Ofcom’s budget by 28%. When he did so, I am sure he
thought it would be a cut without consequences for the general public
because Ofcom is part of the Government machinery that is invisible to
ordinary members of the public. In practice, such cuts have real
implications, and he must think about whether Ofcom has the resources
it needs to address nuisance
calls<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:06:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022876000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000070">I
reiterate what other hon. Members have said: Ofcom should be the lead
institution, because people have heard of Ofcom. But it is not simply a
question of beefing up Ofcom; we also need a new framework based on the
important principle that people are entitled to their privacy and
should be in control of their own personal
information<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:06:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022876000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000071">As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:06:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central said, the issue is not only
with nuisance calls but with people’s use of the internet and
new technology in general. One of the main inhibitors when people go
online is their anxiety about loss of privacy, and nuisance calls are
another good example of that. The Government, who are pursuing a policy
of digital by default, must energetically address that
anxiety<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:07:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022876000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000072">Members
on both sides of the House agree that unwanted calls are a nuisance and
that we need a fresh approach. Will the Minister say something about
the forthcoming communications White Paper, which has been rather
delayed, and commit to including nuisance calls in that and in new
legislation? We hope to see a framework and outline for those things in
the Queen’s Speech so that we can get moving on the
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:08:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022876000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000073">I
hope the Minister will be able to address the following issues in the
White Paper. There should be a single complaints portal and a single
regulator. There should 
<?notus-xml column=173?>also be changes to the rules on consent. At the moment, withdrawing
consent is difficult once it has been given. If a person gives consent
to a firm, the firm can carry on using that consent, even if the person
subsequently signs up to the TPS. The firm can also sell on those
data<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:08:47"></hs_TimeCode>. We must
enable people to retract consent simply and
straightforwardly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:08:57"></hs_TimeCode>.
I would also like the Minister to explore the possibility of ensuring
that third-party marketing consent expires after three
months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:09:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022876000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000074">It
would help if the Minister said a little more about the monetary
penalties available. Does he believe that the ICO needs to have
stronger powers to issue fines and monetary penalties? These firms have
an interest in making a high number of
calls<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:09:38"></hs_TimeCode>. They have
a financial interest in exceeding the 3% of abandoned and nuisance
calls permitted under the existing regulations. As long as they have a
financial interest in doing so and it is difficult to tackle the
technology, they will carry on doing that, so the only way to deal with
it is for a strong, powerful financial disincentive through the fines
mechanism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:10:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022876000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000075">Finally,
we need to address the technology question. I was pleased to hear
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:10:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central, who probably knows more
about the technology than anyone else in the Chamber, say that it can
be done. With a number of the culture, media and sports policy issues
that we have debated, the initial stance of the industry has been,
“Oh, it is not technically possible to do that”, although
it has then turned out to be possible.</hs_Para>

have suggested that even if the telephone number of the caller cannot
be released to the recipient, the recipient should be able to complain
to Ofcom and refer to the call, so that Ofcom can trace it. That is
sensible. Another suggestion, equally important, is that mobile phone
companies should be able to provide consumers with spam-filtering
technology, to help them to tackle the problem of spam text messages,
which all of us have received about

is an important issue—we agree on that—and it is a new
issue, so I am not blaming the Minister for not having dealt with it
earlier, because he could not be expected to have that much foresight
of the situation. The problem having now arisen, however, we clearly do
not have the necessary institutional and legal machinery in place, so
he needs to act. I hope that he will make a commitment to act in the

right hon. Member for Doncaster Central (Ms Winterton) made
a silent contribution by being in the Chamber to monitor proceedings,
so she is technically regulated by Ofcom for the purposes of the

wishing to turn the debate into some kind of tit-for-tat exchange with
the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland, with whom I would like to say I
have a good relationship on the issues we cover together, the problem
is not new, although it is becoming prominent. Let me make no bones
about taking the problem seriously. I know it is a problem from my own
postbag, because, of the correspondence with the Department by hon.
Members, I suspect that the majority is about nuisance calls, although
I have not done an actual stock-take. All hon. Members contributing to
the debate have made it clear that their constituents are genuinely
affected by the problem, from those finding it mildly irritating to
vulnerable people who find it sinister and intimidating. We must do
more to tackle
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:14:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

small contextual point: not all marketing calls are a bad thing. In
this country, we have a successful direct marketing industry which is
worth £14 billion—mail as well as calls—and
employs almost 400,000 people. We must therefore recognise that it is
an important industry and that, in many cases, a direct call can help a
consumer. To return to the main point and to the thrust and mood of the
debate, however, we must do more to combat the menace of silent and
unsolicited marketing
calls<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:15:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022876000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000081">As
I implied at the beginning of my remarks, and many hon. Members
including my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:15:31"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan have made the point, there
is some confusion in the regulatory structure. The Information
Commissioner’s Office is responsible for the Privacy and
Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, the result
of a European directive, which means that it is responsible for live
marketing calls, when someone calls people at home, and for automated
recorded message calls, when a recorded person calls people at home.
Ofcom has stepped into the breach—I think well—to deal
with silent and abandoned calls, which are not directly regulated but
are now covered by Ofcom because it has powers to deal with persistent
misuse by telecoms companies. That is where Ofcom’s role
exists<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:16:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022876000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000082">In
2010, we made an important change, increasing the level of fines
available. I will not make a party political point because that process
was already under way under the previous Government; I am sure that a
different Government would also have increased the fines. A penalty of
£50,000 for persistent misuse is clearly chickenfeed to a large
multinational company; that has been increased, so Ofcom can now fine
up to 
<?notus-xml column=175?>£2 million. In May 2011, we gave the Information
Commissioner’s Office for the first time the power to fine, so
that it can now fine companies up to
£500,000 for serious breaches of the privacy and electronic
communications regulations. Previously, it could only issue a fine of
up to £5,000 through a magistrates
court<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:17:27"></hs_TimeCode>. The new
powers, which came into effect about a year ago in January 2012, once
the ICO had updated its statutory guidance, are being used and have
resulted in substantial fines, such as the £440,000 imposed on
two illegal
marketeers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:17:45"></hs_TimeCode>.
These are, therefore, to an extent early days for the use of the
powers, although that may sound
odd<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:17:54"></hs_TimeCode>. I meet
regularly with the ICO and with Ofcom to discuss what they are doing to
work together and to use the powers. I am confident that we will see
more
fines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:18:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022876000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000083">It
is worth remembering that the ICO and Ofcom are not in a position
simply to be told about a breach and issue a fine the next day. They
have to go through due process and they have to be sure of their facts.
Although I suspect that that is frustrating, in particular for people
who are watching the debate and want to see action and more fines, I am
confident that there will be more fines along the way. That is quite
depressing, however, in a funny way, because it shows the problem is
continuing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:18:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022876000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000084">I
too share the frustration that two regulators are involved, which is
something that we want to look at in our White Paper. Now that I know
that the Labour party’s position is that Ofcom should be the
single regulator, I invite
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-02-28T16:18:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bishop Auckland, as well as all stakeholders and those interested,
to make a response to our White Paper. We will not set out our
definitive position in the White Paper, but we will set out the
options. The Government being a co-ordinated and seamless machine, as
we know, it is the case that the ICO is covered by the Ministry of
Justice, while Ofcom is covered by the Department for Culture, Media
and Sport, although a young, energetic and vigorous Minister is
stepping into the breach to cover both issues and to be with hon.

meet regularly with the ICO, Ofcom and the Telephone Preference
Service. One thing they have done in the light of those meetings is to
improve the information available on the internet. It is now relatively
straightforward to navigate the Ofcom and ICO websites. On the Ofcom
website the nature of the call received is detailed, and  if it
falls to the other regulator a button can be clicked to go straight
through to it, and vice versa. They are co-ordinating their
work.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady referred to a single regulator. I hear what she says about
consent, and I will certainly have a closer look at that. It is clear
that authorised consent must be obtained from a consumer before
contacting them, but it is also clear from the debate that hon. Members
have the impression that some companies are playing fast and loose with
that. It is possible to impose a fine for breaching that requirement,
but I will look in more detail at how consumers may seek
redress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022876000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000087">I
make it absolutely clear that companies are required to provide calling

is also important, as some hon. Members said, that we continue to hold
to account companies that persistently abuse the system. For example,
the ICO stated on its website that it has invited some companies to
attend meetings with it to discuss their compliance with the privacy

Weatherseal Home Improvements, The Claims Guys, We Fight Any Claim,
British Gas, Scottish Power, Anglian Windows, and TalkTalk. One or two
of them are certainly improving their procedures as a result of the

action. We have introduced fines in the past two years, so they are
relatively recent. They are being used and they will be used in future,
but due process must be followed. I give a commitment to the House now
to have regular round-table meetings not just with the ICO and Ofcom,

hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock highlighted Mr Herman, who is a
champion of this campaign. Without question, he has managed to get his

common theme has been the call for a single regulator. The Minister
responded positively, and indicated the direction of thinking. We need
simplicity and certainty, and we must put the consumer at the front of
the issue, not the companies. There is a balance to be struck because
not all marketing calls are wrong. There is a part for them to play,
but it must be proportionate and within the
regulations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022876000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000102">With
changing technology, Ofcom needs broader powers so that it can react to
circumstances as voice over IP becomes more of an issue and technology
develops in ways that we may not even be aware of at the moment. The
Minister is absolutely right to say that the private sector has a part
to play. I am grateful that he talked about his meetings with the ICO
and Ofcom, and that telephone providers and operators will come
forward. It is exceptionally important to act in
co-ordination.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13022876000121" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/halltext/130228h0001.htm#13022876000121">4.30

IRA</I>—In July 2012, a number of disparate groups came together
to form an organisation generally referred to as the “new
IRA”. This new grouping primarily consists of members of the
Real IRA, Republican Action Against Drugs (which conducts brutal
shootings against nationalist members of the community) and a number of
unaffiliated individuals who we believe have connections to the fatal
attack against Massereene barracks in 2009. This group has already
demonstrated its lethal intent, claiming responsibility for the murder
of David Black last November. The group also conducted an unsuccessful
attack in September 2012, in which it attached a bomb to a bicycle as
part of a trap to kill police in Londonderry. It has, however, also
suffered setbacks. For example, on 6 December 2012 a number of
individuals were arrested and charged after being found in possession
of an explosively formed projectile capable of penetrating armoured
vehicles.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13022844000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/wmstext/130228m0001.htm#13022844000051"><I>Continuity

six months. We judge that this group is responsible for two attempted
under vehicle car-bomb attacks since December 2012. Fortunately none of
these were successful. Had they exploded they would almost certainly
have been fatal for anyone in the vicinity, potentially including
families and young children. Most recently, we believe that ONH were
responsible for throwing a pipe bomb which struck a PSNI vehicle in
north Belfast on 30
January.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13022844000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/wmstext/130228m0001.htm#13022844000053">All

bearing on the terms of that individual's redundancy. The maximum

all allegations of reported benefit fraud seriously. Where suspected
fraud or error is found the allegation is electronically routed to
either the Fraud Investigation Service (FIS) or the Customer Compliance

investigation is judged unnecessary, enabling FIS to focus on higher

investigate their cases to the criminal standard of proof and their

gross adjudicated overpayment is above £2,000, the case is

from Wales under the last Administration is instructive. The
introduction of a new top council tax band in Wales in 2005
(‘Band I’) went hand in hand with revaluation. The
revaluation and re-banding saw four times as many homes move up one or
more bands as move down. Many homes jumped multiple bands upwards, and
the new Band I contained homes from amongst all of the previous lower
bands, reflecting the fact that one cannot just split an existing top
band or bands. The biggest increase in the tax burden fell on homes
originally in Bands A to

guidance to councils on parking fines: 'Performance and

greater openness in the operation of the family courts. We have already
made considerable improvements by publishing much more information
about local court performance. In line with the recommendation of the
Justice Select Committee, flawed legislation to open up the family
courts to media scrutiny is being repealed, however, we are carefully
considering other options to allow for greater openness while
respecting the parties right to privacy. Our objective is to use the
creation of the new Single Family Court as an opportunity to correct
the perception that family courts are unjustifiably secret.</hs_Para>

also had a further meeting with ICO and Ofcom last month to discuss
enforcement action against nuisance calls. In those discussions I
pressed for further improvements to be made, particularly in terms of
more effective enforcement action against companies that breached the
Telephone Preference Service (TPS) rules. Consequently, ICO increased
the resources devoted to enforcement of the Privacy and Electronic
Communications Regulations (PECR) 2003 and on 28 November 2012 served
monetary penalties totalling £440,000 to two illegal marketers
responsible for distributing millions of spam texts. ICO also published
on its website a list of the most complained about companies that make
calls to TPS registered consumers. If the companies rail to remedy
their actions, then they could race further enforcement action.
Furthermore, ICO is currently considering issuing substantial penalties
to three other companies for making calls to TPS registered consumers.
I welcome this kind of robust action and expect ICO to continue with
similar measures against other companies as well.</hs_Para>

Improvement is continuing to work with the cardiovascular networks and
other key partners to provide advice and guidance on stroke prevention

prescribed aspirin to manage their risk of stroke and who would benefit
from oral anticoagulant medicines. Over the last year, NHS Improvement
has promoted the use of this tool at many educational events as well as

Soubry:</Member></B> The aim of the human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccination programme is to prevent cancers related to HPV. Given the
difference in the age at which most cervical cancers occur and the age
of routine HPV immunisation, an impact on cervical cancer incidence is
not expected to be seen for at least a decade or more and is likely to
be seen first in the results from the cervical screening programme
before cancer registries. For this reason the Health Protection Agency
has been commissioned to monitor the early impact of HPV immunisation
on type-specific (vaccine and non-vaccine) HPV infection rates and
initial results from this programme are anticipated to be published
within the next year.</hs_Para>

to develop the financial sector. For example, in Tanzania DFID and
other donors support the stock exchange regulator to develop a new
market segment at the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange called the
Enterprise Growth Market, which is similar to the Alternative
Investment Market at the London Stock Exchange. In Ethiopia, the
DFID-supported Investment Climate Facility for Africa is helping to
modernise the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange by introducing risk

access to online trading. In Southern Africa, DFID has provided support

was pleased that the British Library, the British Museum and the
Premier League were able to join the Prime Minister's delegation, who
were also joined during the visit by some members of the England
Women's Cricket Team. We want to see a step change in cultural and
sporting exchanges with India. We will see this reciprocal relationship
flourish further during the Alchemy Festival at the Southbank Centre in
London in April. These cultural exchanges also underpin our drive to
boost exports in fashion, film and other creative industries. These
exports, together with increasing levels of tourism from India, will
contribute to the economic growth of the UK while enhancing our quality

along with nineteen petitions, to its consultation on extending
marriage in England and Wales to same sex couples. In the event that a
Government consultation is likely to receive a high volume of
responses, it is not standard practice to collect either names or the
contact details of those individuals that respond. We are, therefore,

Grant:</Member></B> As the Secretary of State for
Culture, Media and Sport and Minister for Women and Equalities made
clear at the Second Reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill,
the Bill contains full protection against successful legal challenge of
a religious organisation's refusal to conduct a marriage of same sex
couples.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13022883000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130228/text/130228w0003.htm#13022883000010">The
Bill contains a quadruple lock of religious protections which deliver
on this commitment. No religious organisation will be allowed to
solemnize marriages of same sex couples according to its rites or on
its premises unless the governing authority of the organisation has
formally chosen to "opt in". It is clearly provided in the Bill that no
religious organisation can be compelled to “opt in”. So
any challenge in the European Court of Human Rights would be brought
against the Government, not the religious organisation. Even if an
organisation does opt in, no minister of religion (or person involved
in the solemnization) can be compelled to take part. We have made
separate arrangements to protect the Church of England and the Church
in Wales because of their unique legal
positions.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Correction" ColStart="7"><?date 2013-02-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_02_28_PT_1/A746108DC6FF99E3C7C50D6BF90D6CE041EF30DD" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="28 February 2013">Thursday
