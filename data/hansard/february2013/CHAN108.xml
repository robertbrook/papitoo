We do not use directly much gas from Russia, but we are happy to

and I will certainly look into that idea, but can I just tell him how
many things the Government are doing to support switching, not least
our support for collective switching? One of the advantages of
collective switching is that it can get even better deals for people
than the normal switching we have seen in the past. It can also reach
out to the most vulnerable and to the people on the lowest incomes.
That is why the only criterion for our competition, Cheaper Energy

on this issue, because the report that my predecessor commissioned from
Professor John Hills is a serious report, and I urge all right hon. and
hon. Members to read it. It talks about how we measure fuel poverty and
shows that some of the statistics we have used in the past have been
deeply unhelpful in tackling fuel poverty, not least because they
failed to identify the people who were in grinding fuel poverty year
in, year out. The proposals put forward by Professor John Hills will
ensure that the really poor, who never escape fuel poverty, are
identified and that we can give them much greater help. That is the
real debate we should be having, not this exchange of
statistics that gets us nowhere.</hs_Para>

Community groups in my part of Edinburgh, with which I am working, have
been trying to set up an onshore wind turbine in the area. They have
raised funds for a serious proposal, but have been bogged down by all
sorts of bureaucratic nightmares, which in this case relate to Scottish
Water and the Scottish Government. There are issues across the UK with
communities that want to set up wind farms and renewable energy schemes
but are not being allowed to do so. When the Minister looks at how to
deal with those who oppose wind farms, will he also look at how we can
support those who want community-owned wind farms to be set up in parts
of the UK where they are

not want wind farms and ensure that they have more of a voice, and to

the decision to send troops to Mali and neighbouring countries to help
to train the Malian army, but the deployment of troops to conflict
areas raises important issues on which Members wanted to question the

the Defence Secretary to the House. It is not the first time that an

Friday’s GDP figures were terrible. After two and a half years
in government, the Chancellor has presided over a double-dip recession
and a flatlining economy. Once again on the part-time
Chancellor’s watch, the economy is contracting. We warned that
the Government’s economic strategy—if one can call it
that—was damaging the economy: they cut too far and too fast.
The Deputy Prime Minister has popped up to attack his own
Government’s record of cutting infrastructure expenditure. It is
a bit late to be saying so, since his party voted for each and every
cut. While the economy has nose-dived, the part-time Chancellor has
been filling up his time with pizzas in Davos, and not one but two
dinners with Rupert Murdoch. With all these dinners, I fear that the

have it both ways. They have to decide. Not only does their position
represent utter confusion on the part of the Labour party, but, to be

essential point. As the Prime Minister rightly said, the public will

might be at some point in the future; yet, at the same time, they
manage to be opposed to the idea of making a future commitment to the
public that a new settlement with Europe should be the subject of a
referendum. If they, like us, do not want a referendum now, why can
they not just agree with us that there should be a referendum in the

women and children underground, and the Factories Act 1844, which
limited working hours for children and women in factories. Although
Benjamin Disraeli fashioned the phrase “two nations” and

May we have a debate on the scrapping of council tax benefit?
Currently, 5.9 million families receive this benefit, which is to be
abolished on 1 April, and the Resolution Foundation says that a single
parent using child care and working full time on the minimum wage could
see their council tax jump from £220 to £797. This is
happening at a time when the bedroom tax is coming in, when tax credits
are being cut and when the minimum wage is being frozen for under-21s.
May we have a debate, therefore, about why council tax
benefit is being cut, while millionaires are getting a tax

is not being scrapped, but being localised, with local authorities
taking responsibility. He also knows perfectly well that there are
clear administrative benefits associated with local authorities taking
responsibility for council tax benefit alongside their housing benefit
responsibilities. Like any Opposition Member who asks about this,
however, he must start by recognising that we are doing this because we
are in the most appalling financial mess inherited from the last Labour

superfast broadband is obviously much harder to make. That is why we

NHS exists to provide patients with the highest levels of care and
compassion, and it does so in a way that is more equitable than the
system in any other country in the world—it provides
comprehensive care, free at the point of need. But to be true to those
values, different parts of the NHS need to be financially sustainable.
Financial problems left unaddressed become clinical problems, not least
because money used to fund deficits cannot be used for patient care.
The South London Healthcare NHS Trust is the most financially
challenged in the country, with a deficit of £65 million per
annum.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000324" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000324">It
currently spends some £60 million a year, or 16% of its annual
income, to service two private finance initiative contracts signed in
1998. For this and other reasons, repeated local attempts to resolve
the financial crisis at the trust have failed. As a result, the trust
is losing more than £1 million every week. In the three years
since  it was formed in 2009, it has generated a deficit of
£153 million. That figure will rise to more than
£200 million by the end of this financial year, a
huge amount of money that has to be diverted away from front-line

consulting with the trust, its commissioners and the London strategic
health authority, my predecessor as Health Secretary, my right hon.
Friend the Leader of the House, instituted the special administration
process, which includes a period of intense local engagement. Matthew
Kershaw, former chief executive of Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, was
appointed as the trust special administrator in July 2012. I would like

Kershaw had the extremely difficult task of finding a clinically and
financially sustainable way forward for the South London Healthcare NHS
Trust. Reluctantly, he concluded that only by looking beyond the
boundaries of the trust to the wider health community could he put
forward a viable solution. I support that
analysis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:35:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000327" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000327">I
received his recommendations on 7 January. Six of his seven
recommendations were as follows: first, that over the next three years,
all three hospitals within the trust, Queen Elizabeth hospital in
Woolwich, Queen Mary’s in Sidcup and the Princess Royal in
Bromley, should make the full £74.9 million of efficiencies he
has identified; secondly, that Queen Mary’s in Sidcup be
transferred to Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust and developed into a hub for
the provision of health and social care in Bexley; thirdly, that all
vacant or poorly utilised premises be vacated, and sold where possible;
fourthly, that the Department of Health pay the additional annual funds
to cover the excess costs of the PFI buildings at the Queen Elizabeth
and Princess Royal hospitals; fifthly, that the South London Healthcare
NHS Trust be dissolved, with each of its hospitals taken over by
neighbouring NHS and foundation trusts; and sixthly, to aid
implementation, that the Department of Health write off the accumulated
debt of the trust so as not to set the new trusts up to fail, that the
Department of Health 
<?notus-xml column=1073?>provide additional funds to cover the implementation of his
recommendations and that a programme board be appointed under an
independent chair, reporting to Sir David Nicholson
as chief executive of the NHS Commissioning Board, to ensure the
changes are effectively delivered. I have accepted each of these
recommendations in

a consequence of what he found, Mr Kershaw also recommended that
services be reconfigured beyond the confines of South London Healthcare
NHS Trust across all of south-east London. This part of his
recommendation included reducing the number of accident and emergency
departments across the area from five to four, replacing the A and E
department at University Hospital Lewisham with a non-admitting urgent
care centre, reducing the number of obstetrician-led maternity units
from five to four and downgrading the current obstetrician-led
maternity unit at University Hospital Lewisham to a stand alone
midwife-led birthing centre. Each obstetrician-led maternity units
would also have a midwife-led birthing centre. The recommendation also
included co-locating paediatric emergency and in-patient services with
the four A and E units, with paediatric urgent care provided at
Lewisham, Guy’s and Queen Mary’s hospitals. Finally, he
recommended that University Hospital Lewisham should become a centre
for non-complex elective procedures, such as hip and knee replacements,
to serve the entire population of south-east
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:38:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000329" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000329">The
public campaign surrounding services at Lewisham hospital has
highlighted just how important it is to the local community. I respect
and recognise the sense of unfairness that people feel because their
hospital has been caught up in the financial problems of its neighbour.
However, solving the financial crisis next door is also in the
interests of the people of Lewisham because they too depend on the
services that are currently part of the South London Healthcare NHS
Trust. None the less, I understand their real concerns about how any
changes could affect their access to vital health services. Those
concerns are echoed by Lewisham clinical commissioning group and many
clinicians at Lewisham hospital. I have had in-depth discussions with
the hon. Members representing those affected who have reflected those
concerns to
me<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:39:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000330" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000330">As
a result of those concerns, I asked the NHS medical director, Professor
Sir Bruce Keogh, to review the recommendations and to consider three
things: whether there was sufficient clinical input into the
development of the recommendations; whether there is a strong case that
the recommendations will lead to improved patient care in the local
area; and whether they are underpinned by a clear clinical evidence
base, as set out in the third of the four tests for
reconfigurations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000331" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000331">On
the matter of clinical input, a highly experienced clinical advisory
group, led by local GP, Dr Jane Fryer, and including eight trust
medical directors, six clinically qualified clinical commissioning
group chairs, the London ambulance service medical director, the local
director for trauma and three directors of nursing, supported the trust
special administrator. Further scrutiny and challenge was provided by
an external clinical panel, which included representatives from the
Royal Colleges of Midwives and of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The
panel was chaired by Professor Chris Welsh, the 
<?notus-xml column=1074?>strategic health authority medical director for the midlands and the
east of England. Both groups included respected national and local
clinicians. They built on years of previous work in this area and held
a series of clinical workshops in August and September last
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:40:27"></hs_TimeCode>. Sir Bruce
was satisfied that there had indeed been sufficient clinical
input<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:40:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000332" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000332">On
the issue of better care and clinical evidence, the recommendations
provide for the adoption, for the first time in south-east London, of
the 2012 pan-London standards for acute care, which are the standards
that all six local CCGs have said that they want to commission for
emergency and maternity care. They define the best available clinical
practice and set the bar higher than that provided by most other acute
providers in
England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:40:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000333" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000333">Sir
Bruce agreed that the adoption of these standards could not be achieved
without a reduction in the number of sites delivering acute in-patient
care. Such a reduction will enable the necessary concentration of
resources and senior clinical staff. A similar approach has already led
to significant improvements in stroke, major trauma and cardiovascular
disease services throughout London, saving hundreds of
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:41:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000334">For
both emergency and maternity care, Sir Bruce found no evidence that
patients would be put at risk through increased journey times. The
whole population of south-east London will continue to be within
30 minutes of a blue light transfer to an A and E
department, with the typical journey time being on average only one
minute longer. Accessing consultant-led maternity services will involve
an increase in journey times on average of two to three minutes by
private or public transport. Sir Bruce therefore concluded that there
should be no impact on the quality of care due to the small increase in
travel
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:42:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000335" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000335">On
the issue of maternity services, the expert clinical panel advising the
TSA was not willing to support the increased risk to patients of having
an obstetrician-led unit at Lewisham without intensive care services.
As achieving the London-wide clinical standards will be possible only
with the consolidation of the number of sites with these facilities,
Sir Bruce supports the proposal for this unit to be replaced with a
free-standing, midwife-led unit at Lewisham hospital. This will
continue to deal with at least 10% of existing activity and potentially
up to 60%, and £36 million of additional investment has been
earmarked to ensure that there is sufficient capacity at other
sites<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:42:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000336" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000336">Turning
to the emergency care proposals, Sir Bruce was concerned that the
recommendation for a non-admitting urgent care centre at Lewisham may
not lead, in all cases, to improved patient care. While those with
serious injury or illness would be better served by a concentration of
specialist A and E services, this would not be the case for those
patients requiring short, relatively uncomplicated treatments, or a
temporary period of supervision. To better serve those patients, who
will often be frail and elderly, and would arrive by non-blue light
ambulances, Sir Bruce recommends that Lewisham hospital should retain a
smaller A and E service with 24/7 senior emergency medical cover. With
these additional clinical safeguards and the impact that this is likely
to have on patient and clinician behaviour, Sir Bruce estimates that
the new service could continue to see up to three quarters of those
currently attending Lewisham A and
E<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:43:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Lewisham to retain its A and E would help to reduce the level of
increased demand at hospitals with larger A and E services, while an
additional £37 million of investment will further
expand services at these hospitals for more serious conditions. Sir
Bruce advised that patients with those more serious conditions should
now be taken to King’s, QE, Bromley or St
Thomas’s—not for financial reasons, but to increase their
chances of
survival<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:44:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000338" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000338">On
the issue of paediatric care, Sir Bruce recognised the high-quality
paediatric services at Lewisham and that any replacement would have to
offer even better clinical outcomes and patient experience. His opinion
is that this is possible, but dependent on very clear protocols for
primary ambulance conveyance, a walk-in paediatric urgent care service
at Lewisham, and rapid transfer protocols for any sick children who
would be better treated elsewhere. He is clear that this will require
careful pathway planning and will need to be a key focus of
implementation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:44:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000339" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000339">With
these caveats, Sir Bruce was content to assert that there is a strong
case that the recommendations are likely to lead to improved care for
the residents of south-east London and that they are underpinned by
clear clinical evidence. He believes that overall these proposals, as
amended, could save up to 100 lives every year through higher clinical
standards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:45:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000340" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000340">Yesterday,
30 January, as no viable alternative plan had been put forward, and in
light of Sir Bruce’s opinion, I decided to accept the
recommendations of the trust special administrator, subject to the
amendments suggested by Sir Bruce. It is important to be clear that my
acceptance of these recommendations is conditional on Monitor approving
the proposals relating to foundation trusts, and on my Department
negotiating an appropriate level of transitional funding with
organisations such as King’s
Partners<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T11:45:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000341" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000341">Owing
to the size of the task, there is a significant level of risk
associated with achieving the identified savings. I recognise that the
additional clinical safeguards that I have put in place will marginally
increase these financial risks, but on balance I have made the judgment
that this is worth it if it means that local patients are reassured
that they will gain from an additional better service, rather than
losing their A and E.</hs_Para>

believe the amended proposals meet the four tests required for local

implementation of these proposals will be challenging and complex. It

the Secretary of State has accepted the principle that a successful

takes precedence and any hospital, no matter how successful, is

is clearly the case that the proposals that the Secretary of State has

failed to listen to them. Thousands of people have put their lives on

defend their local hospital, led by the fantastic efforts of the local

actually came from the Labour party, which passed it when it was in
government. He asked me to confirm that the people of Lewisham have no
right of appeal to the IRP against this decision, but who was it who
stripped them of that right to appeal? It was him when his Government
passed the legislation. Nothing that he has said has contained a single
alternative proposal to deal with this problem. If he was being
responsible as shadow Health Secretary, he would have come up with just
one proposal, but he did not come up with a single one or tell the

respect to the GP-led clinical commissioning group in Lewisham, of
course I understand its opposition to the proposals put forward by the
trust special administrator, but it supports the principle that complex
procedures should be done from fewer sites. That is an important point.
Inevitably, when we are reducing the number of sites for complex
medical procedures, the people in the areas where those procedures will
no longer happen will often be opposed to the changes. That is what has
happened here, but the group supports the principles behind what the
trust special administrator has said.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady’s concern that we are setting up a new trust that will
not be sustainable is precisely why I am taking this extremely
difficult decision today. Lewisham hospital has proposed that it and
Queen Elizabeth hospital in Woolwich should be allowed to work out
their own way of dealing with the deficit, but that was precisely the
problem that happened when the South London Healthcare Trust was set
up. Trusts with deficits were put together in a marriage that, in the
end, failed to address those difficult decisions. My responsibility to
her constituents is to address those issues and to give them certainty
about the provision of their health services. 
<?notus-xml column=1080?>Already, her constituents who have a stroke or a heart attack do not go

deaths. London has a higher rate of maternity deaths than most other
parts of the country, and that is something that any responsible Health
Secretary should try to tackle. The Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives agree that the way to
reduce the number of maternal deaths, in which London does not score
well, is to centralise the facilities that deal with the more complex
births in fewer sites, where surgeons can get more experience and
deliver better clinical outcomes. That is what this proposal is doing.
It will lead to fewer maternal deaths in Lewisham and south-east
London. It will also mean that, for the first time, south-east London
will do something that it does not do at the moment, which is to meet

clinical rationale behind what is happening? London has halved its
stroke mortality rate, because it reduced the number of hospitals
treating people with strokes from 32 to eight. As a result, her
constituents in Lewisham now go for their stroke treatment to the
Princess Royal and King’s. That has led to fewer deaths in
Lewisham and many other places. We need to do the same for high-risk

First, on GP commissioners, all six local commissioning groups support
the principles upon which these proposals were developed. To meet the
London-wide clinical quality standards, which are not being met in
south-east London at present, it is necessary to centralise the
provision of more complex services in the same way that we have already
successfully done for heart attacks and strokes. That principle applies
as much to complex births and complex pregnancies as it does to strokes
and heart attacks, and it will now apply for the people of Lewisham to
conditions including pneumonia, meningitis and if someone breaks a hip.
People will get better clinical care as a result of these changes. That
is the most difficult project in all the work of the trust special
administrator. The project has been to try to resolve an unsustainable
financial situation while improving clinical care for the people of
south-east London, and I think that, in the end, we have got a set of
proposals that  does

identifies, particularly in relation to the relocation of the

dependent on extremely difficult interconnections among ambulance
services, receiving staff and inpatient beds, and rely on them all
working effectively. He rightly recognises the knock-on effect for

Mr Speaker. Departments of State have varied records as to the quality
and timeliness of answering questions. The Department of Health is very
good, but the Department for Education has been particularly
bad—so bad, in fact, that an evidence session with a Minister of
State in December at the Procedure Committee, and an evidence session
with the Secretary of State last week, considered why that Department
was so woefully bad. Last week at the Procedure Committee there was a
list of 36 questions that had been asked in 2012 to which answers had
not yet been given. As of yesterday, 31 of those questions remain
unanswered.

I have said, considerable time has been spent debating these issues,
and it is therefore not my intention to speak for too long. The first
group of amendments made in the other place relates to enforcement.
When the Bill was introduced to the Lords, the Bill provided that
council officers could seize articles, receptacles or equipment when a
person was reasonably suspected of committing a street-trading offence
or of helping another to commit the offence. The Bill also stated that
a court 
<?notus-xml column=1089?>before which a person is convicted of a street-trading offence could
order the forfeiture of seized items, and that an authorised council
officer could serve a fixed penalty notice on a person whom he
reasonably believed had committed a street-trading offence, or an
offence of aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring the
commission of such
offences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000419" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000419">The
Lords Committee was concerned that some of those enforcement powers
were disproportionate, and that they could be used to prevent pedlars
from lawfully carrying out their business. It therefore removed the
power of seizure, but left the power to issue fixed penalty notices. It
inserted a provision requiring councils to train all officials charged
with exercising the remaining powers, and to publicise on their
websites information about street trading and street trading
enforcement in their
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000420" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000420">I

with the publicity provisions. They would specifically require the
details to include information on the streets contained in the
designated areas within which special provision on pedlars will apply.

councils believe that the amendments are unnecessary. The information
that they publish will be comprehensive and it would be neither

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T12:34:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Pudsey (Stuart Andrew), with typical understatement,
said that their lordships had some concerns about the Bill—the
disproportionate powers, the power of seizure and so on. We will
discuss the pedlars aspect of the Bill under the second group of Lords
amendments, but essentially, their lordships have filleted the Bill.
The Bill originally extended to some 18 clauses, but it now has only
13. The clauses that have been taken out are the subject of the Lords
amendments we are discussing under this group—clause 6, on
seizure; clause 7, on the seizure of perishable items; clause 8, on the
return and disposal of seized items; clause 9, on the forfeiture of
seized items; and clause 10, on compensation when seizure is
unlawful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000426" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000426">You,

us briefly remind ourselves of the history. The Canterbury City Council
Bill was presented to Parliament as a private Bill on 27 November 2007.
I do not know whether the fact that we are still considering it is some
sort of record. The Bill was read the First time on 22
January 2008. Second Reading began on 12 June 2008 and
continued on 29 October 2008. The Canterbury City Council Bill was
completed, but the need to keep the four Bills together meant there was
a third day on Second Reading on 3 June 2009. Significantly—this
is one of the important messages that should go out from this
exercise—because there were no Commons petitions against the
Bills, the matter went to a Committee on Unopposed Bills, which
rubber-stamped the provisions on 8 July 2009. The fact that the Bill
came straight back from a Committee on Unopposed Bills meant we were
unable to debate the Bill on Report. We were therefore able to express
our concerns further only on Third Reading on 14 January 2010, just
over three years
ago.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000428" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000428">Fortunately,
Members of the other place took the Bills seriously—we owe them
a great debt of gratitude. My noble Friend Lord Lucas, who took an
interest in earlier Bills, did not serve in Committee in the other
place, but he has been instrumental in working closely with pedlars and
their representatives to ensure that the importance of the Bill was
raised in the other place. As a result of that and Lords petitions
against the Canterbury City Council Bill and the other Bills, the House
of Lords Opposed Bill Committee sat for three days in November 2011.
The other place debated the Bill in Committee on 24 November 2011,
which was followed by a debate on Third Reading on 3 December
2012.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013128000429" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013128000429">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T12:49:37"></hs_TimeCode>

Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose), who was in his
place earlier in the Bill’s passage, would continue his interest
in today’s subject matter, but unfortunately he is unable to do
so. What the Minister failed to tell us about in his short contribution
was that between the Committee stage on 24 November 2011 and Third
Reading on 3 December 2012 in the other place, the Government issued
yet another consultation paper on the subject of pedlars. I will refer
in more detail to some aspects of that consultation paper in relation
to the 
<?notus-xml column=1091?>second group of amendments to which I think it has a greater relevance,
but let us remind ourselves that the effect of the Government’s
proposals is to abolish all existing legislation relating to pedlars
and to replace it. They argue that the existing legislation is at odds
with the European Union services directive. When I raised this matter
in the House in 2010, people thought it was a device to try to prolong
proceedings. However, it is apparent that this was an important issue
of substance and, although it seems to have taken a long time, the
Government have realised that the EU services directive did and does
impinge on the Bills.</hs_Para>

that that is satisfactory. I am therefore surprised that they seem to
be relaxed about allowing to go on to the statute book four new local
Bills that will be inconsistent with the Government’s intentions
as set out in the consultation paper. My hon. Friend the Minister could
argue that the closing date for contributions to the consultation paper
is not until 15 February 2013, and that the Government will then listen
to the representations received. In the light of that, I am surprised
that the Government are not saying, “Hold on a moment, let us

council tax payers will need to ask questions about how they got
themselves into this mess. They have each probably spent hundreds of
thousands of pounds to try to promote legislation that was
ill-conceived from the outset and was certainly ill-conceived following
the implementation and introduction of the EU services directive. It
has also been much criticised at all stages in this House and in the

that the Bill would be wholly unworkable without them. Now that these

I would like to put on record the fact that in considering these four
Bills, I had a constructive meeting with a representative from Leeds
city council, from which came the idea that the way forward would be to
impose constraints on the size of the trolleys that pedlars can use in
Leeds city centre. That theme has now been picked up in the other Bills
and the Lords amendments, as well as in the suggestions in the
Government’s consultation paper on where we go from here. That
was a good example of constructive working between a Member of this
House and an official from one of the councils seeking to promote this
legislation. My hon. Friend might remember that when the question arose
of whether any of the other councils would be prepared to accept
similar constraints or amendments, they resolutely refused to engage.
In a sense, they have now been forced to do so as a result of what
happened in the other place, but there is always a lot more scope for
those promoting these Bills and the officials behind them to speak with
colleagues directly about issues such as the one my hon. Friend
identifies.</hs_Para>

information, on the basis that the council reasonably considered it to
be sufficient. Somebody who felt that it was insufficient—a
pedlar who was potentially suffering a fixed penalty—would not
be able to argue that the information was not sufficient to enable him
to understand the circumstances under which he could trade, because all
the council had to do was provide information that the council itself
reasonably considered sufficient. The council would therefore be
introducing a subjective test, thereby removing the effectiveness of
what, on the face of it, seems perfectly sensible—that the
information provided should be sufficient. The notion that the
information is sufficient if the council considers it to be sufficient
effectively negates what would otherwise be a worthwhile

my hon. Friend knows, I am with him on virtually all of this and have
been for a number of years. However, we are in danger of parting
company, I fear, on the issue of the notices being different in every
local authority. Surely the whole point of the objection is that people
going from one place to another cannot be expected to know the exact
regime in a particular place. Surely therefore it would be helpful if
the same notice were in place in each local authority. Just as
“no parking” notices are the same across the country,
should not the same thing apply to pedlars’

if any notices were produced, they need not be uniform across the

training and it is by any objective test inadequate, that would not be

satisfy an objective test in relation to training will we ensure that
the right quality of training, to which our noble Friends in the other
place referred, will be implemented. My amendment would strengthen this

provide adequate training. The purpose of my amendment is to try to
ensure that that happens. If the training is not adequate, it will be
open to somebody to make a complaint to the council or the councillors;
ultimately, it could be used as a defence to a fixed penalty notice or
something like that—although I would not want to speculate on
that. The test is that the officers must be properly trained: that is
what the provisions would require—rather than that the council
thought the training was adequate. I hope it would not be necessary to
set up a new bureaucracy—an appeals panel or something like
that—to deal with the situation, as we are already overburdened

Davies:</Member></B> I commend my hon. Friend the Member for
Christchurch (Mr Chope) not just for his speech, although it was of the
customary calibre, but for his dedication in ensuring that, if the Bill
ever leaves this place, it will leave in a much better state than the
state in which it arrived. Without my hon. Friend’s personal
dedication to this issue, and his determination that we should do what
we ought to do in this place—that is, defend people’s
freedoms and defend enterprise—the Bill would have passed
through Parliament in a much less satisfactory
manner.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013129000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013129000002">Like
my hon. Friend, I am grateful for the work that was done by their
lordships. I do not know whether my hon. Friend felt the same, but I
feared that the Bill would go through on the nod in the House of Lords.
Their lordships should be commended for going through it in great
detail and considering the arguments properly, and, consequently,
tabling some amendments with which I think we can be particularly
pleased.</hs_Para>

what my hon. Friend said about many of the amendments. He focused on
the subject of seizures, and on the Lords amendments that proposed the
omission of various clauses relating to it. He may recall that the
issue caused great controversy when it was debated for the first time
in this place. It struck me as unacceptable that local authorities
should employ authorised officers to go around seizing people’s
goods willy-nilly. As my hon. Friend will recall, we argued the case
vehemently for many months. We were told that the clauses were
essential to the Bill, and that without them it would be unworkable and
meaningless. We were also told that the proposals in the amendments
would be unenforceable, and that they were in effect wrecking
amendments: that, if I remember rightly, is what my hon. Friend was
accused of when he tried to persuade the promoters that what they were
saying was over the
top.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013129000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013129000004">I
should be interested to know why the promoters thought that removing
those clauses then would wreck the Bill, whereas removing them today
apparently does not wreck it all. It seems that it will still be fit to
proceed into law. It is difficult for us to consider the merits of the 
<?notus-xml column=1101?>amendments until we are given some satisfactory answers to the question
of how important the clauses are to the Bill as a
whole.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013129000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013129000005">I
have the impression that we have reached a stage at which the promoters
are determined to produce an Act of Parliament, irrespective of what is
in it and whether anything that is in it will ever be applied. This
seems to have become a war of attrition, a battle of wills. The
promoters seem merely to want an Act of Parliament to hang their hat
on. I certainly support the removal of all these clauses—page
after page of them—and I think we should be grateful for the
fact that the promoters may have come round to my hon. Friend’s
way of
thinking.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013129000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013129000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Bone" PimsId="4750" UID="13013129000775" xid="903" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013129000775">Mr

the Member for Pudsey (Stuart Andrew) is my parliamentary neighbour and
an excellent Member of Parliament. The only bad thing about having him
as my neighbour is that he puts me to shame. He has already
successfully steered a private Member’s Bill through Parliament
in his short time in the House. He did so with an awful lot of panache
and charm, and by being practical and reasonable about what it was
sensible to do in order to get that legislation through. I very much
hope he will adopt the same strategy now, because he saw how well it
worked with his Bill; I hope he will use that experience when
considering this legislation, too.</hs_Para>

consider the
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T13:39:23"></hs_TimeCode>debate we have
had so far from a layman’s perspective—from the point of
view of people who have no vested interest in the legislation and who
have not been going through battles which started six years ago, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T13:32:46"></hs_TimeCode>said. People who
do not have that baggage and who listened to the argument that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T13:32:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
made for his amendments to Lords amendment C27 could not fail to have
been persuaded by his case. We started from the position that these
Bills were designed to give local authorities far too much
power—that was the whole point for us when we started out. As a
result of my hon. Friend’s work and what happened in their
lordships’ House, gradually, bit by bit, the excessive powers
have been whittled down. We hope to end up with legislation that,
although perhaps not ideal—it may not be something we
particularly agree with—will certainly be an awful lot better
than it was when we started out.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T13:32:46"></hs_TimeCode> have an
opportunity to carry on the theme that my hon. Friend started, and that
their lordships continued, by removing some of the remaining parts that
put far too much power in the hands of local authorities and give far
too little protection, literally, to the man on the

is why some of us felt so strongly about these Bills and, in

done—defend people’s freedoms—but we should not
have to rely on their lordships for that; we should be doing that in

clear by publishing details of the streets covered by the legislation.
That is not catered for in the Bill at the moment. If that is such a

these councils that everybody knows which streets are affected and
which are not, and the boundaries of these rules. With the best will in

those days when there is no council official waiting to move a pedlar

Andrew:</Member></B> My understated manner was mentioned earlier, and I
plan to carry on in that manner as I speak to this group of amendments.
The pedlar provisions have generated the most interest, from those who
petitioned against the Bills in the Lords and from a number of hon.
Members in this House. Under the existing licensing legislation, an
exception is given to persons who act as a pedlar under the authority
of a pedlars certificate granted under the Pedlars Act 1871. The Bills
would have limited 
<?notus-xml column=1110?>that exemption so that it applied only to pedlars who traded by way of
house-to-house visits. All other pedlars would have required a
street-trading licence or
consent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:34:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013129000693" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013129000693">The
Lords Committee amended the pedlar provision very much in favour of
pedlars. The amendments made will now restrict the exemption from the
street-trading regime enjoyed by pedlars to trading by house-to-house
visits, trading without any means of support—that is, by traders
carrying the items they wish to sell—or trading with a wheeled
trolley that does not exceed 0.75 metres in width, 0.5 metres
in depth and 1.25 metres in height. The overall size of the
display of goods has also been listed in the
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:35:33"></hs_TimeCode>. So
the Committee has limited the circumstances in which the restrictions
on acting as a pedlar can
apply<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:35:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:35:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013129000694" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013129000694"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Chope" PimsId="2598" UID="13013129001424" xid="110" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013129001424">Mr
Chope:</Member></B> My hon. Friend has referred to the Committee stage
of the Bills in the other place. He will be aware that since then, on
27 November last year, the Government issued a consultation paper that
proposes to repeal the UK-wide Pedlars Act in order to comply
with the European services directive. How is that consistent with the
rewriting of clause 5, which still purports to amend the Pedlars
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T14:36:20"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013129000695" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013129000695"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stuart Andrew" PimsId="5565" UID="13013129001425" xid="1120" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013129001425">Stuart
Andrew:</Member></B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that
intervention. Honestly. This process has been going on for a
considerable time. In fact, even back in the 1990s, the Home Office was
promising to introduce changes, although it never did so. We could go
on debating these matters for many years to come. I shall now continue
to make my points.</hs_Para>

addition, the amendments provide that the restrictions on
pedlars’ activities should be confined to areas that have been
designated by the councils. Each designation must be justified against
two criteria. One involves ensuring road safety; the other involves
preventing the obstruction of the highway. So, as I mentioned, the
regime in the Bills is now far more generous to pedlars than the one

been caused. Since the Lords looked at these issues in November 2011,
the Government have come forward with a consultation that effectively

important that the Pedlars Act be repealed nationally. Although I agree
that this process has been going on for a while—many years,
perhaps—this is the first time we have got what might be
described as a European dimension. If the European services directive
is going to apply as the Government interpret it, we in this

Chope:</Member></B> I have some sympathy with amendment C9 as it
contains many of the proposals that we were trying to persuade councils
other than Leeds to accept when this Bill was before our House. Leeds
conceded that instead of having a regime under which pedlars could only
go from door to door, it would be content with one where pedlars could
go to pedestrianised high street areas, provided they did not cause an
obstruction by having a very elaborate and large apparatus. That is
where the concept of having trolleys of limited size came from; it came
from Leeds city council, and the idea was discussed with me and some of
my hon. Friends. The proposal to give pedlars the freedom to operate on
the street with a trolley of sufficient size to enable them to display
their goods and provide articles to those who wish to purchase them is
a valuable development and makes a lot of common sense. Although the
Government consultation specifies a maximum  size of trolley
rather larger than the one specified in amendment C9, they
appear to accept the
principle.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013129000713" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0002.htm#13013129000713">On
whether I personally agree with that amendment, I am still very
sceptical about whether the Government interpretation of the services
directive is correct. When we first raised this issue after the
services directive had come into force, the Government took the line
that it was of no consequence or interest, so their interpretation has
changed significantly in just a couple of years, and they might change
it again. Because things are in a state of flux, it would seem to me
premature—if one can  use that word in respect of a Bill
that has been before this House for over six years—to proceed
now with amendment C9.</hs_Para>

interesting that the consultation paper was issued so late that it

comments, and for noting, without expressing an opinion, that the point
is now on the record for the promoters of the Bill. It is hard to
imagine, but if I were a promoter of a private Bill, I would certainly
be keen for everything to be dealt with in one Bill, rather than face a
situation in which my Bill was amended and put on the statute book in a
form that would not comply with legislation brought forward by the
Government in due course.

the Government may have is that to amend private legislation that is

as far as they could have done in ensuring that the new regime will
work well in practice. The principal reason for saying that is
reflected in my amendments to C9, which are centred around whether we
should have “designated areas” or streets. Everybody
understands a street; it has a name and can be found on a Google
map—just to show how modern I am—and that name can be
seen at the side of the street as someone walks along. A
“designated area”, however, is much vaguer and could be
large or small. The most difficult concept for us to deal with in

Chope:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Such measures
are quite often a matter of interpretation. The trained police officer
is in a far better position to interpret the law than a council that is
prejudiced against the interests of pedlars. To reinforce the point
about prejudice, the noble Lord Strasburger said on Third Reading
that:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13013129000764" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013129000764">“It
was alleged that pedlars create a situation that attracts pickpockets,
but…no evidence was offered. It was also said that pedlars cause
obstruction of the highway. Little evidence for this allegation was
offered apart from a small number of cases where wide and expanding
trolleys had been used…The witnesses who spoke for the local
authorities were somewhat unconvincing. We heard evidence from pedlars
that many council officers and the police are ignorant about the 1871
Act, and we also heard much evidence of a bullying culture on the part
of council officials towards honest and hard-working
pedlars.”—[<I>Official Report, House of Lords,</I> 3

is why we need to be alert to the precise wording of the Lords
amendments. We need to ensure that the intention is to establish a
level playing field for pedlars and street traders, and to ensure that
pedlars cannot be undermined by over-zealous or prejudiced council
officials. For those reasons, Lords amendment C9 would be
much improved by amendments (a) to (h), which I have tabled.</hs_Para>

directive was raised. That was why, as I recall, we were arguing that
the provision of services should not be covered under these particular
local Acts. There seems to be a recognition that clause 4 is outlawed
by the services directive. What I do not understand—I look
forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about this—is
why the directive also applies to pedlars who are dealing not in
services, but goods. How does the directive apply to the sale of goods
by pedlars? That is causing concern among the pedlar

these Bills, one of which was the Bournemouth Borough Council Bill. The
argument put forward by the promoters was that life was intolerable for
retailers in the city centres because of the activities of pedlars, and
therefore that pedlars needed to be banned outright from the city
centres. Now, as a result of their lordships’ amendment, the
promoters have recognised that pedlars are welcome and free to operate
in city centres—or is that really what they intend? Does the
local authority really want pedlars to be free, or will it seize on the
provisions about obstructing the highways to create designated areas
where pedlars cannot
operate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T15:13:45"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013129000754" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013129000754"><B><Member ContinuationText="Philip Davies" PimsId="4767" UID="13013129001457" xid="887" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013129001457">Philip

clause 5, as I am calling it—effectively gives local
authorities the discretion to interpret in their own way what
they regard 
<?notus-xml column=1118?>as a road safety issue or a potential obstruction of the highway, and
what it is necessary to do to ensure road safety or
prevent an obstruction of the highway. If local authorities are able to
persuade themselves that something is necessary for the purposes of
road safety—a wide concept that includes pedestrian
safety—and they couple that with the need to prevent obstruction
of the highway, that almost drives a coach and horses through the
provisions. Local authorities would thereby retain almost absolute
discretion to designate areas as they wished, potentially arbitrarily
way to the detriment of the pedlar
fraternity.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13013134000242" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013134000242">3.15

short answer is that if we are talking about a subjective test, all the
council has to do is to say that it has reason to believe, whereas if
we are talking about an objective test, the issue is not what the
council believes, but what actually happened and the impact. If

believe that”, subsection (7) would read: “The council
may designate an area for the purposes of this section only if it is
necessary to do so to ensure road safety”. That is something on
which evidence could be drawn from all angles. One could argue that
designating an area was necessary for road safety or that it was not,
but it would not depend on the council. Under subsection (7)
as currently worded, as long as the council says that in its view
designating an area is necessary for road safety, that is the end of

Stuart:</Member></B> I agree absolutely with my hon. Friend. The
Government want to restore the currency of 16-year-olds’
qualifications, and restore confidence among employers and universities
in the value of those qualifications. That is one of the
Government’s aims and they are right to take that approach.
Although I am not talking about the main, fundamental changes beneath
the surface, it is interesting to note just how few people from the
university sector or employers agree with the decision to abolish GCSEs
in the core subjects. They worry about what 
<?notus-xml column=1122?>that says about the other subjects left behind—I am sure that my
hon. Friend will be concerned about what it says about GCSE religious
education. How can it be right that those subjects are seen as second
tier compared with the reformed EBCs?</hs_Para>

saw last year, with GCSE English, the turbulence and disruption that
can happen when changes are made to a high-stakes qualification. The
Government are proposing change on a much greater scale and the risks
are correspondingly higher. We are concerned that rushing through
multiple fundamental changes could jeopardise the quality of the
reforms and the stability of the wider exam system. The Committee has
particular concerns about how well the Government’s
proposals will serve lower-attaining pupils, who are often the most
disadvantaged. It is unclear how raising the bar will automatically
help those young people, and we call on the Government to rethink their
plans for a statement of achievement, specifically for lower-attaining
pupils, as it could be less useful to young people than a low-grade
GCSE or alternative qualification. It must not be allowed to become a
badge of failure. One of the Government’s stated
priorities—rightly so—is to narrow the attainment gap
between the richest and poorest students. We have not seen evidence to
suggest that EBCs will do that any better than GCSEs already
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013134000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013134000039">The
Committee agrees that changes are needed to the way exams are run. We
concluded in our report last year that the current system leads to
downward pressure on standards. All options for reform, including
franchising subjects to exam boards, have benefits and drawbacks. Our
concern is that the Government need to give proper consideration to the
likely unintended consequences of franchising, as well as to the
complexities of the tendering process. Today’s west coast main
line news shows how easy it is for Governments to get that wrong, and
the profound and expensive consequences that can arise.</hs_Para>

Brennan</B> (Cardiff West) (Lab):</Member> I thank the Chair and the
rest of the Committee for their report. Does he agree that the problem
with the Secretary of State’s EBC proposals is that although
there is a consensus that we need reform to exams at 16, this is the
wrong reform, being done to the wrong timetable and being done the
wrong way round, because we do not yet know what the curriculum is? As
a former teacher and educator who went through this kind of change when
GCSEs were introduced after O-levels, I cannot, for the life of me, see
how this change can actually take place. Even if it does, I cannot see
how it can last for long. Without proper piloting and proper consensus
across the educational and political worlds, these major high-stake
exam reforms just do not last, as we know from experience. Does the
hon. Gentleman agree that it would be better if the Secretary of State
listened to what the Committee said, 
<?notus-xml column=1123?>scrapped this particular proposal and worked together across the piece
for a lasting reform that will command a broad consensus and would be
proofed against any future political
changes?</hs_Para>

Stuart:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his invention and I
certainly agree with his last point. Let us be clear that the Select
Committee’s report does not say that the Government should
necessarily scrap the reforms but that they should make the case for
them. They need to prove that the GCSE brand is so
fundamentally broken that it cannot be reformed. It seemed to us to be
difficult to see what was so intrinsic to the GCSE in the core subjects
that could not be repaired with the right approach.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13013134000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013134000044"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T15:35:11"></hs_TimeCode>The
hon. Gentleman is also right to highlight the need for consensus. Some
650,000 children a year move through our education system and there are
nearly 500,000 teachers in state schools. This is a mammoth enterprise
and not something to which we can make quick changes. The repercussions
will go on for a long time and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take
it well if I chide his party by pointing out what happened with the
diploma. Then, we had a Secretary of State who was determined to bring
about change and who rightly identified the need to improve vocational
education and qualifications in this country, but the assessment and
exam experts said that he was going at an unrealistic pace, suggested
that he slowed down and said that there was a risk that the tremendous
legacy of transforming vocational education in this country could end
up withering on the vine. That is exactly what happened. The children
who took the diploma will have a certificate that employers will
struggle to recognise in a few years’ time, vast amounts of
public money were expended and those in the education system who
marched to that tune and worked so hard to bring colleges and schools
together to deliver the diploma have been left high and dry. We do not
want to see that happen to these reforms, which are even more
fundamental to the education system. We do not want the reforms brought
in by this Secretary of State to go the way of the diploma.</hs_Para>

need only to look back to last year and the English GCSE furore. The
judge in the judicial review has not yet pronounced, so I hesitate to
talk too much about it, but many of the problems arose from the fact
that the previous Government decided to change what was taught, how it
was taught, who assessed it and how it was assessed all at once. That
caused what happened in 2012 and whenever that many changes are made to
a qualification, there is turbulence and volatility. That is why we saw
so many schools with a history of doing well suddenly doing badly. The
first EBCs will be taught 
<?notus-xml column=1124?>in 2015 if the Government proceed according to their current timetable,
so the timing will be tight. This will be a much bigger reform than
that of the English GCSE last year and the risks and downsides are
great.</hs_Para>

are not saying that the Government have necessarily got it wrong and we
agree broadly with their critique of the existing situation. We also
agree about the need for more rigour, for reform and for world-class
qualifications at 16 to be put in place. We are questioning whether
these particular reforms and the abolition of GCSEs in the core
subjects need necessarily go ahead. We remain to be convinced of that
argument.</hs_Para>

major secondary issue, which is probably less likely to be picked up by
the press but could prove phenomenally significant, is the move to
franchising. In effect, that gives us an insight into why the timetable
is so truncated. Awarding bodies have not seen the outcome of the
revised curriculum and therefore do not know exactly what they are
supposed to teach, but they are having to design the new qualifications
now. They will thereby effectively control the curriculum, rather than
schools and educators. The awarding bodies are designing the
qualifications now and the timetable means that a winner will be chosen
for each of the core subjects by this summer. The Secretary of State
will pick a winner who will stay in place for five years. What happens
at the end of that time? It brings up a lot of questions.</hs_Para>

everybody who has expertise in assessment in English works for one
board and if quite a lot of people retire because they are not prepared
to move, meaning that we lose expertise, will there be genuine
competition at the end of that five years? Or will we simply have
created a monopoly in certain subjects for certain awarding bodies?
What about flexibility during that time? What if changes need to be
introduced? Will the spec that the Secretary of State chooses this
summer have to be fixed in place for five years? We do not really know
the detail—there is an awful lot that we do not know—and
it important that we get this

Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart) said,
Committees need to be more effective at communicating. That involves
the social media, but it also involves traditional print and broadcast
media. We get a lot of coverage and a lot of interest from the
broadcasters. Occasionally they annoy us by failing to distinguish
between Select Committees of this House, elected by the House, and
all-party groups, which have a role and a usefulness but are not the
same thing. A Select Committee of this House is a Committee of people
who have a degree of expertise developed over a period but are not
united by a common cause in their membership of the Committee, as is so
often the case with an all-party group. There is a big difference
between the nature of a report produced by a Select Committee and one
produced by an all-party group. The use of the term “a group of
MPs” to describe either body, which we find in the
broadcasts even of the BBC, is something we
deplore<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T15:50:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013134000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013134000067">The

should be able to question the responsible official
directly—even if they have moved on to another job. It does of
course remain the case that an official can decline to answer for
matters of policy, on the basis that it is for the minister to answer
for the policy, but officials owe a direct obligation to Parliament to
report on matters of fact and implementation. This does not alter the
doctrine of ministerial accountability in any way. Ministers should
never require an official to withhold information from a select
committee. It cannot be a breach of the principle of ministerial
responsibility for an official to give a truthful answer to a select
committee

Prime Minister could meet our long-standing request for him to appear
before us and report back on his work on the Rio+20 agenda, but it was
impossible for him to do so in his capacity as the Deputy Prime

important point. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have
both taken the view that once they started going to Select Committees,
they would end up being asked to go to all of them. Our response to

to the Liaison Committee so that they could be questioned on matters in
which they had played an important part.</hs_Para>

world has changed significantly. The election of Committees, and the
way in which Members now see them as the main means of holding the
Government to account, means that the Government must recognise that
things are clearly different. Many Departments co-operate very well
with the Committees, and quite a few Ministers find it helpful to have
Committees looking at issues over which they—the
Ministers—are involved in internal battles, either within their
Department or with the Government. Many a Minister has had cause to
thank a Select Committee for its support on such issues. There must be
a recognition right across Government that Select Committees have a
role to play in one of the most important functions of Parliament.
There must be a clear understanding that Select Committees are entitled
to information and that they should have the full co-operation of the

Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith). He covered so much

would not want this debate to consist only of us talking about
ourselves and about how well we have all done. The reason that we are
in this place, and the reason that so much has changed in the past five
years, is that Parliament has changed. The occupant of the Chair, in
the person of Mr Speaker, has decided that the procedures of Parliament
should make the Government much more accountable than I can remember
them being in all the 25 years I have been in the House. I know that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T16:03:16"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed has been here even longer than that. The
fact that Mr Speaker has decided to use those processes to a
much greater extent than they have ever been used before, and the fact
that we have put in place the right reforms and that those on both
Front Benches decided to implement them, mean that the Select Committee
system is almost there, as far as scrutiny of the Government is
concerned. I say “almost there” because, although the
Chairman of the Liaison Committee rightly mentioned all the positive
aspects of the system, there are a couple of things that I think could
make it even better.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T16:04:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Maldon (Mr Whittingdale), for going where no Committee, or
Committee Chair, has dared to go before. He rightly mentioned phone
hacking and the Rupert Murdoch affair, because those events represented
a line in the sand for the powers of Select Committees. I can tell him
that frequently when witnesses refuse to appear before the Home Affairs
Committee, I do not have to come here and seek an order; all I have to
do is remind them of what happened to Mr Rupert Murdoch when he decided
he would not appear before the Culture, Media and Sport
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T16:04:53"></hs_TimeCode>—which
conducted a very good inquiry, of

a sense, however, we are making these rules up as we go along. As has
been said, we do not know what powers we have at our disposal if
somebody refuses to appear before a Committee. When witnesses say they
are sick, I now ask for a sick note sent via a doctor with initials
after their name, so I can be certain that that is why the witness
cannot attend. We must clarify what these powers are. In one sense, I
am reluctant to do so because it is always useful to have the mystique
of Parliament—to have the fear of the unknown, so that people do
not know what will happen. In that respect, therefore, it is better not
to write things down, but to keep them vague and use that as a way to
cajole people to appear. At some stage, somebody will refuse
to attend and will not answer to a warrant, however, and
that is when we will have to decide how to
proceed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013134000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013134000093">I
want to pay tribute to my Committee secretariat staff: Tom Healey,
Richard Benwell, Elizabeth Flood and all the other staff who work

resources. We need more resources if we are to be able to do our job
effectively.</hs_Para>

Clerks has ended up clerking three Committees and is currently clerking
the Culture, Media and Sport

is so good that, like Ronaldo, she gets passed on to all the big

allow Committee staff to 
<?notus-xml column=1133?>develop their specialisms. I am grateful to the powers that be for the
fact that over the past year my Clerks have not changed, and I hope
very much that we can stick to the unwritten rule that we have them for
the whole of the Parliament, as that enables them to develop fields of
expertise.</hs_Para>

in Washington and I met the chair of the homeland security committee,
the equivalent of our Home Affairs Committee. I was told he had a staff
of 32 and that was just for the majority side in Congress. I am not
suggesting for one moment that we should increase the staffing of the
HAC from nine to 32, because I know I would never get away with that.

mean we would go on for even longer. We are able to do so much work,

way in which we could help the public to understand the distinctive
contribution that Select Committees make would be to end the great
ballot to find out in which room Select Committees will sit on any

Select Committees bring us together and form us in teams across party
lines. They build deep friendships and relationships. They help us to
understand where other people are coming from. That has a civilising
impact on 
<?notus-xml column=1135?>the way in which this place works, which I hope permeates through to the
way in which we make law. It makes Ministers more confident about
conceding ground at times, and means we are more effective in

for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart) and the right hon. Member for
Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith), the Chair of the Liaison

welcome the report and wish to identify three recommendations that the
Joint Committee on Human Rights has already begun to implement to the
benefit, I hope, of both Houses. The first concerns best practice and a
recommendation on away-days. We have implemented that recommendation in
order to discuss which inquiries we should choose and review our work.
In doing so, we have engaged with civil society and outside
organisations, and it has been a worthwhile exercise.</hs_Para>

there was a recommendation on leading questioners. Our Committee may be
a little unusual, because its members comes from two Houses and have a
wide range of experience. Decisions on certain inquiries are often led
by the recommendation of a particular member. For example, the inquiry
on independent living came from a strong proposal from an eminent and
experienced member at the time—Baroness Campbell of Surbiton.
Although it was implicit, we all recognised that she was the expert,
and she basically led that inquiry.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T16:17:18"></hs_TimeCode>Equally, the
Committee’s well-known inquiry on extradition was proposed by
the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab), and for most of the
time we deferred to him. I was delighted that both inquiries resulted
in unanimous reports.</hs_Para>

intriguing recommendation that I warmly recognise and embrace concerns
the importance of principles of diversity and of engaging as fully as
possible with civil society and small but well-known groups at national
level. For example, yesterday we met Praxis community projects. It has
helped a small group, Better Futures, which related to our inquiry into
young unaccompanied migrant children. I am certain that the inquiry and
report will benefit enormously from the first-hand
experiences—often very traumatic experiences—that we
heard about from those young unaccompanied migrant children, some of
whom were from war-torn countries such as Afghanistan and Sierra
Leone.

it. I am sure

Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith) will recall the
conference that we both attended and addressed last year on 18 April
here in Westminster on Parliaments and human rights. It marked the end
of the UK’s chairmanship of the Council of Europe’s
Committee of Ministers. It was a sobering experience to have such a
wide range of voices and experiences from this country and throughout
the world looking specifically at the work of my Committee, and it made
me reflect on my work as a Chair and on the work of the Committee as a
whole.</hs_Para>

have been other conferences, including one in November in
Geneva on strengthening the role of parliamentarians in establishing

have fought to achieve what you have in your country.” It was

Walley</B> (Stoke-on-Trent North) (Lab):</Member> In the brief amount
of time I have available to me I want to welcome the manner in which
the Chairman of the Liaison Committee has introduced the report. We
should do anything we can to get away from the widespread perception
that Parliament is all about what happens at Prime
Minister’s Question Time on Wednesday at 12
o’clock—that is simply not the case. A great deal of
detailed scrutiny work is done not just by the Liaison Committee and
Committee Chairs, but by members of Select Committees. It is important
that people out there who follow what Parliament does understand that
MPs can make a difference in our day-to-day work in holding the
Government to account. The report shows how we have taken that
forward.</hs_Para>

important in the short amount of time I have to concentrate on what
will  make a difference. Select Committees work not just to
hold an inquiry, get a Government response and put 
<?notus-xml column=1137?>out a press release, but to follow up their detailed
recommendations. We tenaciously follow up Select Committee
recommendations so that we get Ministers to come to Parliament to
respond. That is

echo previous comments on resources, which is a big issue for my
Committee. When the Government got rid of the Sustainable Development
Commission, there was an in-built assumption that the Committee would
take over that work. I want to leave the House with a plea. The
resources available to my Committee in no way compensate for those that
the Government took away and cut from the Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs budget and the budgets of other
Departments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013134000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013134000124">My
Committee was told that the National Audit Office was at our disposal,
but the Government cannot dictate what the NAO does. I simply make the
point that the NAO needs to look at its resources. Although we have one

is nowhere near sufficient. We need to ensure that the NAO recognises
that environmental and sustainability issues matter.</hs_Para>

an attempt to try to compensate for our current lack of resources, we
have sought advice from other sources—something very much in
keeping with the thrust of the Liaison Committee report. One of our
specialist advisers, Professor Tim O’Riordan, has taken the lead
in organising a network of academics with research interests in
sustainability, pulling together researchers from many universities and
think-tanks. I am pleased to say that the network convened at Keele
university in north Staffordshire for the first time in October 2011
with members of the Committee. It is producing a database of
sustainable development research to inform the Committee’s
sustainable development-related inquiries, once they are under way. As
we take the work of the Liaison Committee forward, I hope we are

independence of Committees. It is two years since that was

I do not know what the answer is, given that Members of Parliament

is not only major companies, however, that Select Committees need to

up of the health service means that lines of accountability are
becoming more and more blurred. The House and Select Committees have
the opportunity to scrutinise what these new organisations are up to

We share the Committee’s disappointment that the Government have
not published more Bills in draft. They only published 18 Bills in
draft in the 2010-12 parliamentary Session. Pre-legislative scrutiny is
beneficial to the legislative process and is an area where Committees
made up of members with in-depth policy knowledge can add real value.
Will the Leader of the House commit, therefore, to increasing the
proportion of Bills that the Government publish in draft? Even when the

Liaison Committee describes the main role of Select Committees as

Committees, the functions it describes are scrutinising and holding the

“scrutiny” is preferable to “influencing”.
The measure of a Select Committee’s success should not be the
sum total of its recommendations that the Government adopt. The core
objectives of Select Committees, as first set out by the Modernisation
Committee in 2002, have worked well, with an emphasis on their role in
scrutinising the Government. However, the Liaison Committee was right
to consider whether more streamlined objectives would be suitable. The
proposed new guidance for Select Committees is sensible, although I

their

Select Committee work to set off debates. I regret the fact that it has

Departments finally get round to responding to Select Committee
reports, the responses are often inadequate. In its evidence to the
Liaison Committee, the Regulatory Policy Institute’s better
government programme described the Government’s responses as
“models of evasion”. Will the Leader of the House say
something about what Ministers could do to respond to these criticisms

want to consider for themselves the many recommendations on how
Committees can have a greater impact. I support the recommendation for
Committees to experiment with different approaches, such as appointing
rapporteurs to lead inquiries, commissioning external research and,
perhaps more controversially, using special advisers to question
witnesses on technical subjects. That can be seen in other Parliaments,

agreed to it and allocated time for it to be debated. The establishment
of the Backbench Business Committee—it is good to see its Chair,
the hon. Member for North East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel), in her

I thought about the matter in preparation for this debate, I wondered
whether we should at least try to look for a practical way of solving
the problem. Noticeably, the Thursday Westminster Hall debates chosen
by the Backbench Business Committee are often well attended, and I
suspect that that Committee would be willing and able to schedule more
debates in Westminster Hall if that time was available. If the Liaison
Committee were to think about working with the Backbench Business
Committee, perhaps even giving up some of its allocation of time in
Westminster Hall, and if Chairs of Select Committees were, in parallel,
more frequent bidders to the Backbench Business Committee for debates
on Select Committee business on a substantive motion in this Chamber,
we might find a solution that benefits both the Backbench Business
Committee and the Liaison Committee, and, especially, the House as a
whole<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T16:50:22"></hs_TimeCode>. Such an
approach might allow precious debating time in Westminster Hall to be
used and allow the particular characteristics of a substantive motion
in this House to be used; things might be optimised both
ways.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013134000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013134000167"><B><Member ContinuationText="Natascha Engel" PimsId="4772" UID="13013134000309" xid="828" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013134000309">Natascha

pairs of number plates a week. That badly designed approach offers
neither quality nor inherent integrity, yet countries such as Sweden
have designed and developed a secure system relying on a single
supplier, appointed on a five-year basis through a competitive tender

be like a secure document that can assist law enforcement agencies as
well as protecting owners’ vehicles. In Sweden, the plate
manufacturer receives its instructions electronically from the Swedish
equivalent of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. The system is
simple and efficient, and it provides for security. It is similar to

a limited number of approved suppliers. The British Number Plate
Manufacturers Association, the Department for Transport and the DVLA

perhaps that is not too surprising, given that the DVLA is not
generally associated with innovation and the BNMA is heavily influenced
by dominant manufacturers and suppliers, not least the multinational
group 3M. These vested interests have little incentive to change the
system. It suits them to have a relatively unsophisticated model for
the supply and assembly of number plates. 3M gains enormously from the

hope the Minister can commit to reviewing the existing situation. I
hope I can persuade him to review our use of number plates in the
context of security and related technology. I hope we can convince him
that there are clear advantages in having more security features, and I
hope he will re-examine the case for greater control of the supply of
number plates. I believe that a single-source supply model warrants
consideration, but I recognise that others may judge it to be too great
a step, and my interest is in advocating a model that provides for a
markedly more secure and sustainable number plate regime. Such an
approach need not cost the taxpayer money. It will more likely raise
revenue through a better established market that can support the sale
of “cherished plates”, and of course any Government
seriously considering introducing cost-effective and sustainable road
pricing will need an effective number plate regime that gives access to

will therefore follow up some of the points made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:10:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Birmingham, Selly Oak, particularly regarding the position of the
police on these matters. I am grateful to him for sharing with me some
of the material that West Midlands police have helpfully provided. The
police have highlighted historical issues with the existing VRM regime
for many years, and they have recommended a system of secure
anti-tamper plates—for example, riveted to the body of the
car—that should be available through limited approved suppliers.
The problem, though, is that the Department for Transport has responded
to the police by rejecting their recommendations on the basis, at least
according to West Midlands police, that they are unable to prove that
the increase in theft of registration plates is linked to criminality.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:11:27"></hs_TimeCode> find that an
extraordinary position, and perhaps the Minister will be able to give
an explanation.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13013134000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013134000199">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:14:23"></hs_TimeCode>
am concerned that the real explanation is that those within the
industry who benefit from the current regime have too strong an
influence within the Department for Transport and that the concerns of
the police, and indeed the wider interests of the consumer, hold
insufficient sway. It does not strike me as a sensible way of
organising the regime to have, as the hon. Gentleman said, a major
manufacturer such as 3M providing the high-value element of the number
plate, and I suspect that the value, or cost, is far higher than it
needs to be. It is in the interests of that multinational that our
market should be dispersed and broken up with very large numbers of
suppliers, given that the sum involved is relatively small for each
person in the industry, such that competitive pressures do not come to
bear to reduce the price at which it can sell the reflective piece of
equipment, nor is the market opened up to other competitors to the
benefit of our consumers.</hs_Para>

we are not worried about the consumer, as we should be, we can at least
look at the position of the police. The suggestion that the increase in
the theft of number plates is not linked to criminality is really
rather preposterous. In 2007-08, West Midlands police found that their
monthly average number of thefts was 250. By 2011, that figure had
increased to 425, 20% of which involved thefts from vehicles.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:14:23"></hs_TimeCode> is for the
Department for Transport to prove its view that this practice is not
associated with criminality. West Midlands police gave a whole list of
examples of how it is associated with criminality, such as legitimising
the use of a stolen vehicle, disguising a vehicle’s identity to
use it in crime, 
<?notus-xml column=1151?>false reporting after a speed camera activation, walking away from
offences such as road traffic collisions without reporting them, and
escaping congestion charges and insurance premiums. Potentially, it
could be associated with road-use charging. I am not sure that I
approve of the hon. Gentleman’s position on that, but I
understand that it is to be used on the Dartford crossing.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13013134000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013134000201">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:13:59"></hs_TimeCode>
of the obvious ways in which stolen number plates are used is for
theft-of-fuel offences. As the Department for Transport supposedly
wants evidence on this, I am delighted that in February 2011 West
Midlands police commissioned a case study across the whole of
Birmingham which found that 153 thefts of number plates were reported,
of which 43, or 30%, were subsequently used in theft-of-fuel offences.
I think that that is clear evidence that the increase in theft is
associated with
criminality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:14:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013134000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013134000202">From
the police perspective, the argument is that change is long overdue.
There is a security-related argument for limited suppliers, which could
be a lot cheaper, and, in particular, an argument for riveting plates
to vehicles in order to make it much more difficult to steal them and
then use them to support a whole other range of
criminality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:15:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013134000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013134000203">Before
I conclude, I want to raise a wider issue than vehicle registration
plates. The current system includes the British Standards Institution

be opened up, where possible, to competition and, where not, to at

listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman, particularly to his espousal

register of number plate suppliers scheme was established in 2003 to
regulate the supply of number plates in the UK. It has helped to reduce
the opportunities for criminals to obtain plates to disguise the
identity of stolen vehicles or to use them in criminal activity. As the
hon. Gentleman has said, there are almost 40,000 suppliers on the
register—38,894, to be absolutely precise. Although I
acknowledge, as the hon. Gentleman has said, that  
<?notus-xml column=1152?>other countries operate a different regime with regard to supply and
format, including a single supplier system, the register scheme
represents a system of
regulation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013134000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013134000207">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:17:46"></hs_TimeCode>
accept that, prior to the scheme, it was possible to buy number plates
in the UK for any vehicle from any supplier without valid checks or
controls. That is why it was essential to put the scheme in
place. It makes it more difficult for criminals and penalty evaders to
abuse the number plate process, as it requires them to prove
entitlement to the plate and to provide personal identification. It has
closed off the opportunity for criminals to obtain number plates
through legal channels and, contrary to some views, it has the support
of the
police<hs_TimeCode time="2013-01-31T17:18:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013134000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/debtext/130131-0003.htm#13013134000208">All
number plate suppliers now have to register by law. They pay a one-off

hon. Gentleman was right to highlight the concerns expressed a few
years ago when a single manufacturer, Hills, developed a system of
printing that had the unforeseen side-effect of making the number plate
text unreadable by automatic number plate

out that concerns still exist. Hills was the only manufacturer using
that system, and the manufacture of those plates has now been stopped,
but there is still an unknown number of those so-called transparent
plates in circulation. 
<?notus-xml column=1153?>The Department for Transport estimates that, in the worst-case scenario,
up to 5% of all cars could be unreadable. However, we have reasonable
evidence that the actual numbers are somewhat smaller. None the less,
that development needed to be stopped immediately, and it has been.
Most of the transparent plates were fitted to fleet vehicles, which are
eventually sold into individual ownership, at which point the plates
are routinely swapped for regular, opaque ones. That is one reason that
the number might be lower. There were no concrete rules to stop
companies employing that process, but that has now been

Cairns</B> (Vale of Glamorgan) (Con):</Member> Thank you for chairing
this debate, Sir Alan; it is pleasure to serve under your chairmanship.
I extend my appreciation to the Backbench Business Committee for
responding positively to my request for this debate. Its members, like
all Members here, recognise the importance of
S4C.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000010">The
purpose of this debate is to recognise and underline the important role
that S4C has played in Wales over the past 30 years, but I also want to
look forward to how the channel can develop and respond to changing
needs in the new media age. This is also an opportunity to seek
assurances from the Minister about his Department’s continued
role in supporting and funding the
channel.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000011">It
is hard to recall how broadcasting in Wales looked before S4C started
transmitting in 1982. I can just about remember when Welsh language
programmes used to appear on the BBC and ITV. They irritated non-Welsh
speakers and could hardly meet the demand of those who wanted to watch
Welsh language programmes. “Pobol y Cwm”,
“Heddiw” and “Fo a Fe” are just three of
the programmes I remember best. Although “Pobol y Cwm”
remains with us, it has changed significantly and holds the record for
being the BBC’s longest-running soap opera. It is interesting to
note that the first Welsh-language broadcast was in 1923, when Mostyn
Thomas sang “Dafydd y Garreg Wen” on the
radio.</hs_Para>

of the Broadcasting Act 1980, which established Channel 4 across
England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and S4C in Wales. Before that
time, there was some controversy. We should pay tribute to two people
who played key roles in securing the Welsh channel. The first was the
former Plaid Cymru MP Gwynfor Evans, who campaigned tirelessly; the
other was Wyn Roberts, then MP for Conwy and now known as Lord Roberts.
His influence as a Welsh Office Minister was key in encouraging
Margaret Thatcher and Willie Whitelaw to agree to the
channel.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000013">Over
the past 30 years, S4C has boasted a host of nominations and awards,
including numerous BAFTAs. “Hedd Wyn” and “Solomon
a Gaenor” were nominated for Oscars in the best foreign-language
film category, along with several Emmys and New York film festival
awards. S4C has an excellent reputation for animation;
“Superted”, one of its first programmes, broadcast in
1982, became the first ever British animation series to be broadcast by
Disney. I could go on and on.</hs_Para>

not only demonstrate the channel’s cultural and artistic
influence but underline its economic role. Films and programmes of such
calibre have naturally 
<?notus-xml column=324?>created demand from international broadcasters. I could highlight
several examples, but one of the most notable is “Jesus: The
Miracle Maker”, seen in the cinema and on television by some 40
million people, including two peak-time viewings on the ABC network in
the US.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13013159000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000015">The fallout
from such success and Government spend has been the creation and
development of a broadcast industry. Wales has 40 independent
television companies, some of which have become significant UK players
and are expanding internationally. Two obvious examples are Boom
Pictures, which developed from Boomerang and is in the news today
because of its deal with MainStreet Pictures, and Tinopolis, which
bought Mentorn Media and Sunset and Vine.</hs_Para>

Cairns:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman might be familiar with the
Hargreaves report, which said that it is unlikely that there would be
an independent television industry in Wales if not for S4C. The
economic impact now adds between £80 million and £90
million to the economy. Although that is positive, it needs to develop
further with a multiplier effect; I will return to that a little later.
I note that every one of S4C’s chairman and chief executives
have contributed significantly to that success and provided excellent
leadership over the years.</hs_Para>

created new opportunities, but also caused the channel some
difficulties. S4C established its digital channel in 1998, changing the
landscape significantly. Rather than broadcasting a limited number of
hours of Welsh programming and taking the remaining feed from Channel
4, S4C Digital started broadcasting Welsh-language programmes all day
long. Although there was a change in the funding formula, budgets
naturally became tighter with increased demand for output. Increased
viewer choice also had a fallout on viewer numbers. Depending on how we
measure the channel’s success, audience numbers would naturally
have been squeezed. Recent changes in viewing patterns to online,
on-demand, satellite, mobile and other innovative formats have made
Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board data less
reliable.</hs_Para>

politicians and leading individuals have sought to exploit the need for
changes in the running of S4C for their own ends. Just over two years
ago, my hon. Friend the Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) held a debate
on the channel here in Westminster Hall, after the Minister first
proposed to change the predominant funding source from the Department
for Culture, Media and Sport to the BBC. That debate was exploited
to the full, despite assurances and guarantees offered by the
Minister and the Secretary of State at the time. Questions were asked
about operational independence and commissioning guarantees to
independent companies. Despite the commitments offered by Ministers to
my hon. Friend the Member for Aberconwy and me, the critics continued
to be negative and to use the channel as a political stick, creating
uncertainty and undermining confidence.</hs_Para>

Cairns:</Member></B> I remind the hon. Gentleman how packed Westminster
Hall was on that occasion. People who had never shown any interest in
the channel came merely to use it as a political stick, rather than
listening to the reassurances given by the Secretary of State and the
Minister, which have now been realised in the agreement signed earlier
this week. Until then, the channel had avoided being used for political
purposes. I hope that it can return to that state of consensus on how
it is supported. That is the best way to secure its long-term future.
This week, those guarantees from the Government have become reality. I
was pleased that the BBC Trust and the chairman of S4C approved their
operating agreement. It is excellent news and exactly meets the
Minister’s commitments. It satisfies the demands of the Welsh
public, the industry, S4C and the BBC.</hs_Para>

in the agreement are still open to interpretation. They relate to
powers to intervene, which lie with the trust rather than the
corporation, and extreme circumstances in which the BBC could withdraw
funding. It is important to emphasise that interpretation of
“the BBC” in that document should refer to the BBC Trust,
and that there is an expectation that the BBC Trust would consult
Ministers and others well before getting into a position to withhold
funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000024"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jonathan Edwards" PimsId="5701" UID="13013159000363" xid="1034" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000363">Jonathan
Edwards:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is being very generous in
giving way. The agreement is testament to the hard work of the chair of
the S4C authority and the commissioner for Wales of the BBC. They seem
to have managed to square a circle. Does he share my concern, however,
that the agreement might be problematic if we had a commissioner for
Wales on the BBC Trust who was hostile to Welsh language
broadcasting?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000025"><B><Member ContinuationText="Alun Cairns" PimsId="2422" UID="13013159000364" xid="1173" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000364">Alun
Cairns:</Member></B> I refer to the point I have already made. I pay
tribute to the people the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, but the
agreement follows the commitment and guarantees that were given by the
Secretary of State and the Minister at the time of the previous debate.
It brings those commitments into reality, and I absolutely take
confidence in the document and in the comments made by the chairman of
S4C, its chief executive and the chairman of the BBC Trust. I
absolutely accept those comments. That is why I wanted to clarify today
the small points that are down to interpretation. It comes down to the
matter of the BBC Trust, and there is a long process before the BBC
would ever get to a position of withholding
funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000026">With
those doubts resolved, we are left with the challenges and
opportunities for the future. We are already seeing the benefits of
closer working with the BBC. There is on-demand provision through
iPlayer and Clic, where common platforms provide opportunities for
savings, and some central services can be reorganised to save more
money. Such joint working, however, should not be at the cost of
commissioning from the independent sector. In fact, money
saved through joint working should be able to increase resources
available for commissioning.</hs_Para>

joint working with the BBC and how that should release funding to
enable more money to be spent on commissioning from independent
companies, although, as one of my hon. Friends commented during the
interval, the Divisions make it seem as though S4C is being subject to
some interference. Commissioning programmes to be made in both English
and Welsh makes good business sense and opens international markets.
“Mathias”, or “Hinterland”, is one such
example —the programme has already been sold to a Danish
broadcaster.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000032">Viewing
figures alone are not necessarily the best measure of the success of a
channel. The limited number of BARB boxes in Wales leads to significant
fluctuations in the audience numbers recorded, and a recent saving of
£250,000 was made by removing the additional BARB boxes
commissioned by the channel. That was sensible, and the right thing to
do, but we need to bear those fluctuations in mind. If measuring
audience numbers alone is too simplistic, we need to recognise the
limited audience and compare S4C with other channels that operate in
specialised areas, such as BBC 4. I do not have a solution to the
problem of how we measure success, but it needs to be
considered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000033">New
media technology also provides new opportunities to reach new
audiences, and means that language need not be a limitation.
Two-language commentary on sport is an excellent innovation that should
be developed further. Although the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport has been supportive of S4C’s expansion into new media,
legislative changes are needed, because of the limitations of the
existing Communications Act 2003. Such changes would enable
the channel to become more effective and to operate in further areas of
new media. That has a direct link with the economic impact of the
channel, but the multiplier has to improve further. The digital
development and co-production funds offer opportunities to attract
additional finance, support creativity across platforms and develop new
companies and innovations. It would be good to see S4C expand yet
further in that
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000034">It

afternoon, and that this important debate can continue. I was about to
make my final point, which is about the importance of funding from the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Not only is the £7
million important financially, but it prevents the BBC from
holding a near-monopoly on the funding and commissioning of programmes
in Wales, although ITV plays a part, and that is important to the
plurality of media in Wales. I appreciate that the Minister’s
hands are tied and that he cannot provide a copper-bottomed guarantee
because of Treasury rules, but I would like some words that
show his and his Department’s commitment to the channel, and a
reassurance within the constraints and limitations on him.</hs_Para>

Elan Jones</B> (Clwyd South) (Lab):</Member> It is a great pleasure to
speak in this debate on a very important subject. This is a great
moment in our history, celebrating, as we do, the 30th anniversary of
the world’s only publicly broadcasted Welsh language channel. Of
course, we now take the channel’s existence very much for
granted. We are not only used to S4C, but used to seeing and hearing
the Welsh language, though I certainly do not accept the view of some
commentators that the historic struggle for securing the future of the
Welsh language is over. None the less, it is fair to say that Welsh is
still a living language. It stares at us from road signs, beams down
from the large letters beloved of supermarkets, and plays on our
television sets, radios and on the internet. It is the language of
much, though not all, official documentation.</hs_Para>

is that none of that happened by magic or by chance. The existence of
S4C is a reminder of a diverse history of people—some of them
famous, but most of them not—who fought for the Welsh language
in times when it was not fashionable to do so. The fact that we are
here at all today is testimony to them, and they, above all, deserve
our publicly expressed thanks and admiration.</hs_Para>

need reminding of the scale of the challenge that they faced, I would
like to share with hon. Members the words of Mr E.R. Appleton, who was
the senior BBC official and man in charge of broadcasting in Wales in
the late 1920s. When questioned about whether the people of Wales might
have a modicum of Welsh language in broadcasting, he said
that</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13013159000316" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000316">“the
official language is English. When His Majesty’s Government
decided to form a corporation for the important function of
broadcasting, it was natural that the official language be used
throughout. To use the ancient languages regularly—Welsh, Irish,
Gaelic and Manx—would be either to serve propaganda purposes or
to disregard the needs of the greatest number in the interest of those
who use the language for aesthetic and sentimental reasons rather than
for practical purposes...If the extremists who desire to force the
language upon listeners in the area were to have their way, the
official language would lose its
grip.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13013159000045" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000045">There
we have it—no Welsh language broadcasting, or it might affect
the grip of the English language. That is not quite a reflection of
what happened.</hs_Para>

our great Welsh youth movement, the Urdd Gobaith Cymru, implored the
youth of Wales, “Cymraeg yw iaith yr aelwyd, siaradwch
hi”—“Welsh is the language of home and hearth,
speak it.” It spoke of an era when Welsh was commonly spoken by
all members of a family. The greatest challenge then was seen as
ensuring that the young carried on speaking and using the Welsh
language. However, that is no longer true for most families today,
including my own, and those of us who come from homes where Welsh was
not spoken by all members of the family owe S4C a particular debt of
gratitude.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000047">It
is a great privilege to have been brought up in a country with
a television station such as S4C. It is a privilege to have been a
viewer of S4C as a teenager in Wales, and as an adult in both Wales and
London. Last September, on my first holiday to that great European city
of Barcelona, a Freesat box meant I was able to watch S4C there too. I
have no complaints about people in Barcelona, or indeed, England,
needing a Freesat to watch S4C. However, I object to the fact that
according to a recent admission by Ofcom, 2% of Welsh viewers need to
do the same. I have brought that matter up in the House before, and I
will do so again. If the technology of transmitters is beyond the
collective abilities of Digital UK and Ofcom to sort out, I believe
that they, and not Welsh television viewers, who pay their licence fees
every year, should foot the bill for the Freesat boxes.</hs_Para>

Rhosllannerchrugog, which is Wales’s largest village, though I
know there are some in south Wales that have a different version of
events on that one. I think it could be described fairly as a village
with two community languages. My father came from a village five miles
away, where Welsh was not a community language. He does not speak
Welsh. My mother speaks Welsh as a second language. English was the
language of our household, but my community and school were
bilingual.</hs_Para>

household that I grew up in, the regular presence of S4C, sometimes
with subtitles on, did much to normalise the use of the Welsh language
for me. It brought bilingualism to life in my family and in many other
families in my local community. Through it, Welsh became not only the
language of chapels and older people, but a contemporary medium with a
diverse range of interesting programmes. One of only five
television channels on offer at the time in our area, it provided
something new and different. It made Welsh relevant, and for people
from backgrounds such as mine, it gave us new impetus to use the Welsh
language.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000050">Today,
S4C faces a different media age. In the internet age, the development
of the channel’s online presence is vital, as is its work in
commissioning broadcasts produced by media companies across Wales.
There is a real challenge in what must be the development of new media
companies in our Welsh-speaking heartland communities, offering diverse
programming and a genuine cultural renaissance and regeneration in
those
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000051">Those
challenges will not be easy. There were those of us who wanted to take
S4C out of the Public Bodies Act 2011. At the time, on that Bill
Committee, three parties, dare I say it, were acting “in the
national interest”—myself, along with the hon. Members
for Arfon (Hywel Williams) and for Ceredigion (Mr Williams). That was
voted for by all Opposition parties and a few Liberals who had a bit of
the best Welsh Liberal tradition at heart. That was contrary to the UK
Government’s policy, and, I believe, to the policies of all
parties in the National Assembly for Wales. We did that, not because we
wanted to be awkward, controversial or any of the suggestions that
people far less pleasant than those in this room might make,
but because we knew the scale of the challenge that S4C would face,
even without the disproportionate level of cuts that the channel saw
levelled against it.</hs_Para>

S4C’s calculations, those cuts amount to 24% over a period of
four years—a real-terms cut of 36%. In 2010, S4C’s grant
was £101 million, and it was reduced to £90 million in
2011 and £83 million in 2012. Last summer, the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport announced further reductions—1% in
2013-14 and 2% in 2014-15. From April this year, most of S4C’s
funding will come from the licence fee through the BBC Trust for the
duration of the existing BBC Charter, due to be renewed in 2017. We do
not know what will happen after that. As noted from this week’s
statement from the BBC, the funding from the BBC will go down every
year between now and 2016-17. Furthermore, there is no
guarantee that the £7 million received by S4C from the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport will be received after 2015.
According to S4C’s figures, if that £7 million was not
there, there would, in fact, be a 42% cut. It is no wonder that the
1,200 people in that mass e-mail and letter lobby—organised so
well by the Welsh Language Society—of Members of Parliament
serving on the Public Bodies Bill Committee were so concerned. They
were absolutely right to be.</hs_Para>

learning Welsh, and for those longing to be able to speak Welsh by the
time of the next census, I believe that we need to consider the
situation—to celebrate S4C’s 30th birthday, certainly,
but also to look forward to its future and the future of Welsh, as a
living, sustainable language throughout
Wales.</hs_Para>

Wales compete with one another to claim credit for creating it. It was
created, of course, at a time when Mrs Thatcher was the Prime Minister
of the country. My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan has
paid tribute to the work of Lord Wyn Roberts and to Willie Whitelaw. We
should also refer to the work of Lord Crickhowell at the time, because
he played a very significant part in what happened. I, too, want to pay
tribute to Mr Gwynfor Evans. He made a massive commitment, over a long
time. All we remember 
<?notus-xml column=331?>is his threat to fast to death if this channel was not created. I do not
know whether that threat was a help or a hindrance to what happened,
but it certainly demonstrated a massive commitment to the Welsh
language.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000061">I
still remember what happened very clearly. The most important thing
that the Thatcher Government did was not only to create S4C, but to
commit to a funding level tied to a mechanism to continue that, linked
to inflation. That happened right the way through until two years ago,
and this is where I enter what is perhaps more controversial territory.
The love of the language, the feeling for the language, caused many
people to pressurise me, as a member of the Public Bodies Bill
Committee, which was considering the breaking of the link. I know just
how much the people of Wales care about it. At the time, I thought that
it was inevitable. I thought that it would be unrealistic to retain the
position that we had, but without the link, we will occasionally refer
again to the funding levels for S4C. It will crop up in the
parliamentary timetable. Certainly I and, I hope, the successors to all
of us will fight S4C’s corner to maintain a realistic budget, in
the economy of the time, and to make certain that we have a strong
S4C.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000062">We
have had a period when S4C has seemed to be in a bit of a bad place. I
felt that there was almost a self-destruct button being pressed three
or four years ago, but what do we have now? We have two bodies, two
broadcasters in Wales, that are committed to the Welsh
language—the BBC and S4C. They are working very closely
together. We have seen the operating agreement. We have seen two chief
executives who are working very well together. We have seen the two
channels produce the “Mathias” or
“Hinterland” programme. That is the sort of thing that I
hope we will see happening again and again in the future. We are in a
position from which we can celebrate S4C. It is in a wonderful place at
the moment. Wales is a small country and is very lucky to have a
channel that does such a wonderful
job.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13013159000341" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000341">2.45

current challenges and its future

hon. Gentleman has his roots in the western edges of the south Wales
valleys, where he had the good fortune to be educated in Ysgol Gyfun
Ystalyfera—the bilingual comprehensive in the Swansea valley,
where all three of my children were educated. No doubt the debates at
the school in the early 1980s mirrored those throughout Wales. It was a
time of great economic, cultural, political and linguistic uncertainty.
The late historian, Gwyn Alf Williams, even asserted in his memorable
BBC Wales lecture, “When was Wales?”, that the Welsh had
virtually voted themselves out of history with the decisive 1979 Welsh
devolution referendum defeat. It was a time of steel and mining strikes
and of heavy industry redundancies. I know that the hon. Gentleman was
part of the vigorous discussions at the school—I had regular
reports at home about them. There would have been many supporters of
Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg, Nelson Mandela and the Greenham 
<?notus-xml column=332?>Common peace protests. Socialists of various
kinds were there—and there was at least one
Conservative in the

we look back at that time, it seems somewhat surprising that Sianel
Pedwar Cymru—S4C—did emerge. The moment, of
course—we have heard this several times, and rightly
so—was Gwynfor Evans’s decision to “fast unto
death” to achieve the channel. We should leave it to the
historians—as a lapsed historian, I welcome their taking on that
challenge—to debate how S4C was actually
created.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000066">What
is not in doubt is that the Welsh language was —unnecessarily, I
believe—a matter of conflict and division, which partly
influenced the 1979 referendum result, but ultimately the achievement
of a Welsh language television channel became a politically unifying
force, with all political parties and movements rightly claiming their
part, to varying degrees, in its creation and its subsequent
achievements, which we are rightly celebrating
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000067">We
should of course acknowledge the decades-long campaigns in the defence
of the Welsh language—we have heard something about that
today—involving a very diverse range of movements, parties and
organisations, encompassing the Urdd, eisteddfodau of all kinds,
including the one that my late father and I were associated
with—the bilingual miners’ eisteddfod at
Porthcawl—Sunday schools, the Welsh medium schools movement,

the Welsh Language Society
itself.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000068">The
point that I am making is that at a time of fracture, fear and, indeed,
retreat, the very creation of S4C, in the midst of all
that—unexpectedly for many—served, over time, as a focus
of political and cultural unity. The Welsh language then ceased to be a
party political football, and I certainly do not believe that it has
become so again, even today—the hon. Member for Vale of
Glamorgan made passing reference to the matter. I do not believe that
S4C is seen as a matter for party political debate. Everyone in the
room today and beyond celebrates S4C’s
achievements.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000069">Over
time, S4C has made its contribution in creating what the great Welsh
writer, Raymond Williams, called “the idea of a common
culture”. For me, that means a common democratic culture
that embraces our two Welsh languages—English and
Welsh—and a growing belief that both languages belong to us all
in
Wales.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000070">In
reflecting on the programmes of S4C, from “Pobol y Cwm”
and “Dinas”—I should declare an interest in that
my son had a part in “Dinas” over many weeks—to
“Superted” and “Y Byd ar Bedwar”, I am
struck by one particular iconic cultural creation, which represents for
me one of the very best creations of British television. It was created
by S4C and is a signifier of the common culture I mention:
the 1999, award-winning, Oscar-nominated, trilingual film
“Solomon a Gaenor”, which has already been mentioned. It
portrays poignantly, painfully and beautifully the class and racial
tensions of early 20th century Wales. It is a story for
today and for all time—We recently, sadly, commemorated
Holocaust memorial day.</hs_Para>

on, a more democratic and, I believe, tolerant Wales is also more at
ease with itself. For all our problems and challenges—there are
many—S4C has played its part in sustaining one of our languages.
It has done so by ensuring that it is more of a force for political and
cultural unity than for division.</hs_Para>

all the progress, there are great uncertainties regarding funding,
quality, standards, working conditions, sustainability and indeed
democratic accountability. I am not at all convinced that
the agreements and arrangements with the BBC are sustainable in the
long run, nor am I convinced that the UK Department for Culture, Media
and Sport is necessarily the appropriate line of democratic
accountability. I am not clear that the funding following the
comprehensive spending review—the cuts have already been
mentioned—is viable, notwithstanding DCMS obligations under the
Public Bodies Act 2011.</hs_Para>

the Joint Committee on Human Rights, I am keenly aware of the
need to protect all our cultural rights in this country, including the
Welsh language, and ensure that financial considerations do not
overwhelm linguistic and cultural priorities. The linked questions of
quality, standards, working conditions and so on largely stem from the
funding cuts outlined. Vital issues relate to screen quality suffering,
health and safety, morale and the loss of skills and expertise in
Wales’s creative industries, but all that is for another debate
and another day. We celebrate today S4C’s achievements and trust
that it will have, in Raymond Williams’s words, the
“resources of hope” to sustain itself for another three
decades and I hope
more.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-31?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_31_PT_1/59A6A38B1410ABA161294DDB047115DB39B2CA1D" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="31 January 2013">Thursday

the debate this afternoon. It is timely not only in the sense that it

would not have said those words during the passage of the Public Bodies
Bill. As the hon. Member for Clwyd South (Susan Elan Jones) alluded to,
some of us, for good reason, attempted to instil other safeguards and
to address the funding formula between S4C and the BBC. I remember my
hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Stephen Crabb), now
the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, and my hon. Friend the Member
for Montgomeryshire (Glyn Davies) were there as well. There was a
spirited campaign. I do not deviate from the thinking behind that
campaign in any way. I would not say that I resent, but I do take
exception to, the argument that that campaign was political posturing.
The amendments we tabled and the campaign we raised were a genuine
response to the many hundreds of concerns that had been raised with
us.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000076">Members
of the Bill Committee will recall that many of the e-mails we received
were remarkably similar and came from one source. Members who do not
represent Welsh constituencies were bemused and confused at the
scale and substance of many of those e-mails. I was more interested in
the concerns of the many individual constituents of mine and the many
organisations across Wales. I come here today at least in part
reassured by what has happened and the emergence of the agreement, and
in part because our job is to show a healthy scepticism—even, on
occasion, of the things that come from a Government of our own side of
the House.</hs_Para>

chairman, Huw Jones, has said that the agreement provides security for
the channel until 2017. The new operating code will allow BBC
intervention in editorial matters in extreme cases, only where there
has been a material breach of its remit. We have heard about the
funding. S4C will receive £76.3 million directly from the BBC
Trust, falling to £74.5 million in 2016-17—an issue of
some concern, of course. I welcome that agreement. As I said, it
reassures me, but we should not lose sight of how different the funding
settlement is from that previously guaranteed in statute. S4C came into
being because of a people’s campaign. It was set up to
provide a vital service to the Welsh people, and my impression was
always that the strength of feeling was the justification for
enshrining the arrangements in statute.</hs_Para>

played a key part in ground-breaking productions in both languages,
such as “Pobol y Cwm”, “Grand Slam” and

Flynn</B> (Newport West) (Lab):</Member> In 1973, the concept of a
fourth channel seemed an impossible, impractical dream. That
year’s report, “Television in Wales”, which became
Labour party policy in Wales at the 1974 election, called for such a
fourth channel. The writing of that report was fascinating, because it
went into areas that were unknown—certainly, to me—at the
time, including that so much was going on in minority languages
throughout the world. As my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd South

it could be made to

thing that I discovered in compiling the report was that the Inuit word
for television is “the shaking tent”. Before Eskimos saw
television for the first time, they had an ancient practice of going
into a tent and starting an oil lamp burning so that, when the tent was
shaken outside, they could interpret the shadows on the screen. Given
the quality of television at the time—fog with knobs
on—they thought it was another version of the shaking tent. It
also came out that, for example in Canada, Ottawa had a station
broadcasting in 30 languages, none of which were Canadian or Eskimo
ones.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000091">The
point I want to make—we have to nail down the history that we
can remember—is that, although Willie Whitelaw has been praised,
he was not one of the 
<?notus-xml column=336?>heroes of the process. He was the one who turned the
channel idea down. I had a minute, protozoan moment in that history, in
that I was the acting chairman of the Broadcasting Council for Wales at
that time. I served in that post for a record time that I am certain
will never be equalled—15 minutes. I went into the first meeting
and resigned after the minutes had been read, as a protest against the
cancellation of a fourth channel, although that did not have a great
effect on the history of the
matter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000092">What
did have an effect, and it was an almighty one, was, as we have heard,
Dafydd Iwan and the young people who sacrificed so much and went to
jail. I can remember a young man on “Disc a Dawn” called
Huw Jones—I cannot think what has happened to him—but
many people worked to build up the feeling that there was a great
injustice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000093">The
event that changed the situation, after the idea had been emphatically
rejected by the Conservative party, was the lucky one that Margaret
Thatcher had been reading about Irish history—she was deeply
ignorant of it at the time—and was struck to find out that,
following the Easter riots and the shooting of Irish nationalists, the
interest in Irish nationalism had multiplied enormously. When Ireland
had its martyrs, what was a tiny fringe group suddenly became the
majority of the nation. She saw a film on television of Gwynfor Evans
in the Sophia gardens in Cardiff with a crowd chanting,
“Gwynfor, Gwynfor.” She calculated that if he carried out
his fast and died, Wales would have a martyr around which a movement
would develop. She rightly saw that that would happen—I am
certain he was a man who would have stuck to his fast, if the channel
had not arrived—but the Government had to find a pretext,
because they could not possibly give into pressure or blackmail. There
was therefore this little pantomime in which three of the great and the
good in Wales visited Mrs Thatcher to persuade her that it was a good
idea and that she was wrong to reject it. That was the naissance of the
fourth channel,
S4C.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000094">That
is a matter for great celebration. Looking back on those 40 years, we
remember that on the Labour party’s approach—there were
many others—there was unanimity in Wales. It meant a great deal
to non-Welsh speakers, too, although for other reasons, to get
a fourth channel. Great meetings were held, including one in
the city hall in Cardiff, at which everyone agreed that the channel
would be a great
thing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000095">At
the time, we did not envisage that it would be possible for the channel
to create many of its own programmes. It was thought that, to fit with
the amount of money that was likely to be available, the only way would
be to dub or subtitle programmes and so on. With all the pessimism
about people watching subtitled programmes, it is interesting to see
the current fascination with “Borgen”. Subtitles do not
matter. An audience can be got for a programme if the quality is
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000096">This
is a moment of great celebration. The work of S4C was beyond
anyone’s expectation then, and from decade to decade its
glorious success has continued. If the Catholic Church saved the Breton
language and the chapel saved the Welsh language in the past, it is S4C
that has maintained and enriched the life of the Welsh-language world.
Congratulations to all concerned. I think that the parties
in this House will be united in ensuring that these 30 years will be
followed by a glittering future for yr hen
iaith.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-01-31?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_01_31_PT_1/C142318FCA4CFCC13574E920F0BD6DBA67E3F4BE" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="31 January 2013">Thursday

inject a perhaps political, but not sour political, note, I must say to
the House that this is the only Parliament in which we can properly
discuss S4C, because this Parliament is responsible for it. However,
our debate has so far been interrupted four times by Divisions in the
House on amendments—I hope that they were not frivolous
amendments—tabled by a few Tory MPs, as I understand it, to
Lords amendments to the Canterbury City Council Bill, which has now
reached clause 6. If that is the importance afforded a debate such as
this in this place, it is high time that broadcasting was devolved to
Wales. The hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan may say that I am making
political capital, but that is what I wanted to
say.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000099">The
hon. Gentleman started by saying that S4C was born out of the
Broadcasting Act. I have a long speech in front of me saying that it
was not, but despite the Tolstoyan labours I expended on my speech, I

few notes.</hs_Para>

role in the actual genesis of S4C, which began more in the early 1970s,
with the campaign by Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg, the Welsh Language
Society. I had slightly more than a walk-on role, but slightly less
than a starring role—somewhere between Hamlet and third noble on
the left. The same is true of a large number of people in Wales who now
hold responsible positions. We subsequently came to a consensus on the
language and on the value of S4C, and I welcome that.</hs_Para>

historical note for the hon. Member for Aberavon (Dr Francis), I was at
the meeting in Porthmadog on the night it was decided to establish the
channel. The meeting was held to welcome Gwynfor Evans, who was on a
tour making speeches about his decision to fast. I was sitting in the
body of the hall as it filled up. Then, the aisles filled up, the sides
of the hall filled up and the stage filled up. When Gwynfor Evans
eventually came in, he could scarcely find room to stand. That was
because his campaign was popular, and he had captured something in the
national mood, so I pay tribute to him. I am also glad to pay tribute
to Wyn Roberts, whose role in this matter is sometimes not
recognised.</hs_Para>

channel’s cultural achievements are astonishing. Wales, with a
population the same size as those of Bedfordshire, which has a little
over 600,000 people, Wiltshire and Worcestershire, has produced a TV
channel responsible for creating films that have been up for Oscars and
BAFTAs and for filling a great number of hours during the week. That
cultural achievement is astonishing, and we have to pay tribute to S4C
and the people who contribute.</hs_Para>

Bebb</B> (Aberconwy) (Con):</Member> I will be brief. I associate
myself with the comments of most Members this afternoon, especially
about S4C’s success over the years. It is a matter of great
pride that we have had Oscar-nominated films such as “Hedd
Wyn” and that we have fantastic programmes that are enjoyed by
many.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000106">The
hon. Member for Clwyd South (Susan Elan Jones), whom I often disagree
with, touched on an important point regarding the challenge facing S4C
as it moves forward. We have been concentrating on the challenge it
faces as a result of the funding cuts, and there has obviously been a
political discussion about them. However, I grew up in an area where
people spoke, and still speak, Welsh as a natural community language.
People could go to a public house on a Saturday night, and the whole
place would stop to watch “C’mon Midffild”. There
was a sense of community about a programme that really touched on the
community S4C served. That reflects the challenge the
channel now faces.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13013159000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000107">When S4C was
established, Welsh was the community language in large swathes of
Wales, and more than 70% of people spoke it in various wards. Recently,
however, that has been challenged by a decline in the Welsh language,
although not in terms of actual numbers—we have seen an increase
in numbers, despite the disappointing fall in the recent census in the
number of places where more than half the population speaks Welsh.
Overall, however, the number of people who speak Welsh or claim to
speak it has increased since the channel was established. None the
less, the number of communities where it is the predominant language
has fallen. That has happened not least in Carmarthen, where the
figures are quite worrying. The number of people speaking Welsh in the
historical county of Carmarthen, which was always a Welsh language
bastion, is down to 43%.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13013159000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000108">The challenge
was highlighted by the hon. Lady. In the past, the channel would have
enjoyed the support of families in which every member spoke Welsh, but
it now faces a very different situation. Often, we will have a mother
and a father, and one will speak Welsh, while the other does not.
Equally, the children might speak Welsh, while the parents do not. We
heard about that from the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr Williams), who
said he was outnumbered in his own house by Welsh speakers, and I
suspect they will be the children. In the same way, I know that Henri,
the son of the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Alun Cairns), can
speak Welsh but that his mother does not.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13013159000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000109">Such things
are a huge challenge for the channel. We have one television channel
that can produce programmes in Welsh, and it has to deal with the
challenges posed by a changing Welsh-speaking community. It also has to
make sure that it appeals to young children, adults, pensioners, people
who think they are trendy and those who think they are not. The
challenges facing S4C, therefore, are great. However, although the
funding agreement might not be perfect and might not be what people
wanted, we can build on it and we can move forward with it.</hs_Para>

a quick warning about the situation we face in the run-up to the
changes. There is no doubt that S4C has made a huge contribution, but
it took its eye off the ball. There was a feeling that viewing figures
did not matter, that establishing the channel in west and north Wales
was not crucial and that everything could be done from Cardiff.
However, there has been a wake-up call, which is not something we
welcome, but it does not do any harm.</hs_Para>

forward, we face challenges, but there are significant opportunities as
well. Good programmes are being produced under the new regime. My son,
who is 15 and a half—not the age to be watching programmes with
his parents—loves watching “Alice”. He watches a
recording of it on Monday night, because he watches something else on a
Sunday. My children still subscribe to S4C’s children’s
programmes, which are often ignored as attracting no viewers, but that
is because the papers do not understand the
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000112">I
shall be brief, Sir Alan, because you need to call the Front-Bench
speakers, but we should put this debate in context. We have had funding
cuts, but we have great opportunities, although they exist in a
complicated and changed scenario. I have only one question for the
Minister. I accept that the settlement is good and positive and that it
gives stability. I am not one of those who believes that the BBC is
necessarily bad for Wales. In many ways, it has done a lot of good for
Wales. The key issue is that we have argued for a settlement for S4C
that is on par with what the BBC is facing. We have not quite managed
that, but we have a degree of stability. However, the one thing the BBC
has is the ability to plan while knowing where it stands.</hs_Para>

Minister to consider again whether it is appropriate, given the cuts at
S4C, for the DCMS contribution to be cut further. After all, that
contribution has fallen dramatically. As a Member who has supported the
changes, I ask him to reconsider the further cut that has been
announced, as a goodwill gesture towards a channel that is crucial to
the future of the Welsh language.</hs_Para>

congratulate the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Alun Cairns) on his
part in securing the debate. I thank the Backbench Business Committee
for according us this opportunity to celebrate 30 years of S4C. The
debate comes at an important time for S4C, given that we had the
announcement only yesterday that the BBC Trust and the S4C Authority
have agreed the operating agreement that will govern the future funding
and accountability arrangements between S4C 
<?notus-xml column=340?>and the BBC from April 2013. From then on, the majority of
S4C’s public income will be provided by the BBC from the licence
fee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000119">We
have heard slightly different versions from both sides of the Chamber
of the history of S4C and how the channel came about. The important
thing, however, is that it now has support on both sides of the House.
I pay tribute to Gwynfor Evans for his work and his determined stance.
He is best known for his threat to go on hunger strike, but he did a
lot of work before that. I should particularly mention the
intervention of the so-called three wise men: Syr Goronwy Daniel, the
former principal of the university of Wales in Aberystwyth; the former
Archbishop of Wales, Gwilym Williams; and Cledwyn Hughes, the former
leader of the Labour peers in the House of Lords. They intervened to
try to prevail on the then Prime Minister to change her mind. So it was
that Sir Goronwy Daniel became the first chairman of the new channel,
and Owen Edwards was appointed chief executive. It may interest hon.
Members to know that S4C first broadcast on 1 November, before the new
Channel 4, which broadcast on 2 November, in 1982. To start with, the
agreement was for 22 hours a week of broadcasting, for a trial period
of three years. That seems a long way in the past, but that is how it
was then. What a difference that is from the 7 am to midnight service
that we enjoy today.</hs_Para>

always fully understood that S4C is a commissioning body. In other
words it has a finance, contracts and legal department, and a
commissioning arm. It has been responsible for commissioning programmes
from independent companies across Wales. There was an agreement from
the beginning with the BBC to provide 10 hours of programmes per week,
but apart from that the output is commissioned by S4C from independent
companies. The growth in output from the original 22 hours a week to
the current daily coverage, from early in the morning to late at night,
has led to a flourishing Welsh language media sector in Wales, with
independent companies across Wales employing some 2,000 people. That
has been important not only in providing much needed quality jobs in
Wales and a range of Welsh media work experience and apprenticeship
opportunities for young people; it has given people in Wales pride in
the language and an opportunity to show what we can do. Companies such
as Tinopolis in my constituency compete internationally.</hs_Para>

there is a knock-on effect into the local economy. More than 100
regular employees come into the centre of Llanelli to work in
Tinopolis, not to mention the many guests who come to stay
there to work with the company, who increase footfall in the
local shops and businesses. That is a real boost to the local economy
and I believe that such decentralisation, and the way independent
companies have been able to work across Wales, has been important for
many communities. It has given them pride that their company takes part
in something as big and important as S4C, and has provided job
opportunities, and skills opportunities for young

particularly the worrying cuts from the DCMS budget. I hope that the
Minister hears that, and I will not go through the figures again.
However, the impact of the cut in S4C’s programming 
<?notus-xml column=341?>budget, from £85 million to £65 million, is already
apparent. Jobs, and opportunities for young people, are already being
lost.</hs_Para>

teacher, I am particularly aware of the huge importance of S4C in
fostering the use of the Welsh language. People choose to use one
language or another in different circumstances for complex reasons, but
S4C has had a significant role in encouraging and facilitating the use
of the Welsh language and in helping people to feel confident, and to
find it natural to use it. One problem is that pupils may be attending,
or have recently attended, Welsh-medium or bilingual schools, but once
they are outside the school the world around them is often dominated by
English. That is not just because English is the main language of 80%
of the people who live in Wales, nor just because of the influence of
our neighbour, England; it is also because English is a worldwide
language, used for communication between people of many different
tongues, and it has a dominant place in popular culture.</hs_Para>

vital in helping to foster use of the Welsh language in the past 30
years. One of its great challenges has been to be everything to
everyone, from soap opera to highbrow. We all have certain
registers of language, but S4C programmes help us to extend
them, whether in current affairs and new vocabulary, documentaries,
popular comedy series or soap operas. We are exposed to registers that
we might not naturally use. We are exposed to different regional
accents so that we become less insular and more aware of how people say
things in the north or south of Wales. We are better able to
communicate as a nation; S4C has done a lot to help with that. Fifty
per cent. of Welsh speakers come from homes that are not solely
Welsh-speaking, so even people who are not surrounded at home by
speakers of the same language have opportunities to continue to hear,
use, repeat and be aware of the language.</hs_Para>

vital for helping people who are less confident. When I talk about
learners I do not mean just people who arrived in Wales and began
learning the language yesterday. Most of us in Wales are learners in
one way or another. We all feel less confident about some areas of our
language than others. We all have the opportunity, through different
types of programme, to increase our fluency and
understanding.</hs_Para>

children’s programmes is fantastic, and the introduction of the
new “Ti, fi a Cyw”, to help parents who are not Welsh
speakers to learn alongside their children who watch the programme, is
important. There are also things such as “Stwnsh”, for
older children. It is important, particularly for teenagers, that Welsh
TV is not seen just as the language of mam-gu—just the hymn
singing and the countryside programmes, which perhaps do not appeal to
the younger, teenage audience. It is important for things to be brought
up to date. Sport has been crucial to that, because if people want to
watch a programme for its own value, they will want to
understand it. Tribute has also been paid, of course, to high-quality
productions such as “Hedd Wyn” and “Solomon a
Gaenor”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000127"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jonathan Edwards" PimsId="5701" UID="13013159000386" xid="1034" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000386">Jonathan

the lifetime of S4C there has been unprecedented change in
communication technologies. It is almost unbelievable that in 1982 we
were still putting film in our cameras, and journalists used to rush to
phone boxes to relay breaking news. It was in that year that my
constituent Winston Thomas, the owner of Pembrey airport and founder,
owner and chief executive officer of Celtic Engineering, was part of a
team that developed the first commercial e-mail and numerous other
products and services, including fibre-optic systems. We have come a
long way from there, but what does the future hold? Gone are the days
of the family huddling around one TV set in the living room, and
arguing over which of the four channels to watch. People can now access
numerous channels, through a wealth of different media devices, and it
is a complex thing even to collect current viewing figures, never mind
to predict viewers’ future behaviour. That is a challenge for
S4C.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000131">As

have a few questions for the Minister. Members on both sides of the
Chamber have mentioned the importance of funding, and £7 million
per year of S4C’s funding will continue to come from the DCMS
budget; but that sum is guaranteed only until 2015. Continued funding
from DCMS is vital to the future of S4C. If it were not forthcoming it
would equate to total real-terms funding cuts of 42%. Under section 31
of the Public Bodies Act 2011, the Secretary of State for Culture,
Media and Sport must ensure sufficient funding for S4C to provide its
public service. What will happen about funding post-2015? How does the
Department propose to make the evaluation of the public service
provided by S4C? What criteria will the Department use to work out what
constitutes sufficient funding for that public service?</hs_Para>

that his officials will engage with

certainly hope for a change in Government in 2015. However, as he and I
both know, there is homework to be done on this. Whoever is in

contribution to the cultural and economic life of Wales. This 30-year
birthday is a key milestone not just for S4C but for the broadcasting
sector as a whole. The length of service has been due not in small part

total hours of programmes transmitted by S4C during 2011 amounted to

providing Government services in the Welsh language where there is
demand for them. It is particularly important for its Welsh-language
mission that S4C offers comprehensive services for children, including
for young children and teenagers. The innovative children’s
programming that S4C has developed, such as the highly successful
nursery programme, Cyw, is helping the next generation of language
speakers. It was certainly heartening to hear hon. Members talk about

broadcasting. Unfortunately for him, this Government are
committed to maintaining broadcasting as a non-devolved matter. There
are good reasons why broadcasting was not devolved in the devolution
settlements, and there is no evidence to suggest that devolution of
broadcasting policy would benefit licence-fee payers. Essentially, the
UK as a whole benefits from pooling the licence fee, advertising
revenue and subscription fees that go to fund the excellent
broadcasting output across the UK. It allows major investment to be

bodies. I was the Minister when we made those changes. We had a
vigorous, but sensible and good natured debate on the matter. Just as
this debate has been characterised by a common purpose, I strongly felt
then that although our changes were challenging to some people, it was
clear that the Welsh broadcasting community and the Welsh community at
large were prepared to unite behind a solution. As is well known, that
solution is that from April 2013, under the Public Bodies Act 2011, the
BBC will become S4C’s majority funder, using licence fee revenue
and working in partnership to provide the best possible service to the
Welsh people,

Cairns:</Member></B> Thank you, Sir Alan, for calling me to speak
again. I am grateful for the opportunity to close this debate, and I am
also grateful to the Members who have contributed to it: the hon.
Members for Clwyd South (Susan Elan Jones) and for Aberavon (Dr
Francis), and my hon. Friend the Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb), who
focused on the importance that S4C has attached to the Welsh language;
the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr Williams), who focused on the
agreement between the BBC and S4C, which was signed just
yesterday; my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Glyn Davies)
and the hon. Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith), who, along with my
hon. Friend the Member for Aberconwy, highlighted the funding issues;
and the hon. Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn), who talked about the
history of S4C, but I think that he almost forgot to mention that it
was a Conservative Government that ultimately set it up. The hon.
Member for Arfon (Hywel Williams) called for devolution of S4C, which
is an issue I will return to in a moment, and the hon. Member for
Llanelli (Nia Griffith) covered many of the points that I have already
mentioned, and more, in this interesting and constructive
debate.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13013159000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000157">The Minister
responded by reassuring the House that there are no plans to devolve
S4C and broadcasting. I am grateful for that reassurance, and I think
that that feeling is also reflected among the Opposition Members who
have spoken. Those who call for the devolution of S4C need to
remember that there have certainly been squeezes in budgets in Cardiff
Bay. I certainly take more comfort from the security of funding from
the UK Government than I do from the funding from the Welsh Government.
I just point to the Arts Council of Wales, and the questions and
controversy about it in Wales over time, and some of the advocates for
devolution might need to look back at recent history.</hs_Para>

challenges will always remain; I think that that is a healthy tension.
Perhaps in the past, there has not been the debate and discussion about
the funding challenges, when there was an automatic RPI increase. It is
important that we maintain the dialogue, but the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport and the Wales Office
Minister—it is a great delight to see the Under-Secretary of
State for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire
(Stephen Crabb) here supporting the debate—will recognise the
feeling among all parties represented in Westminster Hall today that
the future funding of S4C is important, needs to remain in focus and
will not be forgotten.</hs_Para>

British military is a highly efficient, effective and disciplined
force. This debate will examine the military justice system. Serving
and ex-service personnel, military and civilian charities, and
statutory and non-statutory organisations have all expressed to me
their concerns about the system set up to address both complaints and
criminality. I repeatedly asked everyone I met, “Is there a
problem?”, and I was told, “Yes, there is. Keep
digging.” I thank them all for their willingness to share what
at times were distressing stories about the complaints and injustices
that people have faced. It is right and appropriate that the problems
within the armed forces are raised in this House. It is
Parliament’s responsibility to ensure that necessary changes are
supported, promoted and
implemented.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000164">This
will be a wide-ranging debate. I could take 60 minutes of the
90 minutes allowed for the debate just for my speech—I
promise Members that I will not do so—and still not do the
subject justice. I am pleased that the Minister of State, Ministry of
Defence, the right hon. Member for Rayleigh and Wickford (Mr
Francois), will respond to the debate. He has been most generous in
meeting me, along with senior military police officers, to discuss some
of the concerns that I am raising today; I thank him for that. I am
confident that he is also eager to address the problems that I will
outline today, and I am also confident that we will get the
changes that we
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000165">As
I explained to the Minister when we met, my interest in military
justice was sparked by learning of the extent of rape and sexual
assault in the US armed forces. A report found that in the US a female
soldier was more likely to be raped than killed or injured by enemy
fire, in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In the US in 2011, 3,192 service
personnel reported being raped or sexually assaulted. The US Department
of Defence admitted that 80% of victims do not report the crime against
them, and the conviction rate for sexual assault was just
8%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000166">However,
the US is tackling the problem. Having visited numerous US bases
recently, I can report seeing billboard-size posters on the walls of
bases, and every toilet door has a poster and every corridor is covered
in posters, all of which highlight the importance of ending sexual
assault and rape within the US military. In Australia, the Defence
Minister, Stephen Smith, recently issued an apology to all servicemen
and women who had suffered abuse. So Britain is not alone in needing to
tackle this issue. We do not have the same scale of the 
<?notus-xml column=348?>problem as in the US, but we cannot be complacent. For the sake of the
reputation and integrity of our armed forces, the issues raised today
must be addressed.</hs_Para>

inundated by e-mails and letters from people who have been through the
military justice system having their complaints and offences examined.
All of them felt that they did not receive justice and were dealt with
unfairly. Most of them wish to remain anonymous, as they are fearful of
what will happen if they are identified as complainants. Meetings away
from the House to protect the identities of individuals have been
necessary and—well-founded or not—a level of fear exists.
Sadly, for many people the experience has led to mental health
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000168">Cases
have highlighted problems with the conduct of summary hearings and
problems created by the lack of access to an independent employment
tribunal system. Many people accepted the findings of a summary
hearing, which they saw as a hearing into a disciplinary issue, without
realising that they would incur a criminal conviction. Many only
discovered that years later when they left the services and applied for
residency or civilian employment. They accepted the summary hearing and
its findings because the alternative would have been a court
martial.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000169">The

Moon:</Member></B> Mr Dobbin, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is not
suggesting that you answer the question, but I can confirm that someone
guilty of a minor theft would incur a criminal record. Someone
responsible for a disciplinary issue of a minor order, such as failing
to salute, would not. What is sad is that criminal records are seen
differently depending on which part of the United Kingdom they are
recorded in. Someone might get a criminal record for a certain offence
in England and Wales, but not in Scotland. I hope that other Members
will address that issue later, as I will not have time to do so. In the
system, people face bullying when they register complaints.</hs_Para>

Equal Opportunities Commission suspended a formal investigation into
sexual harassment following an agreement with the Ministry of Defence.
Surveys were instituted in 2006, 2007 and 2009 asking servicewomen and

harassment has not gone away. I am told that in the military culture,
sexual harassment is an everyday occurrence. Making a complaint is not
an option because it involves reporting through the chain of command,
which could include the perpetrator or a friend of the perpetrator, and
because the complaint could have consequences for the victim’s
future career. The perpetrator may often be seen as a good soldier who
is not to be lost and who must be protected. I am told that reporting
results in social isolation and ostracism within the unit and is seen
as showing a lack of mettle and an inability to get on with others. The
victims are seen as being at fault: they are the ones who should not
have been drinking or in the room, and apparently they also lack a
sense of humour. In the military, fortunately, at least women cannot be
blamed for wearing high heels and short skirts.</hs_Para>

which sexual harassment is prevalent can be a factor in rape and sexual

personnel, and have received conflicting data. A response to one of my
myriad parliamentary questions stated that 18 rapes were reported
across the three services in 2011. When I asked for a gender breakdown
of those 18 rape victims, the number dropped to four: three female and
one male. In a letter from the Minister for the Armed Forces, the right
hon. Member for South Leicestershire (Mr Robathan), I was informed that
the figures were lower because the original figures included reports by
civilians, which implies that 14 civilians or members of the local

one in November 2012 said that there had been 40. Yet the Army Justice
Board’s item 6, “Allegations of rape and sexual

60 allegations of sexual assault in 2011. In the three years between
2010 and mid-2012, a parliamentary question informed me that there had

fundamental to how our armed forces are organised, with complaints and
reports of criminal acts being passed up the chain to the commanding
officers, who have responsibility for discipline and welfare. The COs
combine the roles of judge, jury, manager, social worker and enforcer
of discipline, and they are in a position of considerable power and

raised or to dispute the figures that she quoted. The one message that
must go out from this Chamber today is that if someone in the armed
forces has been the victim of such behaviour, they must report it. As a

so. We must ensure that people do not lose confidence in their ability

am glad the hon. Lady recognises that our armed forces are highly
professional, and I testify that the training we receive and the
protocols we are taught are extremely politically correct—in
fact, they might be a little over the top for our own

leadership, responsibility and integrity is important. I disagree with
her on the armed forces’ ability to address equality issues with

must recognise that the cases we are discussing are not the norm, and
we must also recognise the good work that has gone on. In her session
before the Defence Committee, Dr Sue Atkins highlighted many examples
of good practice, such as how the Royal Navy addressed the backlog of
complaints that all the services were facing by being extremely
pragmatic, by empowering people lower down the command chain to clear
the general admin cases—issues about pay, terms and conditions,
and so on—and by putting resources into the more serious issues
that the hon. Lady has raised.</hs_Para>

bulk of the cases addressed by the Service Complaints Commissioner are
on things such as pay and admin. I have raised with the Minister many
times the importance of getting that right and the woes of joint
personnel administration. It is important to learn from that and to
note that the lessons and good practice that are going on in one
service are being shared across the other services. There are many
things in the Service Complaints Commissioner’s report that give
us confidence for the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000211">Unfortunately,
things go wrong, particularly in a case I have dealt with: a nasty
assault that I will not detail, although the Minister is aware. I will
highlight a few learnings from that. First, it would be helpful if
serious allegations are immediately picked up centrally. The chap I was
dealing with, after he made his allegation, was placed back in the unit
with the perpetrators of the assault. That is absolutely wrong, and if
allegations were picked up centrally, that would not
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000212">Secondly,
there are clearly complexities in taking statements from individuals.
Someone may be deployed between an incident happening and being
reported, but it is important that we ensure such investigations take
place
swiftly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000213">Thirdly,
there must be support for the individual. From my experience, I praise
the work of the Royal Marines. The chap I was dealing with is from the
Army. He had a placement on light duties with the Royal Marines, which
was not only a way of parking him until things were resolved; there was
proactive work to help him to get his confidence back. That was deeply
impressive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000214">I
also want to highlight support for families. People who have
experienced a traumatic event often leave their unit and their service
accommodation to stay with their parents, who are sometimes elderly.
With the emotions they are going through, such people might be violent
or kicking off a bit, and dealing and coping with that is particularly
hard for older parents. In cases I have seen, the Service Complaints
Commissioner and the Naval Families Federation were wonderful: they got
in touch with the individual, and were able to provide him
with a safe house to go to when things got a bit too
much at
home.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000215">Finally,
we must be aware of how we deliver sometimes bad news to victims of
assaults. If an investigation has not gone their way, or if a panel has
made a decision that might be difficult for them to hear, support for
the commanding officer or the other ranks who may have to deliver that
news is vital. On occasion that is done badly. In the case I was
dealing with, for example, the parents were asked to be the messenger,
which is not
good.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000216">We
must ensure that people are properly supported. Such cases are not the
norm, but they are evidence for why the Service Complaints
Commissioner’s role is incredibly important. Her intervention in
the cases I have dealt with has been extremely useful. She respects the
chain of command, but she points out what is not acceptable. She gives
practical help to the individuals and families involved, and, as an
individual and an office, she can call on a great network of people
across the services. Although this guy was from the Army, the Navy and
the Marines provided
assistance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000217">The
Service Complaints Commissioner is frustrated in acting swiftly and
having basic common sense taken up and acted upon. We must support her
and the role.  
<?notus-xml column=355?>I agree with her call that she should be an ombudsman, which would make
a difference in the small cases where we have difficult issues to
address. She should be allowed to investigate and report on some of
those issues. Given the myriad figures quoted by the hon. Lady,
everyone would benefit from ensuring we have got the facts
right.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000218">Complaints
are seen as an employer-employee dispute. If someone makes a complaint
and then dies, whether it is in service or if they are hit by a bus
when crossing the road, the complaint dies with them. That is deeply
unsatisfactory not only for the family of the victim, but for the
person against whom the accusation has been made. The Service
Complaints Commissioner ought to be involved in the development of the
military covenant, and certainly with its annual
report.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000219">Those

things we would like to see for the Service Complaints Commissioner are
completely compatible with the chain of command. I thank the Minister

we deal with tough stuff such as this, and the general challenge of

as talking the talk, has walked the walk. The Minister is a former
Territorial Army officer for the Royal Anglian Regiment, and his
colleagues have distinguished service careers, too. I think

Bridgend raised important points relating to those involving sexual

replied in detail to an Adjournment debate last year on this case,
expressing confidence in the legal outcome and that, in this case,
there had been no real prospect of a conviction being secured. Again,
this is not the place for anyone to challenge that judgment. Yet I
think that the Minister would accept that, in that case, there were
missed investigative opportunities—admitted by the Service
Prosecuting Authority—unwarranted delays, particularly in the
adequate gathering of evidence and poor communication between various
military authorities, particularly between the SPA and the Royal
Military Police. There was also poor communication between those
authorities and Mr Moore, who was at various stages left in the dark
for months on end about what was happening in the process. I am sure
that other hon. Members will mention other
cases.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000239">The
creation of an ombudsman in response to such problems with process and

everybody in every case that has not gone the way that they would want
it to go—it will not cure all these things, which are sometimes
cultural and sometimes to do with the conduct of individual officers

is what we need here. An ombudsman figure would be independent and
would be perceived as such. I am sure that an ombudsman would not be
able to second guess the legal facts of cases that had become criminal
cases, but would be able to investigate process and the conduct of
military authorities and to suggest redress, as other ombudsman
authorities can. An ombudsman figure would provide a powerful incentive
to have better conduct of such cases and it would at least allow
failings that had occurred to be identified and addressed by Ministers
or the military authorities, even if it could not necessarily bring
about redress in every
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000241">Nobody

Stewart</B> (Beckenham) (Con):</Member> I am not going to talk about
specific cases. I want to talk about the system of military justice,
just to put it on the record. Military justice is superimposed on
civilian law. It is an addition to, not a subtraction from, the civil
law of our land. Military law imposes additional responsibilities on
people 
<?notus-xml column=358?>who are subject to it. Military justice has evolved recently. It has
changed quite a lot—notably in 2006—and was amended in
2011.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000243">Criminal
cases in the Army are investigated by the Special Investigation Branch
of the Royal Military Police, and I understand that there is an SIB
element in the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force as well. The Special
Investigation Branch of all three services deals only with criminal
investigations. The SIB is independent of the military chain of
command. Its investigators report directly to the Director of Service
Prosecutions, who is currently Bruce Houlder, QC. He and not the
military authorities decides whether a serious prosecution should go
ahead. I accept the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon) was talking
about the interface with complaints, but I will talk specifically about
the system—if it works, which it normally does.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13013159000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000244">The system
itself is okay, but it does go wrong, normally because of human beings.
In 2010 Her Majesty’s Crown Prosecution Service inspectorate
reported that the Service Prosecuting Authority was one of the most
successful areas that it had investigated throughout the land. The
military justice system has of course changed—quite
significantly—since I left the Army in the dark ages of 1996
but, in principle, it still consists of three levels. First, normally,
a person charged under military law appears in front of his or her
sub-unit commander—in the Army, for instance, usually a company
commander, normally a major. Those charged have the right to have a
friend or adviser present. They also have the right to opt for court
martial should they so wish. If a sub-unit commander deals with a case
of petty discipline such as insubordination, the accused has the right
to appeal up to 14 days thereafter, against both the verdict
and the
punishment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000245">The
next level is the commanding officer—normally, in the Army a
lieutenant-colonel, in the Navy a commander and in the Royal Air Force
at least a wing commander. Again, the accused has the right to have a
friend or adviser present—they are clearly told about that
right—or they can opt for trial by court martial, if they so
wish.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000246"><B><Member ContinuationText="Martin Horwood" PimsId="4795" UID="13013159000408" xid="820" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000408">Martin
Horwood:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is speaking from great knowledge
and experience, but one of the complications, as in the case of Mr
Moore, my former constituent, is that a civilian is sometimes the

military.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000247"><B><Member ContinuationText="Bob Stewart" PimsId="5537" UID="13013159000409" xid="1011" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000409">Bob

the third level is the possibility of a court martial, which is
obviously for serious cases. Again, accused personnel in such
circumstances have the right to be represented
properly—normally, in courts martial at which I have been
present, by someone quite senior, 
<?notus-xml column=359?>such as a Queen’s counsel. The armed forces insist that things
are done properly, and such people are brought out to wherever the
court martial is taking place. Someone convicted by a court martial has
the right to appeal to the court martial appeal court, which operates
as part of the Court of Appeal and consists of civilian
judges—nothing military. I am trying to point out that the
system includes a largely civilian
component.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000250" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000250">In

the principles of loyalty and authority. Orders are given and orders
must be obeyed. Such factors help us to understand the frame within
which military justice operates, but can they ever be excuses for
denying
justice?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000258">We
have heard much about serious and criminal matters in the
debate but, instead of repeating such points, it might be helpful if I
drew attention to some issues to do with what one might think of as
administrative justice 
<?notus-xml column=360?>and the operation of service complaints. Understanding the culture
surrounding the issue is certainly relevant. I have received reports of
hearings behind closed doors and of superior officers acting as both
prosecution and, effectively, judge. Such matters, if allowed to
happen, make access to a proper appeal process against those decisions
all the more important. Furthermore, if the process is drawn out for as
long as we read about in some cases, such appeals risk being rendered
irrelevant on the ground by the time that they are concluded.</hs_Para>

the proceedings, to restore the faith of service personnel in the

reference to the better understanding of the situation that has come

take to be heard and how, in some cases, appeals have not even been

we ask for independent oversight of such processes, I have read that
some people point to the role of Dr Atkins and say,

many of the concerns have been well aired. I add my support to the
calls for a strengthened institution to provide independent oversight

like the Minister to address the parallels with the Independent Police
Complaints Commission, and to say whether there is a case for
equivalent powers in the oversight of military justice. The confidence
of service personnel in how the system operates is important. We ask an
enormous amount of them, and they go out of their way to protect
others, so it is of great concern when we hear reports of instances,
such as have been well outlined in this debate, of our armed forces
being unable to protect their
own.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000262" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000262">The

Doyle</B> (West Dunbartonshire) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> It is a pleasure,
Mr Dobbin, to serve under your chairmanship today. I congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon) on drawing attention to
the important issues that we are debating. The vast majority of our
armed forces do their job with the utmost professionalism and
commitment, and nothing we say here today should take away from our
gratitude for their service. However, we have a responsibility in this
place to give an accurate reflection of the issues we discuss, and some
people, not necessarily in this Chamber but outside, may want to
suggest that there is no problem. A combination of the statistics and
the stories show that there is a problem, and it needs to be
addressed.</hs_Para>

women need to have confidence in their justice system. They need to
know that if they are wronged against, they will get redress, and if
they wrong someone else, they will be held accountable. The key
principle of the armed forces covenant is that no one serving in the
forces, their families, or veterans should be disadvantaged because of
their service, and there is agreement that the covenant should cover
all aspects of life in the service community. There is a paragraph in
the 2012 covenant report abut the Service Complaints Commissioner, but
the wider and more complex issue of military justice is not covered,
and I hope that that will be on the agenda for the next
report.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000265" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000265">There
is concern that the system is not properly serving the forces. When the
same person in an organisation is responsible for discipline and
justice, there is a real danger that the lines may become blurred. We
must look properly at giving people access to justice outwith the chain
of command. It is not difficult, even for those of us who have never
been in the forces, to see how concerns about career prospects,
promotion, redundancies and relationships with colleagues and senior
officers might get in the way of ensuring that justice is
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000266" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000266"><B><Member ContinuationText="Bob Stewart" PimsId="5537" UID="13013159000414" xid="1011" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000414">Bob
Stewart:</Member></B> I am a little worried about where the hon. Lady

would not help.</hs_Para>

Doyle:</Member></B> With respect, the phrase, “It is not the
military way”, is sometimes part of the problem. I am happy to
repeat what I said: I think we must look at whether there is a need to
give people access to justice outwith the chain of command. As I said,
it is not difficult to see how the lines may become blurred, and we
have heard many examples of that
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000268" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000268">The
figures on sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape are extremely
worrying, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend outlined. Such
actions should not be tolerated in any workplace. I appreciate that the
armed forces are a unique working environment, but that must not be an
excuse for any toleration of such behaviour. Even when complaints are
made, there is concern that they are not treated or taken forward as
they should be. The chain of command is integral to service life and it
is right that there is a distinct service justice system that
recognises the unique nature of service life, but that does not mean
that we should not look at ways to ensure it works as well as possible
and whether it could work
better.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000269" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000269">We
have heard a little about the summary hearings process, which is used
to deal with both discipline issues and minor criminal offences. A
commanding officer handles the whole process from start to finish,
receiving the initial complaint, investigating it, carrying out the
hearing and finally issuing the judgment and punishment. The commanding
officer acts as prosecutor, judge and jury all in one, and we must
seriously consider whether external oversight is
required.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000270" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000270">Nacro,
the crime reduction charity, recently published a report on military
convictions and criminal records. It found inconsistencies in the way
punishments are recorded 
<?notus-xml column=362?>in the hearings system. For example, as the hon. Member for Cheltenham
(Martin Horwood) outlined, if someone has committed a minor offence and
is fined, that is added to their civilian criminal record. However, if
someone has committed a more serious offence and been demoted in rank,
that is not recorded on their criminal record because there is no way
for it to be recorded on the police national computer. In some cases,
it is only after the serving person has left the forces and is trying
to get a job that they find out that that minor fine is preventing them
from getting on with life in civvy street because they now have a
criminal record. Nacro also found inconsistency in the rehabilitation
period, and highlighted that the period for a fine was five years, the
same as for service detention, which is a much more serious punishment,
presumably for a much more serious
offence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000271" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000271">I
understand that there are concerns about the annex 40K form

result that the information is not always recorded on the police

serious issues have been raised today, including the level of sexual
harassment experienced by women in the forces, some serious
cases of assault and rape, concerns that individuals may not feel able
to report incidents, and concerns about whether the system is as open
and transparent as it should be when complaints are
made.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000273" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0001.htm#13013159000273">I
think that all parties agree that the Service Complaints Commissioner
is doing an excellent job, but she and the British Armed Forces
Federation have called for the creation of an ombudsman, and we agree
with that proposal. We also believe that independent oversight of the
military police, similar to the role of the Independent Police
Complaints Commission, should be considered, and I hope the Minister
will explain the Government’s thinking on that. When the Service
Complaints Commissioner was originally set up, it was seen as
controversial. At the time, it was quite a culture change, but it is
now seen as crucial to the process, and we should not be scared about
looking at whether further changes need to be made.</hs_Para>

tragically lost their lives because they felt that the system let them
down. It is not in any way about painting the armed forces, and the
police within the military, in a bad light, but we let down those who
take their responsibilities seriously if we allow wrongs to go
unchallenged, and we run the risk of losing valuable people
if justice is not available and people feel unable to continue in their
jobs.</hs_Para>

Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Mr Mark Francois):</Member></B>
It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr
Dobbin. I start by congratulating the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs
Moon) on securing this important debate. It is testimony to her
determination to raise the profile of the issues under examination
today, and I know that she takes these matters seriously. She kindly
said that I do as well, and I hope that in my 
<?notus-xml column=363?>remarks over the next few minutes, I will be able to
persuade her and the rest of the Chamber that I intend to continue
taking this issue seriously.</hs_Para>

forces can be asked to deploy anywhere in the world, often in unstable
areas. That kind of agility and reach, coupled with the professionalism
that is their hallmark, requires the highest standards of discipline.
In order to enforce those standards, they are subject to a justice
system that, although encompassing the key tenets of the UK criminal
justice system, is, to some extent, separate and distinct from it. That
point was made clearly by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Bob
Stewart), who brings to bear in this debate his personal experience as
the commanding officer of a regular infantry battalion—and a
very good battalion at that.</hs_Para>

that we have in place reflects both the unique role of the armed forces
and the environment in which they live and work. It recognises offences
specific to the armed forces and calls to account those who are found,
after a proper investigation, to have fallen short of the high
standards that we rightfully expect. The Armed Forces Act 2006 drew
together the disciplinary systems of the three services, so that all
service personnel are dealt with under a common system. Acknowledging
that our armed forces train and operate in some countries with legal
systems unlike our own, the service justice system applies a single
code, based on our own criminal laws, transportable anywhere in the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000279" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0002.htm#13013159000279">Separate
from the service justice system, but acting in parallel with it, is the
distinct service complaints process. That has been a matter of
considerable discussion this afternoon, and was raised by my
hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth North (Penny
Mordaunt), the hon. Members for Chippenham (Duncan Hames), for
Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) and for West Dunbartonshire (Gemma Doyle)
as well as the hon. Member for Bridgend. The Service Complaints
Commissioner, Dr Susan Atkins, and her staff act as an independent
starting point for personnel who want to make a complaint but are
concerned about how their chain of command might deal with it. In
addition, they provide independent oversight of how the complaints
system is working and report back to Ministers and Parliament. In cases
of bullying, harassment or discrimination, the MOD is obliged by law to
update the commissioner on progress with allegations that she has
referred to the chain of command for
investigation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000280" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0002.htm#13013159000280">I
have great respect for the role of the commissioner and recognise the
enormous benefits that we have derived from Dr Atkins’s unique,
independent position. I met Dr Atkins before Christmas and will do so
again in March. We are actively engaging with her to determine what
further resources, including staff, we can offer to assist her in
carrying out her important work. One thing that we will discuss in
March is the expected benefits of the changes that we have just made
this month to speed up the administration of the complaints
system—changes that I believe will have a real effect in 2013.
For instance, we are encouraging greater use of informal means of
resolution, and stressing to commanding officers the importance of
getting to grips with complaints early to maintain unit cohesion and,
ultimately, operational effectiveness.</hs_Para>

we have also provided a formalised avenue for the Service Complaints
Commissioner to approach commanding officers directly, so that if she
feels that a 
<?notus-xml column=364?>complaint has not been dealt with with sufficient alacrity, she can now
formally approach the relevant commanding officer and raise that
personally with that CO, in order to allow that to progress. To some
degree—to be as complete as possible—that already
happened in some cases informally, but we wanted to formalise it to
make it clearer that the SCC had that right in just about all cases.
She—and she can be quite a feisty lady, I have to say—can
now go to a CO directly, bang the table and say, “You’ve
not dealt with this in the way you should have done”, or
“You’ve not dealt with it quickly enough.” By that
method, she can accelerate the
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000282" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0002.htm#13013159000282">As
I say, we have just brought in those reforms. They have literally just

to a commanding officer about any complaint. She can use her
discretion. Whether she would want to go to the CO about every single
matter is an issue of balance, and a judgment for the commissioner
herself, but she has the formal right to do so if she wishes. If, for
some reason, a relatively minor complaint has been—to use a
colloquialism—gummed up in the system for some time, she would
have the option to go straight to the CO in the unit and say,
“Do what you can to speed it up, please.” In our
discussions in March, I am hoping to review those matters and take
stock of how the new system has been operating in the first three
months or so. We believe that it will help to speed up the process

Ministry of Defence. When reported, they are dealt with by specially
trained investigators conversant with modern techniques in identifying
offences, evidence gathering, forensics, and crime scene management. To
support victims of such crimes, service police are able to draw on
specialist civilian facilities such as sexual assault referral centres
when they believe that may be appropriate. A number of safeguards are
in place to ensure that investigations are 
<?notus-xml column=365?>handled properly and professionally. Allegations of serious sexual
offences must be reported to the service police, who act independently
of the chain of command, as we have heard, and answer to their service
provost
marshal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000290" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0002.htm#13013159000290">If
sufficient evidence is found to charge an individual with one of those
offences, the case must be referred to the Director of Service
Prosecutions, currently a civilian QC, who carries out his functions
under the general superintendence of the Attorney-General rather than
the Ministry of Defence. He decides whether charges should be brought,
which is a process that mirrors the relationship between the civilian
police and the Crown Prosecution Service. In essence, it is the same
principle.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000291" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0002.htm#13013159000291">In
the United Kingdom, members of the armed forces are subject to both
service and civilian criminal jurisdiction. Broadly—I make the
point broadly—offences that have a civilian context are dealt
with in the civilian jurisdiction. Service police would generally lead
an investigation only if both suspect and victim are serving members of
the armed forces. Servicemen and women are entitled to report offences
either to service or civilian police.</hs_Para>

Lady is aware—we have discussed this at some length, I think it
is fair to say—there is therefore no single, consolidated set of
statistics relating to sexual offences involving members of the armed
forces, and there are considerable practical obstacles to producing
such a comprehensive overall report. Let me give an example of why that
is. A service man or woman who suffered a sexual assault might have
suffered it while on leave in their home town and reported it to their
local, Home Office police force, rather than to the service police,
particularly if the alleged perpetrator was a civilian, not a member of
the armed forces. The point that I am making is that it is difficult,
with the data that we have available, to provide an overall and
comprehensive
report.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000293" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0002.htm#13013159000293">However,
against the background that I have set out, I have been pressing my
Department hard to produce the most accurate information possible. That
work is still in hand. It is complex, and given the seriousness of the
subject, we must be thorough, but the initial trends suggest that
incidents of sexual offences in the armed forces are declining. That
work needs time to mature; it will not be finished tomorrow night. I
therefore say in all seriousness to the hon. Lady, before she beats her
well trodden path to the Table Office, that it would be helpful if she
could allow us to evolve that work. In return, I give her a sincere
assurance that as the work matures, I will write to her to update her
on its progress, and of course, in accordance with convention, I will
then place a copy of that letter in the Library of the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000294" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0002.htm#13013159000294">If
hon. Members consult the annual reports published by the Service
Complaints Commissioner, they will see that the total number of
complaints about sexual harassment has fallen year on year since 2008.
That is reflected in the most recent armed forces continuous attitude
survey, which shows a recent decrease in the number of respondents who
believe that they have been subject to discrimination, harassment or
bullying.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000295" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0002.htm#13013159000295">For
the avoidance of doubt, let me say that of course even one occurrence
is too many, but it is vital that the reputations of the massive
majority of our outstanding 
<?notus-xml column=366?>servicemen and women are not tarnished by the actions of a few. None the
less, my Department will continue to be proactive in raising awareness
of the standards of behaviour that we expect and in tackling offences
across the whole spectrum. I am pleased to report that positive steps
are being taken across the services. I shall choose one example from
each.</hs_Para>

Army’s Speak Out campaign informs Army personnel of the
bullying, harassment and discrimination helpline. The Army has
established that confidential helpline to allow service personnel who
believe that they may be victims of that to report it. The Army also
has a poster campaign that targets sexual offenders and reassures
victims. We have consulted local authorities that are leaders in that
field, and the hon. Member for Bridgend was shown some examples of that
work when she came to visit me in the Ministry of
Defence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000297" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0002.htm#13013159000297">The

to impress on the Department the importance that I attach to this
issue, I have convened a meeting of the provost marshals of the three
single services to discuss how best we can continue to ensure that
these offences are recorded, investigated and then thoroughly pursued.
In essence, I will speak to the head of each of the three service
police forces so that we can discuss this in
detail.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000299" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0002.htm#13013159000299">In
addition, I spoke yesterday on precisely this issue to the principal
personnel officers for the three services: the Second Sea Lord, in the
case of the Royal Navy; the Adjutant-General, in the case of the Army;
and the Air Member for Personnel, in the case of the Royal Air Force.
It is very clear that we are all of the same mind—that this kind
of behaviour is unacceptable and must be challenged head-on. I will be
discussing this issue further with the three principal personnel
officers in the near
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000300" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0002.htm#13013159000300">As
I said at the outset, I believe that the hon. Lady and, I hope, other
hon. Members who have participated in this debate accept that my
Department takes the issues under discussion very seriously. The hon.
Lady should be in no doubt: we are not complacent and we are taking
steps to expose and eradicate behaviour that has no place in an
institution with such an outstanding heritage and
reputation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000301" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0002.htm#13013159000301">The
right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire—sorry, I mean the hon.
Lady; it is only a matter of time—asked whether we had
considered the possibility of empowering a body such as the Independent
Police Complaints Commission, or an equivalent, to take a role in
overseeing the work of the service police. As she may be aware, there
is already a protocol, which has been signed by the three provost
marshals, which says that if one of those police services needs to be
investigated, in the first instance one of the other service police
forces will conduct that investigation, in the way that one civilian
Home Office police force might be asked to investigate another if there
is a serious matter to be looked into. That protocol, as I understand
it, is already in existence and in operation.</hs_Para>

Lady’s question was whether we would go further and ask the IPCC
to have an overall role. That is a slightly complex question, and I
will explain why. Let us say that it was to be given that
responsibility. As I understand it, under current legislation the IPCC
has no remit in Germany, so if, for instance, it was asked to
investigate the work of one of the service police forces there, it
would not, at the moment, have the power to do that. The point I am
making is that it is not an absolutely straightforward choice. However,
I can tell the hon. Lady that work is under way to consider that
possibility. No decisions have yet been taken, but giving the IPCC such
a role is something that we are in the middle of considering at the
moment, although we have not yet reached a conclusion, partly for some
of the reasons that I have just given. I hope that that deals with her
question.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000303" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0002.htm#13013159000303">As
I have said, changes will be made this month—in fact, they have
already been made—to give the Service Complaints Commissioner
better oversight of delays in handling complaints and their
causes. That will also give those who approach her, I hope,
even greater confidence that she can have a positive impact. The single
services have put in place a number of measures both to deter potential
offenders and to encourage victims to speak out. I will get the chance
to judge the impact of that for myself as I talk to our servicemen and
women up and down the country and overseas. In my role as the Minister
for defence personnel, welfare and veterans, I try to travel as much as
I can, practically, to visit our servicemen and women, and that will be
something that I will have my ears open
for.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013159000304" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/halltext/130131h0002.htm#13013159000304">Specifically

highest standards of conduct and operational effectiveness. In return,
whether they are in Aldershot or Afghanistan, they are entitled to a

importance of not deploying individuals back to units where perhaps
perpetrators of offences are still serving. I endorse that call, and I

hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) also called for an

support for victims. One of the things that I have heard repeatedly
from people who felt that they had been victims was that there was no
support in their units from their chain of 
<?notus-xml column=368?>command. If what had happened to them had happened in the civilian
system, they would have received such support. I agree that the

Investigation Branch. It is an excellent branch of the military, but
the problem for many of the victims has been that they never got that
far: their attempts to bring forward their experience as a victim never
reached either the military police or the Special Investigation Branch.
They were squashed earlier in the chain of command by threats and
intimidation and did not take their complaint and experience

landowners to plant more trees where it best suits them and their local
conditions; developing further the voluntary woodland carbon market and

well as the many helpful and constructive comments we have received

When I cancelled the competition for the intercity west coast franchise
last October, I also put on hold the live competitions for three other
rail franchises. Having carefully considered the options for these
three competitions, including the recommendations of the independent
review by Richard Brown, chairman of Eurostar, I have this morning
informed the stock market of my decisions about these three
competitions. I am also today publishing Mr Brown’s advice about
these competitions, having previously redacted it from his report in

sensitivity.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13013127000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/wmstext/130131m0001.htm#13013127000117">In
summary, Mr Brown recommended that the Government should look to
continue the existing competitions for Essex Thameside and for the
combined 
<?notus-xml column=61?>Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise. But in the light of
his wider advice about franchising policy, he also recommended that the
current proposition for the Great Western franchise was not the right
one. I accept those recommendations, and
accordingly:</hs_Para><hs_brevIndent Justify="left" UID="13013127000133" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/wmstext/130131m0001.htm#13013127000133">the
competition for the Essex Thameside franchise will be resumed, with a
revised invitation to tender being issued to the existing short-listed

important issues raised by Mr Brown, for example about capital

delay. The new franchise will have a contract term of 15 years, as

considering changes to A levels, the Secretary of State for Education,
my right hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), and I
have spoken to a number of universities and reflected on the range of
available evidence, including Cambridge University Admissions Research
Working Party study into the effectiveness of the AS level as a
predictor of degree course performance. While the current AS level
qualification may be a useful aid for university admissions, academics
have indicated that the current-A levels do not provide an adequate
preparation for undergraduate degrees. New linear A level
qualifications will benefit students by reducing the burden of
assessment and promoting deeper understanding. Retaining a standalone
AS level qualification will enable students to continue to study a
broad curriculum post-16.</hs_Para>

16 to 19-year-olds in schools and colleges will shift to a “per
student” basis from 2013/14. The funding provision will be based
on an average of 600 teaching hours per academic year for a full-time
programme of study. Institutions should decide what courses to offer to
their students, but on average, this will allow A level students the
opportunity to take three A levels and one AS level or other similar
sized qualification. The Department is currently considering funding
arrangements for larger programmes of study.</hs_Para>

2007 to 2012 are presented in the following table. Gas prices rose
significantly in 2008 as the price of oil reached historically high
levels. Many gas supply contracts in continental Europe are indexed to
oil prices and the interconnectedness of the UK and European gas
markets means the oil price often affects UK wholesale gas
prices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13013163000492" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/text/130131w0001.htm#13013163000492">Following
2008, increased availability of LNG and the global recession resulted
in a significant decrease in the gas prices. This has subsequently been
offset as growth in gas demand (particularly from Asia) has outstripped
new supply leading to increases in gas
prices.</hs_Para><TableWrapper Columns="1" Size="8"><table tabstyle="headft"><tgroup cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="33*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="34*"></colspec><colspec colname="3" colwidth="33*"></colspec><thead><row><entry nameend="3" namest="1" rowsep="1"><hs_TableTitle Justify="centre"><I>UK

response to the findings of the Public Accounts Committee, the
£300 million Capital Fund operates an agreed and governed
savings share formula that incentivizes NHS Supply Chain to negotiate
commercial terms with equipment providers that aggregates NHS trust
demand. This drives maximum NHS savings against historical prices and
terms that individual NHS trusts could achieve for their single
requirements. The majority of the saving is passed onto the NHS trust.

contrary to the public interest to release details of our modelling as
to the additional cost of extending the HS2 purchase and compensation
regime outside the M25 to the area inside the M25. This is because such
details are likely to be misrepresented and to mislead prospective
property buyers about the future value of properties near the HS2

unnecessary property blight.</hs_Para>

Simon Burns:</Member></B> As stated in January 2012, the Government
believes the HS2 network should link to Heathrow and its preferred
option is for this to be built as part of Phase Two. However, the
Government has since established an independent Airports Commission to
recommend options for maintaining the country's status as an
international aviation hub. We have therefore taken the decision to
pause work on the spur to Heathrow until after 2015 when we expect the
Airports Commission to publish its final report.</hs_Para>

comprehensive double taxation agreement with their Brazilian
counterparts on several occasions, most recently in November 2012.
However, owing to important differences in approach between the two
countries, prospects of concluding an agreement that would be of
benefit to UK business appear at the moment to be remote. In their
contacts with the Brazilian Government, Ministers and officials
nevertheless continue to highlight the value of a double taxation
agreement based on the principles set out in the OECD model

Court of Justice ruling that prohibited the use of gender in the
pricing of insurance policies and anticipated that it would have a
largely negative impact on consumers. The Government's Impact
Assessment, published in December 2011 set out our assumption that the
judgment would result in an initial net increase in the cost of
premiums. As the market adjusts, the effect of competition is expected
to help drive premiums down but overall we expect that the market will
stabilise with premiums at a higher level overall than they were
before. Government has been working with industry and the Financial
Services Authority to mitigate as far as possible the negative impacts
of the judgment. We will also continue to work with all relevant
parties to understand the future pricing
impacts.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13013163000126" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/text/130131w0002.htm#13013163000126">LIBOR</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13013163001249" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/text/130131w0002.htm#13013163001249"><B><Member PimsId="3084" UID="13013163001916" xid="188" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130131/text/130131w0002.htm#13013163001916">Clive

breaching its principles for business in regard to their submissions to
LIBOR and EURIBOR. This misconduct includes attempted manipulation. In
some cases those attempts were to lower the final LIBOR rate, and in

The figures given in the table relate to persons for whom these
offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with.
When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is
the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same
disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is
the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>3</Sup>
Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate
and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have
been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the

Reynolds:</Member></B> The Secretary of State is right to say that my
local authority of Tameside is one of the pathfinder areas.
Conversations that I have had with officers from that authority and the
wider public infrastructure show that there is a lot of concern about
the lack of detail and support from the Department of Work and Pensions
with regard to the implementation. Given that this is just a few months
away and is a cause of serious concern, will the Secretary of State
reassure me and people in my local area that the Government are on top
of this and that implementation will take place as
planned?</hs_Para>

that reassurance. We are discussing this at every level with the local

the areas I have mentioned on 29 April, and that will start bringing in
childless couples to claim universal credit, rather than
jobseeker’s allowance. Over that period, once people are
captured into the universal credit system, they will not go back on to
jobseeker’s allowance, so a lot of tax-credit people who fall
unemployed will move on to universal credit. We are in deep discussions
with the
