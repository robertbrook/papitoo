Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, the board of the UK
Statistics Authority accepted the recommendations of the National
Statistician both to produce a new index, to be known as RPIJ, and to
retain the RPI as it is currently constructed. RPIJ is constructed in a
way that meets current international standards whereas RPI was judged
not to meet those standards. Because of this, the designation of the
RPI as a national statistic was removed by the UK Statistics Authority,
following a statutory reassessment which confirmed the finding of the
National Statistician’s consultation that its formulation failed
to meet current international

a little irrelevant? After all, is it not the case that the Office for
National Statistics changed its mind from the original proposition,
based on strong representations from finance, commerce, industry and
savers? In the light of that, will my noble friend make further
suggestions to the UK Statistics Authority that it thinks again and

mathematics or statistics differed according to national boundaries.
The only statistics course I took was in the United States. I should
have thought that international standards—those of Eurostat, the
International Labour Organisation and the IMF—are standards that
the UK should follow without wishing to bring the defence of national
sovereignty or hatred of the European Community into

agree— I am sure he will agree as his background is
similar to my own on this matter—that there is no such thing as
a perfect price index—far from it? Those of us who taught the
subject spent all the time explaining why there is no such thing. Is it
not for the Government to explain what they want to use this particular
index for? Is it to measure the inflation rate, in which case 
<?notus-xml column=1398?>the RPI is not, in my view, the right index and the
GDP deflator is, or is it to measure the cost of living? Even then,
they have to answer the question: whose cost of living? Does the

area of statistics and I am happy to tell the House that there is a
range of different measures of inflation in Britain—the RPI,
RPIJ, RPIX, which excludes mortgage costs, and the RPIY, which excludes
tax changes. Then there are the CPI, CPIH, CPIY and CPICT. I hesitate
to explain all these in detail to the

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:10:13"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, they
should not be unclear. The decision to maintain the RPI was taken
precisely to leave clarity on the various forms in which the RPI is
used as a reference point. I am quite clear from what I have read that
the RPI as measured has an underlying upward bias of currently about
0.9% a year above CPI. That means that the Government end up paying
more for index-linked bonds and elsewhere, which, in the long run, is
against the interests of taxpayers although very much in the interests
of investors and
pensioners<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:10:54"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:10:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Barnett" PimsId="3885" UID="13042455000234" xid="1068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000234">Lord

giving up and steering in the dark if we want to, but trying to assess
as well as we can what is happening in our economy and in the economies
of our partners is a necessary part of the way we have to
operate. We recognise that all measures will be imperfect. The decision
to make changes in the RPI was taken to make it a little less imperfect
than it

over 30 years ago introduced RPIX, is not the most important thing to

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> Digging into this, I am told that one
of the problems is the way in which the RPI was estimated. They changed
the way in which they calculated changes in the pricing of clothing,
which got more and more difficult as discount stores were adopted. That
is why the gap between CPI and RPI has widened in the past four or five
years. That has a substantial knock-on effect for the Government, the
Exchequer and for consumer
prices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:12:33"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:12:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

McFall of Alcluith:</Member></B> My Lords, in order to overcome the
notion of dodgy statistics, the Minister will be aware that Parliament
set up an independent body in the UK Statistics Authority which was
first chaired by Sir Michael Scholar. As a result of that, he and
others have resisted the massaging of statistics by politicians. Is not
the UK Statistics Authority a bulwark to prevent the massaging of
statistics by politicians? Therefore, we must commend the work of the

in this area by the previous Government was to establish the UK
Statistics Authority as an independent body. The decision was
criticised on all sides. Some noble Lords will remember the article in

Howell of Guildford:</Member></B> Did the Minister notice the other day
that Sir Mervyn King, the outgoing Governor of the Bank of England,
said that one of the main contributors to rising RPI and therefore
rising inflation was higher energy taxes? Every time the RPI goes up,
it generates a gigantic increase in public expenditure through indexed
provisions in the public sector. Could he possibly advise his friends
to think again about some of the higher taxes that are being piled onto
our energy costs in industry and in the

right to say that the extent to which tax increases are factored into
the calculation of inflation is one of the problems. If you are not
careful, when inflation is rising, you get into a positive feedback as
mortgage interest rates rise, and that increases the measurement of
inflation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:14:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_24_PT_1/8069A8284F2AC14BEF52B8B1CC7B202BBA49F840" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 April 2013">Wednesday,

My Lords, since 2010 the Government has invested over
£1 billion in measures that will help to improve air quality,
including incentives for low-emission vehicles and sustainable
transport. In London, the mayor is responsible for working towards
national air quality objectives, and we work with him and London
boroughs to improve air quality. Nationally, we support local
authorities to deliver local measures and work with the devolved
Administrations to improve air quality across the United
Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:15:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Government are not being very effective. Will the Minister confirm

4,000, that the number of people who have an early death through poor
air quality is second only to the number who die of smoking, and that
about 17% of the National Health Service budget is used to deal with
the consequences of poor air quality? Are we not dealing with a major

particulate matter the United Kingdom meets both the daily and annual
limit values. A number of member states face infraction proceedings by
the Commission for failing to meet their limit values. The United
Kingdom, like many other member states, faces significant challenges in
meeting the air quality limit values, specifically for nitrogen
dioxide, as I think I mentioned earlier. Significant transport and
other measures have been put in place over many years to reduce the
emissions of air pollutants. Twenty-two out of 27 member states
reported that they exceeded the limits in 2010, and most are unlikely
to achieve full compliance by 2015. The United Kingdom has secured time
extensions for nine zones, with compliance in London not expected until
2025. This is similar to other major cities, including
Paris.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000031"><Member ContinuationText="The Countess of Mar" PimsId="1684" UID="13042455000255" xid="1337" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000255"><B>The

immigration. Given that we are to have an influx of people from
Romania, where the rate of tuberculosis is over seven times what it is

Germany and 36 times what it is in Italy, is it not important that his

with about £5,000 for an ordinary case of TB.</hs_para>

Malta. However, I take his point about migrants from eastern Europe.
Port health regulations give some powers at the port of entry but this

what is open to us once the person is in the UK. Once here, health

February announcement made by my right honourable friend the Home
Secretary. The noble Baroness will know that part of our policy for
improving standards within the police lies with the establishment of a
College of Policing, which is leading a programme of ways to improve
police integrity. It is important 
<?notus-xml column=1406?>that the police generate these standards from within their own
experience. It is not necessary for the Home Office to impose a
standard on the police service. We are great believers that the
integrity of the police force and the capacity for maintaining it lie
within the police service itself. The figures that I have given have
shown exactly

Dear:</Member></B> Noble Lords will perhaps not be surprised when I say
that I view the emerging picture of misconduct and, sometimes,
criminality in police forces with great concern. There are a number of
issues in this matter but one of them has to be attracting of the right
calibre of recruits in the first place, and then accelerating and
developing leadership within the service. Can the Minister reassure the
House that he, too, sees this as a fundamental priority? Can he
reassure your Lordships’ House that when the results of the
recently concluded consultation on leadership and fast-tracking have
been evaluated in the Home Office, the Government will address this
particular issue urgently and with all possible
speed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:37:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000056"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="13042455000280" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000280">Lord
Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> I can give the noble Lord that
assurance. Earlier I referred to the vetting procedure also referred to
by my noble friend Lady Doocey. The key thing is to make sure that you
get the right people into the police in the first place. The vetting
procedure set up by ACPO states that police forces should not recruit
people with convictions, cautions and judicial or any other form of
disposals which may call into question the applicant or their role in
the service. It also states that each case must be judged on its
individual merits; I think that the noble Lord will agree with that.
Where standards have not been met, decisions about what action to take
are for chief constables, based on the circumstances of each case.
Other than in London, those decisions are monitored by the police and
crime
commissioners.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_24_PT_1/D4FB3EA664FE3FC41AED344FC7F0B8C1E7663BDA" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 April 2013">Wednesday,

trying to outline is the means by which we get to making a decision.
Formally, we have to take note of the report. There will then be a vote
on the substantive issue of whether we want a Back-Bench debates
committee. I think that is now clear: two debates and a substantive
vote on whether we go ahead with a Back-Bench debates committee. Once I
have moved that Motion formally, I do not expect further debate
at that point, and I hope that we can move straight to a
decision.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042455000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000066">I
shall now briefly outline the recommendations contained in the fifth
report. From now on, at this stage, I shall deal entirely
and solely with the fifth report. First, on Private Notice Questions,
as the report says, we considered a request by the noble Lord, Lord
Trefgarne, to introduce a right of appeal against the Lord
Speaker’s decision on an application for a Private Notice
Question. We unanimously concluded that the current system
works well and that it would be inappropriate to introduce such a right
of appeal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000067">The
Lord Speaker has a special authority which comes from being the only
officeholder who is elected by an open election of all Members of this
House. That brings with it a unique authority, and we should think very
carefully in trying to abridge that authority by introducing a concept
of appeal against the decisions of the Lord Speaker. We have therefore
decided to recommend no change. From the amendment that he has tabled
to the Motion on the Order Paper, it is clear that the noble Lord, Lord
Trefgarne, is not satisfied with our decision. I am aware that he is,
in particular, concerned about the level of consultation that takes
place prior to the Lord Speaker taking her decision. The fact is that
noble Lords applying for a PNQ already routinely supply covering
letters setting out their reasons for considering that a particular
proposal satisfies the threshold of urgency and importance. Their
letters are considered by the Lord Speaker before she makes her
decision, along with the views of the usual channels and clerks, which
are normally sent to her office by
e-mail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000068">Members
of your Lordships’ House who have been involved in PNQs will
know that a decision on a PNQ takes place within a very tight
timescale. The request is usually put in during early or mid-morning
and the decision is announced before the House sits. With that
tightness of timescale, it is simply not feasible for the Lord Speaker
to clear her diary, possibly at a few minutes’ notice, to meet
those who have submitted PNQs. Therefore, I invite the noble Lord, Lord
Trefgarne, to consider very carefully whether there is any point
referring the matter back to the committee, without any clear
instruction, when our views have been so clearly and unanimously
expressed.</hs_para>

Questions, noble Lords will recall that back in January I sought the
House’s agreement to the committee’s proposal to replace
the current system for tabling Oral Questions, which is based
largely on queuing with a ballot. I think it is fair to say that I was
given a pretty hard time from noble Lords around the House and the
committee was blamed, in particular for a lack of consultation. The
House accordingly 
<?notus-xml column=1409?>agreed an amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord
Grenfell, which referred the issue back to the committee with an
instruction that we report again before Easter. I subsequently wrote to
members of the Procedure Committee to invite them formally to consult
colleagues with a view to bringing forward proposals on which we might
be able to build a
consensus.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000070">As
a result of this consultation, we now have much more evidence which
suggests that there is broad if not universal agreement that we
should encourage participation by a greater number of Members in Oral
Questions; however, there is little consensus on how to achieve this.
In the absence of such consensus, our latest recommendation is a modest
one. We recommend that with effect from the current year Members should
be entitled to table no more than seven Oral Questions in each calendar
year. This will affect only the five or six Members who currently table
most Questions—up to about 10 a year. I hope this small change
will be welcomed across the

Chairman of Committees:</Member></B> I shall touch on the
committee’s other recommendations still more briefly. Noble
Lords will be aware that we have, since the new year, been operating a
trial procedure for the repetition of Answers to House of Commons
Urgent Questions, under which only 10 minutes is allowed for questions
and answers to the Minister. As our report makes clear, this has led on
occasion to Back-Bench time being squeezed and that is not right. We
believe that the fault lies with both Front Benches rather than with
the procedure itself. We have therefore used this report to remind all
noble Lords of the rules on supplementary questions and answers. Again,
brief questions, not speeches, are called for. On this basis, we have
recommended at this stage making the trial procedure permanent, but we
will be keeping a close eye on its operation. If we encounter further
problems, we will undertake to look again at the possibility of
protecting Back-Bench time more formally, but in the first instance it
is a matter of discipline, particularly for the Front Benches. Finally,
we recommend the repeal of three ancient and obsolete Standing Orders.
The report is self-explanatory. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_AmendmentHeading UID="13042455000339" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000339">Amendment

very easily persuaded to withdraw my amendment. I accept the principal
conclusion of the Procedure Committee, which is that there should not
be, in present circumstances in any event, an appeal against the
decisions of the Lord Speaker. However, it is important that it is
understood—I have to confess it was not well understood by
me—that representations can be made to the Lord Speaker when
permission to ask the Question is sought and should normally be made in
writing. It would be nice if the Lord Speaker was willing, in principle
if not in detail, to receive verbal representations for this matter
because, as the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees has said, time is
often very short and it simply might not be possible to write a
suitable letter in the short time available. If he was able say that in
principle the Lord Speaker would be willing to receive verbal
representations, provided her diary was suitably free, that would be of
great assistance to me. I beg to

not pass this without substantial discussion. It really is quite an
outrageous series of suggestions. I go from time to time to schools,
under the guidance of the Lord Speaker and her predecessor, as
part of the Peers in Schools programme to talk about this House
and how effective it is in scrutinising legislation, challenging the
Government and in debates. Over the past year in particular, I have
begun to doubt whether I am actually telling them the truth when I say
that. We are cutting down the time in which we can

give one or two examples before I touch on the precise issues of this

place. We will be proroguing a lot earlier than ever: tomorrow, as I
understand it. Important debates on membership of the European Union

on the Floor of the House. There is 10 minutes for supplementary
questions when Urgent Questions are repeated here. This is not just a
question of the Front Bench. Both the Minister and the Opposition took
up minute after minute, but then other Members spoke at length so there
was insufficient time to ask questions. All that the committee is
suggesting is that we remind Members of what is in the
<I>Companion</I>. We can do that until we are blue, or red, in the
face; we will still not get the message over to people. Why do we have
to limit it to 10 minutes? Do people want to rush home at five
o’clock for their tea? I just do not understand. We should be
here to ask questions, to challenge, to discuss and debate. That is
what we are here for. To limit it to 10 minutes seems totally arbitrary

seven? That seems totally gratuitous. Then, in order to persuade us,
the Chairman of Committees says that it does not matter very much
because it affects only seven Members, and the maximum number of
Questions they ask is 10. If that is the number of Members and

What is so different about Oral Questions that they now have to be

It depends on the subject. Some subjects merit a longer period. I want
to be as helpful as I can, but I believe that whether it is 10, 15 or
20 minutes, an allocation should be given to the Front Bench within
that time. There is a case for saying that Back-Benchers should have
one question and one question alone. When noble Lords go on too long,
it is sometimes because they put more than one supplementary question

is a case for a Front-Bench allocation, especially when it is borne in
mind that the Urgent Question in the Commons is a little
victory—I think that is the way to put it—for the
Opposition. It is their way of being able to put aside the business for
an hour or less to put their special case on an urgent matter to the
House. It is within the gift of the Speaker to grant the Urgent
Question, so even though privately the Executive, through the Chief
Whip, might have said that they do not want that Urgent
Question, the Speaker has granted it. By the time it comes to the House
it might be something that the Opposition have achieved, although it

have an opportunity to question the Leader of the House from time to

through carefully before putting a proposal to the Procedure Committee.
I am not looking for points of order in the way they have them in the

mechanism whereby one can raise issues on the Floor of the House.
Sometimes I feel very frustrated because there are issues that I wish
to raise, which is my duty as Leader of the Opposition, but unless
there is something on the Order Paper that enables me to raise a point,

Laming:</Member></B> My Lords, as a member of the committee, one thing
that has impressed me most from day one is that committee members
recognise fully that the House takes very seriously these matters and
gives very careful consideration to them. I hope that the noble Lord,
Lord Foulkes, might be reassured by the fact that in the time that I
have been on the committee, neither the Chief Whip nor the Leader of
the House has attempted to intimidate any member of the committee.
Indeed, one thing that struck me is the way in which the committee goes
into these matters with great seriousness and in great detail.
Sometimes 
<?notus-xml column=1415?>the degree of detail rather surprises me. We know
that whatever report we bring to the House, it will be very carefully
scrutinised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:09:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000102">When
the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, came before the committee, he had the

Elton:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may briefly detain the House to
pick up one point, as it is the most suitable moment to do so. We have
heard these encouragements to brevity in Questions ever since I can
remember, but the only way of actually doing anything about it is as it
happens. There is then a responsibility for both Front Benches, not
just the government Front Bench, to bring their own side into
compliance with the Standing Orders. That applies to many other
procedures as well. If something goes wrong in a debate and there are
only relatively inexperienced members on the Front Benches, then it
falls to people who have been here for many years to take that
responsibility on themselves, so that the House continues in good
order. I hope that that is
acceptable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:10:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000104"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Empey" PimsId="5912" UID="13042455000300" xid="2122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000300">Lord
Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may briefly raise one very
minor point. It has occurred to me that when we deal with supplementary
Oral Questions, there might be a difficulty for some Members with
mobility issues in getting up quickly enough to actually put a
Question. I do not know what the solution is, but perhaps the Chairman
of Committees and his colleagues would bear it in mind. It frequently
happens that in the area around here it tends to be easier for Members
to get up and get called, whereas some Members who have difficulty
rising in time may find it more

Sewel:</Member></B> It may have been that I was turning half way. If
the noble Lord will forgive me, although I am dealing with his point I
will not actually look at him. He asked whether I could give an
undertaking in principle that the Lord Speaker would see individual
Peers to make oral representations. I am loath to use the words
“in principle” because I fear what they sometimes lead
to, but I think it is highly likely that if the opportunity arises that
might well be possible. But I have to warn noble Lords that the Lord
Speaker’s diary is heavily timetabled—it is virtually
impossible to find the odd gap in it. Given the very short timescale
involved in making these decisions, which are made on the basis of
paper representations, it would often be difficult to find such a gap

for two years. If we had had a limit of seven Questions for the Session

the Back Bench up there howling abuse at me but would be right down in
the front doing it—and rightly so. We have to recognise that a
Session can be a bit flexible, and it would be unfair if it became
longer and people were penalised and unfairly limited. We recognise

background to these two Motions is summarised in the report itself. Two
years ago, the report of the Leader’s Group on working
practices, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, was published.
Among the group’s recommendations was the establishment of what
the group called a Back-Bench business committee—a committee of
Backbenchers whose task it would be to schedule certain types of
Back-Bench debates. As noble Lords will be aware, there has
been a Backbench Business Committee in the House of Commons
since 2010, when it was established following the report of the Wright
committee.</hs_para>

before the meeting of the committee in February, the Leader of the
House, the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Oareford, put a further paper
before the committee, in which he set out, on the one hand, his wish to
improve the opportunities afforded to Back-Benchers to table business
and, on the other, his opposition to a Back-Bench debates committee.
The committee did not reach a decision at its February meeting but,
instead, invited both the supporters of a Back-Bench debates committee

further proposals to our March meeting.</hs_para>

led to a welcome degree of consensus on the desirability of increasing
the range of opportunities for Back-Benchers to table debates.
Essentially we have identified various portions of time which either
already are or could in future be set aside for Back-Bench debates:
first, those Thursdays—one a month from the start of the Session
to the end of December—that are already set aside for Back-Bench
balloted debates; secondly, additional days in Grand
Committee—at least one day for every six sitting weeks in the
Session, or around six in total over a typical Session; and, thirdly,
an additional one-hour slot on Thursdays, which would be allocated from
the start of the Session to the end of January to a topical Question

the current situation by which subjects are chosen for debate in the

debate on government or opposition Motions on Thursdays is made by the
Government or opposition parties, presumably after discussion and

of subject for debate on Cross-Bench days is discussed in the meeting
of the Cross-Benchers. In our group, we often take a vote on the
subjects for which we should use that time. However, the choice of
subjects on Back-Benchers’ days is made by the random process of
a ballot—a lottery. There is no rational process for choosing
subjects that may be of general or topical interest and may make best
use of the expertise available in the House to debate matters of
significant national interest.

It is that such a committee would introduce a new hurdle, in his words,

would have to persuade a committee of their peers of the merits of
their chosen subject. The Government and the
Opposition go through a rational process for selecting subjects for
debate on 
<?notus-xml column=1421?>their days, and so do the Cross-Benchers. The only group that does not
is the Back-Benchers. When the Leader talks of the merits of
Back-Benchers having access to debates without the intermediation of a
committee of their peers, it needs to be remembered that Back-Benchers
are required to go through the formidable but irrational intermediation

Hill of Oareford:</Member></B>
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:39:35"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I am
grateful to the Lord Chairman for his introduction and to the noble
Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, for getting our debate under way. It is
extremely good to see a former Cabinet Secretary, who operated at the
highest levels within Whitehall for many years, not always in the glare
of transparency, openness and accountability, arguing for it so
forcefully this afternoon. Like him, and in response to the point made
earlier by the noble Lord, Lord
Peston<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:38:09"></hs_TimeCode>, I am
very glad that we have this opportunity for the whole House to decide
how it wants to move ahead in organising Back-Bench debates. It is good
that we have a full House today to discuss it, and it will be good to
reach a clear decision later this afternoon as to how we want to
proceed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:38:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

question the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, and other noble
Lords have raised about whether to have a Back-Bench debates committee
or not has been hanging around for some time. As a new Leader, I am
keen that we should answer it then plan accordingly. I do not want to
speak for very long because this is above all a Back-Bench occasion,
but I would quite like to do three simple things, if I may. First, I
will explain the proposals for the new time for debates that I have
made. Secondly, I should like to clear up any misunderstandings that
there might be about how our current arrangements work. Thirdly, I will
set out what I think is the issue of principle on which we all need to
decide today.</hs_para>

about this for my first Procedure Committee meeting, I was struck by
the arguments that have been made in favour of having more topical
debates and, indeed, for creating more opportunities for Back-Bench
members to initiate debates more generally. I thought those arguments
were absolutely right and, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Butler,
said, I am extremely keen to provide opportunities for as many Peers as
possible, especially newer Members or those who are not able to attend
the House as frequently as others, so that as a Chamber we are able to
make the best possible use of the full range of contributions that we
have at our disposal.</hs_para>

could, I came forward with two proposals. One was to create a new,
regular weekly slot for a topical short debate on the Floor of the
House, which I have suggested could also provide a route for getting a
prompt debate on a Select Committee report. This would increase the
number of short debates on the Floor of the House by about half. The
second was to make more use of the Moses Room for short debates,
thereby doubling the number of opportunities for Members to have
debates there. So there would be more time for topical debates,
guaranteed time on the Floor of the House and capacity for twice as
many short debates in Grand Committee.</hs_para>

proposals for additional time for Back-Bench debates were welcomed by
the Procedure Committee and, to be clear, they are not at issue today;
they apply equally to whatever the House decides. I think this was the
point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Grocott. The decision before us
therefore, as the noble Lord, Lord Butler, said, is how we want this
offer of additional time, plus the time that is already set aside for
monthly balloted debates, to be used. Do we want it to be allocated in
future by a Back-Bench debates committee or do we want it to be
allocated broadly along current lines?</hs_para>

about our current arrangements, as I am not sure that they are always
well understood and I think there is a feeling that they are less
transparent than perhaps they are. For short debates, Members are free
to choose any subject that they want: they simply put their Question
down on a waiting list, which is printed in <I>House of Lords
Business</I>, and are taken in turn. For balloted debates, Members pick
their topic and put the Motion into a ballot which is drawn by the
clerks for a particular day. The key feature of these two processes is
that neither the identity of the sponsoring Member nor the particular
topic that they have chosen has any bearing on their prospects of
securing a debate. All entries to the ballot have an equal chance of
being drawn. All entries on the waiting list for short debates are
offered time in the order in which they were tabled, subject only to a
practical constraint that a Minister and shadow Minister must be
available to participate and that Members waiting for their first short
debate of the Session come before those waiting for their
second.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042455000150" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000150">To be
crystal clear on this point, there is no selection by the government
Chief Whip or the usual channels on merit, personality, party, group or
personal profile, or on anything else. This principle—that the
views of individual Peers matter and that they should all have an equal
chance to pursue subjects they care about and get them debated in our
House—is at the heart of how we think of ourselves as a House.
It is particularly important for Members who are less well known or who
are able to attend less often, who might find it harder to persuade a
committee of the merits of the case. Our current approach means that we
end up with debates on a wide range of subjects, from the treatment of
homosexual men in developing countries to the future of
English cathedrals. This allows for the independent-minded, for the
quirky and for the whole range of outlooks and experience on which this
House is able to draw and which, I believe, is its particular
strength.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000151" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000151">I
agree with the point that the noble Lord, Lord Butler, made—I am
sure that other noble Lords will make it later on—in that I do
not take the view that everything in our current arrangements is
perfect and cannot be improved. I take the point, for instance, that
ballots can sometimes produce debates that are undersubscribed. I do
not think that our processes are clear enough to the very Members they
are intended to serve. However, there are practical steps we could take
to mitigate those potential difficulties and which we could discuss in
the Procedure Committee. I hope I have made it clear that I am keen to
do that if that is what the House would

Hill of Oareford:</Member></B> As the Chairman of Committees made clear
earlier, on both proposals some of the precise details of how one can
address these points will need to be worked through. For example, it
would be possible to have criteria around the amount of support that
there was for a particular balloted Motion, such as the number of
people. It is also the case—this is why one would need to work
this through and come back to the House before going nap on it, because
that is also extremely important—that, as the Procedure
Committee knows only too well, every suggestion that might address a
particular problem can give rise to another set of problems. That is
the kind of thing we would need to

at all sure which way I would want to vote. One point that is made by
the sixth report, and which was put forward by the noble Lord, Lord

long-term national importance. The difficulty about the ballot is that
you cannot get those issues in, perhaps at rather short notice, for an
hour’s debate. How would the noble Lord expect that issue to be

criteria, for example on identifying topicality, I shall just go back
one stage. I am very glad to have been able to come up with this new
proposal for guaranteed time, once a week, to deal with a topical issue
on the Floor of the House. I very much accept that we need an
opportunity to do that. One would need to establish some points around
topicality in exactly the same way as a Back-Bench debates committee
will have to come up with a set of criteria within which it would
operate in choosing those debates. I accept that we would need to do
that work; I would need to come back and show the House those

Hill of Oareford:</Member></B> There are a number of different points
there. I certainly used the word quirky—I quite like quirky.
This goes to the heart of the issue of having a rational process. The
noble Lord, Lord Butler, talked persuasively in some ways about wanting
a rational process. That could obviously mean a process 
<?notus-xml column=1425?>that can lead, over time, to confirmation around a
kind of norm. It could lead to a group of people’s sense of what
is rational being superimposed on that of others. On retaining
quirkiness, we are more likely to have quirkiness in balloted debates
and on QSDs more generally if we do not have a sifting process. The
topical slot is a different
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:49:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I have some sympathy with his point of view and I pay tribute to him
for bringing forward some extremely interesting proposals. However, the
House does itself no good service by constantly referring to this

Butler, said. It is a random process. Anyone listening to this debate
would think that there was some estimate of support and merit for the
proposals that come before the House. Can we please get away from this
suggestion that we somehow ballot to see whether there is merit in a
particular suggestion? Even on the quirky issues to which the noble
Lord refers—I have some sympathy, being a quirky sort of
guy—we do not get any opportunity to assess the quirkiness of a

Leader has done in seeking to respond to the pressure for more
Back-Bench debates and time. That is utterly commendable. However, he
is proposing a mechanism whereby we would still have a lottery in which
we chose from topics that were judged to be topical. Who will decide
that topicality question? Clearly, from previous discussions, that
topicality would have to be decided by the clerks, under whatever
guidance the House had given them. That puts them in the invidious
position of making a judgment about whether an issue is topical, and it
would be much better if such judgments were made by the House itself by
the only mechanism that it can—through a properly appointed

are dealt with in precisely that way. As I have said, we would need to
agree in the Procedure Committee, in just the same way as we would if
we end up with a Back-Bench debates committee, the criteria by which
that committee will reach decisions, because the House will want to
know on what basis the judgments that the Back-Bench debates committee
is making are being determined. At an earlier stage, the proposal for
the Back-Bench debates committee was that it would make the
consideration and would not have to give reasons, perfectly properly,
for why it had reached its decisions. Whichever route we go down, we
will have to have a set of criteria within which we operate, so that

its provenance, notably with the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, I assumed
that it would go through your Lordships’ House on the nod. I am

say to the House, and I should have said it before, that I know that
there are a number of people in my party who are in favour of a
Back-Bench debates committee. I also know that there are a number of
members of his party, on the Cross-Benches and in all groups who have
come to me expressing concerns about the idea of a Back-Bench debates

Peston:</Member></B> It is my dear wish, which I think is that of all
noble Lords, that there should not be a party-political element to our

of its merits is definitely the provenance of the committee. A
committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, is not some minor
committee, not one that would not have deliberated fully, but one that
would have come up with the right answer. That is the answer that the
noble Lord, Lord Butler, has presented to your Lordships. I know that I
do not have to repeat what the noble Lord, Lord Butler, has said. I
have no interest in being on this committee. I have better things to

matters to me is that your Lordships should be using these slots for
important debates. We have been reminded that they are pre-determined;
there is no argument about the slots being there. We differ on what we
regard as important. I have been waiting for someone to put forward a
debate on the present crisis in economics, but my guess is that
virtually no one will be interested in debating it. Perhaps that is why
it has not come forward. Why do we not trust our own colleagues to be
on a committee to which they will be elected by the different groups in
the House? Why do we not trust them to come to the right answer in
terms of both fundamentals and topicality? I am reminded of that great
classic work, <I>Microcosmographica Academica</I>, where it is argued,
basically in connection with the universities, that nothing should ever

with the previous speaker, because why should I, as an ordinary
Back-Bencher, not be allowed to challenge the report by the committee
chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, or any other report? I expect
to agree or disagree. Why should a group of Members from the
Back-Benches select certain topics when we know that we all have our
internal prejudices? It would be very difficult for some topics to get
through those prejudices. What procedure would the Leader of the House
put in place to ensure that, if we had this committee, no Member was
open to lobbying by any external group to make sure that Members are
free from any prejudice in the list? It is for those reasons that I
felt that I had to get up to speak to, very unusually, disagree with my

Higgins:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the proposal for a Back-Bench
committee. Indeed, I was one of those who put the suggestion to the
Procedure Committee. I start by paying tribute to the former
Leader of the House for establishing the working group on our working
practices. He was sometimes accused of dragging his feet and not
getting on, but we have made a number of improvements, although a
number remain to be made, of which this is one, and I hope that we can
make progress on it today. Secondly, I express appreciation to the
present Leader of the House for the extra time that he is proposing we
should have for Back-Bench debates, which is very
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000178" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000178">The
noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, asked why we should go along with the
Goodlad report. The answer is very simple: we should or should not go
along with it on the basis of the arguments that were put forward on
this issue. The letter that the noble Lord the Leader of the House has
circulated strongly stresses that we should look at the situation and
read the report of the Procedure Committee. I am sure that we should
read the Procedure Committee report, but the report that we should be
reading on this issue is the Goodlad report. The recommendations in
this regard run to a full page and are supported by a number of
paragraphs arguing in favour of such a committee.</hs_para>

Butler, set forward the case comprehensively. I do not wish to delay
the House for long, but I shall refer to one personal experience of 
<?notus-xml column=1429?>these matters. At the height of the first outbreak
of the eurozone crisis, I sought to obtain a debate on the Floor of the
House. It proved extremely difficult. I tried for week after week on a
matter of major importance; meanwhile ballots were taking place on
issues of relative unimportance. Eventually I managed to secure a
debate in the Moses Room. The Motion was immediately hijacked by the
Opposition, who added a second part to it, which was entirely partisan.
The debate broke up completely in both directions and the real issue of
the eurozone was barely debated. Had we had such a committee at the
beginning of the crisis, we could have had what would have been, as
always in your Lordships’ House, an expert debate. This is not
going to happen with a ballot.</hs_para>

odds on the chance of getting a debate on a major issue as against some
particular enthusiasm are not good. A large number of Members may have
put in for the ballot and the odds are getting worse because there are
more Members. Therefore, the chances of getting relevant, topical,
important debates would be improved if we had someone, and a group of
the kind suggested, who would be effective in bringing that
about.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042455000181" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000181">My
noble friend asked a moment ago how the group would be selected. I am
strongly in favour of its members being elected. That seems to me the
obvious way of proceeding rather than by appointment or any other
method. That should ensure that they are appropriately members of the
committee and can then act in our interests as far as the overall
picture is
concerned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000182" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000182">Reference
has been made to the situation in the House of Commons. Its Members are
enthusiastic about the change that was made to their proceedings.
Matters are never on all fours between one House and the other but I
had the chance last night of speaking to Mr Bernard Jenkin, who
happened to be involved in procedures in the other place and who is
wildly enthusiastic about what has happened there. Perhaps that is
overstating it; I am not sure that one is ever wildly enthusiastic
about such matters. But he has not the slightest doubt that the change
has meant that Back-Benchers have a greater influence on the matters
that are debated and the priority given to them. That is what we ought
to secure by this proposal and I hope very much indeed that we do,
because I am frankly rather puzzled by the position that the
Leader of the House has taken. I do not think that the present
arrangement is working well and we ought to reform
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000183" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000183"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Filkin" PimsId="3237" UID="13042455000336" xid="1220" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000336">Lord
Filkin:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak briefly, because I am sure
that the House wishes to come to a conclusion on this quite rapidly. I
was slightly troubled by the last thing that the noble Lord, Lord
Higgins, said in his excellent speech, as it is almost guaranteed to
ensure that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, will not now vote in
support of the Motion. But you cannot have everything, can
you?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000184" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000184">The
points are as follows. If we adopt the proposal on the Order Paper, we
are much more likely to be able to have timely debates on issues that
the public think are important and we will be seen to be relevant. That
is important; it was one of the fundamental issues that the Goodlad
report affirmed. Secondly, unlike in the 
<?notus-xml column=1430?>Commons, these issues are not divisible. That is
important for our traditions. The Government do not have to fear what
they fear in the Commons—that you have a debate on some
contentious issue leading to a headline story that the Lords voted X or
Y. That would not happen and it is in keeping with our traditions that
it should not. That ought to allow the Government and the coalition
parties who are signatories to the letter to relax a little bit on this
issue. Thirdly, the proposal makes no change to the existing procedure
for QSDs. Those who are beloved of ballots will still be able to go in
for ballots for a number of QSDs; that is going to continue. Finally,
we all know that the Government can ensure that there is a debate on
any issue that they judge to be topical and important whenever they
wish to do so. Back-Benchers ought to be able to do the
same.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000185" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000185"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Brabazon of Tara" PimsId="2250" UID="13042455000337" xid="1088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000337">Lord
Brabazon of Tara:</Member></B> I welcome parts of this report,
particularly paragraph 6, which gives us extra time for QSDs, but I am
not so keen on this idea of a Back-Bench business committee. I know
that it was proposed in the Goodlad report, but not everything in the
Goodlad report was gospel. I well remember bringing the first half
dozen proposals from the Goodlad report to the Floor of the House when
I occupied the position of Chairman of Committees; three of them were
voted straight out. So I am not certain one should use that as an
argument for the goodness of this
suggestion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000186" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000186">I
make the point, as have other noble Lords, that balloted debates are
the only chance that some noble Lords have of getting their subjects
debated. Will this new committee have to give reasons for its
decisions? Would it deliberate in public? How does it intend to fulfil
its remit, in paragraph 10, to “add transparency and
accountability”? I assume that the committee would be set up in
much the same way as are most of the other committees in this House.
Whether it is elected or appointed, it would still have party balance.
Like, I am sure, all committees in this House with party balance, it
would tend to rotate the debate subjects around the various parties. I
am not quite sure why it would operate in a different way from the
existing party debate days, which will
continue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042455000187" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042455000187">I
welcome the proposals in the Leader’s section—option 2 in
the report. I welcome the idea of not rolling over debates from one to
another, so that you hopefully get a slightly lower number of
two-and-a-half-hour balloted debates on the Order Paper at any one
time. I agree that there should be an element of cross-party support
for the particular subject. I make one further suggestion, which is
that the present two and a half hours for each balloted
debate—five hours in total—should not rigidly be divided
at two and a half hours each. If we were to have a situation where
there were more speakers in one debate than in the other, the list
might have to close slightly earlier but one debate might get, say,
three hours and the other only two. I wonder if the Procedure Committee
might look at that proposal.</hs_para>

spelt out, were that the subjects for debate should be varied, timely,
and address issues which are either topical or

part on the power of the Whips to deselect, so the position of the two
Houses in the competition with the Crown for power, which is what this
is all about, are quite different. A Back-Bench committee with command
of some time in the House of Commons is a very large step forward. A
Back-Bench committee here, for the reasons which have just been very
adequately voiced by the noble Earl, is a step backwards, and I hope we

It is a lucky dip. If you want a ballot then you should be supporting a
Back- Bench committee because such a democratically elected
committee, working on democratic principles, would be deciding on what
debates should take place by balloting within the committee. That is
where you get the ballot. So let us not confuse balloting with

these may be esoteric: I do not believe that a properly

Richard:</Member></B> Perhaps I may detain your Lordships for just two
minutes. I am in the very unusual position of agreeing with the noble
Lord, Lord Cormack. It is not something that happens daily in this
House, and it certainly did not happen over reform of your
Lordships’ House. However, I am bound to say that I came to this
debate in a wholly neutral frame of mind. I was not sure whether I
liked the idea or whether I did not. One argument seems to be
absolutely critical, and for me conclusive. When I was Leader of the
Opposition in this House, when I was Leader of the House and indeed
since, it struck me—as I suspect it has struck every other
Leader—that the one great gap in our procedures is that one
cannot raise an urgent issue. It is almost impossible. If one wants to
secure a debate in this House on an issue such as the Arab spring or
North Korea’s nuclear policy, unless the Government are prepared
to give it time, one cannot get it. That is wrong. A parliamentary
assembly ought to have a procedure whereby issues that are clearly
urgent and topical are capable of being discussed. That gap is
partially—only partially—filled by the proposals for this
experiment. For me that is the conclusive argument. It fills a gap in
the procedures of our House that has existed for many years, and we
would then be in a position, like other parliamentary assemblies, to
deal with urgent, topical questions, which at the moment we are
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:27:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042465000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042465000014"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wakeham" PimsId="4483" UID="13042465000592" xid="1480" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042465000592">Lord
Wakeham:</Member></B> I will say a word or two because I was the Leader
of the House when the noble Lord was the Leader of the Opposition. I
listened to my noble friend putting forward a housemaid’s
baby-type argument; we will have a little experiment and it will be all
right. I also listened to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell. I have no
doubt that if he was in charge of all this, it would work very well
whatever the rules because he is that sort of person and he would make
sure that it did. However, I am still worried about the central
proposition that a Back-Bench committee should be able to decide which
Back-Bench topics should be debated. The committee will come under
enormous pressure and a great deal of lobbying. Inevitably it will end
up, in order to keep the peace, taking on the big issues and leaving
some of the smaller issues to one side. That is what worries me. Of
course I accept the argument that we have to have more topical debates,
but I am not sure that a Members’ Back-Bench committee is the
way to do it. I would prefer it if we found another way. Therefore, I

Lady Tyler of Enfield, who cannot be here because she is unwell, I must
at least put the points on which we agree as two of the signatories to
the paper that was referred to. One is the importance of capturing the
public mood, which is another way of saying that there are important
things that we may miss out on debating in a timely manner.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:12:16"></hs_TimeCode>I, for one, do
not want to ignore any chance to increase this House’s standing
with the public. The other point is Back-Bench ownership of debates

self-regulation of the House, as indeed would be the election of the
members of such a
group.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042465000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0001.htm#13042465000017">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:34:32"></hs_TimeCode>
will confine myself to one other point, which concerns the criteria. As
has been said, this concerns a small number of occasions. Whoever takes
the decisions about what is to be debated on these very few occasions,
I understand that for balloted Questions the applicant must convince
the clerks that the subject of a proposed topical Question is indeed
topical. That may be relatively straightforward. However, the other
characteristics—which include quirkiness, for which I have great
enthusiasm— are much harder to deal with. I am sorry we
cannot include the clerks in this debate and hear their views on how
they would deal with that. It would not be a ballot; it would indeed be
a lottery. To those of us who have been involved in the democratic
process, as we all have, a ballot means putting something to the vote.
We are talking about the distinction between the procedure going
through the proposed, and a lottery or chance. I for one hope
that the House will support a trial

stressed repeatedly, this is an experiment. It seems to me that the
success of the experiment depends crucially on the criteria that the
committee will apply, and how it will apply them. That is crucial. What
exactly are the criteria going to be? What weight will be given to each
of them? Will the committee have a remit, for example, to ensure that
all the criteria are met over the period of the experiment, or only
some of them? How many of the separate criteria will have to be met at
any given time? If a topic meets more than one criteria, how will one
topic be favoured over another? What weight will be given to each of
the criteria? All these issues go towards whether this experiment will
be perceived as fair and objective, and as an improvement on
the current process. I very much hope that if this moves forward, as I
hope it will, these questions will be addressed as we make progress on

progress, modernisation and change, but I am not in favour of a
Back-Bench debates committee at this point because it is unnecessary in
view of the Leader’s proposal. In the light of that proposal, a
Back-Bench debates committee would be a huge sledgehammer to crack a
tiny nut. It could easily turn into a bureaucratic and expensive
procedure, if full accountability was desired. One just has to think
about it. Peers tabling subjects for topical QSDs would have to give
reasons in papers or e-mails, and signatures of support would be
sought. Minutes of the committee would have to be prepared; all
conflicts of interest, not just financial, would have to be
declared; and all lobbying, either ignored or debated, would have to be
declared. A clerk would be required, plus an assistant to prepare
papers. The committee would not be cheap and, if there is capacity for
another committee, I would much rather the money was spent

understand the concerns raised by my noble friend Lord Forsyth in
relation to valuing shares. As I have made clear previously,
established practices are in place that cover this. Let me repeat, we
recognise that for private companies there is no traded market which
enables easy valuation of shares. Private company shares are valued for
many different reasons—for example, when someone leaves the
company and wants to sell shares, or following the death of a
shareholder or if the company is to be sold. Practitioners such as
actuaries and accountants undertake this work using standard methods to
reach a valuation. They will consider such things as examining the
company’s performance and financial status as shown in its
accounts for a period up to the date of valuation. They may also
consider future plans of the company, by looking at order books and
analysing future
commitments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042465000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042465000042">If
a private company is considering issuing new shares as part of an
employee shareholder scheme, it will probably be taking advice from its
accountant, who will be able to advise on how best to value the shares
to be issued. In this case, the company will be able to demonstrate how
the valuation has been made to the individual. In addition, I reassure
the House that we will not allow individuals to use this employment
status for tax avoidance.</hs_para>

point is that some of the mischiefs that may be causing concern are

second point that I would like to reiterate is that the Finance Bill,
published on 28 March and currently progressing through the House,
includes a number of stringent anti-avoidance rules. These will 
<?notus-xml column=1445?>prevent those who have a substantial interest in a company from
benefiting from any tax advantages, as they may otherwise use the

are also rules to safeguard against a person exploiting the tax

concerns that highly paid employees in companies that are already well
established may look to take on the maximum share ownership available
in order to reduce their capital gains tax liabilities. However, a

employee shareholder legislation prevents an employee sacrificing
taxable remuneration or employment benefits to take up this status for
the purposes of obtaining a tax advantage. That is because an employee
shareholder is not permitted to give any consideration—which
means forgoing anything—for the shares that they receive. That
will prevent the type of salary sacrifice behaviours that my noble
friend Lord Forsyth and others have rightly described. If necessary,
further provisions to that effect could be considered as part of the

the absence of a requirement for independent advice was a fundamental
defect in Clause 27. Indeed, the absence of such a provision until the
11th hour—in fact, way past the 11th hour—was quite
incomprehensible to many noble Lords. As was painfully clear from our
debate on Monday night, the Government had no answer, and never have
had an answer, to the question of why they are refusing to require
independent advice before an employee signs away employment rights when
Parliament has required independent advice before a compromise
agreement is reached in tribunal proceedings in an individual case
concerning the exercise of employment rights. Because this amendment is
designed to protect the individual who is being invited to sign away
basic employment rights, it is appropriate that the provision should be
comprehensive in the protection it confers. For my part, I am satisfied

employment rights that are lost. It also plainly requires advice on the

Indeed, the amendment is expressly linked to the statement that the

Burnett:</Member></B> I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, particularly for all his efforts in relation to this matter.
Regarding the matters that he listed, I wonder whether he has
considered one further condition that should be added. The valuation of
close company or private company shares is an art, not a science, and
the valuer acting for the shareholder—the outgoing shareholder
perhaps—and the valuer acting for the company may not reach an
agreement on price. Presumably, underlying all this must be a provision
for arbitration in case of disagreement on price, through either an
independent expert or an arbitrator.</hs_para>

Pannick:</Member></B> I would anticipate that when the employee is
given advice, one of the terms and effects of the agreement in relation
to which he will need to be given advice is as to what happens if and
when the shares are to be sold or the company goes into liquidation. No
doubt some advice will have to be given—I doubt in very great
detail—as to what the mechanisms are. In any event, this is, as
I say, a very extensive requirement for legal advice. These are very

employee as regards from whom he or she seeks the legal advice. Given
the complexity of the matters on which advice must be given, I cannot

fourth point I want to emphasise in relation to this extensive

the costs, so the amendment says, even if the employee or prospective
employee decides not to take up the job offer on Clause 27 terms. I
should also be grateful if the Minister would confirm my understanding

remains a deeply unsatisfactory provision, for all the reasons
identified by noble Lords across the House at every stage of the Bill.
The best that can be said for it—the best—is that it is

Division lists confirmed, the Government have achieved by Clause 27 the
quite remarkable feat of persisting with a proposal which is widely
opposed in both coalition parties, as well as on all other sides of the
House. I therefore regret that the Government wish to persist with
Clause 27 but I very much welcome the positive move of this
amendment. I will listen with particular care to the debate
but, for the moment, I beg to
move.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_24_PT_1/E055DADB26064819192B6084467C27AF87A0D3DD" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 April 2013">Wednesday,

Forsyth of Drumlean:</Member></B> My Lords, I pay
tribute to my noble friend Lord Younger and to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. We have had some pretty robust debates around this. We
started with the proposition that it was wrong that someone who was
sent from a jobcentre to take a job but who declined to accept an
employee shareholder contract could be found to be intentionally not
taking work and therefore be subject to sanctions on their benefits.
That was dealt with. On the fundamental point, I do not wish to repeat
the arguments which the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, has made, although I
will observe that it is a relief to me to discover that there is
something that he does not know about and which I do: the drag-along
rights. It strikes me that drag-along rights are quite a good way of
describing the process of this Bill in respect of the
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042473000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042473000002">However,
we have eventually got there, and the most important thing, as the
speech of the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, indicated, is that this can be
an extremely complex and difficult area and that we are making a
fundamental change of principle here in that people can negotiate away
certain employment rights. The need for independent advice is therefore
crucial, and I am delighted by the amendment which my noble friend has
brought before us. I pay tribute to the 
<?notus-xml column=1449?>long-suffering officials in the Treasury and BIS for
the way in which they have produced an amendment that covers the ground
completely. My first instinct when I heard that the Chancellor
had decided to accept our arguments was to rush to the Public Bill
Office to get the draft of it, thinking that it would be full of holes
or weasel words. Actually, it is comprehensive and the Government have
been as good as their word. They deserve credit for that.</hs_para>

of concern was that this would be used by my friends in the British
Venture Capital Association and others as a way of limiting their
capital gains tax on shares which they would otherwise have got, and on
which they would have to pay capital gains tax, by changing their
employment status to that of shareholder employee. The loss of
statutory redundancy pay would not be a major factor in their minds. I
very much welcome what my noble friend said about the determination to
look at this.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Pannick, made the key point that the advice provided
to someone who is considering an employee shareholder contract should
be paid for by the employer but that the tax liability that would
normally arise from that would not apply. I guess that the Finance Bill
currently before the other place will need to be amended. It already
makes provision for the £2,000 of shares not to be subject to
tax and national insurance. I assume that it will be amended to provide

my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was trying
to do with this clause. He was trying to encourage more people to take
stakes in their business and therefore to have an interest in the
success of the business and an understanding of the risks being taken
by it. He was also trying to encourage new emerging businesses, which
may or may not have a future and may or may not have very much cash, to
take on employees who share in the risks of that business.
That is a noble and good intention.
Equally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T18:29:07"></hs_TimeCode>, on the

is the best way forward, we should recognise that this House has done

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> My Lords, I also agree that substantial
concessions have been made, which have been spelt out by the noble
Lord. On the other hand, the basic problem still exists in my mind.
There are already co-partnership schemes through which employees can
have shares and can participate in their companies. However, they can
do so in many instances without surrendering important employment
rights. That is the important thing. Why do you have to surrender
employment rights, which have been in existence for many years and have
been struggled for by previous generations, to participate in a
shareholding scheme? I do not understand that unless this
really is, as I originally believed, one of the moves that the
Government are making, as they do not like employment
rights all that much, to ensure that employment rights are
surrendered without appearing to remove them. Employees can be
persuaded, under these arrangements, to give up employment rights
voluntarily in return for a shareholding scheme.</hs_para>

still feel very unhappy about this. Unions will not be happy about it
either. The basic point here is the surrender of rights in return for
shareholding. I still do not think it is appropriate. Shareholding
schemes can exist without that and do exist in many places. For
those reasons, I express great concern, although I understand
that quite substantial concessions have been made. The core problem, as
far as I can see, is the surrender of employment rights for something
that may be quite worthless when it really comes to
it.</hs_para>

Bilimoria:</Member></B> I appreciate that the Government have made
several concessions in trying their best, as has been explained, to
make sure that this is not compulsory and has not been forced on
people. It is another option to add to the several share option schemes
that already exist. The huge issue, as the noble Baroness has just
said, is why it has to be linked to giving up any employment rights.

debated this, before it went to the other place, I asked the Minister
two questions, which he did not answer. The first was whether the
Government consulted business properly before going ahead with this.
The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said in his closing speech last time, if I
remember correctly, that 160 responses were received when
the Government consulted and only three of them were in favour of this
scheme. I am sorry, but unless I have got something fundamentally
wrong, if you get three out of 160 you do not go ahead with something.

again is disrespectful to this House and to what we have done. I
appreciate that concessions have been made, but I think that the
Government defending it so much is linked to whose idea it is. The
press say that it is the Chancellor’s idea. If it is, I really
question his priorities in trying to push forward something like this

Myners:</Member></B> My Lords, I disagree with one of the comments made
by the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria. I think this will be a very popular
scheme for employees and employers, but in only one small sector of the
economy. This is not about creating employment, business and economic
growth. SMEs and new innovative companies are not going to offer these
schemes, and employers are not going to be attracted by them. When we
last discussed this issue, the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean,
said that he was not sure whether this was being looked at by people
who plan tax avoidance. I assure him that it is being looked at by
those people with alacrity.</hs_para>

piece of legislation proposed by this Government that is most likely to
have unintended consequences. This provision will be implemented
broadly across the investment banking sector. In fact, we will find
employees in the investment banking sector with multiple contracts, and
subsidiaries in new companies formed beneath teams and groups within an
investment bank where they contract themselves to a specific desk or
function. The tax leakage from this proposal will exceed by enormous
multiples any possible benefit to the economy, but presumably at least

general tax avoidance rule is not going to create a new nirvana and

supported it, so I do not think there is a political point here.
However, on this subject we need to be realistic about what will be

of the business expansion schemes that were set up by the then
Government in the late 1980s and early 1990s and targeted at new small
high-tech companies that were looking for investors and considerable
tax benefits to investors and shareholders in those companies. They
progressed reasonably well over the subsequent 
<?notus-xml column=1453?>two or three years, but then the accountants and
lawyers found the loophole that enabled at the very least the
university sector to entirely rebuild its student accommodation using

interesting point to note, which the Chancellor might want to consider

that would signal the death knell of this entire clause. I apologise;
that was going to be my peroration at the end but, given the debate

fine-toothed comb to see where the lacunae were but could not find any.
It is extremely helpful that the clause echoes the compromise agreement
legislation with regard to the necessary independence of the
legal advice that the payment for reasonable advice must come from the

discussion today about the value of shares. I am less concerned about
the value of shares when the shares are first purchased, because we
keep being told that this is for brand new companies when their shares

employee leaves if they have to sell the shares back, or at a point at
which the company might be sold on and an employee may want to disagree
with an arrangement that the company directors have come to with a
prospective buyer. Unfortunately, I absolutely cannot think of a way of
legislating against that. Let us hope that, should that happen, the
increasing value of the shares would be such that the employees found
it beneficial. However, my experience of working with high-tech
companies throughout the 1980s and early 1990s was that the vast
majority of small high-tech companies, which we are told this would be
useful for, never make the sort of glorious gains where capital gains
tax is a real benefit. There may be a very minor benefit, and that is
wonderful, but not for most. The Cambridge silicon technology companies

Christopher:</Member></B> I support the noble Lord, Lord Pannick.
Although they have moved, with this Bill the Government have solved one
problem only to create others. I begin by confirming what my noble
friend Lord Myners said. I was campaigning for an anti-avoidance,
broad-brush approach for 30 years as an official of the Inland Revenue
Staff Federation. I agree with my noble friend Lord Myners that this
will not work. Over those 30 years, Chancellor after Chancellor said
precisely that in relation to the arguments from the union that there
should be such a thing. We will await events to see whether it
happens.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042473000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042473000030">The
only point on which I disagree a little with the noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, is the question of independent advice. The press picked it up
and said that people will be entitled to go to a lawyer but if you go
back to the Employment Rights Act 1996, which is from where this
proposal came, you find a weird list of people who are legitimate to
give advice in the context of the Bill that we are discussing. An
independent adviser can be a qualified lawyer, which is defined in the
terms that you would expect, or an officer or official of a trade union
who is qualified to value companies. The trade union movement has
swarms of people qualified to do that at the
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042473000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042473000031">Then
we come to the issue of reasonable costs. If this is to happen, we must
define “reasonable costs” as probably something that
employers are expecting. If we were talking about going to a lawyer and
this were a different forum, I would say that if lawyers were present,
those who felt they were qualified to do it should put their hands up.
Very few would be qualified. I do not know what it has now but the
Inland Revenue used to have a specialist section in Hinchley Wood to
deal with the valuation of companies. This morning I asked two company
chairmen whether they could tell me what the value of their company was
and the answer was no. They would have to pay qualified people to value
those companies. While it may be initially a case of shares at par,
Lord knows what it would be in two, three, four or five years’
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042473000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042473000032">As for
the advice that is being given, he or she who gives advice has to
confirm that they are adequately insured to ensure that there is
compensation payable if the advice turns out to be wrong. Why on earth
are we debating this? This is a proposition that, prima facie,
employers do not want to lessen on the terms that my noble friend Lord
Myners has expressed. It will be a considerable disservice not just to
working people, because the potential of this is dreadful. I would not 
<?notus-xml column=1455?>need any arguments at all to vote against it on that
basis. It is also a disservice to employers. They will read this as
saying that they have to pay only a few hundred pounds for the
reasonable costs of advice. It will not be that sort of figure. If I
had to do this today, I am not certain where I would go if I went to
the City of London. Fees there are not
cheap.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042473000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042473000033">This is
a little explosion that is set to go off the first time that anybody
gets serious advice. My advice to the TUC would be to say to every
union that has asked: seek and provide them with a list of people who
may be capable of giving advice. We are talking about thousands of
pounds an

King of Bridgwater:</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister ended our
previous discussions on this matter by saying that, depending on the
outcome of the vote and if it went against what he was advising the
House at that time, he would make sure that the strength of feeling
here was conveyed to his colleagues in the Government. I should like to
express my appreciation for his having very precisely discharged that
undertaking. As we know in this House, it is unusual for us to have had
two occasions on which we have declined to agree with the other place.
This has been a difficult exercise for the Minister and at this stage I
congratulate him on the extra safeguards that he has managed to
introduce. I do not disagree with many Members of this House but my
view on this clause is summed up by a phrase that Sir Winston Churchill
once used. He said that he could on this matter confine his enthusiasm
within the bounds of decorum without any difficulty. I certainly feel
that I have made clear my views on
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042473000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042473000035">The
situation is now that we have introduced important safeguards.
Additional safeguards do not make it easier for employers and they
limit the range of businesses to which they might apply. I think that
the clause will have limited application. There is now much protection
against the real danger of this being mishandled by irresponsible
employers. My noble friend Lady Brinton referred to not having met an
employer who is in favour of them. I am not in the least surprised. I
do not think that an existing employer could use this provision. If he
has existing employees with full employment rights, the idea that he
starts introducing a small additional recruitment of people who have
fewer rights seems to me an unreal situation. I see this being applied
now by genuine start-up businesses where the originator trying to start
some new IT company. He might say to his friends and bright colleagues
who are going to join him that he just cannot take on the liabilities
that he might have to face in difficult unfair dismissal cases and
cases of redundancy, and that they should all be in this together.
Those are the only applications where I see that this might
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042473000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042473000036">With
this additional safeguard we have reached a stage when we must
recognise the primacy of the other place. It is very unusual for us to
reject twice in a row. I think that I can remember one occasion earlier
in my time here but I cannot remember our going any further than this.
I would have had to think very hard about that if we had not had such a
comprehensive amendment, which, as my noble friend will recall, is
precisely what  
<?notus-xml column=1456?>I asked that we should introduce. It involved a lot of hard work and I
pay tribute to the officials. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, ably spelt
out that this is a most comprehensive amendment. It covers a wider
range than I expected could be covered. The list of the types of
shareholdings is warning enough of the problem that this issue
contains. In recognising the way in which the Government have respected
the view of this House and responded to the points that we have made, I
say genuinely to your Lordships that we have done our job. We have
introduced additional safeguards. We have challenged the other place
twice. Having limited significantly the damage and introduced very
dubious questions as to whether this clause will amount to much, we
should now ease its

last time that we debated this, my noble friends Lord King and Lord
Deben were saying similar things to me about this proposed piece of
legislation but from the other side of the fence. As I said from the
outset, it is clear that it is applicable only to the sort of
situations that my noble friend Lord King described—to
entrepreneurial situations, start-ups and groups of bright, young,
ambitious people getting together and wanting to keep down the
potential costs of their new enterprise. It would not be suitable, nor
be taken up by large organisations. It would be strange to have some
employees with one sort of equity and others with another sort, and
some with one sort of employment contract and some with another. De
facto, to the extent that it used, it will be in the territory
described.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042473000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042473000039">I
may be naive, but I think the noble Lord, Lord Myners, exaggerates the
scope for tax avoidance. It seems to me that it will be much
smaller-scale, more analogous to the EIS scheme, which has been
extremely successful in generating some £10 billion of risk
capital for small companies and has more than paid for itself tax-wise.
It may be that the noble Lord is a cleverer tax avoider than
me—sorry, he is more knowledgeable than I am—but I do not
think that the sort of structure to which he referred would work. I
would have thought that HMRC would outlaw such things fairly quickly. I
do not quite see how it would work to make individuals huge amounts of

Forsyth of </B><B>Drumlean</B><B>:</B></Member> With all due respect to
my noble friend, the tax provisions within the Bill provide for the
taxable gains on up to £50,000 shares not to apply, so if it
were possible for people who would in the normal course of their
employment receive shares to change their employment status, then
£50,000-worth of shares that they received would no longer be
subject to capital gains tax, which would apply if they had normal
employed status. That is the kind of loophole that I hope my noble
friend and the Treasury will deal with and which would cause a loss of
revenue. While my noble friend and I may think that capital gains tax
is too high, it would clearly discredit the scheme if the only people
using it were people who would otherwise have had to pay tax
in the normal way and who benefited by changing their
employment status. That is the argument that we raised at an earlier
stage, and I am content to take my noble friend’s assurances
that this will be looked at and will not
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T18:53:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

was the point, but if an individual chooses to invest in a fairly
high-risk new venture via an EIS scheme, he does not pay capital gains
tax. If he invests and it does not qualify for that scheme, he does.
Self-evidently, new companies will as far as possible qualify for the
EIS scheme because it gives that incentive to investors. The position
here is not so dramatically different. People may well have equity in
new start-ups that does not qualify for this scheme, but in terms of
the overall package, as we are well aware, they will have to pay income
tax up front, there is a limit to the amount of equity they can have
and it is of cash-flow benefit to the company in terms of the potential
costs that it removes. I do not see it as a vehicle of fancy tax
avoidance. There is a perfectly fair debate about whether it is a good
idea, but I do not believe it is useable as a vehicle for the sort of
tax avoidance that we are trying to get rid

has gone back and got the key concession that this House clearly wished
for when we last discussed this Bill. It would be somewhat churlish of
this House at this stage to push things to the wire. This scheme is not
going to be a huge issue, and its usage will be limited to appropriate
circumstances. There is merit in having a new class of employment

came into the debate at Third Reading on 20 March with a speech in my

voted against this measure. They have done an immense service because I
believed at the time that this should be an opportunity for the strong,
not a fait accompli for the weak. The concessions that they have

forward these comprehensive announcements reflects very well on those

envelope look like Magna Carta. As a result of our deliberations, the
envelope is somewhat more neatly addressed, and for that at least we
should be grateful. I join other noble Lords in paying tribute in
particular to the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, who has pursued the
Government tirelessly on this scheme and, if I may say so, has become
something of the constitutional conscience of the House, with large

safeguards and the Bill is somewhat less objectionable, but the reality
is that this shares-for-rights proposal is still fundamentally flawed
and fundamentally wrong. It is not the details that are wrong; like the
poll tax, the basic idea is wrong. The idea that fundamental employment
rights granted by Parliament to ensure that employees are treated
fairly can or should be traded for shares, let alone shares worth as
little as £2,000, is fundamentally objectionable. We are talking
about basic employment rights which, as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth,
pointed out in our deliberations, have been granted by Governments,
including Conservative Governments, over recent decades: the right to
redundancy pay; the right not to be dismissed unfairly; the right to
request flexible working in order to look after dependants; and the
right to 
<?notus-xml column=1459?>request training. These are basic rights and, as the noble Lord, Lord
Bilimoria, said, there is a fundamental confusion at the heart of this
proposal between employment rights on the one hand and enhancing wider
share ownership on the other. We are all in favour of wider share
ownership. Indeed, the Government commissioned the Nuttall review,
which reported only six months before this proposal came out of the
Chancellor’s bath in favour of a whole set of measures to widen
share ownership. Not one of them was the proposal before your Lordships
this evening and indeed it was not even considered by Nuttall, so
absurd would it have been to the Nuttall
advisers.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13042483000244" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000244">7

we are in a situation now where we have some safeguards, particularly

have fundamental objections to this proposal, and it comes to us as a
revising Chamber with the weakest possible mandate: it was in no
one’s manifesto; it was not in the coalition agreement; it was
not recommended by any independent review of any kind; the majority
which came to us from the Commons was below the Government’s
normal majority; and it has been opposed by business, and so on.

with the safeguards in the Bill, this proposal is still unacceptable,
and not just in principle, as I said a moment ago, but in practice
too—in particular, in respect of the tax status of these shares
and the huge opportunities which this proposal gives for tax avoidance,
as my noble friend Lord Myners stressed. Of course, I understand that
discussions have taken place between those who were opposed at an
earlier stage and the Government, and that a way forward has now been
reached, but the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, can never contain his real
views. He is always commendably frank. His exchange with the noble
Lord, Lord Flight, could not have been more telling. We are now just
hoping that the Government, after we have enacted this legislation,
will deal with the huge potential for tax avoidance which is not just
theoretical but which the independent Office for Budget Responsibility

Anti-Abuse Rule interim advisory panel that drafted the guidance on
anti-abuse for the Treasury, says that the rules in respect of employee
shareholders to prevent tax abuse are weak and likely to be open to
considerable abuse. For example, while it is suggested that an employee
shareholder may not hold more than 25% of the shares in a company and
qualify for this scheme, this would be all too easy to manipulate,
especially in the case of a new company where any share ownership might
be extremely flexible. In addition, given the ingenuity shown by many
lawyers in their structuring of share capital, it would be all too easy
to attribute value of much more than 25% to shares issued to any
employee shareholder if that was desired. Furthermore, when there are
no clear rules laid down on how valuations are to be agreed, and when
these are exceptionally difficult to determine objectively in the case
of small start-up companies whose owners might be tempted to make use
of this arrangement, then the scope for tax avoidance exempting large
swathes of future profits from the sale of SMEs is all too easy to
envisage.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13042483000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000007">That

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> Once again, I thank all noble Lords who
have spoken. I can only reiterate that the Government would like to
give individuals and companies more choice in how they structure their
workforce. That is the aim of the employee shareholder employment
status—to provide this additional choice. It remains correct
that the employee shareholder status will be likely to be taken up
largely by new small companies, which my noble friends Lord Flight and
Lord King acknowledged. A large number of points were raised during the
debate and I would like to address as many as
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000009">The
first was a very important point raised by the noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, and my noble friend Lord Forsyth and concerns the question of
the cost of legal advice to the employee shareholder. I just make it
clear that the issue is whether they are charged in terms of
having a benefit in kind. I can confirm that the Government will
introduce an exemption within the benefits-in-kind legislation to
ensure that the requirement to provide legal advice will not lead to a
tax cost on individuals looking to take up the employee shareholder
status, regardless of whether they choose to take up the status. This
should be addressed in the Finance
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000010">The
second point is a point of clarification and concerns the definition or
description of drag-along and tag-along rights. Perhaps at this stage I
should defer to the superior knowledge of my noble friend Lord Forsyth.
The answer, for the education of the House, is that these rights are
sometimes found in a company’s articles of association
or shareholder agreements. Drag-along rights refer to the rights of a
majority shareholder to require minority shareholders to sell their
shares if the majority shareholder sells theirs on the same terms, and
tag-along rights, which are more active, are the rights of minority
shareholders to procure an offer for their shares on the same terms as
the majority shareholders are selling
theirs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000011">The
noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, in a passionate speech, raised the issue of
consultation. I should like to clarify that we consulted on how to
implement the option, not on whether we should proceed in principle.
Therefore, it is not true to say that no one supported the measure,
although he did not say exactly that. The consultation responses
included some positive responses. As organisations said, businesses of
all sizes might be able to benefit because the changes suit the dynamic
way that their business operates. Therefore, the Government believe
that it is a good additional option for companies and individuals. It
adds to the existing status of employee and worker, which has been much
covered in previous debates, and it provides those taking it up with
the flexibility as well as the opportunity to share the reward and the
risk that comes with having an interest in a growing company. As I have
said in the past, we recognise that not all companies will wish to take
up this new status, and that is fine. What is important is giving those
companies that wish to take on people in this different way the
opportunity to award share
equity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000012">The

noble Lord. However, where a person takes up an employee shareholder
status in a number of companies which are associated with one another,
such as banks and subsidiaries, income tax will be payable on any
shares received from whatever company beyond the first £2,000 in
value. Likewise, any shares beyond the first £50,000 in value
will not enjoy the exemption from capital gains tax. This will prevent
multiple use of the scheme for tax advantages, because the

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> I believe that I have spelt out the
comprehensive and extensive advice that will be on offer to employees.
The noble Lord, Lord Christopher, has brought up the issue of what
can be defined as “reasonable costs”. We
recognise that the cost of legal advice will depend on individual
circumstances. I remind the House that employee shareholder status and
its ramifications will entirely depend on the type of company, type of
employee and the wishes of the employee shareholder. Those discussions
will go on outside any control from government. The costs involved will
vary depending on the type of contract or job offered and the level of
knowledge of the individual seeking that advice. What is reasonable in
one particular instance may not be reasonable in another. Very
deliberately, we are not stipulating a minimum or maximum price which
would come under the definition of “reasonable costs”. It
relates to other areas and sectors in entirely different circumstances.

Lord will be aware, is not an unusual

Lea of Crondall:</Member></B> My Lords, the reason for this Motion is
because there is one point which has been made repeatedly the last four
or five times in which this matter has been discussed in the Lords and
the Commons. It relates to the category of job vacancy which is solely
for employee
shareholders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T19:33:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

versed in industrial relations have been very puzzled by this from the
word go. What is this category of job vacancy which is offered
by employers solely to employee shareholders? The Minister
cannot possibly stick to what he has expressed once or twice that there
is always an option. There is no option in this Bill unless the
guidance is radically
rewritten<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T19:34:24"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T19:34:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000031">On
22 April, the Minister said that the guidance possibly did need
rewriting but that that was not too difficult. I would invite him to do
so but, given the time, perhaps all he needs to do is to acknowledge
that, at the moment, the guidance is not perfect and needs to be
rationalised in the light of much of what has been said in both Houses
of
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T19:35:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000032">Of
course, it is true that employers may want some of these jobs to be for
employee shareholders. However, if they then say that the only jobs
available for that warehouse, or that factory, are employee shareholder
jobs, that is saying that those prospective employees can either have a
job and give up their rights against unfair dismissal or redundancy, or
not have a job at all. That is not offering

Morris of Handsworth:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the Motion in
the name of my noble friend Lord Lea of
Crondall<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T19:37:32"></hs_TimeCode>. My
support is based on two principles which I want to clarify. First, it
is important that the intention of Parliament is clear and my noble
friend’s Motion does that. Secondly, there is the issue of
equality of opportunity in the recruitment
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T19:38:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042483000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000036">Given the extent of the
Government’s effort to secure the passage of this Bill,
employers at every stage of the recruitment process will assume that
having shareholder employees is the preferred option. For the avoidance
of doubt, it is therefore imperative that the legislation is clear and
that what Parliament means is recorded on the face of the Bill. The
Motion does that: it removes any inadvertent preference for shareholder
employees<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T19:38:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000037">My
second point concerns the avoidance of discrimination at the point of
recruitment. Here is a very simple example. A job is advertised by an
employer who is currently operating an employee shareholder scheme. It
is my view that, without this Motion, there is no duty, no guidance to
the employer not to discriminate in favour of a shareholder preferred
option. For those reasons, the legislation can be enhanced by clarity
of purpose in order to protect the employee and also the employer, who
might have to answer questions about the choice that was made at the
point of recruitment. There is no protection in respect of recruiting a
shareholder employee rather than someone else who is equally or better
qualified. I support the
Motion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T19:39:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> I thank the noble
Lords, Lord Morris and Lord Lea, for their interventions. As I made
clear in my opening remarks, we do not believe that the provision in
the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Lea, is necessary. It should be up
to employers to recruit as they see fit. If a company wants
to recruit an employee shareholder, as companies already do with
employees and workers, it should be able to do so in its own way.
Taking the argument further, if an employer wishes to post a notice
for, or advertise, an employee shareholder position, they should be
free to place this as one role, just as they would be able to do in an
advertisement for any other
role<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T19:41:12"></hs_TimeCode>. While the
House has raised concerns on behalf of the individual, and particularly
given the concessions we have made, we must ensure that we do not tie
the hands of employers. The noble Lord’s Motion would
do just that. Therefore, I hope that it will not be supported by the
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T19:41:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000039"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lea of Crondall" PimsId="1443" UID="13042483000720" xid="1309" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000720">Lord
Lea of Crondall:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his reply.
Perhaps I should first mention my thanks to my noble friend Lord Morris
of Handsworth, who some 15 years ago was the chairman of the TUC
working party on rights at work. I recall that this was part of a
hugely successful programme of improving the quality of the contract of
employment in many ways. This is the first time I have seen legislation
that explicitly states that you can have a contract of
employment of less satisfactory quality. That should be a
source of concern. It would have been a source of concern in Whitehall
in the days of the Ministry of Labour. At the moment we have
legislation that is like a dog with three legs. There is input from the
Treasury, Customs and Excise and BIS, but because there is no ministry
of labour, the collective experience of people who know about
recruiting and agreements seems to have been totally
lost<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T19:42:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000040">I
think that our predictions will come true and that the
Government—or the Government in power at the time, because we
are only two years from a general election—will see this
programme staggering on its feet. All the difficulties, from those
raised by my noble friend Lord Myners to those raised in our last
debate by other noble Lords on all sides of the House, will come to
pass. However, in light of the hour and having had a full debate on
this question over many days, I beg leave to withdraw the

B. We return to discussion of the equality provisions of the Enterprise
and Regulatory Reform Bill. The House debated these issues on Monday
and strong views were expressed, on which the Government have reflected
very carefully. On Monday, as on other occasions, the noble Baroness,
Lady Campbell, spoke eloquently and with passion about the importance
of the commission’s general duty. I very much respect the
knowledge that she and others contributed during the passage of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000043">The
Government want the commission to be a strong equality and human rights
body: our national expert whose opinion is respected and valued.
This is what our legislative proposals, alongside our
non-legislative work, are intended to achieve. We recognise that the
general duty is important to many people as a symbolic statement of the
Equality and Human Rights Commission’s overarching purpose.
After the debate 
<?notus-xml column=1471?>and Division in the House on Monday, the Government
reflected further and decided to no longer press for its removal from
the Equality Act 2006. However, as I argued on Monday, the general duty
has a practical effect, as Section 12 of the Equality Act 2006 requires
the commission to monitor and report on society’s progress
against the aims set out in the general duty. We continue to believe
that the commission will be more effective if the monitoring and

that we remain unconvinced that the evidence shows that legislation is
the right way to resolve problems associated with caste prejudice or

amendment that was last debated in this House would have seen caste
directly become an aspect of race for the purposes of the Equality Act

proposed as an amendment in this House in Grand Committee. Under this
amendment in lieu, what is currently a discretionary power in the
Equality Act to add caste to the list of race characteristics will
become a duty on the Secretary of State. This amendment still gives
effect to the need to legislate, while giving us greater flexibility to
pick up the key issue of public consultation, which I believe the House

which were highlighted by the Opposition in the other place and raised
in this House, for example the guidance needed by business or by courts

see that there is a further element in the Motion. We have provided for
the possibility of a review of the exercise of the caste power and any
order made under it. This safeguard is in response to the
various concerns raised by parliamentarians of all parties, here and in
the other place. It looks beyond any immediate need for caste
legislation, and concerns the importance of ensuring that legislation
does not inadvertently embed in British society the concept of caste,
together with those aspects of it that are inappropriate to the modern
world.</hs_para>

opportunity to review the ongoing need for such legislation to remain,
together with a means for its removal should it no longer be considered
appropriate. As I have already said this evening, the Government have
listened carefully. We are committing to legislate after we have
carried out the consultation which this House has recognised to be
necessary, before we exercise the power to make caste an
aspect of race in the Equality Act 2010. We are also putting in place
the option to review that legislation after it has been
enacted. I trust that noble Lords will accept these

the commitment that she has given it. As she said, the vital change has
taken place. The word “may” has been changed to the word

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, as the House is aware, the Government
accepted on Monday the substance of the amendment of the noble Lord,
Lord Eatwell. I said we would make some small, technical changes to
ensure that it works as intended. The government Motion before us makes
all those necessary tweaks, while upholding the principles of the
policy in
full<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T20:05:58"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T20:05:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000086">I
briefly explain the reasons why the tweaks were necessary. The
Government’s redrafted Motion seeks to address some inadvertent
consequences that could arise from accepting the amendment that the
House approved as it stood on Monday. First, the names of the
workforces were not quite right. We have corrected this to ensure they
are consistent with other statutory references to these groups of
public servants. Secondly, there was the potential for confusion about
the role of the Secretary of State for Defence, who is included in the
general term Secretary of State. The noble Lord’s amendment
implied that he would carry out any review of the terms and conditions
of these workforces in conjunction with himself. That has now been
corrected. I suspect that the original wording sought to ensure that
the Treasury and the MoD worked together on the review; I can confirm
that that is the
intention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T20:06:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000087">Finally,
there is the issue of commencement—the timeframe for when the
Motion would come into force. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord
Eatwell, would have started the clock only after the entire Bill came
into force, which would delay the review considerably. Instead, the
Government’s Motion creates a specific deadline linked to the
relevant clause of the Bill, a timescale which has been further
clarified by the Economic Secretary in another place. I am also happy
to confirm to noble Lords that the Government will commence the
relevant sections promptly to ensure that the review takes place
without further delay with a view to concluding and reporting within
eight
months.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000088">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T20:07:38"></hs_TimeCode>

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, one of the main concerns in
our debates on the Health and Social Care Bill was the fear that
clinical commissioning groups would be compelled to put clinical
services out to tender, forcing doctors and nurses to compete with each
other at huge expense and at risk of fragmentation of clinical services
to patients. In response, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, told this House
that commissioners would not have to create markets against the best
interests of patients. He said that they would be free to commission
services in the way they consider best. The regulations we are debating
tonight are concerned with the circumstances in which contracts for the
provision of services to patients within the NHS must be put out to
tender<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T20:11:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000094">When
an NHS commissioner goes to tender for a service, the commissioner is
already required to operate within a framework of EU and domestic law.
These regulations are different from the existing regime in which NHS
commissioners operate. They impose for the first time legal obligations
on NHS commissioners to tender services with NHS trusts. They remove
the discretion that commissioners have to decide when it is in the best
interests of patients to expose the service to a compulsory competitive
tendering process. We are deciding which organisation is best placed to
deliver service. At the moment, commissioners can look at the
needs of the NHS as a whole and make a holistic judgment about who is
best placed to deliver a service. These regulations, in my contention,
make it far more difficult for commissioners to take such a
whole-picture
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T20:12:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000095">Many
NHS organisations, including the BMA, the Royal College of General
Practitioners, and many more, have sounded the alarm about the effect
these regulations will have on the NHS. Your Lordships’ Scrutiny
Committee reported them with substantive criticisms for the special
attention of the House on the grounds that they may imperfectly achieve
their policy objective. Not least of the committee’s concerns
were that because of the withdrawal of the original regulations and
their hasty substitution of these ones, the Government have allowed
insufficient time to enable thorough scrutiny. The committee says that
it cannot be good or effective policy-making to seek their immediate
implementation when they are so widely
misunderstood<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T20:13:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000096">The
Health Minister, Mr Burns, told the other place that it was not the
Government’s intention that the regulations would impose
compulsory competitive tendering requirements on commissioners. But
surely that is what Regulation 5 does. The only circumstance in which a
CCG can avoid a tendering process is if that CCG is satisfied that the
services under the contract are capable of being provided only by a
single provider. The single provider test will never be satisfied apart
perhaps from the case of a single rural hospital which 
<?notus-xml column=1481?>is the only provider for acute services in a large
geographical area. I fail to see how it could operate in cities such as
Birmingham or London because there will always be multiple providers.
Having mentioned Birmingham, I ought to remind the House of my health
interests. Hence, in those circumstances it will not be for
commissioners to decide, as the Minister has assured us. It will surely
be for commissioners to undertake a competitive process in all cases,
unless there is no remote possibility of another capable provider
coming forward. This will be bureaucratic and very
expensive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T20:14:30"></hs_TimeCode>. One
question that I want to put to the Minister is why the Government have
not set a contract value below which the single provider test will not
apply. Why is that not in line with all other procurement
regimes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T20:14:46"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000097">When
we met the noble Earl for a briefing a few weeks ago on the regulations
he gave examples of the circumstances in which services are capable of
being provided only by a single provider. He particularly mentioned the
possibility of bundling services together in a single contract. But,
even in those circumstances, there will often be more than one
provider. I remind the noble Earl that the recently published review of
the economic regulator for the NHS, Monitor, entitled <I>A Fair Playing
Field</I> makes a number of criticisms of bundling. Monitor said that
it restricted the ability of providers to enter the market and that
bundling services together was likely to exclude some providers from
offering services. Monitor is being asked to police the regulations.
The noble Earl will have seen the letter that noble Lords have received
from a number of leading charities which say that the bundling of
services could put them out of reach of the voluntary sector. If that
is the view of the voluntary sector, what of private companies that may
feel similarly

heard Ministers and have read the responses made to people who have
written to them that the regulations simply continue the 2010 guidance
issued by the previous Government. If that is so, and as the Scrutiny
Committee said, if there is no difference in substance to the existing
procurement regime, why are the regulations needed at all? As for the
difference between regulations and guidance, there is all the
difference in the world. The official guidance in 2010 made it clear
that it was ultimately for commissioners to decide when and how to use
the guidance. Quite. Of course, a public body can depart from guidance,
but there is no discretion to depart from these enforceable rules,
however much a clinical commissioning group, or indeed the National
Commissioning Board, might think it would be a good thing in the
interests of patients so to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T20:17:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000099">Under
the guidelines there was no legal right for a disappointed commercial
contractor to sue a clinical commissioning group for damages for
failure to follow guidance, but Section 76 gives a specific right to
seek damages if the rules are broken. There is a genuine fear in the
system among advisers, the clinical commissioning groups and in a lot
of other organisations, that the regulations will create a culture of
defensive contracting when commissioners will go out to tender if there
is any doubt, because a failure to do so will expose them to a possible
damages claim. I refer the 
<?notus-xml column=1482?>noble Earl to the Scrutiny Committee’s

believe that the regulations are part of the Government’s drive
to shift the culture of the NHS from a public service into a public
marketplace. They are at a piece with a number of other developments
that are sending the NHS along the same path. Already we have seen the
creation of clinical commissioning groups where a third of GPs on the
boards of those CCGs have a conflict of interest as a result of
directorships or shares held in private health companies.</hs_para>

want to give on the quite extraordinary intervention of the Competition
Commission into the entirely sensible proposal to merge Poole Hospital
Trust and the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospital Trust on the
grounds that it will reduce competition in Dorset. Is the noble Earl
aware that leading clinicians in those trusts have had to sign an
agreement to restrict their communications with senior clinicians in
the other trusts? What other evidence do noble Lords want that there is
a determination to introduce a competitive market in the health

there is the incredible intervention by the Competition Panel in
Bristol, which ruled that the centralisation of the provision and
management of head and neck services at the University Hospitals
Bristol Foundation Trust and of breast care and neurology at North
Bristol Trust could reduce competitive pressure. Have noble Lords ever
heard such nonsense talked about the health service? Yet NHS
England—and I absolutely endorse its approach—talks about
the need to centralise and reconfigure services, because it knows that
this will lead to better outcomes for patients.</hs_para>

arrangements that we now have means that despite clinical evidence, a
competitive market is being forced upon the NHS. I am oblivious of any
assurances given by Ministers to Parliament. People in the system
believe that a market is required. That is why CCGs will operate
defensively, because of a fear of being brought before the courts if
they do not put out services to competitive tendering. I believe that
we face the prospect of NHS services being placed in the middle of a
costly bidding war with private companies, with discrete services
cherry picked for profit, while the NHS is left to run the more complex
and expensive services with less money. How can that possibly be in the
best interest of patients? It cannot, and we should reject these

ago, I read the original form of these regulations, and we took the
clear view that they would need to be changed. In perfectly good faith,
they had been too restrictively drafted and did not appear to fulfil
the commitment given to noble Lords during the passage of the Health

result of our concerns, my noble friends Lady Jolly, Lady Williams of
Crosby and I met health Ministers on the first day that the House
returned after the February half-term recess to discuss the issue. It
became clear that some of the problems with the regulations were due to
the difficulties of ensuring that the UK abides by European law on
competition and tendering; but that the language used in the
regulations was, in some cases, inaccurate and in others did not
properly reflect the provisions of Section 75 of the Act. Health
Ministers agreed with our view that the regulations’ wording at
the time could lead CCGs and others to the incorrect belief that they
were required to tender for all services. They therefore agreed to work
with some of us to redraft the regulations. The new regulations that
have been published are a result of those
discussions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000107">The

makes it absolutely clear that CCGs cannot be forced by Monitor to go
out to competitive tender. A number of other changes have been made to
clarify how CCGs should decide whether to go out to tender. In
particular, there are changes to paragraph 2 of the regulations. This
sets the overriding objectives of the CCGs when commissioning. The
first and foremost objective
states:</hs_parafo><hs_quotefo UID="13042483000243" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000243">“securing

a result of the changes agreed, paragraph 2 now makes it absolutely
clear that CCGs should consider the benefits that providing services in
an integrated way can have on their quality and efficiency. Bundling of
services is clearly envisaged, indeed encouraged, and the BMA should be
entirely reassured on this 
<?notus-xml column=1484?>point. These objectives in paragraph 2 determine how CCGs exercise their
powers, including those under the much disputed paragraph 5,
which sets out the circumstances in which a contract can be awarded
without a competition. Under paragraph 5, it is expressly provided that
there may be only one provider capable of delivering the kind of
integrated service that the CCG wants to secure for its patients, in
which case commissioners would not be forced to put services out to
tender.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000110">Many
people have expressed their concern that this paragraph of the
regulations would make commissioners tender more services than they do
now, and this is due to the reference to commissioners having to tender
services unless they feel they can be provided by only “one
capable provider”. However, there are many proper and valid
reasons why commissioners might feel services can be provided by only
“one capable provider”. They are, for example, if the
commissioner is satisfied that the local hospital needs to maintain a
certain number and mix of patients to provide a safe and effective
service; if only one provider is able to meet the clinical quality and
safety standards required; where only one provider is capable of giving
access 24 hours a day, seven days a week; where highly specialised care
is involved; and, crucially, where a range of integrated services needs

begin, briefly, with some context in which these draft regulations sit.
Much of the comment and briefing that I and, I suspect, some other
noble Lords have received has an underlying assumption that, somehow,
competition is bad for NHS patients. It would let in what are usually
described as slightly distasteful people called private providers and
should be prevented at almost any cost. Much of that seems to overlook
the legal procurement framework that the NHS operates within now and
within which it operated when I was a Minister some years
ago.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042483000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000122">The NHS
has to operate within the terms of EU competition law, with certain
constraints related to clinical services. NHS bodies operate under a
set of process rules in how they conduct procurements. There are
regulators that patrol the territory of competition with jurisdiction
in relation to the NHS, namely the Office of Fair Trading and Monitor.
That is not new. It is not a nasty invention by the coalition. We can
get all fanciful about it but it has been around for some time. We may
not like it, we may prefer it to be different, but that is the legal
context in which the NHS has had to operate for some
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T20:35:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042483000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0002.htm#13042483000123">I
would argue—this may be rather uncomfortable for some of my
colleagues on these Benches—that this contextual framework makes
any persistent attempt to make NHS providers preferred providers,
irrespective of these legal constraints, profoundly anti-competitive. I
believe that it is vulnerable to successful legal challenge. We got
quite close to that before the 2010
election<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T20:36:23"></hs_TimeCode>. This
set of contexts in which the NHS has to operate means that we have
rather a complex area for NHS commissioners to operate in. They need a
clear set of rules to guide their conduct on procurement and
competition, and that is provided for in Section 75 of the legislation,
which we passed after a great deal of discussion and debate. That is
the context in which these draft regulations are being
prepared.</hs_para>

are also operating in another important context, one in which the NHS
itself faces enormous financial and clinical challenges over the rest
of this decade. It was the Public Accounts Committee under a Labour
chairman that made very clear that virtually every NHS trust was
financially and often clinically unsustainable in its present form.
Change is absolutely inevitable within the NHS, whether we have these
regulations or not. A massive programme of service reconfiguration
awaits the NHS to meet the unavoidable fiscal, demographic and
morbidity challenges it faces. In the past two months, two acute
hospital trusts have gone bust, and in my view another 20 may
be well on the road to the same fate. The idea that we can somehow
solve these problems without an injection of new providers with some
new ideas and some better management techniques is

undertaking that kind of investigation under the legislation on
competition as it stands today. I am not prepared to engage with my

reasonably. I would sooner wait and see what action it takes to
investigate these arrangements, and that is the position that most of

country has built and run a whole nursing home sector because the NHS
turned its back on nursing home provision more than 30 years

have been relevant to today’s needs. Alongside the NHS we have a
market-driven service—and very soon we shall probably be
discussing something called the care and support Bill, which I and a

bad news for some is that within that legislation are some provisions
for market-making, and that is the term that was being used in

no acceptance that the public sector ever fails, and in which and it is
only all those nasty people outside the public sector who do a bad job.
Even where some of these homes have failed, they are failing in a
context—this is a criticism of the Government—where local
authority budgets have been trimmed to a much greater extent than NHS
budgets. It is not a fair comparison blithely to assume that people can
go on funding care in the adult social care sector when they have not
been given the resources to do so. We have a difference, but the point
I am trying to make is that in an area that is analogous to the
healthcare sector there has been a private, independent sector market

the Labour Party. Some may recall that Labour won a third election on

implementing the NHS parts of that manifesto with a policy of
“any willing provider”. Many of the interests opposing

the swashbuckling new Labour days of modest NHS competition, most
PCTs’ contracts were rolled forward each year under that regime

be that there were probably somewhere of the order of 50,000 of those
contracts each year. It would have been totally impracticable and
unnecessary to put many of those out to competitive tender each year,
or even every three years. It will be the same with the 211 clinical
commissioning groups. They will not be able to put out to tender on any
great scale a large number of contracts, and they will be operating

able to act as a kind of Stasi outfit, rounding up clinical

potentially in all aspects of NHS
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T20:50:34"></hs_TimeCode>. Why is
this not being done in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, all of
which are in the European Union and all of which ought, if this is so
compelling, to be under this obligation? Why is it not being done in
Finland, Denmark and other countries? Why was specific provision made
in the European Union for people to exempt publicly provided

that I tried to get from him through a freedom of information request
the advice on which the Government’s legislation was founded,
because I felt that we were not being told the truth behind our
relationship with the European Union. It was very difficult to hold
this debate without knowing the actual legal advice. I hope we will get
that. I do not want go too far into all these issues in this debate,
but underneath it there is a fundamental question. The National Health
Service, as it was conceived, had a substantial element of public
provision within it. There then came the provisions of the internal
market, which I thoroughly supported and have always believed was
necessary. Doctors had to be more conscious of costs. The whole health
service had to be aware that it was making considerable economic
decisions, often involving budgets of millions of pounds. There had to
be a mechanism for cost comparison as a simple measure of good
management.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1304252000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#1304252000004">In

Turnberg:</Member></B> I am delighted to be able to follow the noble
Lord, Lord Owen. He puts his finger on it. It is hard not to think that
we are coming up against some rather polarised views lying behind this
debate about how far we can go with the use of private providers in the
NHS. On the one hand there are those who believe that private providers
will drive up quality and efficiency by the competition that they
introduce, and on the other those who see private providers in it for
the profit that they will make from the
NHS.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304252000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#1304252000012">Clearly I
cannot go into this tonight but I want to say two things. First, we
have an NHS for which everyone pays through tax for the common good and
which distributes resources to those who need it so that society as a
whole can benefit. By opening up the NHS to private companies we are
increasingly using that taxed income to provide for, among other
things, their profits. When we go down that route we have to be sure
that we are getting something that is worth while for society and that
we have the balance right. Secondly, I have the feeling that instead of
the welfare state, to which we are all signed up, being regarded for
the common good, it seems to be increasingly regarded, in some quarters
at least, as a cost to society and an onerous subordinate to economic
policy. This is not a debate for today, although we need to have that
sort of debate. It does, however, colour my views about this
contentious set of regulations.</hs_para>

to the wording of Regulation 5, as we have heard, commissioners are
legally obliged to go out to tender unless they are satisfied that
services can be provided only by a single provider. Despite the
reassurances by the Minister and his colleagues, the wording here is so
unambiguous that a number of distinguished lawyers tell us that there
is no way out of having to tender for everything else. The fact that
the Government’s lawyers are able to come up with a different
conclusion, as I am sure the Minister will tell us, suggests at least
that there is room for confusion and for something that would have to
be tested in the court, and no doubt the courts will pray in aid the EU
competition

concerned about the problems that this tendering process will cause, as
are the many organisations that have written to us. For example, if we
look at where the most severe difficulties lie in the health service
and try to think what tendering from a variety of providers might do to
resolve them, we come up against a major barrier. It is in the care of
the elderly, of those with long-term multiple illnesses and of those
with mental illnesses that we are clearly failing in the NHS. Yet those
are the services that private providers as well as insurers are least
likely to want to take on. They are much more interested in aspects of
care that come in neat packages—short-term items such as
cold-planned surgery or investigation that are readily costed and
charged for. But these are the sorts of care that by and large the NHS
is pretty good at. It is here where the cherries lie and which private
providers will try to pick, leaving longer-term care for the less
glamorous, chronically ill elderly and the mentally ill to the NHS. It
is not a future that many in the NHS are likely to
welcome.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304252000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#1304252000015">This

regulations as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, seeks to do this evening, but
by ensuring that the guidance which the Government intend to provide
removes any ambiguity and removes the dangers to which the noble Lord,
Lord Owen,
referred.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304252000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#1304252000019">The
noble Lord and I have long experience in different contexts of the
difficulty of covering every contingency in the wording of regulations,
of getting the wording of regulations absolutely right and avoiding any
degree of ambiguity. The previous speaker, the noble Lord, Lord
Turnberg, recognised that the Government’s legal advice was such
that the fears that have been expressed simply would not arise if these
regulations were properly interpreted. Monitor, which is to give the
guidance that we await on the way in which these regulations are to be
interpreted and implemented, has a very important role in that respect
and will consult before issuing that guidance. We at Help the Hospices
intend to take full advantage of the opportunity which that
consultation affords to ensure that Monitor gets the guidance right,
removes any ambiguity and ensures that any lingering concerns that we
may have do not turn into
reality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304252000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#1304252000020">It is
true that the changes that are taking place in the National Health
Service in the way in which we provide health services in this country
pose a certain danger to voluntary organisations such as the hospice
movement, but not because the Government intend to do any damage to the
hospice movement, as was made clear to me and some of my colleagues
from Help the Hospices when we had a meeting with the
Secretary of State very recently. The danger lies in the law of
unintended consequences, so it is right that we should be vigilant to
ensure that those unintended consequences do not damage hospices that
do such wonderful work and provide such remarkable care to those who
are near the end of their life and benefit from the care that hospices
provide. I am satisfied that that danger in this context can be averted
by sensible and proper guidance from Monitor, and I hope that at the
end of this debate the Minister will give the House some assurances
about the nature of that guidance which will put to rest any lingering
concerns that might
exist<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T21:08:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_24_PT_1/9E61A2EDF94D57C6242F7063374936953102FD70" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 April 2013">Wednesday,

Walton of Detchant:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak briefly
because I am faced with a major dilemma, not least because of the high
regard in which I hold the two principal protagonists speaking on
opposite sides of this debate. In this bout of unarmed combat, we have
in the red corner the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of King’s Heath, a
former chief executive the National Association of Health Authorities
and more recently director of a foundation trust, whose contributions
to health matters in this House have been in every way outstanding. In
the other corner we have the noble Earl, Lord Howe, who, without a
scientific background or training, has demonstrated in opposition and
in government a most extraordinary breadth of knowledge, interest and
capability, invariably tackling issues relevant to health with
courtesy, knowledge and authority.</hs_para>

have received a veritable torrent of correspondence from organisations
and individuals, many of whom I respect and know personally. These
organisations include at least three royal colleges and the BMA, of
which I have the honour to be a past president. Almost all of these
letters have suggested that these regulations would result in
compelling commissioners to put all health service activity out to
tender—in other words, they would result, as has been suggested,
in the ultimate privatisation of the entire National Health Service.
Having studied these regulations with great care, I find it
exceptionally difficult to see how they could conceivably come to that
conclusion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304252000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#1304252000023">I
am a firm believer in and supporter of the NHS, in which I am proud to
have spent the greater part of my professional life. If I felt that
that case had been made and if I felt that the regulations would result
in privatisation of the NHS, I would unhesitatingly vote for
their annulment. But having studied the regulations, I do not believe
that that is the case. I have never made any secret of the fact that I
believe that a component of contribution by the private sector in the
NHS, properly considered, controlled and approved by Monitor, can make
a very important contribution to healthcare if it is in the interest of
patients. I am satisfied from the debates we had during the passage of
the Health and Social Care Act that there is an obligation on any
private provider contributing to NHS services to maintain, approve and
provide all the facilities that the NHS already provides for education
and training of healthcare professionals and contributing to research.
I am satisfied that that remains the case. Paragraph 7.5 of the

Williams of Crosby:</Member></B> My Lords, it is for me a great
privilege to follow the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant He made an
astonishingly wise and helpful contribution to debates in this House on
the Health and Social Care Act. I found myself in exactly the same
position as he was in. I have a total commitment to the National Health
Service. That has not changed 
<?notus-xml column=1496?>in any way. In my whole life none of my family has
ever used any other medical service. But I cannot find in the most
careful reading of the regulations and our long debate on these two
sets of regulations anything that bears out the widely spread
view—extensively spread by the social networks—that this
is all about bringing to an end the National Health Service as a public
service and introducing overall
privatisation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304252000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#1304252000027">I
will quickly say three things. First, the Liberals Democrats intervened
immediately when we saw the first set of regulations, laid on 11
February and promulgated in the House on 13 February. We did not like
them at all. The day that the House came back, my noble friends Lady
Jolly and Lord Clement-Jones were at the Minister’s door, asking
him to see us that same day. Although there were widespread press
discussions about how the campaigners and the Opposition had
essentially stopped the regulations, it was not true. At the
end of that discussion on 25 February, the day that the House
came back, the Minister had listened closely to everything that we had
to say and agreed at the end that the regulations could be
misunderstood, and that there was therefore a strong case for looking
again at making them
clearer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T21:15:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T21:15:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

learnt in the debates in this House to trust the noble Earl, Lord Howe.
One of the sad things about all these debates is the way in which the
idea of trust has been kicked about and almost lost in the discussions.
On this occasion, we trusted the noble Earl, and promised that we would
not publicise in any way the fact that the regulations were being
withdrawn after our intervention. That is the truth of the matter. It
is no good the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, shaking his head: I was there,
first hand, from the beginning to the end of what I am talking about. I
am not referring to any other sources; I am talking about my own
personal experience, and that of my noble friends Lady Jolly and Lord
Clement-Jones. I am not trying to spin anything at

discussion, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, agreed to two things which have
gone into the new regulations, both of them referred to by the noble
Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant. The first was that there should be an
additional demand upon Monitor, which will oversee the whole vision and
the setting out of contracts. It replaces, as some people remember, the
famous co-operation and competition regulations under the previous
Labour Government. In exactly the same way, Monitor will be a regulator
of the giving out and oversight of contracts in the same way that the
CCP was before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T21:17:08"></hs_TimeCode>.
The additional demand that we placed upon Monitor was that everything
that it did must ultimately be in the interests of patients. That
cannot be something that encourages privatisation. It must make it much
more difficult, meeting a whole new set of
requirements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T21:17:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

happened was that we agreed, within the structure, what would happen if
there was a bundling of services
together<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T21:17:35"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
crucial to say that some of the charities objected to bundling, but if
you want a single provider to cover an integrated set of services there
is a strong case for bundling. I simply raise the question of whether
bundling cannot be 
<?notus-xml column=1497?>something which charities are brought into and
involved in. There is nothing in the legislation to say that they
cannot be. A great deal suggests that that would be a very rich way

much of this was conducted against the background of a total
blaze—a kind of blizzard—of strangely distorted
information. I got a bit fed up with being constantly described as
either a turncoat or a traitor. I did not respond in kind, and I notice
that the Minister and my colleagues have not responded in kind, either.

thing. The new Minister of State at the Department of Health, Norman
Lamb is, again, a man widely known to be deeply committed to the
National Health Service. He went out of his way when the new
regulations were laid to invite the leaders of 38 Degrees to meet in
his office, so that he could talk openly and discuss with them and to
say, what is more, that he would be happy to consider and consult with
them about the guidance to which the noble Lord, Lord Walton of
Detchant, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, have both referred, before the
department went firm on what it would be. Norman Lamb listened to what
they had to say for many hours and replied in detail, and discussed
with them what might be done. I have to tell the House that, to my
great disappointment, not a single word of the Minister’s reply
to the positions laid out by 38 Degrees has appeared on its website or
anywhere else. It is against this extraordinary background of deeply
distorted information that we have to operate, and I find it, if I may
say so, deeply disturbing and

public services throughout this country we have to ask the question put
by my noble friend Lord Owen about whether we can change the very
strong binding effects of procurement law and competition law. They are

memorable debate on this important subject, and that is not a bad
thing. It is striking that the House should be so full on this
occasion, because the NHS is very close to all our hearts and to the
hearts of the whole of this country. We had a very powerful speech by
the noble Lord, Lord Owen, and against that we have had attempts by a
spokesman on behalf of the coalition, and by the noble Lord, Lord
Walton, to whom we always listen with great respect on these occasions,
trying to reassure us that things are not quite as alarming as they
appear to be—not quite as alarming as the BMA, which the noble

we accept those blandishments and reassurances, we need at least four
very specific assurances from the Government tonight. One is on the
matter very well raised by my noble friend Lord Hunt. Clause 5 is
extremely weak in providing any protection against the absoluteness of
the requirement for CCGs to go out to tender. It simply says that they
do not have to do so if in fact there is no other party able to provide
the relevant service. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, very clearly
said—and he is absolutely right—in a large urban area
such as London or the West Midlands, there will always, or almost
always, be somebody else who is technically capable of delivering the
service, so that is extremely weak protection. I am not very reassured
by what the noble Lord, Lord Walton, said on that subject. It is no use
saying “We’ve got guidance”. We are now passing
the law, and guidance cannot override the law. What is more, when we
have changed the law you can be absolutely certain that an awful lot of
lawyers and some very aggressive companies will be waiting to use this

regulations completely and simply voting them down tonight. That is my

over the future of networks. I was lobbied over the weekend by
one or two doctors in Lincolnshire and I undertook to speak
about this matter. One of them served as a junior doctor in Newcastle
under the noble Lord, Lord Walton, and was full of affectionate and
very admiring memories of the way in which he ran his department.
Nevertheless, those doctors are deeply concerned—as are so many
across the country—about the impact on networks. We have all
read the handouts and papers from the BMA on this subject. I notice
from the way in which the regulations are drafted that the protections
regarding networks and integration in Regulations 2 and 3(4) in no way
override the requirement in Regulation 5 to go for tendering. That is
not a sufficient protection. They simply say that there is one
criterion, and that is not good enough. If the Government want us to
take these regulations seriously, I expect them to provide some
specific reassurances on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T21:25:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304252000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#1304252000045">My
third concern is this. We all know that the ratio of fixed to variable
costs in healthcare is extremely high. To use a technical term, the
operational gearing of healthcare, particularly in the secondary
sector, is very high. That means that if you take out any
particular activity from a general hospital, the existing
overheads will then fall on a reduced range of activities and therefore
a reduced range of revenues. So you will make unviable—or are
likely to make both financially and possibly technically
unviable—other services which are being delivered in that

final concern is one on which, again, I should like a specific
reassurance from the Government—it can be in a yes or no form.
We live in an international digital age. We know that medical services,
even remote surgery, can be provided not merely here but anywhere
around the world. If electromagnetic waves travel at speed c, that
merely means that you have something like a 20th of a second delay if
you are operating from India. A 20th of a second may not be crucial to
that operation in terms of security.</hs_para>

we may well face the possibility of tendering out services all around
the world. It may be that a CCG will quite legitimately decide that the
Massachusetts General Hospital is the best place to go for a particular
type of surgery. That is fine but, again, if a CCG decides—or,
more likely, if the national Commissioning Board decides—that it
is in the interests of this country 
<?notus-xml column=1500?>to keep a capability here, will it be protected in

Hollins:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin my comments by reminding the
House that I am the current president of the BMA and a psychiatrist.
The matter we are discussing this evening has been one of the most
controversial aspects of implementation of the Health and Social Care
Act. We are in a rather unusual situation, debating regulations that
have already been subject to revision, following widespread concern
about their intent and the strength or otherwise of ministerial
assurances. This is remarkable. However, the opportunity has been
afforded to us tonight to rehearse the issues once again and to
ascertain why there is continued unease about these regulations. It is
worrying that these concerns have not abated, despite repeated
assurances from the Government during the passage of a Bill that we
spent so many hours debating and further assurances received since the
regulations were laid earlier this
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304252000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#1304252000051">The
regulations are intended to ensure good procurement practice, as
required by the 2006 EU directive and subsequent case law. They are
substantially the same as those that were in place prior to the 2012
Act, which had the status of declaratory guidance and should have been
enforceable in the courts. Will the Minister tell us how many legal
challenges have been made since 2006 and how many organisations have
deferred court action pending Monitor’s new powers? Will he also
confirm that in future Monitor will provide regular reports on the
scale of legal challenges and on their outcomes? The new regulations
have the effect of binding the new clinical commissioning groups into
the existing legal framework. This reminds us that the NHS of 2006 was
a rather different organisation from today’s NHS, which is
evolving rapidly after the radical changes of the Health and Social
Care Act

regulations touch on the very sensitive question of what role
competition should play in the NHS. This issue was debated at length
last year. Noble Lords will recall the debate about the way in which
aspirations for better integration of services might be threatened by
excessive competition. The big question for today is how far the Act
has further opened up the NHS to competition. I suspect that this is
why there is such 
<?notus-xml column=1501?>strong feeling and concern. As a psychiatrist, I
have already seen the effects of competition in mental health
services—and it has not always been to good effect. We should
remember that Winterbourne View was a private hospital providing part

Minister explained to me yesterday that the effect of annulling and not
replacing the regulations would be that a firewall provided by Monitor
between the NHS and the courts would be removed, leaving commissioners
more vulnerable to legal challenge. If there were no regulations,
Monitor would carry out its functions in accordance with primary
legislation but with no further restrictions on its powers. The noble
Earl further assured me that the guiding principle is to commission in
the interests of patients and on quality, and that Monitor will not be
able to force a commissioner to put a service out to tender or to
unbundle a clinical pathway, although it could

guidance for commissioners on procurement and competition will add
important detail on what will be expected of commissioners and on how

there is confusion over what is expected of commissioners around
tendering and the circumstances in which commissioners would be able to
award a contract without using competition. Will the Minister tell the

opportunities to NHS staff. I am also involved with a number of
charities and voluntary organisations. I think that the Health and

The NHS is no stranger to competition or how to handle it. Would-be
doctors compete for medical schools. Qualified doctors compete for the
very best jobs within the NHS. NHS hospitals compete with private
practice for consultants’ time, and they also compete with
non-healthcare employers to retain nurses. GPs have partly competed for
NHS patients since 1948, and so have hospitals since 1991. Companies
compete to provide the NHS with new medicines and diagnostics, NHS
researchers compete for grants, and the NHS competes with schools,
prisons and the armed forces for public funding. So I make the point

There is something different about competition when profit is one of

others whose commitment is public service. That is what concerns

my noble friend the Minister who, without hesitation, saw the flaws and
had them redrafted. The regulations now encompass transparency and
proper accountability, fairness, value for money, integration,
anti-competitive behaviour, patient choice and a whole section on
potential conflicts of interest. They ensure a proper role for Monitor,
which obviates the need to have matters resolved in expensive and very
tardy courts of law and they make it quite clear that integration

produced integration. When I have said to the health service,
“Why didn’t you produce the integration?”, I am
told, “Well, we haven’t got the time to do it. We
haven’t got the resources”, or whatever. It is not all

want to mention briefly the concerns expressed about Regulation 5. The
debate seems to be around whether contracts have to be awarded for
every single service. David Lock QC, in a briefing yesterday—I
thank the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for having ensured 
<?notus-xml column=1505?>that we were able to hear him—said, if I
understood him correctly, that unless there was an existing contract
people would be denied choice. He gave an example of a person requiring
nursing home care. That person would be denied choice on which home to
stay in unless there was a contract covering that nursing home. Perhaps
the Minister will give us a definitive answer on that and whether any
qualified provider plays into that
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T21:48:15"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, another consideration, which we have not debated in all the
briefings we have had, is that if that person held a personal budget,
he would have great freedom to choose what he
wanted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T21:48:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304252000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#1304252000074">Lastly,
there is concern in the voluntary organisations. I take the point
mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, about cherry picking. My
experience is that the private sector does not want all the hassle,
cost or trouble of getting a contract together when the service is
successful. Why should it? If the NHS is doing very well, leave it to
the NHS. The place that the private sector goes is where the NHS is
doing really badly and change is needed. I do not accept the argument
about cherry picking. I am involved in voluntary organisations as well,
and there are some concerns here. I understand that they want stability
and it is hard, when one works for a voluntary organisation, that so
much time is spent trying to get funding for it. There is again a great
opportunity for co-operation
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304252000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#1304252000075">I run a
very small concern. We provide for a niche market. My company would not
exist if we did not work with others to provide comprehensive
programmes. We work with the King’s Fund, Common Purpose,
Manchester University and all sorts of different organisations on a
contract—bundling together as it has been described. It is
because we are all component parts in this contract that sometimes we
win them—not often enough, but sometimes. People say to us,
“We have chosen your consortium because each element of what you
bring is something different”. There really is merit in the well
known adage that the whole is more valuable than the component

often scrutinises these regulations. This needs to happen, but I share
some of the views expressed by my noble friend Lady Williams that there
has been so much misinformation. These regulations have caused so much
angst and worry, which has been a real pity and unnecessary. However,
there is room for clarity and I think this is on its way. Some further

that he will address them all head-on in his summing up. The lead
question that has been asked tonight is why there is a such disparity
between the centre here and how it is interpreted out there. Therefore,
what will the Government do to make sure that there 
<?notus-xml column=1506?>is no panic about challenges, that this does not
become a lawyers’ charter and that integration works in the best
interests of patients? Clause 2 suggests that it should take precedence
over Clause 5 and that integration is key, because it will secure the
best services for patients today and those of tomorrow. We have
education, research and training in the Act and these also need to be

the main issues of the debate and I do not intend to delay the
House for long. I will confine my remarks to guidance—currently
in preparation by Monitor—the role of Monitor in the process,
and what the effect would be if the Prayer to Annul by the noble Lord,
Lord Hunt, were successful. When we had our first meeting with the
Minister about our concerns, we expressed our anxiety about the
language. Laws they may be, but they did not have to be impenetrable
and we improved the situation with the second draft, in particular,
Clause 2 and Clause 5. I thank my noble friend Lord

noble friend Lord Howe picked up earlier, is that we insisted that the
guidance needs to be absolutely clear and unambiguous. It is written by
Monitor, but it is signed off by the Secretary of State. We said that
it needed to be a product not just of Monitor’s work, but also
of various stakeholders’.</hs_para>

the Secretary of State and my honourable friend the Minister, Norman
Lamb, met some of the stakeholders and I understand that further

of Monitor’s other role, that of regulating and policing
contracts? Until 1 April, much of NHS commissioning covered by
procurement law was undertaken by PCTs. That meant that a supplier
could take a PCT to court if they lost a contract unlawfully, and seek
compensation and damages. That could be a waste of time and
taxpayers’ money, damaging in one way or another to patient
care.</hs_para>

1 April, PCTs, which could be ordered to do anything by the Department
of Health, were replaced by CCGs, which could not. If we want to
continue to keep the NHS out of the courts, something
needs to have the same power over CCGs in relation to
procurement as the Department of Health had over PCTs. That something
is Monitor.</hs_para>

Hollins. In the general debate until today, much has been made of the

enforce that patient care is about competition and they outlaw cherry

the issue of guidance, it might be worth the House hearing that NHS
England and Monitor are working in partnership to develop a
choice and competition framework. Guidance is important; it is not just
the law, but how it is interpreted. The statement that NHS England and
Monitor have made points out clearly that: patients and their interest
come first and the use of competition must be in patients’
interests; the use of competition must be based on evidence, not
ideology, and it is the evidence of what will improve outcomes for
patients that matters; commissioners will decide when to introduce
competition beyond patients’ rights to choice set out in the NHS
constitution—something that not many people have mentioned
during the course of this debate, but which has a huge impact on its
outcome; where there is poor performance there is an expectation that
commissioners will use all the tools available, including competition
where that will improve outcomes for patients; and there is a need to
strengthen the evidence base further on the potential benefits of
introducing competition.</hs_para>

begin with these simple statements because they are key to
understanding what the Government are doing and what they are not
doing. What we are doing, above all, is having a set of arrangements in
place that will protect the interests of patients. The basic purpose of
the regulations is to prevent commissioners failing to think about how
the needs of their patients can best be met. Equally, their purpose is
to ensure that commissioning in the NHS is protected from abuses
arising from conflicts of interest or anti-competitive behaviour that
works against the interests of
patients<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T22:04:42"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is no encouragement in these regulations, explicit or implicit, to
commission services from the independent sector, or indeed any other
sector. The regulations enshrine the principle that patients must
receive services from the providers, from whichever
sector—public, private or voluntary—that are most capable
of meeting their needs and improving the quality of services that they
receive.</hs_para>

that this happened were put in place by the previous Administration.
These mechanisms consisted of the <I>Principles and Rules for
Co-operation and Competition</I>, which were overseen by the
Co-operation and Competition Panel. Now that primary care trusts no
longer exist, we need to carry over those arrangements so as to apply
them to clinical commissioning groups. The Government committed, in
their response to the NHS Future Forum report, to maintain the previous
rules and place them on a statutory footing in order that they could
continue to apply to commissioners. That is exactly what we have done;
the panel has been transferred into Monitor, so that there is absolute
continuity in how the rules will be applied.</hs_para>

noble Lords to understand. Monitor is now the sector-specific regulator
for the NHS. In practice that means that it, not the courts, will be
the guardian of patients’ interests and will adjudicate if
allegations of anti-competitive conduct arise. In effect, it will act
as a firewall between commissioners and the courts. If the House annuls
these regulations, that firewall will disappear and I suggest to the
House that this could not possibly be in the interests of the health

commissioners to go out to tender, which brings me to Regulation 5(1).
People who have looked at that regulation have stated that it requires
commissioners to go out to tender for just about every NHS service.
That is not so. It is not even remotely near the reality. First, the
wording of Regulation 5 which refers to “one capable
provider” is almost exactly the same as that of the previous
Government’s guidance to PCTs. My noble friend Lord
Clement-Jones was quite right in pointing this out. I shall now read
from that guidance. It said that PCT boards “must act
transparently” and without
discrimination,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="1304252000151" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#1304252000151">“and

point about that guidance. It was not guidance that PCTs could take or
leave but guidance that was declaratory of public procurement law,

rather loose arrangement with something more stringent are mistaken.
The law was binding before and it is binding now. These regulations are
declaratory of the existing legal position, just as the previous
Government’s guidance was. However, we also need these

this evening from the noble Lord, Lord Davies, about what might happen
to the unbundling of hospital services. I would like to put that
misconception to rest. Elective hospital care is not
relevant to these regulations. The previous Government brought in a
policy known as “any willing provider” for elective
hospital services. We have continued with that policy, which means that
patients have a free choice between hospital providers who meet NHS
quality standards and contractual terms. There is therefore no question
of tendering for those

the main, the services where tendering might be relevant are those
delivered in the community and certain more specialised services.
Again, the overarching principle to guide commissioners is Regulation
2—to do what is in the best interests of their patients. In some
circumstances, tendering may be appropriate, but in many cases it will
not: for example, where there is only one provider capable of providing
the integrated package or pathway of services which the commissioner
wishes to secure for its patients. In another situation, they may judge
that only one provider is able to meet the clinical quality and safety
standards that they require. They may decide not to tender where they
conclude that it is necessary for services to be co-located because of
the interdependencies between them—a point raised by the noble
Lord, Lord Davies, once again—in order, for example, to ensure
patient safety.</hs_para>

to be satisfied. This means that a commissioner needs to go through a
process to make sure that it is taking sensible decisions that
genuinely address the interests of its patients. In other words, it
must have a rationale for what it does and be satisfied that it is
doing the most appropriate thing. As long as it has that rationale,
that is where the matter ends. I repeat: in those circumstances there
is no one who can oblige the commissioner to go out to

these regulations usher in a lawyers’ charter are not looking at
the evidence. The evidence to date tells us that only a tiny handful of

I said during the passage of the Health and Social Care Act, there is
no requirement in these regulations or anywhere else to create markets.
Nor, as I have said, is there any requirement for commissioners to
unbundle or to fragment services to facilitate competition: in other
words, to separate out individual services so they could be provided by
a larger range of providers. The decision whether and when to create
these conditions and the services to which they apply remains entirely
with commissioners.</hs_para>

produced by the noble Lord for annulling these regulations is that they
lack clarity, particularly Regulation 5(1). I suggest that is a
specious argument. First, the law has not changed. Secondly, employees
of commissioning support units, whose job it is to support CCGs in
commissioning decisions, are very largely the same people who did
exactly the same jobs in PCTs and are entirely familiar with this area
of the law. Thirdly, there is already guidance out there, produced by
the NHS Commissioning Board Authority last year. Fourthly, Monitor will
be providing further guidance to support commissioners in understanding
the circumstances in which single tender is appropriate, including
specific case studies. This guidance will be consulted on shortly.
Monitor will continue, as the Co-operation and Competition Panel did
before it, to provide informal advice to help commissioners understand
the regulations. We really do not have to worry about lack of clarity
here.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042528000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#13042528000006">I turn
now to one or two of the specific questions that were posed in the
debate. The noble Lord, Lord Owen, asked why other countries have not
applied these procurement laws. All member states in the European Union
have been required to transpose the EU directive on public procurement
into their own national legislation. In fact, it has been applied in
Wales and Northern Ireland through the Public Contracts Regulations
2006.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042528000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#13042528000007">The
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, maintained that the OFT’s role in mergers
is evidence of the Government’s agenda to marketise the NHS.
First, that issue is in no way related to the regulations that we are
debating tonight. Perhaps I could remind the noble Lord that the OFT is
acting independently under the powers conferred on it under the
previous Administration through the Enterprise Act
2002.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042528000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#13042528000008">With
regard to the Competition Commission gagging clinicians in the
Bournemouth and Poole merger case, I suggest that that is not relevant
either. My understanding is that those arrangements are simply to
prevent the merger proceeding further while it is being reviewed. They
should not get in the way of providers co-operating with each other in
the usual way in the interests of patients. The noble Lord said that
Monitor is anti-bundling and that it would be policing the regulations
at the same time. That is misleading. Decisions about whether or not to
bundle services are not for Monitor 
<?notus-xml column=1512?>to make; they are squarely for commissioners to take
in the best interests of their patients, and Monitor is under a duty to
enable integrated
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042528000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#13042528000009">The
noble Lord, Lord Owen, raised concerns about charities. I have seen the
brief from National Voices, Marie Curie and others in this regard.
Those concerns are helpful in illustrating the point that there is no
one-size-fits-all approach to the commissioning of services. It is
interesting that some stakeholders have raised concerns about
unbundling leading to fragmentation, while others are concerned about
the effects of bundling too many services together. In practice, it is
for clinically led commissioners to take decisions on whether or not
services should be bundled in the best interests of patients. That is
their job, and these regulations do nothing to require them to bundle
or unbundle, as I have
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042528000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#13042528000010">The
noble Lord, Lord Davies, asked me whether the regulations take into
account the financial viability of hospitals and economies of scale.
First, I remind the noble Lord that these regulations are not relevant
to the vast majority of elective hospital services, so they do not
herald the prospect of large numbers of services being hived off.
Secondly, it is for commissioners to make decisions about the need for
services to be bundled or co-located, as I have said. It is not in
their interest to destabilise providers. Thirdly, the NHS tariff is
being improved in order to ensure that it is properly reflective of the
costs faced by providers. This would mean that profit-making services
would no longer need to cross-subsidise other
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042528000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#13042528000011">The
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked me why there is no contract value

requirement under the regulations or the law to do
so.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042528000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#13042528000012">The noble

annual report on the exercise of its functions and lay a copy before
Parliament, and to provide the Secretary of State with such other
reports and information relating to the exercise of its functions as

consultation on the requirements of the original set of regulations

broad support for the proposals from a wide range of stakeholders. The

exposed to the full force of public procurement law, as interpreted by

likely to secure the very kind of risk-averse behaviour by
commissioners that some have argued today must be avoided. In addition,
without the regulations, patients’ right to choice under the NHS
constitution would not be protected; commissioning processes would be
much less transparent and accountable; we would lose safeguards to
protect against and address conflicts of interest, discrimination and
anti-competitive conduct that work against the interests of patients;

with the last comment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe. These are very
important regulations, although there is disagreement about what they
mean when it comes to practice in the field. The essential test of the

best.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042528000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-0003.htm#13042528000018">The

statement—that clinicians will be free to commission services in
the way that they wish to—has been hedged in by the product of
many statutory rules contained in the regulations. When it comes to
Regulation 5, there is a division of opinion between the Government and
the Opposition, and between lawyers, as to what the single capable
provider test means. It is arguable that the health service will be
confused as to whether it can define a local service as one that can be
provided only by one provider, or whether, in many parts of the
country, similar services will provided by different organisations
within the facility of the CCG. There will be considerable doubt
whether the CCG will be able to go ahead and award a contract without
some competitive tender process. That is at the heart of some of this

of the most developed health care systems in the world. Its latest
evaluation placed the UK as No. 2 overall. It placed the US, where the
system of markets and competition is most to the fore, as No. 7. When
people look at the NHS internationally, they see a lot of things that
they wish to commend, not least of which is the integration of purpose

Anelay of St Johns:</Member></B> My Lords, I think there has been a
little confusion tonight with regard to what may happen tomorrow. I
know that we are getting to a particularly critical moment as we reach
10.39 pm, and I thought it might be of assistance to those who serve
this House so well if I remind noble Lords of my earlier announcement
with regard to Prorogation. With the Government’s business for
this Session being certain, I was able to announce that
the  
<?notus-xml column=1518?>House will prorogue late afternoon tomorrow. The
reason that I am not able to give a precise time is quite simply that
we have to wait for the other place to complete its business. I can now
speed up. We will convene at 11 am for Questions and a debate on the
Maastricht convergence criteria will follow. I then expect to adjourn
the House during pleasure, and we will reconvene for Prorogation in the
afternoon.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Bill">

Massey of Darwen:</Member></B> My Lords, having finally secured this
debate, it is a great pleasure to have so many colleagues speaking in
it, and I thank them all, and the Minister, for taking part. I come to
this debate with one agenda. All of us are concerned about children and
young people, and that they get the best possible chance both in school
and in life. I very much look forward to what others have to say and
how the Minister will respond.</hs_para>

start that I consider PSHE more of a concept than an actual subject in
the curriculum, and I shall expand on that. I realise that things have
moved on since we last attempted to hold this debate. There are
proposals for the science curriculum, there is to be a curriculum
review, and a Statement on PSHE. I know that the Minister understands
the importance of PSHE because we have talked about it, and I want to
ask him if after this debate he will meet interested colleagues to
discuss how we might move forward positively. I know that the PSHE
Association is seeking to form a coalition of interested organisations
to support PSHE in schools. Would he also be prepared to meet such a
coalition? I think that there is some confusion about what PSHE
actually is, and I shall be interested to see if colleagues agree and
whether they support my perceptions of it.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042460000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000006">I shall begin with
three brief anecdotes about the importance of PSHE. First, recently I
was speaking at a reception held by a large and successful
multinational company. I looked at its website to find out what the
company looks for in its employees, and I was impressed to see a huge
emphasis on communication skills, team work and the fostering of good
relationships. That echoes what the CBI has said, which is that young 
<?notus-xml column=404?>people should be “rounded and grounded” by the time they
leave school. The second anecdote is about a primary school in east
London. The head teacher, who co-ordinates PSHE in the school, and six
of its pupils came to talk to the All-Party Parliamentary Group for
Children, which I chair, about their experiences. A few years the
school was in trouble as the result of disruptive behaviour, poor
achievement and low morale. The new head teacher instituted a programme
of PSHE in the school. It now has policies on behaviour, it has been
made explicit that respectful behaviour towards others is a cornerstone
of school life, and specific lessons are held on, for example,
friendship, bullying and helping others. The school is now high-flying
and successful. It is not surprising that a report commissioned by the
Department for Education in 2012 found
that,</hs_para>

you instil good health habits in children, they stick. Also, I know
many examples where children have influenced parental health behaviour,

about the Government making PSHE statutory. I know that it is a clunky

well.</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="13042460000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000007">There
are some myths about PSHE. One is that it is a single school subject
such as maths or history, that teachers are not trained to do it, and
that until they are trained it cannot be delivered. Another myth, as we
all know, is that it is all about inappropriate sex education. Every
child should be able to do as well as possible in school. A school that
creates an ethos of respect and learning will support such achievement.
All teachers in such a school are teaching PSHE, either in the
classroom or outside it, which is about kindness, working in teams,
listening to others and thinking about how one’s behaviour
affects others. Teachers are helping children to gain confidence in
their own

contribute to PSHE in one form or another—for example, PE,
music, English and biology. This is why I have some concerns about the
potential diminishing of, for example, art and sport in schools. It is
not one thing or the other. It is not just a matter of either being
academic or learning personal and social skills. Both should live

specific lessons on, for example, drugs, alcohol, sexual relationships,
first aid, healthy eating and internet safety. The lessons may begin
with a simple concept in primary school. We know that young children
will not appreciate the chemical make-up of certain foods. They can
appreciate that fruit is good for you and some things are not. Young
children cannot appreciate the niceties of contraception, or the danger
of sexually transmitted infections or early pregnancy. They can
appreciate that respecting other people and being a good friend makes
for good relationships. They can appreciate that some behaviours are
risky; after all, we teach them how to cross roads and not to run in
corridors.</hs_para>

Every child needs PSHE—some more than others and some
desperately. Some schools do a great job. Others, perhaps a minority,
are, frankly, not interests. This is why, to protect children and to
enhance their education, we need a strong statement from the Government
about the importance of PSHE. Schools have for many years delivered
PSHE in many different ways. I am asking for all schools to be required

teaches children to think. Is that not what education is about? I know
that UNICEF’s Rights Respecting Schools initiative has
overwhelming evidence that school ethos can be improved by emphasis on
relationships and behaviour. We know that children grow and change.
Inputs should be made every year as they gain knowledge and experience,
such as in English and maths. Pupils need to discuss these issues. They
live in a complex world—life is very complex nowadays for

statutory PSHE is two-fold. First, every school should have a policy
and ethos that parents and pupils understand about what kind of
relationships and behaviours will be promoted in that school. Secondly,
every school should ensure that there is a programme, year on year, for
every child in which they can learn, according to age, about drugs and
alcohol, first aid, the importance of healthy food and exercise, sex
and relationships, risky behaviour and so on. Parents, governors and

understand that for some children feeling safe in school and developing
self-respect and confidence are precursors to being able to learn and
achieve? Do the Government realise that certain health behaviours, such
as obesity, are so risky that they will cost the country millions of
pounds to deal with in the future? Such health behaviours can be
prevented or mitigated, partly, in school.</hs_para>

my case. First, statutory provision for PSHE does not mean a prescribed
programme. Statutory means that every school is expected to deliver a
clear statement on behaviour and ethos. Secondly, every school is
expected to ensure that, year on year, pupils will be entitled to learn
about what constitutes a healthy lifestyle. It is not really that
complicated. There are examples of excellent practice. I am asking
simply that all pupils in all schools should have the right to this
programme of PSHE. Again, I thank noble Lords and look forward to the

I would like to broaden the debate to more than simply what PSHE in the

question the place for PSHE in the curriculum, but I question whether
this range of topics does not belong just as much to what parents,

of the sense of self, and the confidence that we seek to develop in
children, come not from what a teacher says but the way in which the
school conducts its business, its overall ethos. In its briefing for
this debate, the PSHE Association claims that PSHE education instils
“knowledge, skills and confidence”. But these come from
achievement across the whole curriculum. Confidence belongs to a well
educated, happy young person, who has experienced a school life where
aspiration and hard work are rewarded, teachers command respect and
pupils have the confidence that comes from high
achievement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042460000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000019">Experience
shows that giving young people real responsibility, treating them with
respect and applying rules that honour fairness and honesty are the
most effective tools for developing both self-respect and respect for
others. Offering trust to young people inspires trustworthiness, which
can reduce bullying and violence as well as everyday disruptive
behaviour. PSHE should not be seen as a substitute for the more
powerful ways of conveying values and instilling respect for
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042460000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000020">I know
that many noble Lords will emphasise the importance of both drugs
education and sex education—the noble Baroness has already said
that is not the whole story. I endorse the need for this, although I
would expect biology and PE teachers to have a role here as well. The
more young people understand the whole story of dangers in taking
drugs, including excess alcohol consumption, the more likely they will
be able to make informed choices. However, again I caution against the
assumption that information will in itself determine behaviour. The
same applies to sex education. Young people are subject to all too many
external factors as or more powerful than anything a teacher says in
whatever lesson. The school can balance those external factors only by
the way in which its whole ethos conveys a sense of integrity and
self-confidence in young people, enabling them to stand against some of
the pressures that lead to difficult and destructive
behaviour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042460000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000021">The

confident, achieving—and, yes, happy—young 
<?notus-xml column=407?>people must be the focus of all those concerned, from the governors,
head and teachers to the caretakers and kitchen staff. PSHE has an
important role to play in this, but it is only a part and it should
take care not to claim territory that belongs to the curriculum as a
whole and to the totality of the school’s message. This is too
important for us to get it

for instigating this very important debate. Whether it is healthy
lifestyles; whether it is sex and relationship education; whether it is
education about drugs, alcohol or tobacco; whether it is dealing with
bullying or abuse issues; whether it is bereavement or mental health
problems; whether it is developing positive relationships or parenting
skills; whether it is about employability or enterprise proficiency,
should we not, as a society, ensure that our young people have the
opportunity at school to understand and cope with these issues? Do we
not owe it to young people, and to society as a whole, to educate them
to understand these matters? It is simply not good enough for the
“voices off-stage” to say, “Leave it to the
parents”, or, indeed, for individual schools to decide whether
or not they want to teach these subjects. We need to be strong and say,
“Yes, these issues do matter”. They matter in particular
to the well-being of our young
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042460000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000025">PSHE
education should not be an add-on for schools to “take off the
shelf” as and when they please. It should be an integral part of
each pupil’s learning and of the learning ethos of each and
every school. How do we know that it is important to teach these
activities? There is a huge bank of research to draw on. Take, for
example, the use and effectiveness of anti-bullying strategies in
schools: research shows that PSHE education was unanimously rated as
having a positive effect in preventing bullying. Take drugs and
alcohol: a national poll of more than 7,000 young people shows that
95% said that PSHE education had helped them think about the
risks of drugs, and another 80% said that it had helped them avoid them

has become the biggest public health crisis facing the UK and, indeed,
the National Health Service. It is no good saying that we should
educate children about healthy food if we do not include schools in
addressing the issue. The recent high-profile child abuse cases again
show how important it is to keep children and young people safe by
developing their knowledge, skills and confidence. PSHE education
provides the opportunity to explore these issues in detail and offers
the first line of defence against violence and abuse. Interestingly,
the youth democracy group, Bite the Ballot, carried out a survey of
5,000 young people. Those who took part in the survey said that there
was a lack of attention paid to these issues in school. The

good news is that in the most recent Ofsted inspection, which covered
an albeit small sample of schools, PSHE education was judged to be
“good” or 
<?notus-xml column=408?>“outstanding” in three-quarters of the schools visited,
and at least “satisfactory” in all but one of the schools
surveyed. Among the issues raised was that parents were rarely
consulted about their children’s PSHE education. I think that
they should be consulted about it. However, good practice included
schools using peer-mentoring schemes whereby pupils were trained to use
their skills to support their classmates. The most effective model seen
was one in which discrete, regular PSHE lessons were supplemented with
cross-curricular activities. PSHE must be part of every pupil’s
schooling. It should be part of initial training programmes and of the
Ofsted inspection framework. In this way we can ensure that our young
people are best equipped to face the problems and challenges that no
doubt will confront them in their future

others by knowing what to do when bleeding, heart attacks,

children’s education when, so far as I could see, the one

for discouraging smoking but far more for encouraging reflection on
what values should inform our society, whether they are respect for
others, listening to minority voices, generosity to those in need,
truth-telling or whatever. The chapter on values in the

comment on how emotional intelligence is itself best targeted. In this

I would value comment on the relationship between PSHE and religious
studies. Religious studies can so easily become a factual description
of the rituals and beliefs of particular religious traditions. While
that has its value, it is much more crucial that young people are
taught to explore their own and others’ spirituality, whether
that is in a religious or a non-religious context. The relationship
between spirituality and emotional intelligence seems to be two very
closely related concepts that are not quite the same thing. It is
something that our education system ought to be exploring, and it ought
to be important in the way we encourage
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042460000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000035">It

With every minute that passes their chances of survival decreases by
about 10%. Therefore, whether there is someone on the scene trained in
the necessary skills, such as providing CPR or to use a defibrillator
if available, can be a matter of life and death. By the way, nearly

is 52%; in the UK it varies from between 2% and 12% depending on where

give schools as much freedom as possible to determine the details of
their own curriculum. However, in relation

have listened carefully to what noble Lords have said and agree with
the main thrust of the argument, but with one or two caveats or
differences of emphasis which I will just point out. Of course it need
not be a discrete subject and of course it is about the ethos of the
school and things like that. To sum it up, it is about what we teach,
how we teach and the type of place a school is. All those things are
important, and need a bit of space on the curriculum. Personal, social
and health education is a body of knowledge as well as a set of
attitudes and a number of skills. Sometimes, we almost find refuge in
the view that we do not need to worry, as it will be covered by good
English teachers or good maths teachers, or by the good old PE teacher
or the religious education teacher. Because we have had that attitude
and have never really got the subject to the top of the priority list,
it has never been taught as effectively as it might be. There is a big
difference between teaching it and children learning. Very often, we
tick the box as “done” when we have made sure that it has
been taught, but we really should tick the box when we are sure that
students have learnt. There is still a big gap between teaching it and
students learning it in this area of the curriculum and of knowledge.
When we think about what we want for our own children—when we
describe the sort of citizens we would want children to be—we
mention much of what would be covered in this area of the curriculum
and of knowledge. That is the nature of its
importance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042460000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000052">Crucially,
although I do not think that children do not have the facts about some
of the difficult issues to do with health education or sex education, I
believe that they do not necessarily have the ability to make the right
decision at the right time. We all know from our own lives how
difficult that is. It is very much an adult skill which we need
children to gain pretty early on in their lives. That will not be
taught in maths or in English, or necessarily in science or PE. Around
that is what is missing when we have tackled how this subject should be
taught. I am traditional about this. We know 
<?notus-xml column=413?>what makes a good teacher, what makes effective teaching and what brings
success, but we do not have them in PSHE, which is the
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042460000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000053">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:22:39"></hs_TimeCode>
have five comments that I want to throw into the debate. First, the
subject area needs to be valued: schools, students and teachers need to
know it is important. I have not heard the Secretary of State make a
speech about PSHE and I am not really sure what the Government’s
policy is. I cannot think of even a handful of ways in which this
Government have given the message to the school system that PSHE is
important. Secondly, we need recognition for pupil progress and
achievement. We have that in the academic subjects but we do not have
that in this subject. Thirdly, we need to train teachers. Fourthly,
there is a best practice pedagogy. There are good and bad ways of peer
mentoring, and teachers need to know what the effective ways are.
Fifthly, it would be great to have one of our leading heads say,
“I started my career as a PSHE teacher”. That route to
school leadership has not yet happened. Although no one is against
PSHE, my worry is that we are not sufficiently for it to get it to the
top of the agenda. We can make nice speeches and feel comfortable with
it, but unless we look at why students are not learning it as
effectively as they might do, we will not make the progress that this
subject certainly needs and
deserves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:23:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13042460000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000095">4.23

Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> My Lords, I will make three points.
First, I strongly support the calls of the noble Baronesses, Lady
Massey of Darwen and Lady Morris, for a strengthening of the position
of PSHE in the curriculum. Earlier this afternoon, I had the good
fortune to speak to pupils and teachers from Leamington Spa’s
Trinity Catholic School, which is particularly strong on pastoral care
and particularly reaches out to young people who are looked after by
local authorities. I spoke to one pupil who has her PSHE lesson on
Monday mornings, in which she is currently studying child labour in the
developing world. She was animated; it was interesting her. I spoke to
one of the teachers responsible for teaching the subject in the school,
who said that the status of this subject was low among other teachers
and it is not respected. She also said that it is difficult to teach
and teachers need to be well trained to deliver it properly. She
pointed out that, particularly in her school, many children do not hear
what they need to know from their parents, and they get that in these
classes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042460000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000055">My
second point concerns governors. I was speaking to the same head
teacher, I think, as the noble Baroness, Lady Massey—the primary
school head teacher who had turned around three schools using PSHE. I
listened with great care to what the noble Baroness, Lady Perry of
Southwark, and the noble Lord, Lord Eden of Winton, said about school
ethos. Interestingly, the head teacher used PSHE as the basis for
developing an ethos within the school that respected relationships,
where relationships between pupils, pupils and teachers, and the school
and parents were fundamental. She also found, as the noble Baroness,
Lady Massey, said, that if you get the relationships right, the
learning takes place. I hope that is somewhat reassuring to the 
<?notus-xml column=414?>noble Baroness and the noble Lord. To some extent I share the noble
Lord’s concern about the possible hijacking of some political
correctness in terms of sex education. We need to watch that carefully
but should not stop doing this because of those
concerns.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042460000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000056">The
head teacher I spoke to had the first chartered PSHE education teacher
in her school, in 2008. Since then, we have three chartered PSHE
teachers; there may be more now. What is happening to move that ahead?
Why is the progress so slow? Perhaps I may also ask the Minister about
training for teachers in child development. This should be available to
all teachers and would underpin success, particularly in this area as
it deals with the emotional development of
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042460000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000057">I
remember working with a 10 year-old child about five years ago on a
summer play scheme on which I had a placement. This child was
attention-seeking and getting into fights with other children; he
caused us all a great deal of anxiety and we were not able to attend so
well to other children because of him. In the lunch hour, he would sit
in an old tyre and rock himself. After 10 days of working with that
child, I sat in the back of a minibus with him and heard that he was
just about to be moved into his new adoptive home. This child had
experienced trauma, he was at a very difficult stage in his life, and
of course he had regressed towards the behaviour of a three year-old or
a five year-old.</hs_para>

that teachers understand child development so that they can understand

statistics for sexually transmitted diseases—I think there are
more than 1 million consultations a year in this country; quite
horrendous—and then divorce, the abortion rate, underage
pregnancy and much more. All this points to a great deal of misery; in
fact, probably the greatest source of poverty in our society comes from
relational breakdown and all that goes with it. In addition, we have
the distasteful flood-tide of pornography, to which the noble Lord,
Lord Eden, rightly referred, which cheapens sexuality in all sorts of
ways.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042460000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000061">So what
do we do? Improvements to sex-and-relationship education must be part
of the answer. Of course, some call for a curriculum that is determined

<?notus-xml column=415?>by central government. Alongside this there is a demand for compulsory
sexual relationship education in primary schools, which, as I
understand it, is currently at the discretion of the governing body
although it needs to have a policy on the subject. For my part, I can
see the case for sex-and-relationship education in the late primary
years so long as it does not feed the premature sexualisation of
children and childhood, to which the noble Lord, Lord Eden, referred.
That is a real problem today, driven largely by commercial interests.
These are sensitive issues and I believe that it would be a mistake to
centralise the approach in schools even if the Government have a very
important advisory role in communicating good
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:30:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042460000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000062">Consultations
on PSHE clearly support the crucial role of parents. Schools should
have the flexibility to ensure that this sensitive subject is tackled
in line with both the ethos of a particular school and the parental
wishes, which need to be determined. The law as it stands provides for
this and the challenge is to improve the operation of the current law
rather than to try to force solutions by a change to it. There are
widespread problems with parenting in our society but the answer is not
to lessen parental responsibility and involvement but to renew our
efforts to improve and educate people about the role of
parents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:31:10"></hs_TimeCode>. The
centralised nature of the curriculum provides scope for this in theory
but in practice its implementation is very patchy. In some schools,
governors and head teachers consult parents and let them know when the
subject is to be taught so that parents can follow it up appropriately
at home. However, it seems that best practice is often not followed and
governors as well as parents can get frustrated as they are bypassed
and as local authorities advocate perhaps controversial material for
schools to use. Will the Minister comment on this and respond to three
suggestions for any revision to the circular which was referred to
earlier<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:34:29"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042460000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000063">The
first is the need for governors formally to consult parents on this
matter and take that seriously before determining with school staff the
curriculum for a school. The second is the need for local authorities
to make clear that any advice which they offer is advice, that the
governors have the responsibility for this issue, in dialogue with the
best expert and professional advice, and that governors cannot shirk
that responsibility. The third suggestion concerns the need to
communicate regularly with parents in determining the curriculum and in
letting them know how it is being delivered and when so that it can be
followed up in the parental home. That, I believe, would at least make
a start in the right
direction.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13042460000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042460000097"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:32:28"></hs_TimeCode></I>4.32

few weeks ago, I sat in the bedroom of a 15 year-old boy.
Together we looked at a website that, at a touch of a button, conjured
up hundreds of pornographic films in 32 different categories which I

<?notus-xml column=416?>noble Lords by mentioning. This young boy admits that his porn addiction
is a barrier to having a relationship because real girls do not conform
to the images he sees online. This 15 year-old bitterly regrets this
situation. Imagine bitterly regretting such a thing at the age of 15
when he is not yet supposed to be having sex. As uncomfortable as it is
for us to acknowledge this, his experience is becoming a new
normal—it is not an unusual thing. Multiple studies, including a
recent one from Boston University’s School of Public Health
which reported on the rise of teen group sex, show that sexual activity
among teens is increasingly reflective of commercial sexual fantasy,
including its very damaging gender stereotyping. Nearly a third of all
girls between 13 and 17 report having engaged in unwanted sexual acts
demanded by a partner, which is a terrible blurring of the concept of
consent that goes way into

is, resilience against the sexualised imagery that dictates
inappropriate behaviours and confidence to resist the pressures that
result in unwanted or abusive sexual activity. No young person should
be isolated or ignorant on their journey to sexual maturity. It is
disappointing that the Government have not yet made PSHE a statutory

commercially driven sexual content. We have to be careful not to vilify
parents. They are struggling to police their children on the net and
many of the young people I speak to do not wish to discuss intimate
bodily functions with their parents. I fear that if we do not grasp the
opportunity to offer high status, high quality PSHE, the realpolitik is
that we will leave the sex education of many young people to the

Parekh:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank my noble friend Lady
Massey of Darwen for securing this debate and introducing it so well. I
want to bring a slightly different dimension to our debate and talk
about the social and political context in which education needs to be
seen and located. After all, we are asking what new skills and
knowledge are needed in order that people can grow up in our society as
sane human beings. Our society has changed profoundly over the past few
decades and it is going to change even more. That will present the
citizens of the future with new challenges. I want to look in
particular at three of these new challenges which have not yet been
noted in our
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:38:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042466000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042466000002">First, there is the
challenge caused by globalisation. We are an integral part of an
interdependent world. The rest of the world is not beyond our
boundaries; in fact, the expression “the rest of the
world” does not make sense because it is already here in our
midst, shaping us in a profound way. That is so not only in the form of
immigrants, but also in the form of new cultures and new modes of
ideas. The very idea of a border becomes in a sense problematical.
Because we are constantly being exposed to new currents of thought and
new ideas, there is inevitably a sense of panic. What is going to
happen to us? There is a sense of disorientation and the loss of a
sense of belonging. Our children, from a very young age, are faced with
the problems of, “Who am I? Where do I belong? How do I retain a
sense of continuity while at the same time coping with change?”.
The first basic survival skill that they are going to need will be how
to maintain a sense of identity that is not frozen. It must be able to
cope with change, but at the same time it should not be like a set of
clothes which can be discarded in favour of another set. We will have
to teach them reflective skills from a young age.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042466000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042466000003">The second profound
change our society is undergoing is that we are increasingly
multicultural. This is not only because of outsiders but because of
choices that our own people are making, such as gay marriage,
cohabitation and lots of other things. If we are going to live at peace
with ourselves and others in this  kind of society, we will
require certain multicultural competences and sensibilities. We should
learn to appreciate differences, feel at ease in their presence, and
also develop an imaginative sympathy. Right from the age of two or
three, children should be able to recognise that people can be of
different colours and have different ways of life, and feel at ease
with them and learn to cope with them. That skill is absolutely crucial
as children grow up if we are going to maintain any degree of social
cohesion and social
harmony.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042466000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042466000004">The
third skill that I think is just as important has to do with something
that one or two of your Lordships have already mentioned. There is a
pervasive culture of indifference to others. We have seen severe cuts
to people’s livelihoods brought about by the banking crisis,
which I thought would have provoked an enormous sense of injustice and
anger. It did not do anything of the kind. Bankers seem to be
shameless; what are the rest of us doing? We who failed to mount
sufficient pressure on the Government to bring about a regulatory 
<?notus-xml column=418?>regime are complicit in and partly responsible for the consequences of
our deeds. Therefore, these cuts are not happening behind our backs;
they are happening because of
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042466000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042466000005">It
is this culture of indifference—“I have nothing to do
with it, it is all the Government over there taking
decisions”—that has to be countered. That involves a
sense of compassion, concern for others and, going a little further,
what some philosophers have called the ethical care of the
self—a certain sense of pride in oneself, a sense of
responsibility for oneself, so that one should be able say, with regard
to health education, sex education, or whatever, “I am not that
kind of person. I value myself too highly to become pregnant as a
teenager or to engage in certain abominable practices”. If one
had that kind of pride in oneself, which is more than self-respect and
different from self-esteem, one would not dream of doing certain
things. Can we instil that culture of care of the self in our children?
If we do, we will have solved many of our problems without having
recourse to technology or bureaucratic
regulation.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13042466000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042466000023">4.42

labouring against a much bigger problem than in the past. In the days
when we went to school, figures relating to society were far better.
Just to quote a few, the UK now has the highest rate of family
breakdown in the western world and only just over
half—55%—of 15 year-olds live with both their birth
parents. That is a huge social change. Children are considerably more
likely to have a television in the bedroom than a father living at
home. We also know from good, sound research that 80% of variability in
pupil achievement is attributable to so-called pupil factors,
particularly family influence, so schools are struggling against a huge
backdrop of problems that children may be bringing in with them, which
are not the children’s
fault.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042466000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042466000008">I will
touch briefly on emergency first aid, which has already been covered by
the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, and the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. I
cannot but join wholeheartedly with their comments. If there was one
thing that every child should learn, it would be the two hours of CPR.
The children are very likely to be on the scene when the person
concerned drops dead. Even though there is only a 15% chance of
success, if unsuccessful, they can in their grief be consoled that they
did everything they could.</hs_para>

in her 60s, who in her late teens found her father dead in the chair,
and she has never recovered from the fact that she did not know what to
do. She did not even know how to try. She just dived for a telephone
and waited, and of course her father was dead. If only she had known to
give him one thump on the chest, she might have felt better about the
whole of her life. But it is not just about CPR. It is about coping
with bleeding, choking, fractures—the real basics. Young people
are the ones at risk of those; they are the ones at risk off falling of
a horse, falling down a cliff face and so on.</hs_para>

skills with which we are trying to equip children, they are about
relationships. We are not dealing with only the nuts and bolts, if you
like, of sex; we are dealing with the whole business of relating and
coping with all the emotions that go on. Sadly, we have seen a rise in
the number of girls reporting non-consensual sex from 28% in 2002 to
38% in 2008. Something is wrong and we cannot ignore
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042466000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042466000011">We
also have to help children to cope with all those difficult emotions.
EU Kids Online looked at children’s concerns on the internet and
found that 22% are concerned about pornography and 18% about violent
content. We know that between 1995-96 and 2005-06 there was a 66%
increase in the hospitalisation of 12 to 14 year-olds from for
self-harm. We have the data from the report on child well-being in rich
countries and we do not do well. The United Kingdom does appallingly on
teenage fertility rates. We rank badly for alcohol being drunk twice a
week and children having used cannabis in the last 10 months. But we
also do badly on children being involved in a physical fight and in
being bullied at school at least once in the past couple of months. All
of those are negative influence on children’s emotional
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042466000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042466000012">Unless
we grasp the nettle, tackle this, make it part of our statutory
provision and value the need to teach children all the aspects of

Touhig:</Member></B> My Lords, I join colleagues in thanking my noble
friend Lady Massey of Darwen for securing this debate, and it comes on
the eve of the Children and Families Bill coming to this House. I would
like to concentrate my remarks on PSHE and its impact on youngsters
with special educational
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042466000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042466000014">Last

for </I><I>C</I><I>hildren with </I><I>A</I><I>utism</I>. In a survey
which figured in our final report, we found that 84% of respondents
said that teachers were not given enough training effectively to teach
and support children with autism. Training for teachers is obviously an
essential step in ensuring that all staff gain an understanding of the
condition which they can then pass on to their
students.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042466000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042466000015">One
in every 100 children in school is autistic, and most are in mainstream
schools. For many of these children, school can be a difficult place.
Their condition makes communicating with other students difficult, and
many will experience sensory overload. The Children and Families Bill,
which is currently in Committee in the other place, gives us an
important opportunity to transform the special educational needs system
so that more children with autism and SEN will have access to the
special support that they
need.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042466000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042466000016">We must
also think about children’s experience  of school life
more widely and how we can improve understanding of special educational
needs pupils. That 
<?notus-xml column=420?>is why personal, social and health education lessons are an opportunity
to improve, among other things, communication between all students,
both those with special educational needs and their peers. Such lessons
should help young people to develop a rounded and tolerant
understanding of the community in which they live. This must include
awareness and understanding of disability, including conditions like
autism which can often be hidden. Children with autism, especially
those with high-functioning autism or Asperger’s syndrome, can
find that their disability and the challenges resulting from it are not
obvious to their peers or teachers. Therefore, the classroom presents
an important opportunity to help tackle this lack of awareness and
misunderstanding. The National Autistic Society—I declare an
interest as vice-president—recently conducted a survey which
revealed that 22% of young people with autism said that they have no
friends at all. A shocking 63% of young people with autism said that
they had been bullied. What parent would not be greatly concerned if
they found that their children left home for school and spent their
school day isolated, alone and friendless?
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:54:20"></hs_TimeCode> children have
special educational needs, they are singled out for abuse and
intimidation by their fellow students simply because they are
different—bullying and abuse caused by ignorance, intolerance
and, sometimes, spite. We know that some schools have excellent
strategies to tackle bullying and we need to encourage that good
practice. However, it is important that teachers have a full
understanding as well as training to
cope<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:50:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042466000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042466000017">Transforming
opportunities starts at schools; it is about improving special
educational needs and changing attitudes among teachers and students
alike. Promoting personal, social and health skills in schools should
be involved in that and should be about educating young people for the

Northbourne:</Member></B> My Lords, this afternoon I  want to
focus on personal and social education. We have heard a fair bit about
some other aspects of PSHE but I want to concentrate on those two.
Personal and social education matters for many reasons but for three in
particular. The first is employment, the second is family and the third
is social
mobility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042466000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042466000019">The
ability to get on with people, to manage one’s emotions and to
understand social relationships is incredibly important in almost every
walk of employment: in retail, in hospitality services, in healthcare,
in politics and, indeed, in nearly all jobs that involve teamwork and
leadership skills. Personal and interpersonal skills, and the emotional
understanding of parents, are perhaps the key to establishing a stable,
happy and secure family and to rearing happy and successful children.
Then there is social mobility. Everybody is crying out for social
mobility but they do not seem to be prepared to make the necessary
moves towards it. Personal and social skills are absolutely fundamental
to social mobility in our
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:52:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042466000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042466000020">Each
child learns interpersonal skills in the family, in primary school and,
I hope, in secondary school. Families today vary widely in their
ability to give their 
<?notus-xml column=421?>children the social and emotional skills which they are going to need. A
high proportion of primary schools have a satisfactory Ofsted score,
but a satisfactory score only means, “Just good enough and
should do better”. However, the majority of secondary
schools in this country today give personal and social
education a very low priority indeed. In more than 90% of secondary
schools, PSHE, if it is offered at all, is delivered by a teacher with
no specialist training in the subject. Those early years in secondary
school are precisely the time when young people are growing up and need
well trained teachers helping them to explore the personal and social
challenges which lie ahead of them in the adult world. That needs
skilled teachers. Interpersonal skills are not learnt overnight nor are
they necessarily learnt in the classroom. I believe that such learning
should be achieved using interactive programmes involving guided
discussion in class based on young people’s interests and linked
to programmes of extracurricular activities designed to develop social
and interpersonal skills and character
capabilities.</hs_para>

course some of the best schools are already doing this—but why
are all schools not doing it? I think there are three answers. One is
money, the second is time and the third is lack of qualified staff. It
is in that context that I ask the Minister for two commitments. The
first is to accept in principle the importance of taking advantage of
that window of opportunity which exists during a child’s early
years in secondary school, to build up the self confidence, the
personal and social skills, and the character capabilities they will
need later in adult life. Secondly, with such a programme in mind, as a
matter of urgency I would like the Government to make a commitment to
fund one or two of the major teacher training universities to develop a
training module for specialist teachers to ensure that all younger
people in secondary schools get the support and guidance that they need
during the early years of their secondary school life. They can then
develop at an age when they are very keen to know what adult life will
be like and they will have the skills that they need for the challenges
they are likely to meet in their adult
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:55:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_24_PT_1/F7425A545A073CB252B31D23B9FA8D4A3DDF7502" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 April 2013">Wednesday,

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> My Lords, I too, congratulate my

debate.</hs_para>

apologise in advance that in the short time I have, I will not be able
to acknowledge the excellent individual contributions that we have had
from noble Lords across the Committee today. I shall structure my
remarks around three points: first, the arguments in favour of strong
PSHE, including sex-and-relationship education, delivered through
schools; secondly, the question of whether that objective can be
achieved without statutory underpinning; and, thirdly, to ask the
Government what are their next steps, given their response to the
results of the recent consultation on
PSHE<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:56:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042475000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042475000003">On
the arguments in favour of strong PSHE, we have heard in the many
excellent speeches today the reasons for promoting the health,
well-being, personal 
<?notus-xml column=422?>safety, confidence and self-esteem among young people. I will not
rehearse those powerful contributions; I could not improve
on them, and agree with all of them. Not only in this House but in the
other place there is a strong cross-party consensus for high quality
PSHE and SRE in schools, promoted not least recently by the
international campaign to tackle violence and abuse towards women and
girls. The particular point in that recent debate was made
strongly that boys as well as girls need good sex-and-relationship
education, as the noble Baroness, Lady Kidron, rightly
warned us
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:57:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

reasons to support strong PSHE in schools—not only problems,
such as the soaring rise in sexually transmitted diseases among young
people, but in the inculcation of positive values, resilience, good
citizenship, and so on. Not least, there is evidence from young people
themselves in surveys conducted by the Youth Parliament showing strong
support for this subject in schools. Parents, too, in many surveys,
including on Mumsnet, overwhelmingly said that they want this provided
for their children in schools. Teachers, too, and even the Government
have conceded, in Elizabeth Truss’s Written Statement on the
results of the PSHE consultation
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13042475000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042475000027">“all

to the crucial question: whether the objective that we all share can be
achieved without statutory underpinning. First, as we have
heard, we know that the teaching of PSHE is at best patchy. The Ofsted
report in 2010 suggested that provision was at least good in
three-quarters of schools, but the survey did not include any school in
special measures or under notice to improve, so that figure is likely
to be a gross overestimate. Even so, it means that at the very least a
quarter of schools are not providing good PSHE. Secondly, from our
experience in government we know that left to their own devices, we do
not  see the improvement that we want from schools. In
government we got consensus for statutory sex-and-relationship
education as a first step to statutory PSHE, but unfortunately that
fell away in the
wash<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:59:10"></hs_TimeCode>. Finally,
the respondents to the consultation showed that 78%
supported statutory PSHE or at least SRE, recognising that the
necessary consistency and quality in these subjects will not come from
schools left to their own
devices.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042475000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042475000006">In
conclusion, given the Government’s position, despite that result
on the survey they will not make this subject statutory, at the very
least will the Minister first pull back from watering down the
compulsory sex-and-relationship education as outlined in the national
curriculum consultation and instead strengthen the factual content and
build in a strong relationship component? Secondly, will he take up the
suggestion of the National Children’s Bureau and others to make
an explicit link between PSHE and the national curriculum when they
publish the national curriculum document?</hs_para>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord
Nash):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all those who have taken part in
the debate, and particularly the 
<?notus-xml column=423?>noble Baroness, Lady Massey, for raising this important issue. I know of
her long-standing personal commitment to ensure that children not only
receive an excellent academic education, but learn the soft skills so
that they can be “rounded and grounded”. I find myself in
agreement with most of what has been said today. I agree with the noble
Baroness that PSHE is not just a single subject, but a concept that
should be part of the life blood of all schools, and that every school
should have a clear PSHE ethos and programme. I want to assure noble
Lords that I will use every opportunity to exhort all schools to do
this and we will consider carefully what noble Lords have said
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:01:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

we<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:01:53"></hs_TimeCode> believe that
teachers need the flexibility to decide what to teach and how to teach
it in ways that are appropriate. I will agree to meet the noble
Baroness, interested Peers and other parties to discuss this important
issue because there is no question that high quality PSHE education is
vital to equip children and young people with the knowledge and skills
they need. That is why we have outlined in the introduction to the new
national curriculum our expectation that schools should teach PSHE by
drawing on good practice. All young people should benefit from high
quality PSHE education, including sex-and-relationship education. It is
the Government’s aim to empower schools to deliver this as part
of what my noble friend Lady Perry called a “broad and
balanced”
curriculum<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:02:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

distinguish here between the national curriculum and the wider school
curriculum. Over time, the national curriculum has extended to cover
more subjects, prescribing more outcomes, and taking up more school
time. The Government launched their review of the national curriculum
to achieve two goals: first, to set out the core knowledge that pupils
should have that is on a par with other high performing countries; and,
secondly, to slim it down by reducing prescription, thus allowing
teachers more flexibility and freedom to exercise their professional
judgment. We know that international evidence shows that the best
school systems in the world devolve more autonomy to the professionals
working on the ground. Our overall reduction in prescription will give
teachers greater flexibility in the way they teach, allowing them
better to tailor their curriculum and to engage students in the
classroom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:03:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

programme, which has been built on the excellent work done by the
previous Government, is about sponsors taking over the running of
poorly performing schools that are often in deprived areas. Many of the
areas will, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, touched on, have a high
incidence of poor parenting, teenage pregnancy, absent fathers, drug
and alcohol abuse and gang issues. As the noble Baroness, Lady Massey,
said, it is a complex world. Running programmes that empower pupils to
combat these issues is second nature to the sponsors and to many other
schools in such areas. We want to build on this good practice to enable
and exhort all schools to follow what good schools do in a way that is
appropriate to them. We feel that the danger with a box-ticking
approach is that schools will revert to the minimum provision, whereas
our ambition, while recognising that we are a long way short of it at
the moment, is that all schools should provide far more than that. For 
<?notus-xml column=424?>many children in situations where family life has collapsed and religion
plays no part in their lives, their school represents the only solid
brick they have.</hs_para>

to investigate the gang activity in one particular area of London. What
I discovered was, frankly, frightening and deeply disturbing. One of
the important things that any school in an area such as this should do
is provide strategies for preventing their students being recruited
into gangs, which is happening at an increasingly young age. However, a
school in a leafy suburb probably has other issues to worry about. It
is horses for courses, and we want our schools to be free to adapt
their provision accordingly. However, our approach is that we should
not legislate for PSHE, particularly when the needs of individual
pupils vary so widely. We trust teachers and head teachers to provide
the PSHE that is relevant and necessary in their own school, but we
plan to set high expectations.</hs_para>

of PSHE have a statutory basis elsewhere in the national curriculum.
For example, science covers the biological aspects of reproduction and
the life cycle at key stages 2 and 3. Science also covers issues of
health and drugs, ensuring pupils are taught about such topics as the
impact of diet, exercise, drugs and lifestyle on the way their body
functions, and the effects of drugs on behaviour, health and life
processes. In PE, pupils are taught to become,</hs_para>

noble Lords, including the noble Baroness, Lady Kidron, and the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester, spoke most convincingly of the
necessity of good sex-and-relationship education, which is one of the
most important aspects of PSHE and is compulsory in maintained
secondary schools. All schools must have an up-to-date policy in this
regard. One of the cornerstones of this education is parental
involvement and consultation. The guidance covers a broad range of
topics and stresses the need for pupils to be taught to develop a
strong moral framework to guide their decisions, judgments and
behaviour.</hs_para>

issue of violence against women was highlighted internationally in
February by the powerful One Billion Rising campaign. Young people need
to be aware of these important issues and our guidance provides a

evidence that links teacher quality to pupils’ attainment. The

Lee of Trafford:</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to lead
today’s debate on maximising tourism’s potential. I think
I am right in saying that it is just over two years since we had a
debate on tourism in the House of Lords. It is a particular pleasure
for me to see that the debate will be replied to by my noble friend
Lord Gardiner of Kimble. I know from private discussions I have had
with him just how committed he is to the tourism industry. We wish him
well in climbing the greasy pole so that he is able to influence policy
to an even greater extent in the future. I also welcome so many
colleagues who have a particular interest in
tourism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:14:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

interest as the chairman of  the Association of Leading Visitor
Attractions. The association comprises 50 members, all of whom attract
more than 1 million visitors a year, and we now have seven members in
Scotland. Globally, tourism is probably the world’s largest
growth industry, with a huge potential. At present, something like 20%
of the residents of the United States, 34% of French residents and 13%
of Japanese residents take holidays abroad. In China the comparative
figure is only 4.3%, while in Brazil it is 2.7%, and India 1.2%. One
can see the huge potential that is to come. In the United Kingdom,
tourism is our sixth-largest industry, with a turnover of £134
billion, providing 2.7 million jobs, which represents 9.1% of the
workforce. Over a third of all the new jobs created in the past
year—180,000—were actually created in tourism. The beauty
of the tourism industry in terms of employment is that it is capable of
taking in both unskilled and very highly skilled
workers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:16:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

international and national backdrop, successive Governments and
politicians have repeatedly failed to take tourism seriously. I believe
that it is the number one industry in more parliamentary constituencies
than any other individual industry. Yet,  
<?notus-xml column=427?>in the 2010 election, not one word was said about tourism in any of the
three major parties’ manifestos. We have the
occasional speech supporting tourism by the Prime
Minister of the day, and there it ends, with little follow-through.
Until the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer really get
the message on tourism and drive policy forward as a priority, little
is likely to change. We also need much greater co-ordination across
government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:16:59"></hs_TimeCode>. Too
many messages and actions are negative and there are too many
restrictive
barriers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:17:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is not mentioned in the title of the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport. Funding for VisitBritain and VisitEngland has been steadily
reduced, and there is a threat to reduce it even further. Today, I
gather that in a speech made at the British Museum, the Secretary of
State queried the economic benefits of the arts. The chairmanship of
VisitBritain is seen as a job that takes six days a month. That is
quite ridiculous, given the size and scale of our industry. On value
added tax, out of 27 EU countries, the United Kingdom is one of only
four—and the only major tourism destination—to charge
full-rate VAT on accommodation. Independent studies have shown that
reducing VAT to 5% would create 80,000 new jobs and generate an
additional £2.6 billion for the Treasury.</hs_para>

has successfully boosted its tourism industry by reducing VAT and
abolishing air passenger duty. We had a separate debate on this a few
weeks ago. Since 2007, air passenger duty has been increased by 360%,
which means that for a Chinese family of four wanting to visit the
United Kingdom, the duty would be something like £368. On visas,
although there has been a modest improvement, the procedures are still
expensive and burdensome, particularly for Chinese visitors. It is
hardly surprising that France has been attracting something like six
times as many visitors as we have. Moreover, there were the recent
comments by the Home Secretary on possible changes with regard to visas
for Brazil, which have not been seen to be helpful. I believe that we
will have an Oral Question in the House on this matter
tomorrow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:19:04"></hs_TimeCode>. With
regard to airports, despite the urgent need for new runway capacity in

overwhelming arguments that a move to double summer time, allowing
greater daylight activity, would significantly boost tourism and, of
course, road safety, no Government seem to have the will to take

ask my party, and others advocating a mansion tax, whether they have
really thought through the implications. The owners of historical

had two specific aims when I was Secretary of State, the first being
that I should sign all the letters concerning tourism, which is
normally left to a junior Minister. If the Secretary of State signs the
letter in interministerial correspondence, all the other Secretaries of
State have to sign the letter. I thought that was a wonderful
“Yes Minister” device to force Cabinet-level Ministers to
understand the importance of tourism and hospitality and to not let
them delegate it to a junior Minister. Secondly, my small and simple
target was to speak at the CBI conference on the importance of tourism,
hospitality and leisure, because it is a genuine sunrise industry and a
great job creator. I decided that being on the CBI agenda would get
tourism and hospitality where they needed to be. I am delighted to say
that I secured that small target as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:22:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042484000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042484000011">My
small specific target today—declaring my interest as chancellor

warmly congratulate the Secretary of State on her speech today, which I
think the noble Lord did not entirely understand. She spoke about
understanding the economic potential which the arts and culture offer,
both directly and indirectly. They are not an add-on, they are
fundamental to our success as a nation. Culture does not simply have a
role to play in bringing about a return to growth, it should be central
to these efforts. Culture, as part of tourism and hospitality, is
evidently critical. I was delighted she made the speech at the British
Museum, which was founded by a lottery and jeered at by someone from my
former constituency in Farnham, William Cobbett, who asked,
“What manner of interest is that to the common man?”. All

also welcome the noble Lord, Lord Gardiner, because of his background

too, have been listening to what the Secretary of State had to say
today about the economic impact  of the arts. She said one
thing that almost had me cheering: she wants “participants not
bystanders”. If ever there was a compliment to tourism, it is
that. I do not make any partisan point in this because, frankly, I am

tourism has been a partner in economic development, and £24
million of partnership funding from VisitBritain has gone to the
commercial sector. As a result of the activities of VisitBritain over a
four-year period, £100 million has gone into a marketing
programme and that has directly contributed £900
million to the UK tourism industry. That is a stunning return on
investment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042484000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042484000019">If
we look at the impact of tourism on jobs and growth in the economy, it
contributes £115 billion  to the UK’s GDP and
employs 2.6 million people. Internationally, tourism employment
outstrips car and chemical manufacturing in terms of the number of
people employed. It is seen in other countries as a major instrument of
growth, but we consign it to the cuddly fringes of government. This is
an industry that can bring serious economic growth; 9% of the UK
economy comes from tourism. One job in every three 
<?notus-xml column=430?>created between 2009 and 2011 was in tourism. Another key figure is that
44% of those employed in tourism are under the age of

want economic growth in this country; we want it outside the south-east
of England; we want it in Cornwall, Devon, the north of Scotland, the
Welsh valleys and everywhere else. Tourism can bring that, but it will
never have the full impact that it could have if it is consigned to the
outer edges of government policy. We laud UKTI in our economic debates;
we should be lauding VisitBritain, British tourism and the many
hundreds of thousands of people who make it one of our great success

entry first, the World Economic Forum’s latest competitiveness
rankings show that the UK has fallen from 22nd to 46th in terms of its
visa requirements. China’s burgeoning middle class spends around
three times as much as other tourists. However, the requirement to
apply for two European visas—one for the 26 Schengen countries
and one for Britain—is a turn-off. Four out of five do not come
to the UK, representing an opportunity cost of more than £1
billion annually. The Government are working hard to improve the
process, including investigating partnering with other European
countries to provide a one-stop shop for visas, whereby, even though
the screening processes are different, documents and information can be
provided just once. Whatever the solution, we need to be an integral
part of any European tour rather than an optional
add-on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042484000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042484000023">Turning
to the welcome that tourists receive, in the past we have seen long
queues clogging up border control. Here, too, I have been encouraged by
progress at the UK Border Force. The UKBF should be given the necessary
resource, including the ability to get more and better data quickly,
combined with a flexible operating culture to hit tough queue targets,

return to the official topic of this debate. There are things that the
Government can do or continue to do. The GREAT campaign was a good
first step, but we must regard marketing the UK as a positive
investment rather than an unwelcome expense. Are we really spending
enough to maximise the Olympic legacy? Tourism is not a “nice to
have”. It is the UK’s third largest export earner. More
than that, tourist activity is often the first step to future economic
activity.

major initiative through the VisitBritain partnership: a new four-year
£100 million marketing budget to deliver 4 million
new visitors, generate an extra £2 billion in visitor spending
and create 50,000 vitally needed jobs. It is a start. The south-west
smiled; at last there was some recognition of the need to invest in one
of its most important wealth-generating sectors—70,000 jobs in
Devon  and Somerset and more than 25% of Cornwall’s

tourism has moved a very long way from the traditional bucket-and-spade
image of the 1970s and 1980s. On a wet day, to match a genuine
world-class environment, many of the covered attractions are also world
class, including the Eden Project, the National Marine Aquarium and
dedicated local family businesses such as those in my area of north
Devon. These include the Milky Way and the BIG Sheep, both of which
were created through diversification from long-standing traditional

from relying upon tourists arriving between Easter and the beginning of
September, the south-west has been moving towards an all-year season.
This has been based upon widening the scope of the offering, coupled
with investment in quality and skills. Marketing has been adapted to
cater for “just in time” bookings, and branding has been
based on traditional values such as loyalty. Repeat visitors are easier
to attract than
new.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042484000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042484000030">Examples
of how this strategy has worked can be seen in two sectors. The first
is food and drink. The vital link between tourism and locally sourced,
safe products has proved a dynamic area for growth. The south-west is
now every foodie’s dream, with the UK’s most innovative
cuisine, which is locally sourced, ethically produced and, importantly,
prepared by fantastic home-grown talent. A clutch of Michelin-starred
chefs have recognised this powerful market, with Jamie
Oliver, Gary Rhodes, Rick Stein, Michael Caines,
Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and many others enjoying
successful recent openings.</hs_para>

exciting story, however, is in the growth of speciality tourism. There
is no better example of this than what can now be seen in the great
spring gardens throughout our region. These already attract more than
30% of all our visitors and this figure is not only rising but can
ensure repeat visits both during the year, and year after year. There
are in Devon and Cornwall some of the greatest spring gardens in the
world. I say “in the world” for their only rivals are in
the Himalayas. But we need not go that far; it is a very long way and
expensive to get there. Go instead to Devon, to the Royal Horticultural
Society garden at 
<?notus-xml column=432?>Rosemoor. Go to, besides many others, Caerhays on the southern Cornish
coast, where there abound acre upon acre of camellias, rhododendrons
and magnolias 70ft high. Its splendour, magnificence and the beautiful
setting, once seen, are never forgotten. See Naples and die, but
perhaps also see Caerhays and die. All these points underpin the fact
that it will take more than  the recession or bad weather to
dampen the spirit of south-west tourism.</hs_para>

congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Lee of Trafford, on initiating this

of the Heritage Railway Association and as a trustee of the Science
Museum Group. Britain’s tourist potential depends on many
factors, but principally on attractive destinations, such as those in
the south-west that we have just heard about, enjoyable experiences in
terms of where to stay and what to do, and ease of access. With more
time, I would describe the huge contribution that our
museums—the five museums in the Science Museum Group now attract

attracting visitors to
Britain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042484000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042484000033">Railways
were Britain’s contribution to the development of the modern
world. Their history is rooted in the work of British engineers and
entrepreneurs who financed and built railways in so many countries
whose citizens are now visiting Britain as tourists. We were not only
good at building and exporting railways but we are, today, very good at
running heritage railways. There are well over 100 around the United
Kingdom, and they are increasingly popular. They do their best to offer
an attractive face to their customers and an enjoyable travelling
experience. Many provide excellent dining cars on the trains, often
offering local produce as a feature. There are even a few boutique
hotels around the country where the guests sleep in historic railway
carriages, even though the carriages never leave the sidings on which
they are permanently
stabled.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042484000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042484000034">Heritage

Faulkner of Worcester:</Member></B> My Lords, I was just describing to
the Committee how heritage railways are being restored in various parts
of the country. I mentioned the Bluebell line and pointed out that the
North Yorkshire Moors Railway is now bringing thousands of people into
the town of Whitby, with the effect of keeping cars out of the North
York Moors National Park and providing a new journey experience
for people. 
<?notus-xml column=433?>Plans are also in hand with grant funding to extend the Swanage Railway
to connect with the South West Main Line to London at Wareham.
Increasingly, heritage railways are being used by tourists for access
as well as for an enjoyable day out. These developments are the subject
of an inquiry being held by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on
Heritage Rail, of which I am vice-chairman, into the social and
economic value of heritage railways. I look forward to sending the
Minister the group’s report later this year, which will give an
indication of how important heritage railways are to the tourist
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:48:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000037">In
conclusion, I would just remind the Minister that these railways are
run largely by volunteers and operate commercially, without recourse to
government for subsidy. They work with the local community and are
themselves major tourist attractions. They ask for little more than to
be able to continue to invest and develop, and make the plea of most
small and medium-sized enterprises, to be relieved of as much of their
administrative and regulatory burden as possible. A little moral
encouragement and support would be welcome too, to demonstrate how much
this huge voluntary effort is appreciated by those responsible for
tourism

jobs. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Lee, for proposing this debate and
for making the important point that we do not take tourism seriously
enough. It does not get the credit that it is due or the priority that
it deserves. We have dropped from sixth to 11th place in the latest WEF
travel and tourism report in terms of tourism competitiveness. We are
the sixth most visited destination in the world, but we are losing

As we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Lee, we have the Royal
Family, museums, music, theatre, London, the countryside, the arts and
sport—you name it. However, the Eiffel Tower in Paris is the
most photographed building in the world, while the second most
photographed is right here—the Houses of Parliament. Why is
that? I agree that we need to do something about
infrastructure. Can the Minister say when we are going to do something
about our airports, perhaps by providing a third runway at Heathrow and
probably the estuary airport as  well? It is not a question of
either/or; we
desperately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:52:45"></hs_TimeCode> need
both.</hs_para>

the main reason that Paris gets more visitors than London is visas, as
every survey states. The main reason for that is that Europe has the
European Union’s Schengen visa and we do not belong to Schengen.
Why is that? It is because we want to maintain our own border controls.
Is that not a joke? We are incapable of maintaining our border
controls. We do not even know how many illegal immigrants there are.
The UK Border Agency has just been disbanded because it was not fit for
purpose. We still do not have exit checks for people leaving this
country. Can the Minister say when we are going to institute exit
checks to keep control of our borders? With Schengen, one visa covers
25 countries, while here there is one visa for only the UK and Ireland.
The single visa for 25 countries covers 85% of
Europe’s population and GDP. We are worried about security and
asylum seekers, but illegal immigrants do not hold Schengen visas. They
do not have any visas. The Centre for European Policy Studies has
written an excellent report on
th<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:53:48"></hs_TimeCode>e
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000044">We are
losing out in this area. Figures on the number of UK visas issued over
the past five years have remained stagnant at 2 million, while Schengen
visas over the five-year period to 2010 have increased from 8 million
to 12 million, an increase of 50%. I do not understand this. The cost
of a Schengen visa for 25 countries is cheaper than the price of one of
our short-term visas for the UK and Ireland. We are part of the
Schengen co-operation on matters of criminality, so why do we not bite
the bullet and join the Schengen scheme before it is too late? The iron
structure in Paris will then not be the number one most photographed
structure in the world; this building will
be.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_24_PT_1/3104F9339B268ECEAB91C7B3BE12152CDE1EF259" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 April 2013">Wednesday,

Gordon of Strathblane:</Member></B> My Lords, I join noble Lords in
congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Lee, on securing this debate, and I
endorse the broad theme that we all feel that tourism should be given a
higher priority. Let us take as read the figures which have been given;
I want simply to add a gloss or two. First 
<?notus-xml column=435?>of all, on priority, let us take the example given by the noble
Baroness, Lady Bottomley, when she was Secretary of State. It would be
useful if every Bill being brought forward by any Government passed a
“tourism test” before it could be agreed. Every
Government should look at the effect on tourism, our most important
industry, before they implement anything, whether that be visa controls
or whatever.</hs_para>

like to make is about jobs. People tend to forget that jobs in tourism
are increasingly becoming high-quality jobs. Chefs are becoming
celebrities, while further down the food chain, if that is not too
horrible a pun, people in the tourism industry are at least learning to
behave well towards others, which surely is a very beneficial outcome.
They are also jobs which cannot be replaced abroad or digitised or
computerised out of existence. The service industries will always
require human beings, so these are jobs for the long term.</hs_para>

tourism which I think is underrated is the benefit to the indigenous
population. Let me take a rather extreme example. When I was chairman
of the Scottish Tourist Board, I chaired a conference under the
auspices of UNESCO in Scotland called “Peace Through
Tourism”. One of the speakers was the then David Trimble, who
claimed—I am sure that he was exaggerating—that Northern
Ireland and Scotland were broadly similar. However, let us give him the
benefit of the doubt. He went on to say that the income per capita from
tourism in Northern Ireland was one quarter of that of Scotland, and
that Northern Ireland’s target of doubling tourism income was
not an unreasonable one. Funnily enough, I bumped into him when we were
in the Chamber for the vote, and he told me that with the coming of
peace, Northern Ireland is well on the way to reaching that
target.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042481000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000048">Let
us look at the effect of the Olympics on Londoners; as a result, they
must feel a lot more proud of living in London. It should be hoped that
things like the riots that erupted only the previous year are less
likely if people feel better about the place they are living in. That
is certainly true of my native city of Glasgow. The great thing about
promoting Glasgow as a tourist destination is not so much that we have
four times the number of four-star beds than we had 15 years ago, but
that Glaswegians themselves have started to believe in their own city
again. You cannot tell other people that somewhere is a wonderful place
without starting to believe it yourself.</hs_para>

of infrastructure on tourism as well. West End theatres would go
bankrupt if we did not have tourism, so Londoners benefit from the fact
that the tourist industry subsidises, if you like, their own enjoyment.
My son, his wife and my two grandchildren live on the island of Iona,
with a total population of around 90 people. However, there is a very
good ferry service. Why is that? It is because the island is a tourist
destination. The benefits of tourism to indigenous populations are
huge.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042481000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000050">In
conclusion, and bearing in mind that the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, is to
follow me in a few minutes,  I would say this by way of
compromise on British Summer Time. The current chairman of
VisitScotland has advanced the notion that we should adopt British 
<?notus-xml column=436?>Summer Time on March 1. I know that there are apprehensions in Scotland
about the effect of that, but I feel that if we moved BST forward to
that date and saw the universal benefit that would deliver, it would
pave the way for the adoption of double summer time throughout the
country.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13042481000170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000170">5.58

Committee more aware of how important historic buildings and gardens
are to the British tourist industry. It can be shown that
Britain’s heritage, specifically its stately homes, castles and
designed landscape, is the single most quoted reason for foreign
visitors coming to Britain. According to VisitBritain, in 2011, some
9 million foreigners visited one or more of Britain’s
historic houses, contributing £6,500 million to the economy.
Here I must declare an interest in that I own a grade 1 listed castle
and country park in Scotland that attracts 60,000 visitors a year. I am
also a member of the Historic Houses Association, whose members are
those who still own and live in their historic piles. Although I am

many years now, the Historic Houses Association has been trying to
convince successive Governments of the importance of historic houses
and castles to the British economy, how many foreign tourists we
attract and how much our presence benefits local hotels, shops and
pubs. According to its figures, the total expenditure generated by
inbound tourist visits to privately owned historic houses is
£1.6 billion per annum. The appropriate Minister for Tourism

most cases learnt to love, while continuing to lose money every year.

am right in saying that no stately home in Britain that is open to the
public actually makes a trading profit. The ones that are surviving do
so only because the owner has other sources of income or can resort to
selling a Titian or a Van Dyck every other year to fill the gap. Nearly
all the historic buildings in private ownership are now open to the
public but the income derived from them only helps defray the cost of
keeping the house wind and watertight. On top of that, we must pay VAT
on all structural improvements we make to the building, while our rich
neighbour can build himself a brand new, comfortable, warm house
completely
VAT-free.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000059">Now
we hear that the Government intend to cap sideways loss relief, which

a poorer place and its attraction as a tourist destination is

Tanlaw:</Member></B> My Lords, we all thank the noble Lord, Lord Lee,
for giving us the opportunity to speak on this subject. Foreign
tourists and UK citizens alike are generally in agreement that it is
vital that the pound sterling remains throughout the UK as it is and
that the timescales throughout remain synchronised as they are, even
though they are the wrong ones. However, the threat of Scottish
independence has created some doubts on both these matters. I am often
asked which way I will vote on independence. I say to Scottish
residents that if you believe in a Scottish pound that is not
underwritten by the Bank of England—I do not believe in
that—the answer is to vote yes and emigrate with your savings in
pounds
sterling.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000064">The
noble Lord, Lord Lee, mentioned the benefit to the tourist industry in
Scotland and England of switching over to single/double summer time,
something 
<?notus-xml column=438?>which some of us have advocated for years. However, if Scotland should
gain independence via the referendum and/or further devolution of other
aspects of government, may I suggest that the timescale remains an
excluded subject, as it is today? At first glance, it may seem quite
harmless to have a different timescale in Scotland to that which
applies south of the border. It would be similar, some would say, to
altering one’s watch when travelling on the Eurostar to Paris.
The same could be said of trains travelling from London to Edinburgh
with a one hour difference. The Westminster Government are intending to
spend very large sums of taxpayers’ money to build a high-speed
rail link eventually linking London and Edinburgh, resulting in a much
reduced travelling time. However, if an independent Scotland switched
to, say, single/double summer time and Westminster stubbornly stuck to
the status quo, the trains going north across the border would still
take nearly as long as they do today, thus obviating the need for an
expensive upgrade of the line.</hs_para>

if an independent Scotland chose to remain with the status quo and
Westminster went over to single/double summer time, the trains
travelling north would appear to have their time reduced by an hour,
thus again obviating the need for an expensive upgrade of the line. I
have not chosen trains as a facetious example but one in which time
change, if it is not carefully adjusted, has an effect on major capital
expenditure, which affects all taxpayers. If the Scots, in their
enthusiasm for independence, decide to change the timescale—they
may be entitled to do that if we adjust the constitution
accordingly—there will be secondary effects that will have very
severe effects on our economy. Therefore, I ask for that to be taken
into
consideration.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13042481000172" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000172">6.07

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord,
Lord Lee, for keeping this important issue in our minds and for giving
us the chance to repeat the debate that marked my first appearance on
the Front Bench. I think that my opposite number also spoke on this
subject on probably one of the first occasions that he spoke since he
joined the Chamber; so it has memories for
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000067">This
was rather a mixed debate in that we heard lusty praise for local
attractions from all a round the Committee, but many of those
attractions are outside London. That is a good thing. This is one of
the rare times when we have had a debate that has focused on
non-metropolitan issues. I am afraid that we did not come up with any
policy options, which I think was the purpose of having this debate.
Nevertheless, I think we are all agreed that it is important that there
is a policy initiative. I have to disagree with my former
Minister—the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley—who I see in
her place, as I felt that she rather overstated her praise for her
successor but four, I think. When I was researching this subject I was
struck by the fact that when the Secretary of State before the current
one left office, his parting shot was to call for new county boundary
signs, saying that the current signs greeting visitors as they travel
round are dull, often boring and do little to entice tourists. Surely
we can do better than  
<?notus-xml column=439?>that. I hope that the noble Lord will give us some idea of the policy
options available to him and his colleagues when he replies to the
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000068">I do
not have time to go through all the various issues that were raised,
and a number of them are very important but they are all around the
importance of tourism to the UK economy. It is our sixth largest
industry, third largest export earner and accounts for about 9.1% of
employment. Surely something can be done about it. The fact that it is
so joined-up suggests that it is not in its right place in the DCMS.
Something more needs to be added on top of that. I am attracted to the
idea that came up in another place that, as with architecture, one
should have tourism experts or champions in each of the policy
departments within which it operates. That is something I would like to
see.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000069">Many of
the comments today have been about policy issues to do with air
passenger duty, visas and their problems, brilliantly exposed by the
noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, and about what the Government might do to
try to resolve that. When the noble Lord replies, can he respond to the
question of whether his department has raised with the relevant
departments in transport and the Home Office the issues that are
causing such problems in the tourism area? This is important and, as
somebody said, it always gets left to the last. The current Government
and the previous Labour Government did not do enough to try to resolve
the issues and get the benefits that would come from tourism if they
were to be
resolved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000070">Regulation
in the industry is said to be difficult and overburdensome. It is
possible that that could be picked up on and put further up the agenda.
There is, of course, the question of taxation. I was attracted to the
figures that were presented, particularly around the reduction of VAT.
I know from my recent experience in Ireland, which we visit, that the
reduction there in their rate of VAT, particularly in the hospitality
industry, has had a huge impact in terms of the activity going on in
that area. It must, in some ways, be at least self-financing
there—something that we would recommend to the Government, even
though I know that the response will be that these are matters for the
Chancellor of the
Exchequer.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_24_PT_1/46592B514466E5091401EAF5D40C7CB1488033EE" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 April 2013">Wednesday,

passenger duty. This is a matter, as has already been suggested, for
the Treasury. However, we cannot look at this in isolation because we

this country does not. Furthermore, air passenger duty provided
£2.6 billion to the Treasury in 2011-12. We need to very careful
and cautious as it would be difficult to forgo this revenue without
making cuts in other areas. The matter of VAT, which was also raised,
has been examined by the Treasury. I refer to the significant VAT

seeing a significant increase in the number of visitors from
China—an increase of 20% in 2012—  
<?notus-xml column=441?>we must not underestimate the opportunity. By 2030, China will have 1.4

increase since 2008. Recent findings from the Anholt-GfK Roper Nation
Brands Index saw us move three places from 12th to ninth in terms of
international perceptions of the UK welcome, which I particularly hope
will be welcome to the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine. However, we must
do more. The tourism industry is highly competitive and we cannot
afford to be complacent.</hs_para>

nasty skin complaint which western medicine finds difficult to deal
with. I am also the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party in

first question for the Minister is: why does the EU’s law of

ourselves the rules governing the manufacture and use of herbal

Brussels?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000091">The
sorry saga starts with a new directive in 2001, number 83 of that year,
which was amended by Directive 2004/24/EC. Article 5(1) of Directive
2001/83/EC contained a chink of light. It goes as

the prospect arose of having to set up statutory regulation for our
herbalists. Since then there have been two Department of Health
committees and two public consultations, all of which have reported
massively in favour of herbal medicines generally, and statutory
regulation in particular. This is not surprising. A survey
commissioned by the Government’s medicines regulator, the
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency—MHRA—found that 3 million of our people had
consulted a practitioner of Chinese herbal medicine and 25 million had
bought herbal medicines over the counter in the previous two
years.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13042481000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000092">The

to these products. In order to achieve this, while at the same time
complying with EU law, some form of statutory regulation will be

I have to enter the world of rumour and conjecture because the
department has behaved in an unusually secretive and unhelpful way. For
months it has refused to answer those questions or indeed to meet Mr

far as I can see, this paralysis has been caused by Poland. It seems
that Poland had been misusing the “special needs”
provision of Article 5(1) to permit imports of cheap unauthorised
medicinal products which contained the same active ingredients, dosage
and form as drugs that were currently authorised for sale in that
country. So Poland had been approving the import and sale of unapproved
drugs, which were not medically essential for a specific patient, and
thus breaking EU law. The EU Commission took Poland to the Luxembourg
Court, which duly found against Poland.</hs_para>

this judgment which sent our Department of Health into its present
state of funk, although of course our position is entirely different
and we told the department so. However, rumour had reached the
department that the Commission regarded Mr Lansley’s statement
and promise to set up statutory regulation as a rebellious ploy to get
round its wonderful EU edict. If the UK went ahead, perhaps we would
also end up in Luxembourg, where the result is of course a foregone
conclusion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000096">Faced
with this situation, Mr McIntyre decided to take independent legal
advice from Mr David Reissner of Charles Russell LLP. Mr Reissner is an
acknowledged expert in pharmacy and healthcare law. He is chairman of
the Welsh pharmacy appeal panel and a deputy district judge. So he
knows his stuff. His opinion is clear on two issues. The first is that
herbalists have to be statutorily regulated if they are to be
authorised health professionals and thus have access to manufactured
medicines for individual patients under Article 5(1) of the directive.
Secondly, it is wholly wrong to fear that the ECJ’s ruling
against Poland for misuse of Article 5(1) could somehow be applied to
us and block our own statutory regulation. The Polish case is
irrelevant to our national position.</hs_para>

my second question to the Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Northover,
who has my sympathy as none of this is her fault, is: when will Dr
Poulter and those who advise him meet Mr McIntyre, and perhaps myself,
to sort the whole thing out? Would it not be helpful if a number of
noble Lords who are to speak today and who are interested in this
subject came too, or will the Government take the unusual step of
refusing to meet parliamentarians? What reason can there possibly be
for continuing to refuse such a meeting?</hs_para>

is much at stake here for the millions who benefit from herbal
medicines for a range of common ailments which are not particularly
well managed by conventional medicine. If statutory regulation fails to
go ahead, a wide range of herbal medicines supplied by practitioners to
their patients will be lost. The directive has already stopped
practitioners prescribing herbal medicines made by manufacturers and
herbal suppliers for prescriptions to individual patients. Also stopped
have been third-party herbal prescription services which supply
individual prescriptions to named patients at the practitioner’s
request. Without statutory regulation, all that remains are herbal
medicines prepared by practitioners on their own premises. This will
ultimately put a great many practitioners and their suppliers out of
business. Statutory regulation will instead provide much needed support
for these thousands of small and medium-sized
enterprises<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T18:32:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000100">Besides
all that, herbal medicine is cost-effective and should be encouraged to
go on reducing the growing NHS drug bill. That is, of course, why it is
hated by the pharmaceutical companies which appear to go to any lengths
to snuff it out. However, I will say no more about that now because I
am on best behaviour. Statutory regulation will ensure that the public
are protected from poorly trained or bogus practitioners and from
substandard herbal remedies. Without it much activity may go
underground. Of course, I admit that there is the occasional
unfortunate case with herbal medicines but they are minuscule,
microscopic and invisible compared with the thousands of patients who
are mistreated under our National Health
Service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T18:32:51"></hs_TimeCode>.

only remains for me to thank other noble Lords who are to speak in this

lack of evidence for alternative medicine in this House, someone gets
up, as the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, has now done, and says,
“But I was cured” by whatever it is—Chinese herbs
or homeopathy. On the last occasion I raised it in the House, the noble
Baroness, Lady Corston, praised homeopathy and said that she hoped that
my well known views, which she seemed to suggest were somewhat
eccentric, would be ignored by the Secretary of State for Health. They
are not entirely eccentric views; they are the views of the scientific
consensus.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000105" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000105">The
noble Lord, Lord Rees, spoke about homeopathy at a time when he was
still president of the Royal Society. He said that if homeopathy worked
other than as a placebo all the laws of science would have to be
repealed. There is not, to my knowledge, a single fellow of the Royal
Society who supports either homeopathy or Chinese herbal medicine. The
most detailed, careful, scientific, blind trials have confirmed that
view. Only recently, the Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies, said
she was perpetually surprised that the National Health Service still
funds homeopathy. I recommend to those who advocate alternative
medicine the book <I>Trick or Treatment?</I> by Professor Ernst and
Simon Singh. It is extremely well researched and a very objective
treatment, which does acknowledge when there may occasionally be some
possible benefit, but on the whole their views and conclusions are
quite plain. There are many reasons why many people feel better after
treatment—often because placebos do work, whether after taking a
homeopathic dose or treatment with herbal medicine. Private
practitioners of alternative medicine often have more time for patients
and may be good at tender loving care, which is a very important
feature of good medical care. Often, people get better
anyway.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000106">Anecdote
is not scientific evidence. People say, “Well, does it matter if
treatment works only as a placebo?”. It does matter. Faith
healing sometimes works, if people believe sufficiently strongly. In
parts of the world, so does witchcraft. However, it really matters if
people who are seriously ill do not take scientifically proved
treatment, or if pharmacists, for example,  prescribe
homeopathic pills for malaria. Dr Wakefield was believed because many
mothers reported that their children showed signs of autism after
taking MMR. I remember a “Panorama” programme which
interviewed several parents who told how this happened to their
children. The programme was extremely sympathetic to Dr
Wakefield’s views, and stressed how kind Dr Wakefield listened
so carefully to these parents, but completely ignored the overwhelming
scientific evidence that there was no established link between MMR and
autism. In fact, the anti-vaccination campaign was organised by a group
of people who were strong believers in alternative medicine. Today, we
see the consequences in
Wales.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000107">Quack
medicine is not harmless. We should not make it respectable by
statutory registration, which suggests that it is not only respectable

delighted to speak in this debate. I had ministerial responsibility for
the regulation of herbal medicines  a long time ago, but it was
at the time when we first 
<?notus-xml column=448?>discussed the European directive. While I actually agree with almost
everything that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, has said, I do not quite
agree with his opening remarks about the benefits or otherwise of the
European Union. However, he speaks with a great deal of wisdom about a
problem that we
face<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T18:42:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Taverne. I have always enjoyed his
interventions in your Lordships’ House on the side of rational
thinking. However, I must depart from him today. Whether or not herbal
medicines are effective, and that is of course open to legitimate
debate, the issue we face is that an MHRA survey has shown that about a
quarter of the population use over-the-counter herbal medicines. If
that is going to continue, as I suspect it will, surely there is a
responsibility on the part of the Government to make sure that
arrangements are in place to ensure that they are safe as far as they
can be, and that those people who prescribe and dispense such medicines
are appropriately qualified and regulated. If the statutory register is
not now to go ahead, one is left with the problem of the public
continuing to purchase such medicines, as I am sure they will, but
without the necessary statutory regulation. It is therefore important
that we get a clear view from the Government today as to whether they
will continue with proposals on statutory registration.</hs_para>

very difficult problem with the European directive. To an extent, the
provisions around traditional herbal medicines dealt with herbal
medicines that had been on the market for a good many years—some
15 years, I think. However, it does not deal with the issue of new
herbal medicines coming to market. For instance, if they had to go
through the whole panoply of clinical trials, the cost would be
prohibitive for a market that traditionally comprises small businesses.
Even the licensing provisions for new herbal medicines are likely to
cost several thousands of pounds. Again, that is very difficult for an
industry that is essentially
small-scale.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000119" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000119">As
a result of herbal medicines being brought within the Medicines Act
1968, which has been replaced by the European directive on traditional
herbal medicinal products, this now prevents third-party manufacturing
of herbal medicines being prescribed to patients by practitioners, as
well as individualised herbal medicines prescribed by practitioners and
manufactured by a third party. Both have been essential components in
the supply chain for the past 40 years, with many practitioners relying
on such services. Now those practitioners have to prepare medicines on
their own premises. That is a real problem if those practitioners are
not to be statutorily registered, especially in terms of public
confidence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000120" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000120">The
noble Lord, Lord Pearson, mentioned the ECJ ruling against Poland. I
thought that this ruling was in relation to the parallel import of
medicines. For the life of me, I cannot see why that should have an
impact on the proposal for the statutory registration of herbal
medicines. I know that there is an issue with parallel imports which
the Government are right to be concerned about, but this is not
essentially a matter of parallel imports.</hs_para>

register will not curtail the use of herbal medicines, but it will
increase the scope for unqualified herbalists to offer treatments and
for customers to purchase unprescribed medicines over the internet. I
know that the fear of the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, is that statutory
regulation would legitimise a practice which he has cast doubt upon.
However, I would ask him to consider the other problem, which is that
if 25% of us use herbal medicines, is it not better to accept that they
will continue to do so and put some statutory safeguards around that
practice?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000122">The
benefit of regulation is that practitioners would be regulated by an
independent regulator. I understand it is likely to be the Health and
Care Professions Council. Of course, the HCPC is in expansionist mode,
having just taken on social workers, much against my and many
others’ better judgment. If it can take on social workers, it
can certainly take on herbal medicine practitioners. Of course, the
benefit of that is that it can strike someone from the register,
prevent them from being called a herbalist, and thus give more
confidence to the public. The noble Lord, Lord Taverne, will say that I
am arguing his point for him and I recognise that by having statutory
regulation the public are likely to have more confidence, but I think
it is better that way than allowing herbal medicines to be purchased
over the internet with all the problems that can arise. Many legitimate
herbalists may go out of business, which would be a great
pity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000123">I will
end by making two points to the noble Baroness. First, why is her
department refusing to meet the campaigners and indeed the
noble Lord, Lord Pearson? As a Minister, I always met parliamentarians
if they wrote to me asking for a meeting. I am very surprised that
Ministers in the department have refused to meet the noble Lord, Lord
Pearson. That is extremely bad form. Certainly they should meet with
Michael McIntyre. I do not understand why the department has run away
from such a
meeting.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000124" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000124">Secondly,
there are obviously some very strong rumours that the department is
going to drop this proposal. If that is the case, all that I would ask
the noble Baroness is this. Would it not be sensible to meet with the
noble Lord, Lord Pearson, and Mr McIntyre before a final decision is
made? It would be only fair if there was some debate before such a
decision is
announced.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_24_PT_1/BE3BA941341FF7F66704F2AAEB352767335CB0FA" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 April 2013">Wednesday,

recognise that the Government’s progress in establishing a
statutory register for practitioners supplying unlicensed herbal
medicines is of interest both to Members of this House, as has been
demonstrated today, as well as to consumers and practitioners who use
these products. I am glad that the noble Lord was assisted by a herbal
remedy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000127" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000127">The
issue of whether herbalists and traditional Chinese medicine
practitioners should be statutorily regulated has been debated, as the
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will be well aware, since at least the House of 
<?notus-xml column=450?>Lords Science and Technology Committee report  in 2000. The
Government appreciate that there is, understandably, strong support
from many herbal practitioners for the statutory regulation of this
group, and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, has made the case as well. In
addition, many consumers of herbal medicines wish to access unlicensed
manufactured herbal medicines. As noble Lords will be aware, on 16
February 2011, the Government announced that they intended to take
forward the regulation of herbal medicine practitioners and traditional
Chinese medicine practitioners specifically with regard to the use of
unlicensed herbal medicines within their
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000128">At
the time that the decision to take forward the regulation of this group
was made, the Government’s intention was to allow herbal
practitioners to once again lawfully source unlicensed manufactured
herbal medicines. That is something which practitioners have not been
able to do since April 2011, when a European directive made it illegal
for herbal practitioners in the UK to source unlicensed manufactured
herbal medicines for their
patients.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000129" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000129">Where
the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, criticised the EU, others may well feel
that the EU can offer a level of protection, depending on one’s
point of view. Perhaps I can address here the issue of subsidiarity.
The noble Lord suggested that this meant that it was not applying to
herbal medicines. The principle of subsidiarity does indeed apply. The
directive makes provision to facilitate the free movement of herbal
medicines while ensuring a high level of safe public health. It was
thought that the directive strikes the right balance of rules to
facilitate free movement to the EU level, while maintaining flexibility
through domestic implementing
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000130">Since
the announcement in February 2011, the Department of Health has been
working with officials in the devolved Administrations and the Health
and Care Professions Council to look at establishing a statutory
register for herbal practitioners supplying unlicensed herbal
medicines, along with a strengthened system for regulating medicinal
products, to enable consumers to have safe access to unlicensed
manufactured herbal
medicines.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000131" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000131">This
process continues to be complex and lengthy and, with regret, I must
say that we are not in a position to consult on proposed legislation.
My noble friend Lord Colwyn asked about what “going out to
consult” meant. As announced in the Written Ministerial
Statement in February 2011, any proposed statutory legislation has to
go out to an open and public consultation. I hope that that clarifies
the issue and reassures him. However, I am sure the noble Lord, Lord
Pearson, will appreciate that it would be irresponsible for the
Government to undertake to alter the status of a group of workers
without first ensuring that the policy and final decision offers an
appropriate form of regulation and ensures the proposals adequately
address the risks posed to consumers of unlicensed herbal
medicines.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000132">My
noble friend Lord Colwyn flags the serious dangers associated with all
medicines. Nothing is risk-free, whether it is conventional or
complementary medicine, 
<?notus-xml column=451?>or doing nothing at all. That is why it is important that there is
careful regulation and consideration of all of these
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042481000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000133">We
recognise the need to balance the economic wish of practitioners to
continue to supply unlicensed herbal medicines and the wish of some
consumers to have continued access to them against any risks
identified. We understand that there is a strong desire in the field to
bring the matter to a conclusion both for practitioners and the public.
However, it is clear that there is a potential risk to public health
where practitioners supply unlicensed herbal medicines which may be
potent. For example, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory
Agency has recently become aware that an unlicensed herbal product
containing aconite, a prescription-only medicine in the UK which can
cause serious and potentially fatal adverse reactions if consumed, is
being marketed and prescribed by traditional Chinese medicine
practitioners for the treatment of migraine. It is therefore crucial
that the nature of the regulation in the sector is carefully thought

I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for her answers, but can she

that the Government are not going forward with it? I am not clear about
this. The noble Baroness has said that she is not in a position to

herbal formulations on their own premises for use with their own
patients. I also want to make it clear that the previous announcement
made by the Government and any steps taken to regulate herbal
practitioners should not be seen as an endorsement of the efficacy of
herbal medicines either way. The Government do not have a view on the
efficacy of herbal medicines that do not have a full marketing
authorisation; in other words, a product licence. However, the
Government do recognise that members of the public may wish to purchase
complementary or alternative treatments, including herbal medicines.

use of complementary or alternative medicines to find a practitioner

Public Health England (PHE) is that in 2009 the Health Protection
Agency (now PHE) conducted a costing review of chlamydia screening,
which estimated that a cost of £33 per screening episode was
achievable. The review calculated that total cost of screening 35% of

made. Using the figure of £33 per test this equates to an annual
cost of £65 million. However, this figure may be an
overestimate as since 2009 efficiencies should have resulted from
changes to the way the National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) is

comparative value of screening only those young adults recently treated

asymptomatic infections. The aim of the NCSP is to control chlamydia
through early detection and treatment of asymptomatic infections in
young adults. The majority of infections detected through the programme
are in young adults who have not had a previous diagnosis. Therefore
restricting screening to those previously diagnosed would have a
limited effect on the onward transmission of chlamydia and on the
harmful consequences of chlamydia infection. The opportunity to deliver
wider sexual health behavioural interventions would also be limited if
