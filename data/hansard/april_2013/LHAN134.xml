personal journey that she made, particularly at that time, from the
grocer’s shop in Grantham to the highest office in our land, was
a truly remarkable one. The outlines of that journey are well known.
Margaret Hilda Roberts was born in Grantham in 1925. Head girl of her
grammar school, she went to Oxford during the war, graduating with a
degree in chemistry. In 1951, she met and married Denis, the rock of
her life for more than 50 years. In 1953, she gave birth to twins,
Carol and Mark, to whom we extend our deepest condolences, along with
the rest of her family and her many friends.</hs_para>

Parliament in 1959, she was in the Cabinet by 1970. Even today, 11
years from first election to the Cabinet would seem swift, but 50 years
ago, for one of just a handful of female MPs, it was extraordinary.
Even more remarkably, by 1975 this non-establishment figure had become
leader of the establishment party, confounding the predictions of many.
Those same people then foretold a quick exit. They foretold her never
reaching the steps of No. 10. In fact, she herself said that she
believed she would never see a woman Prime Minister in her lifetime.

do not, of course, explain the reason for her success. They do not
capture the strength of her personality, the beam of the spotlight and
the force of her will that I remember vibrating through the government
departments where I worked in the 1980s. Nor, I think, can we measure
the extent of her achievements without first understanding the grim
inheritance of the 1970s. Successive Governments had tried and failed
to tackle our economic and political woes. We had become the sick man
of Europe. People asked, not fancifully, whether Britain was indeed
possible to govern. We were a divided country, and at times our very
future seemed to hang in the balance. That is the background against
which the sifting process of history will make its judgments. That is
the background which helps to explain her approach and makes her
achievements stand out so
clearly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T14:40:43"></hs_TimeCode>. She did
not take the easy way. She certainly did not take the consensual way.

harnessed to the purpose of making Britain great

economic policies were needed to turn the country around. She knew that
the status quo was unsustainable and that some things had to change.
Her programme of deregulation and denationalisation, and of reducing
the power of trade unions, was painful, particularly in some parts of
our country, but it made Britain a global competitor once
again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T14:41:57"></hs_TimeCode>. The
recapture of the Falkland Islands, her resistance to the IRA despite
the high price paid by many of those closest to her, her friendship
with President Reagan and her shared vision for a world free of the
Cold War made Britain once again a world leader. The threat of nuclear
war that seemed to hang over us in the early 1980s was lifted. It was
indeed an iron lady who helped draw back the iron curtain from eastern
Europe, extending freedom to millions. In those countries, too, she

is true that great leaders are not always easy people. I think that it
is fair to say that patience was not a virtue that Mrs Thatcher had in
abundance, and that she did not always instantly get the point. The
great Ronnie Millar, who helped with her speeches for many years, told
me the lovely story of an occasion when he was trying to reassure a
rather nervous Margaret Thatcher with some soothing words just before
she was due to speak at her first party conference as Prime Minister.
“Piece of cake, Prime Minister”. “No, not now,
thank you,
dear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T14:42:54"></hs_TimeCode>”.

Royall of Blaisdon:</Member></B> My Lords, we are here today in rare
circumstances: a recall of both Houses of Parliament for the specific
purpose of paying tribute to not just a formidable former Prime
Minister and leader of the Conservative Party but to a distinguished
Member of your Lordships’ House, Baroness Thatcher. Before I
proceed to my remarks, I want, from these Benches, to express our
sympathy to Lady Thatcher’s family. Even when someone has been
unwell for some time, as Lady Thatcher had been, to lose someone is
still a grievous blow, made in some ways better, but in some ways
worse, by the fact that the person in question was so prominent and so
public a
figure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T14:45:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000014">As
the tributes to her which have flowed since the news of her death was
announced have shown, there is no doubt that Margaret Thatcher was, and
will remain, a polarising figure. For some, including many on the
Benches opposite, Lady Thatcher inspired then, and inspires now, a
devotion to a politician who they believe not only, as the Prime
Minister said on Monday, “saved” this country but was the
political ideal to which they aspired and, indeed, is the political
model that they believe that they still need now. From that viewpoint,
not only was she the dominant politician of her generation but was one
of the most influential Prime Ministers this country has ever
seen—someone who has claim, as David Cameron said in his tribute
to her, to be Britain’s greatest ever peacetime Prime Minister.
Not all those on the Benches opposite share that view. Some, like the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, and the noble Lords,
Lord Lawson of Blaby and Lord Heseltine, and many other noble Lords,
are part of her story but in very different ways. Not all of them were
always and at all times in full agreement with her. For some, including
on my Benches and in my part of the political spectrum, Mrs Thatcher,
as she was then, was a divisive figure and someone to whom they were,
and remain, fundamentally opposed; someone whose very name, even now,
almost 30 years  
<?notus-xml column=1130?>since she became Britain’s Prime Minister in 1979, can raise
heights of emotion, of passion, of anger, of despair and more; and
someone who they believe can never be forgiven for what she did to
individuals, to communities, to industries and to the country. That is
a legitimate position of disagreement to hold, but to hold parties to
celebrate the death of someone is wrong, in bad taste and something
that I

tributes have shown, disagreements with Mrs Thatcher, her vision, her
ideals, her politics and her policies have not prevented even her
political opponents from being able to assess fully the enormity of her
impact as the United Kingdom’s longest-serving Prime Minister of
the 20th century and as this country’s first, and so far only,

particular tribute to Baroness Thatcher in that role. She was
unquestionably a truly remarkable woman, and although I did not agree
with many of her policies, I recognise that it was extraordinary for a
woman—a grocer’s daughter, wife and mother—to be a
successful research chemist before becoming a barrister and then going
on to become an MP, a Minister and to lead the Conservative Party and
become the first female Prime Minister, especially at the time when she
did it. Baroness Thatcher was a model for many women, including many
women in politics. She burst through the glass ceiling and proved that
it could be done, but she did not hold out a helping hand for others to
follow. I admire strong women—and she was certainly strong and
wielded immense power over colleagues as well as the country. However,
as with my late noble friend Lady Castle, for whom I worked in the
first six years of Baroness Thatcher’s premiership, she also
knew how to use her womanly wiles. Barbara said that her power over
male colleagues derived from the fact that she
had,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="1304101000147" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000147">“a

in relation to the issue of women, personally I wish that Baroness
Thatcher had used her strength in different ways. I know that she
showed many kindnesses to female colleagues, both MPs and her staff.
However, despite the many talented Conservative women in Parliament,
they were never—apart from another former Member of your
Lordships’ House, Lady Young—promoted to the Cabinet.
Since 1929, when Margaret Bondfield joined the Cabinet, there have
still only been 33 women Cabinet members. As the first ever female
Prime Minister, Lady Thatcher could have done so much for female
politicians, and for working mothers and women struggling to hold their
families and communities together, but she chose not to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000019">However,
there is some in what which Baroness Thatcher was and did that I
admire: her personal strength and courage, shown so bravely in her
response to being bombed at the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1984, and
her early support for Mikhail Gorbachev, with whom I had the good
fortune to celebrate his 80th birthday here in this House two years
ago, and for glasnost and perestroika in the former Soviet Union. All
this was important in changing the dynamics of 
<?notus-xml column=1131?>our continent and helping to bring the Cold War to an end, as was the
part that she played in driving forward the single market.</hs_para>

determination and belief were the principal drivers in Britain

know too, from my own personal experience, just how formidable a
political opponent she was. In the 1980s I was proudly working for my
noble friend, now the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, then the leader of the

form a judgment on the legacy of Baroness Thatcher as a
political figure in Britain, and in the world. Agree or

conclude my remarks by saying something about Lady Thatcher as a member
of your Lordships’ House. She entered this House in 1992, more
than 20 years ago, and was automatically and, rightly,
immediately a senior figure in this place. When I first came to your
Lordships’ House I was mesmerised by this frail but still
powerful woman who through sheer determination had transformed our
society, dividing opinion and dividing the country. Not for her the
consensual notion of one nation that I passionately espouse. As
increasingly frail as she became, as a result of that enormous impact,
her appearances in the House at key moments and on key

electrifying.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000024">In
more recent years, of course, Lady Thatcher’s appearances were

years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000025">Lady
Thatcher’s presence was never anything but controversial, and
the debate on what she did and the legacy she left will continue. She
was willing—indeed, keen—to take on the established
orthodoxies, but seemed at times not to understand the devastating
impact of her policies on too many communities. She was a polarising
figure, but whether you agreed with her or not she was a giant in

the Leader of the

Baroness Thatcher’s immediate family. I will also tie in
something the Leader of the House said with a personal reminiscence.
Due to some serendipity, for about five years at the State Opening of
Parliament I found myself sitting on the Bench opposite next to Mrs
Thatcher and spending time with her as we awaited the Queen’s
arrival. The one thing I want to share with the House took place in the
year her husband died, when she had already had a number of minor
strokes and did not speak a great deal. She suddenly turned to me and
said, “My husband died earlier this year”. I said,
“Yes, Baroness Thatcher, I know”. She paused again and
then said, “I miss him very much”. That tremendous
partnership between Baroness Thatcher and her husband, which was so
much a factor in her own political
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T14:54:11"></hs_TimeCode>, is
remembered
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000027">There
are times when, for all the grandeur of the surroundings of this House,
we have to play second fiddle to activities down the Corridor. Today,
however, although the tributes in the other place will no doubt be
eloquent and apposite, it is in this Chamber, as the Leader of the
House has reminded us, that we will hear the memories and judgments of
those who experienced first hand the Thatcher phenomenon. If one
considers the number of people whom she sacked, promoted, defeated or
berated, they must make up a goodly number of those present in the
House today. In short, the importance of the next couple of hours is
that not only does this House know where the bodies are buried but some

is perhaps understandable that on an occasion such as this we draw on
personal experiences, although I must say that I have nothing like the
depth of experience of some of my colleagues who worked with Mrs
Thatcher day by day. I first met Mrs Thatcher in the mid-1970s, when
she was the after-dinner speaker at the annual conference of the
directors of social services. The House will not be surprised to learn
that she made a characteristically challenging speech, leaving the
audience in no doubt that, given the opportunity, she had real ambition

services.</hs_para>

not expect, in the early hours of the morning when they were all

a decade later, as Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher commissioned

and I greatly enjoyed working with Sir Roy and we were given the
opportunity to be called his advisers. I was with Sir Roy on the day he
met the Prime Minister to go through the main thrust of his report. He

Roy told me that all had gone well, primarily because he concentrated
on the main thrust of his report. In a nutshell, this was simply that
when a vulnerable person is dependent on a relative stranger to meet
their personal needs, their primary concern is about the quality and
sensitivity of the service delivered and not about the nature of the
organisation that delivers it. I feel sure that this way of thinking
hugely pleased Mrs Thatcher, not least because at that time local
authorities operated an almost total monopoly of home care services,
day centre services and residential homes for all people, whatever
their disabilities or special needs. In addition, they also regulated
the few independent providers operating in that area. That was the
beginning of a fundamental transformation of those services, which are
of such importance to the well-being of our fellow

<?notus-xml column=1136?>a particularly kind woman. I give one example. At the first Christmas
for which she was Prime Minister, in 1979, she said to me, “Do
you know of any of our people in the House of Commons who are going to
be alone—through death, divorce or whatever—over this
Christmas period? If you do, I would like to ask them to Chequers to
come and stay over Christmas”. That, I thought at the time, was

are some who say that she was a very bad listener. I would argue
strongly with that. Maybe she was not a very good listener when some of
her colleagues were embarking on what I call waffle. However, often I
was at a meeting of Ministers when a Secretary of State had to come and
propose a new policy. She would begin the discussion in her typically
strident way, saying, “Well, Secretary of State, I am not very
attracted to what you want to do, but let us hear it, if you
must”. He would then explain what he wanted to do. Others would
come in. Having listened, she would say, “Well, Secretary of
State, if that is what you want to do, you’d better go on and do
it. But if it all goes pear-shaped, don’t come back to me to
bail you out”.</hs_para>

Thatcher loved, probably above all, an informed political debate. I
have a memory of a very small lunch in Downing Street, when Pierre
Trudeau come over from Canada to complain because we were not
expediting as much as he would have liked the legislation to release
British control over the Canadian constitution. At lunch, we quickly
got that out of the way. Then Margaret Thatcher and Pierre Trudeau, who
clearly disliked each other, embarked on a gloves-off confrontation of
political philosophies. Francis Pym and I were the only outsiders
present. It was a memorable experience to be a fly on the wall and
listen to those two going hammer and tongs together.</hs_para>

that many will think of with regard to Margaret Thatcher is
“leadership”. Many people today who look back on Margaret

some people today. They forget that, in 1979, Britain was on its knees.
What needed doing had needed doing for decades.  She set out to
do those things. She changed Britain. She changed much of what went on

Armstrong of Ilminster:</Member></B> My Lords, I have hesitated to
venture to add to the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of words
which have been spoken and written about the noble Baroness, Lady
Thatcher, these past three days but perhaps something should be said
from the perspective of one who, as a civil servant and Secretary to
the Cabinet, worked closely for and 
<?notus-xml column=1137?>with her for eight of the 11 and a half years for which she was Prime
Minister. Statistically speaking, the turnover of
Prime Ministers has been higher than that of Cabinet Secretaries. Most
Cabinet Secretaries have served more than one Prime Minister and
sometimes three, such as my noble friend Lord Butler of Brockwell, or
even four, as my predecessor Lord Hunt of Tanworth did. I am a
relatively rare bird in that I served only one Prime
Minister.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1304101000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000055">I
was summoned one morning in July 1979 to a meeting with the Prime
Minister at No. 10, which I hoped—but did not know—would
result in an appointment as Secretary to the Cabinet. I was taken
upstairs to her room and shown in at the door of the study. As I went
through the door, she looked up at me and said, “Robert,
you’re looking very tired”. It was not the most promising
opening to an interview in which I was hoping to be offered one of the
most onerous jobs in the public service, so I stammered out something
about having been up rather late the previous night. Then she said,
“Robert, I have asked you to come in order that I can tell you
that I want to appoint you as Cabinet Secretary to succeed John Hunt in
October”. Of course, I was delighted and accepted the offer. I
went downstairs and told the private secretary that the Prime Minister
had offered me the job and that I had accepted it. But I said,
“It was a little bit odd that she started by saying,
‘Robert, you look very tired’”. That private
secretary said, “Oh, don’t worry about
that—she’s saying that to everybody this
morning”.</hs_para>

Royall, spoke about Lady Thatcher’s lack of aspiration to be a
feminist, if I may sum it up in that way. That may have been fair but
she was nothing if not feminine and many of her colleagues, and many of
those who were her civil servants, will recognise that. My recollection
goes back to the first visit that we had from President Mitterrand of
France to Downing Street, in 1981. We were all dreading it because he
had no English, or claimed not to, so that everything had to be
interpreted—and, of course, he was

his predecessor and Mitterrand was said to be a socialist, but the

smoothly and there were good speeches by both parties at a dinner. When
the President finally came to leave the next afternoon, I went with the
Prime Minister to see him off at the front door of No. 10 Downing
Street. As we walked back, I said to the Prime Minister in what I
suppose was a tone of some surprise, “That visit went rather
well, didn’t it, Prime Minister?”. She said, “Yes,
I suppose it did”. Then there was a pause and she said,

draft agreement. The draft was never going to set the Thames on
fire—or the Liffey for that matter—and it could not be
expected to go down well with the unionist community in Northern
Ireland. It cannot be claimed that Mrs Thatcher was enthusiastic about
it even at the time, but she clearly preferred an outcome that she
could proclaim as a success, and which would certainly be welcomed in
Washington, to a breakdown of negotiations and a failure of the policy

Howard of Lympne:</Member></B> My Lords, in order to understand the
true greatness of Margaret Thatcher it is necessary to remember the
state of our country and our continent in 1979 when she became Prime
Minister. Our country was in decline—a decline that many thought
was permanent and some thought was terminal. I remember
listening—I think it was in 1978—to one of the great
gurus of the time. He saw no answer to our predicament. He said:
“After the next election, we shall either have a Government that
doesn’t try to do the things that are necessary, in which case
failure and decline will inevitably continue, or we will have a
Government that tries to do the things that are necessary, in which
case it will become so unpopular that it will be bound to lose the
election after next”. Margaret Thatcher proved him wrong and in
doing so, as the Prime Minister said, saved our
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:27:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000072">It
has been said many times, including this afternoon, that she was a
divisive figure. She was. She had to be. There was no consensus on the
right thing to do for our country. If she had waited for consensus,
nothing

with clarity, courage and
conviction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:27:35"></hs_TimeCode>. It
is also true that her divisiveness on occasion extended to members of
her Administration. On one occasion, a Minister sent a paper to her
that she rejected. He had the temerity to send it back with the words,
“Prime Minister, this is government policy”. She replied:
“It may be government policy but I don’t agree with a
word of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:28:03"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000073">In
1979, as we all know, Europe was divided in two. The eastern half was
subjugated to the yoke of communist tyranny. The part that Margaret
Thatcher played, in partnership with Ronald Reagan, in freeing those
countries, has been well documented. However, there is one aspect of
the story that is less well known. In 1990, as her Employment
Secretary, I went to Poland. My noble friend Lord Fowler, my
predecessor, had set up something called the Know-How fund to help
establish small businesses in the newly free countries. My opposite
number was Jacek Kuron, who had been imprisoned for his opposition to
communism. He took me to see Marshal Jaruzelski, the man whose regime
had imprisoned him. Marshal Jaruzelski told me about the part Margaret
Thatcher had played in the rise of Solidarity. He said: “She
visited Poland during one of Solidarity’s strikes in the
shipyards of Gdansk. She said to me: ‘You know, this
isn’t an ordinary strike and you ought to talk to its
leaders’. Until then, I had had no more intention of talking to
them than I had of flying to the moon. But she persuaded me, so I began
to talk to Lech Walesa—and you know what happened after
that”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000074">All

to follow my noble friend and I must say that I wholly agree with his
conclusion. As the Leader said in opening, those of us whose paths
crossed with hers all have our own personal anecdotes and remembrances
about Margaret Thatcher. I have two. First, in a life that has, I
suppose, had some small excitements, nothing that I have ever
experienced so terrorised me as having to stand up as a young,
inexperienced, wet-behind-the-ears leader of my party to question her
in the House of Commons when she was at the full plenitude of her
powers, with the inevitable result that I would be ritually handbagged
twice a week in front of the microphones of the nation. Thank God there

second remembrance illustrates the point made by the Leader of the
House about one of Lady Thatcher’s best qualities and most
formidable weapons. My wife and I had been invited to one of those
Downing Street events to mark the visit of some foreign leader;
I honestly cannot remember exactly who it was. Afterwards,
as 
<?notus-xml column=1141?>we came down the stairs of No. 10, we met the Prime Minister coming up.
My wife, who, I should explain, is much more rampantly left-wing than I
am, hated her policies with a passion. The Prime
Minister stopped and talked to us for a few moments. As she moved away,
my wife hissed through gritted teeth, “She’s absolutely
bloody charming, damn it”. So she was—to everyone, except
of course those who happened to be in her Cabinet, as this row of
wholly unextinct volcanoes sitting in front of me will no doubt
attest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:32:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

many paradoxes. As  the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, pointed
out, she  was not at all the straightforward, black and white,
no-nonsense, unbending warrior leader that she latterly liked to
portray. She knew, at least until the very end, when to compromise and
did so, perhaps most significantly when, although relishing her
anti-Europeanism, she nevertheless signed Britain up to the single
European
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:33:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

qualities set her apart as something different but each of them had its
drawbacks. The first was a passionate commitment to freedom. As a
Liberal, needless to say, I mostly welcomed that, although perhaps not
as much as I should have at the time. Later, in Bosnia, when I tried to
get a stagnant economy moving, I found myself putting into practice
many of the very things that I had opposed when she introduced them:
aggressive liberalisation of the markets, stripping down the barriers
to business and lowering taxation. In these things she was right at the
time, even if today we find that, taken to excess, some of these
attributes have not led to greater prosperity for all but to near ruin
and a disgusting climate of greed for the few. In this, I suspect that
revolution she started has perhaps somewhat run its course. Our
challenge today is to find a kinder, less destructive, more balanced
way of shaping our economy, but that is today. At the time when she did
those things, they needed to be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:34:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

freedom was, one might say, strangely partial. She did much to enhance
individual economic freedom, and our country was much the better for
it, but she did far less to enhance the political freedoms of, for
instance, the gay community or the people of Scotland, or perhaps most
markedly and paradoxically—and this has been commented on,
too—the standing of women in society. She was—and
arguably, given the context at the time, this was one of her very
greatest achievements—Britain’s first woman Prime
Minister. However, her influence and power came not from the exercise
of the female principles in politics but from the fact that she was far
better than any man at the male
ones<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:35:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

quality was her patriotism. David Cameron, the present Prime Minister,
recently called her the “patriot Prime Minister”. It is a
good phrase and an apposite one. However, her patriotism too, though so
powerfully held and expressed, was more about the preservation and
restoration of Britain’s past position than it was about
preparing us for the challenges of what came next. She used her
formidable talents to give our country a few more years of glory, and
for that we should be eternally grateful. However, that legacy means
that Britain today still finds itself uncomfortable and undecided about
its true position 
<?notus-xml column=1142?>in the world, not least in relation to Europe, where the infection that
she planted still has the capacity to rip apart her
party<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:36:03"></hs_TimeCode>. There can

operations anyone who was not at least as frightened as I was, but she
was frightened of nothing. She could see the risks but she ignored them
if she believed she was right, and paradoxically this, in the final

elected to the House of Commons, when I spent a great deal of time
abroad. Like so many of us at that time, I was constantly embarrassed
at the sympathy that was offered to me by foreigners for the state into
which Great Britain had descended. A few years later, I again spent a
lot of time abroad, as the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
The change could not have been greater in the admiration that was
expressed for what had been done in this country. It was sometimes, I
thought, slightly over the top. I could never quite get my mind around
the remark made to me in Italy: “Oh, if only we had a Thatcher

Prime Ministers of post-war Great Britain: two Prime Ministers who

were Clement Attlee and Margaret Thatcher. We have accommodated
ourselves to many of the things which Clement Attlee did, although many
of us would have opposed them at the time. Even some of those in his

should also recollect that Lady Thatcher came into office in 1979
somewhat against the odds that would have been offered a year or so
earlier, because of the winter of discontent. The trades union generals
had brought down Ted Heath’s Government. They brought down Jim
Callaghan’s Government. They brought into office the Government
of Lady Thatcher. They expected, particularly Master Scargill, to bring

of course, who observed that Prague was not in eastern Europe but at

mentioned that aspect of her life. The other, of course, was her

Baroness was aware from both her scientific training and her religious
beliefs that there are things that are right and things that are wrong,
technically, scientifically and morally. She pursued that which she
believed to be right. I must say that as her party chairman I found
that my life was made much easier by my understanding of the
certainties of her beliefs. She never asked me to commission a focus
group. Had I been asked I would have resisted manfully, I hope. What is
more, if I woke in the morning, turned on the radio and heard the
BBC’s version of the news of the day I would know
what her reaction would be to the news because of the certainty of the
construct of her beliefs. It made life very much easier for

opportunity to serve in high office the country that she, I, and I
believe all of us here, love. I am also grateful to her for that other
side of her character, for the support that she gave to my wife and me
after we were injured. No doubt somebody in this House will correct me,
but I cannot think of a precedent for a Secretary of State remaining in
office as Secretary of State although absent from the Cabinet for over
three months. She allowed me to run my office from my hospital bed.
Admittedly, I had the support of two splendid civil servants in
particular who ran my private office, both of whom have appeared again
in other roles: Mr Callum McCarthy, and another fellow who I
believe has achieved high office somewhere more recently; he was the
Secretary of State for Health not long ago. They were quality people,

Soley:</Member></B> I wonder if I could intervene briefly. I was
elected in May 1979. The noble Lord, Lord Jopling, referred to the
photograph of the first Thatcher Government. I can tell him that there
was a group of about a dozen newly elected MPs—because that was
all there was of us—deciding whether it would be better for our
morale to be photographed as a group or individually. We decided that
it was probably better to do it individually, although if I had had the
wit I would have asked if we could have borrowed the Cabinet Room to do
it in.</hs_para>

a way one of Margaret Thatcher’s achievements was that she
forced the Labour Party to reinvent itself. Following the comments of
the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, I should say that it was also what Clement
Attlee, later Lord Attlee, made the Tory party do after its reputation
in the 1930s. Both those people had very different personalities but
had a similarly dramatic effect on changes in the country. We need to
remember
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:52:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000102">I
also recall Jim Callaghan saying to me in May 1979 that the people he
felt most sorry for were those of us who had just been elected,
because, he said, “You will be in opposition for about 10
years”. Well, we were 18 years in opposition, which was when we
forced ourselves to change. It is an important impact in British
politics that our system forces political parties to change. If you do
not listen to the electorate, the electorate ignores you, and you pay a
very high price for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:53:13"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:53:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000103">I
want to say a few other things. Jim Callaghan also said to me at the
time that he had hoped with North Sea oil that we would be able to make
some changes to the economy that we needed to make. That was really
where he was at. He felt that the economy needed to change, and that
with the advantage of North Sea oil we could do it. Margaret Thatcher
took a different view. She felt, as has been indicated a number of
times, that you had to force change on people. This is where I part
company, and it is a fundamental difference between the two parties.
There were ways of bringing about the changes that were necessary then
without some of the conflict that we experienced. You need only look at
what Germany did, particularly with East Germany, to see how change of
that type can be brought about differently. That is an important
lesson. It is a powerful
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:54:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000104">Margaret
Thatcher also had, as the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, knows, a strong
suspicion if not dislike of trade unions. He and I debated that on one
or two privatisations. I noted the good comments made by Matthew Parris
in the <I>Times</I> yesterday about how she hated the closed shop, and
hate was underlined by Margaret Thatcher. That is one of the ways in
which she made some of the negative aspects of the trade unions change.
I have never taken the view, and still do not take it, that trade
unions are not a very important defence in a democracy; they are an
important right for people. But I also acknowledge what we were blind
to in the 1980s: that some of the practices within the trade union
movement were not only doing us damage but were bad practices that
needed to
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:55:07"></hs_TimeCode>. That is

patronising but it is not intended to: when I questioned Margaret
Thatcher in the House I sometimes felt that she was very much on the
right track but was somehow missing the big opportunity. Council house
sales are one such example. In my view, selling council houses would
have been a brilliant policy if she had done what Hugh Rossi, I think,
had suggested: reinvesting all the money from the sales of council
houses into the building of new houses. Margaret Thatcher took the
opposite view. If she had not, that would have been a truly brilliant
policy. As it was, it was the right policy, but it was not followed
through in the way I would have
liked<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:55:58"></hs_TimeCode>. Most

certainly did not like some of the language that was used. It has to be
said that the language used about the trade unions was deeply damaging
to the fabric of Britain, particularly in the north and the west. I was
shadow Home Office Minister at the time and I looked at what the police
were doing during the miners’ strike, the print union strikes
and others. What troubled me was that when the phrase “the enemy
within” was used, you had to know that the police officer facing
the picket line was often a relative or close friend of the miner on
the other side of the line, particularly in south Wales but also
elsewhere in the UK. The phrase “the enemy within” began
to fragment society in a deeply unsatisfactory way. In a way, her love
of an argument and pushing it through with a passion and fury of her
own made her enemies, which perhaps need not have

soon after I was elected, the Falklands issue came up. I have heard the

might be contentious to say this, but it also is my belief that that
helped to bring about the end of the juntas in South America, which we

the messages was that you need to stand up to dictators. Again I might
regret some of the language that was used—not least in the

will judge her well. She was a major political figure by any standards.
She argued dramatically and with great passion, but in doing so at
times she sowed the seeds of bitterness. She loved an argument, she
loved a challenge and she loved change. In that way, she was a Tory
radical, not a one nation Tory. It is an important lesson for us all
that you can be a great leader in a democracy but that no great leader
changes things without hurting people. I say this not as any criticism
of Margaret Thatcher, but I think that we should be careful about going
down the road of military involvement in

be heard. No Prime Minister can govern entirely
compassionately—Prime Ministers have to take tough decisions and
hurt people—but in doing that they need to try to get some

last point has a degree of topicality. I remember when the chairman of
the Procedure Committee in the Commons came to see Margaret Thatcher to
say that he had a wonderful idea for improving Prime Minister’s
Questions. He had the bright idea that instead of Questions being on
Tuesday and Thursday, they should be on Wednesday for half an hour. She
looked him steely in the face and said, “What do you think the
House of Commons would like?”. That was the end of it. Things

more madness—not madness, more reason—than she admitted.
Of course she knew that every Tuesday and every Thursday, she had to
be, as she put it, match fit for Prime Minister’s Questions.
That was a great advantage. However, there was a second great advantage
in that her whole Government knew that on Tuesdays and Thursdays the
boss was in the House of Commons defending the Government. If any
department had not sent a note as to what issues were coming up, I used

Williams of Crosby:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Lord, Lord Wakeham. I had a very long association with Mrs Thatcher and
begin by associating myself with the regrets and the very considerable
concern we all have for her family. In that context, I include her
grandchildren as well as her son and
daughter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:05:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000123">Mrs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:05:52"></hs_TimeCode>
Thatcher and I followed one another at Somerville College, Oxford. She
became the first woman president, I think, of the Oxford University
Conservative Association, and I came, nearly five years later, to be
the first woman leader of the Oxford University Labour Club. Somerville
was the cradle for Prime Ministers, including Mrs Gandhi, and it very
much embodied and understood Mrs Thatcher, who, above all—this
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:09:43"></hs_TimeCode> the first
serious point I want to make—had the most incredible
single-mindedness, determination, dedication and self-discipline. I do
not think in my entire political life that I have ever met anybody who
combined those four qualities in the way that she did. From the very
beginning, she knew what she wanted to be and what she wanted to do,
and managed to overcome virtually every obstacle one can think
of.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000124" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000124">So<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:06:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:06:43"></hs_TimeCode>
far in the speeches that we have heard, including the very moving one
from the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, we have not heard quite enough about
the extraordinary patriarchal nature of British politics in the 1960s
and 
<?notus-xml column=1149?>1970s. It was not easy to put yourself forward as leader of the party
or, later, as a Prime Minister in those days. Our society was still a
deeply masculine one, where any woman who stood up opened herself to
patronage, to the assumption that she was of a second level of
intellect and to all the rest that went with that. It is important to
say—hopefully with respect but with some memory of what things
were really like —that, for example, the then Prime
Minister, Mr Heath, was clearly not too happy to have that
particular woman in his Cabinet and rather cleverly seated her five
seats away from him, so that she could not be seen if she got up and
tried to speak. We remember that she had an extraordinary capacity to
overcome—and even not notice in some ways—the objections
that were raised to her as a woman. The assumption when Airey Neave
took over her campaign for the leadership was that she would be most
unlikely, on those grounds, ever to
succeed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:08:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000125" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000125">In
that context it is perhaps worth my telling one anecdote. According to
Sir Denis Thatcher, at one stage he was sitting at home in Flood Street
while Mrs Thatcher was ironing his shirts, which she was
very keen on doing, and getting breakfast. She said, in a sort of
rather casual way, “Denis, I am thinking of running for the
leadership”. To which he responded, “Leadership of what,
Margaret?”. That somehow sums up the wonderful balanced
detachment and humour of Sir Denis. I cannot underline too strongly the
extent to which I think Mrs Thatcher began to lose her life when he
passed away. He was absolutely central and key to her whole personality
and her ability to become what she
was<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:08:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000126" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000126">The
second, very important, thing that I want to stress is something
mentioned by my noble friend Lord Ashdown, which is her astonishing
courage. Many people, including not least of course the noble Lord,
Lord Tebbit, will recall the courage that she showed, and then
sustained on their behalf, throughout the whole of the Brighton
episode. Let us pause for a minute and notice the courage and daring
that it took to take on the Falklands, 8,000 miles away, with the
likelihood that we were going to be badly beaten. She knew that she
had, in a sense, nothing to lose and everything to gain but it was
still an extraordinary decision to make for a woman who was leading, to
some extent at that point, a divided Cabinet.</hs_para>

thing. There is a great danger that we will sanctify Mrs Thatcher. She
would not want that at all. She was always a great warrior. When she
and I were in opposite positions—we were both Secretaries of
State for Education, and sometimes opponents—she did not try to
pretend that there was no difference between us. She loved it. She
relished argument. She relished confrontation. She would not relish it
now if this House failed to refer to that as an aspect of her
personality and
being<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:10:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to it, and I share the views of those who have expressed that. Her
policies were terribly hard on the industrial north and Midlands. Her
policies did not completely reflect the common ground that we were
beginning to develop as a multicultural and multiracial nation. To me,
that is an important part of what we are
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:10:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

however, that she was essentially a deeply pragmatic politician, as the
noble Baroness, Lady Royall, pointed out. I will make two points on
that. She never, ever, took on those things which were essentially,
fundamentally accepted by the British people. She never attempted to
roll back comprehensive education; she approved more comprehensive
schools than I ever did. She never attempted to take on the National
Health Service and turn it into a privatised service, because she knew
where the British people stood and never forgot the reality of
politics<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:11:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

unquestionably one of the most remarkable Prime Ministers of her
century, and in the world at that time. She also found it hard to get
her mind around globalisation. Do not forget that she opposed, for
example, the unification of Germany, which was key to the creation of a
truly democratic Europe, west and east, in the period after the Cold
War. We should not go too far in saying that she and Ronald Reagan
brought that about; they made a major contribution, but there was of
course somebody called Mikhail Gorbachev who showed astonishing courage
in attempting to change the nature of the Soviet
Union<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:11:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

any more time up. There are many great speeches to be heard, and we
have heard already some outstanding speeches. However, for courage, for
single-mindedness and determination, there are few who matched Mrs
Thatcher. History will certainly see her representation change in some
ways—that always happens in history—but I do not think
that she will ever be
forgotten.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_10_PT_1/FAA3768ECFD90B1D7D447599E947F636150772E6" __version__="1.10"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 April 2013">Wednesday,

Fowler:</Member></B> My Lords, listening to the radio and watching
television in the Isle of Wight, I was struck by the number of
Conservatives at Westminster who said that Margaret Thatcher had
brought them into politics. Some even suggested that they had been
Thatcherites long before she even came to
power<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:12:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

her in opposition and in government for 15 years in succession, I make
neither claim. Mine was rather a different journey. In the leadership
election of 1975 I voted for Ted Heath, and then followed that by
voting for my noble and learned friend Lord Howe. It is fair to say
that that was rather an exclusive campaign. We had 25 definite promises
and pledges and we ended up with 19 votes, that being entirely par for
the course in House of Commons elections. We had some good quality,
however, in my noble friend Lord Brittan and my right honourable friend
Kenneth Clarke. As we chewed over the result in a small room upstairs,
none of us was convinced that the party had made the right choice. It
was then, to my total amazement, that Margaret Thatcher put me into her
first shadow Cabinet; it is fair to say that that amazement was widely
shared. I had never done a Front-Bench job before. I was put in charge
of health and social security against Barbara Castle; I think that is
known as a baptism of fire.</hs_para>

that proved a point about Lady Thatcher. Margaret was sometimes seen as
surrounding herself with known supporters and yes-men. She had the
confidence and the self-belief not to do that. As the 
<?notus-xml column=1151?>noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, said, you did not have to be “one of
us” to be in her Cabinet. All three of us at the time were
doubters, but all three of us became members of her Cabinet, and our
very good candidate—who sadly got only 19 votes—became
her excellent Chancellor of the Exchequer, to whom she owed so
much<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:14:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304101000135" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304101000135">The
second point is that she was personally kind and generous, and much
concerned that her Ministers should not lose out in any way. I learnt
about that in a roundabout way. After about 18 months I was moved from
health and social security to transport. It was not the move that I was
looking for. “What? Transport?”,  I said to
Margaret indignantly. She said, “Norman, I did transport. You
can do transport”. That is exactly what happened. It proved to
be a lucky move, for when the new Government were formed I went into
the Cabinet, never having been even a junior Minister. Margaret
Thatcher had a lengthy apology to make. She said, “I’m
afraid we can pay in full only 22 Cabinet Ministers and you
are the 23rd, so we will have to pay you at the rate of the Chief
Whip”—my noble friend Lord Jopling, who is somewhere
around. She said, “I am really very sorry about that”. I
thought it best not to say that I would probably have done it for
nothing had she asked, and we moved

was fascinated by what the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, said about the
visit of President Mitterrand to Downing Street. The noble Lord was
lucky to face  a socialist. My opposite number was a
communist,  M. Fiterman. The great thing was that after all
these great events, you need a communiqué. It was a very genial
meeting but there was nothing much we could agree on. The one thing we
could agree on, at least in principle, was the need for a Channel
Tunnel. The communiqué became about the Channel Tunnel. It
ceased to be just an aspiration of the Department of Transport and from
that moment became a proposal of No. 10 and went

looking back on those momentous years, is that there were undoubted
tragedies such as the Grand Hotel bomb. I remember as Health Secretary
going back to Brighton the next morning—I had been there the
night before—to visit some of the wounded. If I may say so, I
remember the courage of many people, not least my two noble friends
here today. There were other undoubted crises, such as the Falklands.
That was the only time I remember Margaret Thatcher going round the
whole Cabinet table and asking each Minister, one by one, whether they
were in favour of sending a task force. Virtually everyone agreed;
there was only one exception. However, I am bound to say that I at
least agreed with my fingers metaphorically crossed because I joined
the Army for my national service in 1956, at the time of Suez. That was
not our greatest time. It seemed to me that if we could not get our
forces efficiently from Cyprus to Egypt, it would be very difficult to
get them to the other end of the world in the way that we did. The
success of the Falklands was a tribute to our totally professional
Armed Forces and to the consistency, determination and courage of
Margaret Thatcher. My lesson from that was that the MPs who had voted
for her as leader in 1975 had been proved absolutely
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:18:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Margaret Thatcher was always exciting. It was sometimes also great fun.
Some say that she stamped all over her Ministers. It is true that if
you were prepared to be handbagged she would oblige. She did not
respect Ministers who came in with a proposal that they immediately
withdrew when they heard the initial response from the Prime Minister.
I learnt very early on that she really did enjoy an argument. Sometimes

Thatcher came out to help me in the Clitheroe by-election in February
1974. It was a very cold day and after an hour or two we repaired to a
place to have lunch. I sat the constituency chairman on her left. He
was so intimidated by the occasion that he could not think of anything
to say for five minutes. He then burst into song and said,
“Leader of the Opposition. Don’t you think it’s
time we went for PR?”. I thought that the Leader of the
Opposition would explode. She choked on her prawn cocktail, gave a
great gulp and then said, “Well, of course, if you never want
the Tory Party to win another election that is a very good
idea”. The constituency chairman slumped into his seat and never

did not suffer fools gladly but she could be immensely
kind—somehow very tolerant of ordinary human failings. The other
day I read a book written by Carol Thatcher. I, like others, wish to
give my condolences to the family. In that book about her father, Carol
said that she asked him one day what was his idea of the perfect
afternoon. He said, “It is sitting

have to say that Margaret was not always absolutely calm when you were
working with her. She was always challenging, always relishing a good
argument. Sometimes, when you had endured the flame and the fire, you
came out of it thinking you might have won but you were never quite
sure. She was a towering figure, but I saw signs of human frailty. I
was with her behind the stage in the conference hall in Brighton in
1984. She was waiting to go in front and make her great speech. She was
slumped on a sofa and I think it was Gordon Reece sitting on the arm of
the sofa. Margaret was saying, “I don't think that I can go
through with this”. He said, “Of course you can, of
course you can. When you get out there, the whole world will be
cheering for you”, and so it was. She went in out front of that
audience and gave one of the most marvellous speeches of her whole
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304102000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304102000008">Margaret

discussed in various committee meetings that we had had on the
Broadcasting Bill. I said that I was absolutely sure that the licence
fee had never been mentioned; she said that she was sure that it had.
The minutes were called for; a man came into the room with a great
bundle of documents. She seized the documents, threw them on the floor
and flung herself on the floor to read them, bidding me to join her.
After three or four minutes of fruitless search, someone knocked on the
door and came in. Seeing that extraordinary sight, they might have been
quite embarrassed. Margaret was not at all embarrassed. She got to her
feet full of bad temper, not embarrassment. She flounced out of the

of a civil servant who briefed her and accompanied her to many summits

area of European affairs. It was both a pleasure and a challenge to
work with her. It was a pleasure because, contrary to the popular
impression, she always listened carefully to briefing and did not make
up her mind until she had heard the facts and arguments. It was only
after that stage that she became the Iron Lady. It was a challenge 
<?notus-xml column=1154?>because she, rightly, judged the issues on the overriding criterion,
“Is it in the British interest?”, and so did I, not on
other factors such as pressure from other EU states or other
institutions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304102000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304102000012">Among
the issues, arguments and, indeed, rows, during my time with Margaret
Thatcher was the battle to obtain, and the process of obtaining, the
budget rebate, which I believe has so far brought home about £70
billion to the United Kingdom taxpayer. In the light of later events,
which are not relevant to our Sitting today, you cannot imagine how
strongly she argued for two objectives—not one but
two—which were, first, money and, secondly, the requirement of
unanimity, so that the UK had a veto if there were any later attempts
by others to take away or reduce the rebate. Both those objectives she
obtained<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:28:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304102000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304102000013">In
the course of that, I learnt a lot about disagreements. It is therefore
also a pleasure to me that, although all my papers are lost deep in the
archives, I still have somewhere a piece of torn green blotting paper,

margins of a European Council, she wrote: “I agree. Margaret
Thatcher”, and then, again, “I agree. Margaret

Griffiths of Burry Port:</Member></B> If I may draw your
Lordships’ attention to an entirely different aspect of the life
and character of the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, it would be to
mention her origins as a good Methodist. This has already been
mentioned by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford. Lady
Thatcher was born in Grantham in the county of Lincolnshire, and of
course, John Wesley was himself born in that same county, at Epworth.
She was born into a very devout Methodist home, and the pieties and
religious practices of that home, as well as the values and principles,
were early learnt. I believe she had them processed into her very
being, and I shared my views about that with her later on in her
life.</hs_para>

want to register where she comes from in terms of the primordial
energies that shaped her character. She came down to London to pursue
her career, although while at Oxford, as well as pursuing her
scientific career, she was part of a preaching team that went around
the villages near Oxford to take the Gospel and pronounce good news.
Some of those who were in the team with her are still alive and will
tell you their own tales. If only we can get the Appointments
Commission to bring them into your Lordships’ House they would
regale us with many a
tale<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:31:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304102000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304102000016">I
believe therefore that I should not just introduce an element that is
artificially drawn in, granted the grand themes that have already been
adumbrated in previous speeches, but that I should describe something
that was essentially her. She and Denis were married at Wesley’s
chapel, where I have the privilege to be the minister, and Carol and
Mark were baptised there a little later. She had an enduring fondness
for the chapel and came back regularly. I say to many visitors who come
our way that if they look at the handsome communion rail that was given
to us by Margaret Thatcher, it is the kind of evidence that everybody 
<?notus-xml column=1155?>needs that, despite all those who say the opposite, she did actually
help some people to their feet. It is worth noticing that as a
vice-president of the Friends of Wesley’s Chapel she was a
faithful friend, although, of course, as many Methodists do, she was
translated into the other place, namely the Church of England, and made
that her spiritual dwelling place on a regular
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:32:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304102000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304102000017">I
would have loved to have shared with her my feelings about her
quotation of a sermon by John Wesley when she was in Edinburgh. It was
a sermon on money, and of course, she was well known to have her own
views about that. I think that she wanted to draw John Wesley very much
into her own thinking and to make him suit her purpose. She quoted two
points of Wesley’s sermon, that it was the responsibility of all
Christians to earn all they can—that is all right—and to
save all they can, although I can personally attest that with a 0.5%
interest rate there is not much point in doing that these days.
However, she omitted the third point of John Wesley’s argument,
that having earned, and having saved, good Christian people should be
altruists, spending and giving all they can for the common
good.</hs_para>

I say, she was a great friend. It is interesting that as well as being
the minister of the church where her marriage service took place, I
happen to be an honorary canon of the cathedral where her funeral
service will take place. I shall be there next Wednesday in that
capacity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:33:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304102000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304102000019">There
are many points upon which I disagreed fundamentally with her. When she
came, for example, to open one of the two museums that we have on our
site—it was in 1981 and things were not going well for her at
that time—many of us who championed the cause of the poor and
were very radical young Methodists were out there, shouting the odds
and sounding a different music from what was inside the building she
was opening. She was as well briefed for a humble visit to the
Methodist chapel as she ever was on matters of policy in the ways that
have been alluded to in previous speeches. She knew the answers even
though we who were there all the time often did not. It is strange that
God, or whatever noble and secular Lords want to substitute for God,
has put a sense of humour at the heart of things. This young Turk who
was asking for this chapel to be pulled down and for the money raised
to be given to the poor is now the minister of the very chapel that he
wanted to be destroyed and disposed of.</hs_para>

friend to the end. She wanted to come to church the week after their
50th wedding anniversary. Unfortunately, she suffered a stroke in the
course of a short holiday that she was then taking in Madeira and was
not able to come. I count it a great privilege to have known her just a
little. She exchanged some opinions with me, for example about South
Africa at a crucial stage in its life. She said “The
chief’s the man”, meaning of course Chief Buthelezi of
the Inkatha Freedom Party—and she could not have been more
wrong, could she? At the same time, she did things which I suspect we
on our Benches would be glad of because they were things that we would
have liked to have done, but perhaps did not have the right positioning
to do.</hs_para>

to Britain being on its knees. I have brought with me my prop, which I
used in successive elections in 1983 and 1987. Some noble Lords may be
familiar with it. It is Sir Nicholas Henderson’s
“valedictory dispatch” from Paris, which he sent under
the impression that he was retiring from the Foreign Office on 31 March
1979. He did not actually retire because no sooner had he got back to
this country than the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, who was the new
Foreign Secretary, invited him to go to Washington. He was a very

of a great Prime Minister,  it would be that in showing the
leadership for that national will she worked far too hard. The one
thing that I remember at Cabinet meetings—and one or two of my
colleagues may recall this—was the occasional 
<?notus-xml column=1157?>stifled yawn because it was such an extraordinary time. I remember
walking out of a reception at No. 10 that she gave one evening. She was
saying goodbye to various guests and just ahead of me was a BBC
producer from the World Service. She said, “I do like the World
Service. I listen to Radio 4 at 11 pm and midnight, and then I switch
to the World Service and listen to that at one o’clock, two
o’clock and three o’clock”. Anyone who worked with
her will know that she displayed commitment and knowledge, whatever
subject came up. The amount of background work that she had done was

pressure that was on her, we have heard a number of tributes today to
her personal approach to people and to her kindness. I recall a
wonderful incident which, as noble Lords will understand, made a great
impression. I came into the Cabinet at the very beginning of January
1983. My mother died two weeks later. I think that the first Cabinet
meeting we had was when Parliament came back. She took me to one side
and asked, “Did your mother know, before she died, that you had
come into the Cabinet?”. I said that she did and she replied,
“I’m very pleased”. It was that sort of personal

think this applies also to the comments about the Falklands—it
may have looked as though the decisions that were taken were easy.
However, both events were close run. They could easily have gone wrong
and, if they had, it would have been the end of the Conservative
Government and the end of her as Prime Minister. They were close-run
things and very tough, and I say that having been closely involved not
only with the Falklands but with the miners’ strike, together

I went to Northern Ireland, where I had the pleasure of inheriting the
plan that had been laid by the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong. It did not
meet with universal approval from the Unionist party and we had some
interesting times. I recall one moment when both Margaret Thatcher and
I looked suitably nonplussed. We had the signing ceremony in the large
drawing room in Hillsborough in front of all the television cameras and
then she made a suitable speech, saying how she hoped that this would
be the beginning of a good relationship, and that it would establish
more security and confidence in Northern Ireland and a better
relationship with the Government of the Republic. She then turned to
Garret FitzGerald and invited him to speak. He started off in Gaelic.
Margaret looked at me as though I would know what he was saying. I had
been Secretary of State for only two months and had not learnt Gaelic
in that time.

beginning, I happened to have a flat on the same landing as Airey
Neave. The bomb was placed in his car outside our block of flats and
the tilt switch did its deadly work when he came out of the House of
Commons car park. This was when Margaret was just embarking on a
terrifically demanding election campaign. I do not think that any of us
will forget the speech that she made as a new Prime Minister two weeks

will refer to an event that noble Lords may remember: the bomb outrage
at the Remembrance Day service in Enniskillen. The event shocked
everybody in Northern Ireland, right across the communities. It was a
really difficult time when the confidence that one needed to maintain

going to allow their Remembrance Day service to be destroyed.
We’re going to have another service in two weeks’
time”. I talked to the noble Lord, Lord Powell, who was then her
Private Secretary, and asked, “What is she doing on Sunday
week?”. He said, “Oh, she’s got a meeting with
President Mitterrand in Paris”. I said, “What time is
that meeting?”. He said, “It’s in the

think she’d come to Enniskillen to give the lead, reassurance
and comfort that is so important?”. Without hesitation, and in
spite of the fact that she was a prime target for the terrorists all
through her time, she came. It was wonderful cover. The press said,
“What’s she doing on Sunday, with this big parade in
Enniskillen?”. We said, “She’s got a meeting with
Mitterrand”. With the help of the RAF, she came in the morning
and we had a great service. She got lashed and drenched with Fermanagh

respect in Poland for what she had done, which has already been
referred to. In Hungary they gave me a piece of rusty old barbed wire.
It was part of the 200 miles of the iron curtain that had stood for
almost 50 years on the border of Hungary to keep back people who wanted

Colorado, to receive the Medal of Freedom at the Aspen Institute, and

her with the medal. That was Saddam Hussein’s bad luck. As I
travelled round the Gulf after the first Gulf War, there was no
question that the belief of the leaders of the Gulf countries that they
owed a debt to Margaret Thatcher for the speed of response of the
United States at that critical moment. Contrary to Nicholas

almost impossible for anyone to get elected in any country in the world

“I’m sorry this is happening a bit earlier, I’m

Thatcher left No. 10, the staff in her private office clubbed together
to give her as a parting gift a shortwave radio. The noble Lord said,

Mrs Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979, the country was
anxious for all that to end—but the resistance that she had to
overcome was still enormous, including, as others have said, from
within her own party. But as we know, her conviction intensified, her
determination grew and her courage proved formidable. Mrs Thatcher set
out single-mindedly to address her toxic inheritance, and in due course
she did indeed eliminate inflation. She introduced discipline to our
public finances, she privatised the nationalised industries and she
brought the trade unions under a new system of
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:53:31"></hs_TimeCode>. All that

other ways, her premiership was not clear cut. Mrs Thatcher was an
economic but not a social liberal. She was viscerally uneasy about
Europe yet embraced the single market. She hated communism, but she
championed détente. As we all do, she left behind unfinished
business—in her case an under-resourced, underperforming public

Mackay of Clashfern:</Member></B> My Lords, reference has already been
made to Margaret Thatcher as a scientist and to her strong religious
beliefs. However, there is yet another aspect to her experience that we
should have in mind. She was a member of the Bar, having been a pupil
to Lord Brightman, who many of your Lordships will remember from when
he served here as a Member of this House and did tremendous work in
committees of the House in various ways and in various subjects. She
was a trained barrister.</hs_para>

first personal contact with Margaret Thatcher was when she phoned me in
Edinburgh on the Monday after the election in 1979, inviting me to
become the Lord Advocate. A period of intense legal activity followed.
At that time, the Lord Advocate was a member of the UK
Government, but now, of course, he no longer is. He is a member of the
Scottish Government, and the office of the Lord Advocate is to a great
extent replicated in the office held by the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Wallace of Tankerness.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:54:59"></hs_TimeCode> was invited by
Michael Havers, the Attorney-General, to co-operate with him in
advising the Government on a lot of different matters. The ones that
stick particularly in my mind are the European matters, because it was
a time of great struggle in Europe in relation to the contribution that
the United Kingdom had to make, which many thought was excessive. There
were suggestions that we could refuse to make our contribution, and a
lot of advice was sought about that.</hs_para>

most careful on no account to do anything that was contrary to the
legal advice she had received. From time to time, of course, she probed
the soundness of that advice but, assuming the probing had been
unsuccessful in dislodging it, she never went beyond it. Although that
work was, in a sense, just legal work, it had an effect on the way in
which she was able to negotiate, without the need to stop paying, the
reduction in our contribution that she achieved. Many people thought
that it was with the handbag; I believe that it was with really strong
arguments that had been developed in the months before she

that Michael Havers had resigned earlier that day for the reason of ill
health, and she invited me to become the Lord Chancellor. She said that

guests from the other country was the Archbishop of Canterbury and his
wife. The second couple to  go in was the Lord Chancellor and
his wife, and  the Prime Minister followed. My wife could
hardly contain herself at the idea of going in front of Margaret

were there will remember, she had some difficulty in controlling her
emotions. Someone suggested that I should read her response, which of
course she had written out. I said, “No, not at all”,
which was enough to encourage her to carry on, because she got
immediate control of her emotions and finished what she had to say.

Thatcher demonstrate the huge impact she had on our national

Thatcher’s famous drive, conviction and determination as she
worked to save and revive Britain’s
industries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304105000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304105000020">Margaret
Thatcher was that rare creature, a scientist-politician, as many noble
Lords have just mentioned. She liked to get the facts and most
definitely did not like waffle. Those of us who worked with her
witnessed some memorable hand-backings, conducted with a very British,
forensic politeness. Sadly, there was much to be forensic about when
Baroness Thatcher became Prime Minister. Manufacturing dominated the
economic landscape but in both government and private hands, our
industries were underinvested, uncompetitive and unsustainable, which
made them dependent on life support from government. Our manufacturers
were industrial basket cases, yet it seemed a political necessity to
protect the jobs that they represented. Our shop floors, such as
Longbridge, had become global symbols of industrial
anarchy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T17:10:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that this was not merely the fault of the workforce. British managers
were poor. They had no understanding of global competitiveness, product
development or design. They spent their time not managing companies,
but managing their unions. By the 1980s, Japanese technologies and
products starkly demonstrated the fundamental uncompetitiveness of
British industry. As Britain’s first professor of manufacturing,
I had the honour of having my advice sought as the Government searched
for solutions to this crisis. It was pretty bleak at times. I remember
when it was first proposed to privatise Longbridge, nobody even wanted
to buy it. However, there was a solution: hard work for British pride.
British businesses had to start working with foreign companies. Some
resisted that, but not Baroness Thatcher. She always understood the
importance of working better, working smarter and then working
harder<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T17:11:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

never anti-worker, as people think she was. She certainly hated
restrictive practices, barriers and compulsion, but she truly wanted to
give workers a chance to achieve and improve their lives. That is why
she came to encourage us to connect with industry, support advanced
technology and give industrial workers new skills and opportunities,
which we
did<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T17:12:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Thatcher’s legacy to British manufacturers? Through some very
tough times, and despite much criticism, she built a framework for
prosperity by giving British businesses the freedoms they needed to
manage, invest and trade. The removing of the shackles made a huge
difference. What we did not do, after she left, was capitalise on this.
From Birmingham to Sunderland, British and foreign companies which
invested in the future demonstrated what could be done. For example, as
a result of Baroness Thatcher’s reforms, we now have a thriving
automotive industry. Yet too rarely have we seized the chance of
industrial success that Baroness Thatcher’s reforms gave us. For
Governments and business alike, the lure of easy, 
<?notus-xml column=1165?>unearned money was perhaps too great, and that happened for two
generations. It is perhaps ironic that the freedom
that Baroness Thatcher so cherished meant that we suffered from the
financial speculation that she personally regarded with distaste. She
preferred older, purer values: hard work, getting on and earning your
place in the world.</hs_para>

Thatcher. The voice is familiar and firm. I suspect that the noble

Britain growing. We talk about rebalancing the economy; she would have

privatise them. There was, as the noble Lord said, a real problem of
competitiveness and the cost to the taxpayer of sustaining those
industries at a time when we were desperately trying to reduce
borrowing. There was the fact that the jobs in so many of those

difficult process. Some people said that Mrs Thatcher and Sir Keith

said, “Just a minute”, and disappeared out of that

drivers, secretaries and doorkeepers but not at all about Ministers.
That is not true, although 
<?notus-xml column=1167?>on one occasion I protested to Keith Joseph about how she had handled a
particular colleague during a meeting. He looked at me
in utter astonishment and said, “Oh really?
You know her method. She deals in destructive dialogue”. Then he

occasion when she had been on a plane coming back from the United
States. She sat next to the head of MGM—“More Gutsy
Movies”—a man called Lew Wasserman, who was the chief
executive. Somehow on that journey he persuaded her that her crowning
glory as Prime Minister would be the state financing of film studios in
Rainham Marshes in Essex. I was Chief Secretary to the Treasury at the
time and this was revealed to me. I expressed some bewilderment and
astonishment at this proposal and said to her, “But I thought we
believed in controlling expenditure”. I received a glare. I
said, “I thought we believed in low taxes. I thought we
didn’t believe in subsidies to inefficient industries”. I
got more and more desperate and said, “Prime Minister,
there’s no unemployment in Essex. We would have to build the
roads in order to get to Rainham Marshes”. I remember her
glowering at me very fiercely and in desperation I said, “You do
know, Prime Minister, that we’ll have all the environmentalists
against us because there’s a very rare bird”—I
knew about these things—“called the Brent goose that
breeds there”. She looked at me and said, “You are
utterly hopeless. All you ever say is ‘No, no, no’. You
do not have a constructive idea in your head. If you had been in my
Government since 1979, I would have achieved nothing”. I said,
“Well, Prime Minister, you’re always right about
everything but there’s one thing you’re wrong about.
I’ve been in your
Government”—[<I>Laughter</I><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T17:22:28"></hs_TimeCode></I>.]
I went back to the department and said, “The Prime
Minister’s made a very strange decision but we must get on with
it”. A few hours later, a call came through saying that she did
not wish to pursue the matter. I saw her the next day, beaming. She
congratulated me on something but there was no reference whatever to

one’s mother but to do so in the glare of international
publicity and commentary must be particularly hard to bear. I think

House, the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, was kind enough to point out
that from time to time I helped Lady Thatcher as she attended 
<?notus-xml column=1168?>the House of Lords. However, it was becoming something of a burden. I
found that trying to keep going with my job and being here to look
after Margaret was quite difficult, so I thought that I would tackle
this problem. I said, “You know, Margaret, you’ve been
Prime Minister and you’ve done a great service to our country.
You don’t need to come here as often as you do”. She
turned to me and said, “Michael, when we accept appointment to
this place, it is our duty to attend here. How many times have you been
here in the past two months?”.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T17:28:56"></hs_TimeCode> illustrated
her love for Parliament and her devotion to it. Someone said earlier
that she was scared of nothing. She was quite scared of the House of
Commons. I remember seeing her knees knocking when she was making
speeches. That was because she respected the House of Commons. When you
were discussing policy she would often say, “What do we do about
telling Parliament?”. This was always central to her, and she
had great respect for our constitution.</hs_para>

the Centre for Policy Studies, now so ably chaired by my noble friend
Lord Saatchi, where they were trying to build the building blocks to
turn around our country. As a young man I was told that Britain had no
future—that it was best to emigrate. Somebody wrote an editorial
in the <I>Times</I> saying that it would be impossible to govern
without the support of the trade unions. I thought, “I’m
going to have to get involved here”. I never wanted to be a
politician, but I ended up becoming one because of Margaret Thatcher,
Keith Joseph and the battle of ideas. Ideas fascinated her. Whenever
you had an issue or a policy discussion, she would always start by
saying, “What are the facts?”, and then you would work
out how you were going to sell this particularly difficult

was quite forgiving of mistakes, and I made a few. As a young man I was
involved in her leadership campaign as chairman of the Federation of
Conservative Students. We produced literature to encourage people to
vote for her, which was aimed at young people. I made the mistake of
sticking one of the stickers on the party chairman’s door in
central office, and there was the most almighty row, because the slogan
was, “Put a woman on top for a change”. I thought,
“She will never speak to me again”, but typically, she

is said that you can judge people by their opponents, and that has been
used in the context of the disgraceful minority of Trots and socialist
workers who have behaved so badly in recent days. I will mention one
thing about Gordon Brown. As Prime Minister, Gordon Brown invited
Margaret to No. 10 on several occasions but on one occasion she was
invited for the unveiling of a portrait—a portrait of Margaret
that had been commissioned and paid for privately. In his tribute to
her, Gordon Brown said that there were only three other oil portraits
of Prime Ministers in No. 10 Downing Street. One is of Walpole and was
the first portrait of a Prime Minister to hang in the Cabinet Room;
another was of Wellington, who saved us from Napoleon; and the third is
of Winston Churchill, who saved Britain and Europe from the Nazis. He
went on to say, “And I think it is entirely appropriate, Lady
Thatcher, given what you have done for our country, that the fourth
should be of you”. I was astonished by that, and then 
<?notus-xml column=1169?>I thought, “Well, actually, it is possible in politics 
to recognise brilliance and achievements while still
disagreeing”. Gordon Brown deserves considerable credit for
recognising

noble Lord, Lord Griffiths, mentioned Margaret’s Methodism. Her
religion was very important to her. However, she could be pragmatic
about it. In her latter years a number of us tried to get her involved
in social occasions. It is often said that she was not interested in
the arts and music and so on, but that is nonsense. She was just so
busy sorting out the country that she did not have time for it. I
invited her to Ascot, and she said, “Well, I was brought up as a
Methodist and we’re not really keen on this gambling, but I
understand there are six races”. She opened her handbag and
said, “I’ve got £5 for each race. Is that all
right?”. The first race was run and she lost, and she looked
extremely glum. I had seated her next to someone who was a racing
expert, and I said, “What’s happened?”. She said,
“We’ve lost”. I said to this chap, who was called
Dominic Burke, “Dominic, if you lose the next race you’ll
go the way of Michael Heseltine”. She said,
“That’s quite right”. She won every single
subsequent race. She had all this money and said, “I’m
not sure the Methodists were right about this gambling”, and was
so pleased that she stood on the balcony and joined in the singing of
“Roll out the Barrel”. I thought, if only people could
see the real Margaret Thatcher, and not the Margaret Thatcher that has
been painted as an
image.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304109000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0001.htm#1304109000007">A number
of people have pointed to her having a feel and affection for, and an
easy way with, ordinary folk. My noble friend Lord Lamont talked about
this. When I worked for Flemings investment bank, we had a fantastic
collection of pictures. She asked to see the pictures, so I arranged a
dinner and a number of prominent people from the City came to it. They
all sat down while we finished looking at the pictures. I was taking
her up and everybody was waiting for her. Then the lift door opened and
a cleaning lady came face to face with Margaret Thatcher and said,
“Oh, Mrs Thatcher, I like you”. Margaret said, “My
dear, what are you doing here at this time of night?”. She said,
“I’m just finishing my shift, but I’m such an
admirer of yours”. They got chatting and Margaret said,
“Do you do the whole place yourself”. The cleaner said,
“No, I’ve got all my friends downstairs but they
won’t believe that I’ve met you”. Margaret said,
“We’ll go and meet them”. I said, “But
Margaret, we’ve got a dinner going”, but she went down
and talked to all the cleaning ladies while everybody else had to wait.
That was very typical of the way in which she operated.</hs_para>

supported by a magnificent team of people. Of course, Denis was her
main support until his sad death but Mark Worthington, her political
secretary, really did work seven days a week and 24 hours a
day. He did a brilliant job and sometimes dealt with very difficult
issues which came up from time to time. I would particularly like to
mention Cynthia Crawford, who was with her from the start. Crawfie
organised her wardrobe and I can tell your Lordships that she was very
careful about how she used her clothes and how they could be recycled.

Minister, when Keith Joseph paid a handsome tribute to her. He had been
the architect of so many of the ideas that she, with her pragmatism and

beautiful giant who had achieved more than any of us ever dreamt would
be possible. I cannot add to how he put it. He is, sadly, not with us

her last appointment to the Cabinet. In the run-up to the first Gulf
War, I was going across two or three times every day as Minister of
State at the Foreign Office until she said, “Come in, William, I
want a word with you. You are to be Secretary of State for
Health”. This was unexpected news to me, as it was to the rest
of the country and certainly to the health service. She looked at me
and said, “I think you need a large whisky. I will have one too.

and tried to follow them through. However, that showed that although
she was often described as an ideologue—this is a point that has

only woman to be Prime Minister and the first and only scientist to be
Prime Minister. I hope that there will be more of both. As the noble
Lord, Lord May, said, she played an extremely important part in a
number of crucial scientific issues, of which perhaps the most famous
was the work to take action to stop the production of
CFCs—chlorofluorocarbons—which were damaging the ozone
layer. It did no harm, of course, that some of the crucial science
which led to the proof of the damage to the ozone layer had been done
by British scientists, by the British Antarctic Survey, so it was
respectable science. She

successful. As a Minister in the Department of the Environment, I tried
to persuade her to impose flue gas desulphurisation on the power
stations to stop acid rain. She did not want to do it, 
<?notus-xml column=1171?>partly because she did not want to put the price of coal up and damage
the coal industry even more, although this may
sound paradoxical to some. I plotted with Horst Teltschik, who ran
Chancellor Kohl’s office, and said to him ahead of a bilateral
summit in Bonn, “Will you get your man to really put some
pressure on over this, because I think she might move”. She
obviously saw me coming a long way in advance. We arrived in Bonn in
helicopters and got out. There was a local inversion—a local hot
day—and therefore smog. “Now Helmut”, she said to
the cowering Chancellor—he was always a little nervous of her,
as were others—“I will tell you what you have here. You
have got an inversion and a smog. If you had proper clean air laws,
like we do in England, that would have put paid to all that. I will
explain the chemistry to you if you like”. He did not want to
know the chemistry and no more was heard over that weekend of my plot.

said in casual conversation, which was actually very difficult with
Baroness Thatcher, “I saw Carol on television the other

years—probably a world record for anybody in that position. I
saw 29 Foreign Office Ministers come and go but only two Prime

Euro-enthusiasm of her speech at Bruges, which still reads well as an
epistle to Britain’s strong position in Europe, to the famous
day in the House of Commons when she quoted Jacques Delors and said,
“No, no, no”. My memory was not of the “No, no,
no”, emphatically delivered, but of watching the face of the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, the Deputy Prime Minister, as she
said the words. It was as if he had been slapped across the face with a
dead fish. Clearly it had a major impact, and perhaps that was the
beginning of the end of the Thatcher

the day I was appointed Secretary-General of NATO in 1999, I received
hand-written letters from both Jim Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher
congratulating me on the job that I was about to take and offering me
their best wishes for what I was about to do. It was a remarkable thing
to get two such letters on the same day. I had a lot of experience in
foreign affairs to take with me to NATO. A lot of what I had to do in
opposition was to agree with the Government over the Falklands, Hong
Kong and the rest of it. I also had to attend a series of functions
held by the Government. I used to think that Lancaster House was my
works canteen. I went to one lunch in Downing Street with Russell
Johnston, representing the opposition parties, in honour of the King of
Tonga. He was a very large gentleman with a very small voice. Russell
Johnston and I were very keen to get back to the House of Commons for
Question Time at 2.30 pm but recognised that we could not leave before
the principal guest. We waited until the last second when
Mrs Thatcher walked out of the room with the King of Tonga
to escort him to the lift. Russell Johnston and I shot down the stairs
but were overtaken by the Prime Minister. She said, “The king is
in the lift”. Clearly, if the King of Tonga was in the lift,
nobody else could get in. I said, “Yes, he’s quite a
sizeable guy, but very difficult to hear at the back”. She said,
“Oh, wasn’t it fascinating what he said?”. Her
eyes were glowing. “He said he’s probably the first Prime
Minister in history to go on to become king”. Russell Johnston

was a remarkable person. As I travelled both as Defence Secretary and
Secretary-General of NATO, I realised that she was a very significant
figure outside the country. As her popularity declined in this country

pioneering instinct that she had had,  
<?notus-xml column=1174?>especially in central and eastern Europe, was well registered and
recorded, and will be there for a long time to come. I have had a lot
to do with Russia. I was the first chairman of the NATO-Russia Council.
I recognise that the Russians saw in her somebody who was strong in her
beliefs and in what she stood for. They respect strength. The collapse
of the Soviet Union that occurred—I remind the House—30
months after its exit from Afghanistan was a seminal moment in world
politics. However much we disagree with her in other areas, we cannot

They do not exist any more. Maybe they were going to go anyway. Heavy
steel, engineering and the coal industry are perhaps in decline all
across the western world, but it was, as some of her former Ministers
have said, the way in which it was done which left the lasting

we have to register and remember. She was a mixed blessing. Of that
there is no doubt. I have got a feeling that some of these distasteful
and disgraceful demonstrations that have taken place in the streets
might well have pleased her. She was not somebody who expected acclaim
and unanimity, whether it was in the European Council or in the country
as a whole. I remember the night that my friend the noble Lord, Lord
Forsyth of Drumlean, organised a special dinner after 9/11 in memory of
the employees of JPMorgan Chase who had died in the attacks on the
World Trade Centre. Margaret Thatcher was there with Denis at the
table. She made some comments about me speaking at the dinner; anyway,
she was quite cordial. At the end there was a toast, the loyal toast to
Her Majesty the Queen, followed by a toast to the President of the
United States of America. I leant in across and said, “What if
there was a toast to the President of the European Commission?”.

privilege of working closely with her. I do not want to talk about
those. Much has been said about the trials and tribulations of what
happened over that decade. However, taking the words of Premier Chou
En-Lai, when asked whether the French Revolution had been a
success—“It is too soon to say”—I believe

aspect that has not really been covered which I would like to mention.
It has been covered partially. I refer to her
compassion and her greatness as a human being. Much has been said about
the Falklands, but a little known fact about the Falklands is that
every night during the six weeks of the campaign she would have a list
of the casualties and every night, before going to bed, she would write
a long, hand-written letter to the parents or partner, explaining how
they lost their lives and in what a good cause it really

this myself two or three years later. My young brother, Stuart, who was
chairman of the BBC, died. On the day he died, by the time I got home,
there was a three-page letter from Margaret, condoling me and talking
about Stuart. An hour later, I got a phone call from Shirley, his
widow. She had just received a similar letter, entirely different in
content. Later on that day, my mother rang me. She had also received a
letter from Margaret. How many serving Prime Ministers would take the

other little story shows that side of her character. After she had left
office, my wife and I took her and Denis out for dinner. We were

“Don’t say a word. If you complain, he’ll lose his

Butler, and Margaret Thatcher at that very time. It was very late. We
were writing the speech. Those occasions went on for ever. I thought I
had the final bit. I knew I had not, of course, because there used
sometimes to be speeches where I would be in the cellar writing on the
autocue as it was moving and as she was speaking a bit that she decided
she did not like. However, on this occasion, the noble Lord, Lord
Butler, was finishing some work with her and I had just walked across
the corridor to get the final speech photographed when there was a
terrible bang. Automatically, the girls working in the office running
off the speech and I all got to the floor. There was a second bang

my knees, I moved towards the door, opened it and put my head around
it. On the other side of the corridor, the door to Mrs
Thatcher’s room opened and she was on her knees looking around
the door. Tragic comedy are the only words that I can say to describe
what was happening. It was a mixture of, “What has happened?
What should we do? Don’t we both look silly?” She got up,
brushed herself down and said, “Right, we had better get on with
something”. But what should we get on with, because we had no
idea? She knew that things had to go on. She never said, “The
party conference will continue”. Everyone assumed that it would
because we knew—that was the point made by the noble Lord, Lord
Tebbit—exactly how 
<?notus-xml column=1176?>she would react and precisely what we would be expected to do. So we
went off and organised the continuance of the conference. No one asked
the question, except for the local chief of police. We soon told him
that he had better not ask her that or he might be in even worse
trouble than he clearly was going to be.

“Would you come and help me write speeches?”. I was
surprised because I did not come from the same part of the party and I
would not automatically have been thought of as a natural writer. But
once she knew that you were loyal and that you cared about her, the
relationship was absolutely one of trust, confidence and support.
Occasionally, she would say, “Don’t listen to this John,

could not understand why I was seated next to her on the day we went
with the Queen to open the Channel Tunnel. I was the Secretary of State
for the Environment. We were both sitting there and I could not
understand why. Then I realised that I was the foil. As we moved out of
the station, she said, “This has got nothing to do with the
Germans, you know. It is entirely the French. But I do not see why we
import all that food from France. Why should we buy French cheese? We
have perfectly good cheese of our own.”. I realised that she
wanted an argument; so an argument we had. The argument went terribly
well and we were half way through before either of us recognised that
we had gone into the tunnel. It was absolutely a typical part of what
she loved, which was to discover where she wanted to be by saying
something to which she demanded a response. Her

anything to eat, there were late-night meals in her flat. The first
thing she would ask if you were late was, “Have you had
something to eat?”. I have eaten more coronation chicken
produced by Margaret Thatcher than I have at any other place or at any
other time. I think that she did know how to cook other things but that

asked about them and was interested in them. She knew their names and

a favour,

nice fluffy lamb for touching. However, she walked up to the calf, put
her arms round it and picked it up. It was very heavy. For the
photographers, it was fantastic—wonderful. Holding up the calf,
she said, “I’m going to call it Victory”. However,
the calf was ill and we got every vet in Suffolk to attend to it. We
hid the calf from public eye and kept it alive until after the

serious things. First, I echo the comments of the noble Baroness, and
my very much loved friend, Lady Trumpington. Margaret Thatcher was a
very beautiful woman. She had beautiful hands and lovely ankles, and
she knew precisely how to use both. Any woman who is stupid enough to
think that there is something unsuitable about using the gifts that God
has given her should be ashamed of herself. She knew perfectly well
that she used them not because she was not as good as men but because
she was better than men, and she also wanted to have a bit of an
advantage. It was a pleasure to see how she turned herself out and how

I think that history will remember a rather special thing about her.
She was a very cautious woman. She did not take on things lightly and
she took them on one at a time. She recognised that you could not have
a whole plethora of interventions, initiatives, new ideas and
headline-grabbing ideas. She knew that you won things only by taking
them one and one, by fighting them through and succeeding with them one
at a time. Caution is something that does not normally go with a
charismatic leader, but one reason that she stayed for so long and was
so successful was that she did not go ahead with the abolition of the
dock labour scheme until she had dealt with the problems of the mining
industry. She did not move to privatise water until she had made sure
that people recognised that it was the only way to pay the bills. She
had a quality of caution, which is something that very few people of
her strength have ever evinced.</hs_para>

of greatness. She was a star, and stars rarely come. When they do, we

party are often derided. They can lead to tribal politics, too much
adversarial behaviour, tit for  
<?notus-xml column=1178?>tat, Punch and Judy, and so on. But those words in the hands of Margaret
Thatcher had a magnificence which only she

achieved. I will explain how I know that.</hs_para>

she was deposed, the view arose in our party that it would be a good
thing, as there was much tension in the party at the time, obviously,
if the former Prime Minister was invited to our party conference. It
would be cathartic. She would not speak—that would be too
dangerous—but she would go on to the stage to receive the
applause of the party and that would be a cathartic moment. That was
the idea.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000016">I
was with her in the green room in Blackpool and, in the course of
making the kind of conversation that one does in the green room at
party conferences, she said, “What did you do last night,
Maurice?”. I said, “I had a lovely dinner with Professor
Anthony King”, whom she knew. She said, “Where did you
go?”. I said, “We went to a lovely restaurant, but a
funny thing happened”. She asked what. I explained that we were
upstairs; the downstairs was absolutely packed, as all restaurants in
Blackpool are during party conference week. I explained that, upstairs,
there was only our table for two and the rest of the room was empty. A
long table was laid out for dinner for about 16 people. Professor King
and I had the room to ourselves, as I explained. I also explained to
her that when it came to pay the bill, I asked the woman who owned the
restaurant: “What happened to those people?”. It was a
shocking moment and I remember it vividly. I have never described it
before, but I am doing so now. She said, “You did this. Your
party did this. Don’t you realise that my husband and I
can’t keep this place running. Party conference week is the most
important week of our lives. Without the money from party conference
week, this restaurant would close”. I said that I was very
sorry; I paid the bill and we left. It was very upsetting. She was in
tears.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000017">I
explained all that to Margaret and then—this is exactly what
happened—she said, “Maurice, pass me my handbag”.
I did not know what she was talking about. I passed her handbag to her
and she started to rummage inside and took out her pen. She continued
to rummage inside and took out a cheque book. She said,
“Maurice, what was the name of the restaurant you went to last
night?”. I said, “I think it was the Blackpool
Brasserie”. She wrote the words Blackpool Brasserie on the
cheque and said, “How much do you think they lost as a result of
those people not coming?”. I said, “I don’t know,
£300 or £350”. She made out the cheque; she signed
it “Margaret Thatcher”. She tore it out of her cheque
book, gave it to me and said, “I want you, Maurice, to take this
cheque to the restaurant, give it to the man or the woman who owns it
and tell them, ‘Conservatives don’t behave like
that’”. What a
woman.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13041022000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000163">6.09

Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde:</Member></B> My Lords, Mrs Thatcher, as she
then was, was a truly remarkable woman. She was elected in 1975 as
leader of the Conservative Party. We need to take into account the fact
it was not just the fact that she was elected the first woman leader of
the Conservative Party, and what she 
<?notus-xml column=1179?>had to overcome, but her very humble background and beginnings. I can
remember quite clearly the impact that had on women in Britain.
Whatever your political views at that time, we realised that she had
made a huge achievement in a party that we had always regarded as
male-dominated: the old boys, public school and all the rest of it.
From the side came this woman who succeeded in being elected as leader
of the Conservative Party. At the time, one of my heroines, Barbara
Castle, wrote—and I paraphrase—“Having listened to
the lass, she deserves to be elected. She is head and shoulders above
any of her opponents, but I don’t think they know what
they’re getting”. How true that
was<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:10:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

another important landmark. It was the year that the United Nations
declared International Women’s Year. It was also the year that
Barbara Castle’s Equal Pay Act and the Sex Discrimination Act
became effective. Many of the women in Britain, of all political
parties and none, felt that this was a turning point for us: this
really was good news and women would start to make their mark more than
they had been able to in the past. It would be down to ability rather
than a whole host of other
criteria<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:11:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000020">It
is regrettable that the legacy of this quite remarkable woman, who was
the dominant politician in the 1980s, did not much encourage the growth
of women coming forward and taking positions of authority. I have heard
today many warm stories that I have never heard before from
Conservative Peers in this Chamber which, it seems to me, are stories
of the family of conservatism. However, we must also remember that the
public perception was not that. It was one of a Prime Minister who,
whatever political party a Prime Minister comes from, has a
responsibility to try to generate within the nation a feeling of one
nation, consensus and being able to move forward together. Yet that
public persona of conviction and confrontation held back much of what
might otherwise have been
achieved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:12:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about the trades unions. It has become a mantra, one of her huge
achievements. It is just as dangerous to sweep all trades unions into
one pocket of description, as it is to do so to any political party or
group. There are trades unionists who recognise that change needed to
take place. There are some sat on these Benches today, and I like to
think that I was one of them; certainly, my noble friend Lord Young of
Norwood was another, and my noble friend Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe. We
were trying to make changes. Unfortunately, that statement about
“the enemy within” was probably one of the most
polarising statements against any change that we would have been able
to achieve, and made consensus difficult. Had Mrs Thatcher, as Prime
Minister, taken the same view with a number of the trades unions in
Britain as she had with the President of Poland, in suggesting that he
should talk to Lech Walesa and his fellow workers, maybe the outcome
would have been
different<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:14:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

history will deal. It will also be for history to judge her, but I
think that we can all agree today that none of us would either support
or 
<?notus-xml column=1180?>condone, whatever our political views, the small number—we need
to keep it in perspective—of demonstrations against Mrs
Thatcher, bizarrely celebrating her passing. That is not something with
which any of us indentify or would condone.</hs_para>

memories I have of Mrs Thatcher was that many on the
Conservative Benches in the Commons did not want her elected. She won.
She deserved to win. Yet her last day in office as Prime Minister was
marked by the brutality with which people in her own party treated her,
somehow forgetting all that she had achieved for them. That was a
disgraceful day, in my view, and did not recognise her achievements for
the party. To hear all the support, warmth and memories that are being
given today, there are some members of her party who have perhaps
forgotten the role that they played in that very brutal downfall. It is
something that my own party have never done to a leader in the past and
I hope will never do in the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:15:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000024">History

MacGregor of Pulham Market:</Member></B> My Lords, there is so much
with which I agree in all the many tributes paid to Lady Thatcher
today. However, at this stage, I will add only a few examples of my own
about her qualities. Bearing in mind the point made by my noble friend
Lord Lamont, I believe that this session is providing for future
historians examples, hitherto not revealed in public, of the many
aspects of this remarkable lady and countering the sometimes false
images of her. In so doing, I draw attention to a book that has just
recently been published by my noble friend Lady Shephard of
Northwold—an admirable and timely book—entitled <I>The
Real Iron Lady</I>. The book conveys Baroness Thatcher’s
character, characteristics and values through the personal anecdotes
and recollections of 
<?notus-xml column=1181?>those who, at various times and in various capacities, worked closely
with her or were in contact with her. It is a very useful supplement to
some of the illustrations that we have had
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:18:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000027">There
are a few of my own anecdotes in the book, which I will not repeat
today. However, I will briefly recall this afternoon three others,
among many memories, each demonstrating a facet of her strengths.
Shortly after I was elected to the House of Commons in 1974, I became a
member of the Committee on the Finance Bill, which in those days went
on interminably and at great length for many days, through the night in
the upper corridors of the House of Commons, going line by line through
the various proposals in the Finance Bill itself. Baroness Thatcher was
at that point our opposition Front-Bench spokesman on economic affairs,
so led on the Finance Bill in the Committee stages. On the day of her
election as leader, we were meeting in Committee that afternoon and
evening. As some others will recollect, none of us on the Committee
expected her to be with us at all that evening, given the many
interviews that she had to give and the many celebration drinks and so
on with all of her supporters. Robert Carr, later Lord Carr, who was
then her Front-Bench deputy on economic affairs, took the lead in
Committee. I happened to be on my feet, dealing with a very abstruse
and technical point on some aspect of the Finance Bill, in full flow at
about half past ten, when to my astonishment the door opened and in
walked Margaret Thatcher. She proceeded to sit on the Front Bench for
the whole of the rest of our session, through the night, leading from
the Front Bench. I was so astonished at her arrival, and so obsessed
with my technical details, that I am afraid I mumbled a rather
inadequate congratulation on her victory. However, we were all
absolutely amazed that she stayed to see the session through. That
demonstrated in a remarkable way her dedication and very strong sense
of public duty, and her commitment to her duty in the House of
Commons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:20:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000028">Secondly,
as Minister for Agriculture, I was very much involved in the first
full-blown reform of the common agricultural policy. We had many
sessions in Brussels on that front. We had got to a point in the middle
of the night where we were near to reaching agreement, but it went
beyond the negotiating brief agreed for me by the Cabinet. I had to
refer back to the Prime Minister for her agreement and authority to go
ahead in the way that I wanted to. If I remember correctly, this was at
about three o’clock in the morning, so I agonised long and hard
about when I should ring her to get her approval. I rang at about 6 am,
got straight through and heard her response in a very clear voice.
Clearly she had been up for some time, working on her briefs—I
very much take the point made on this by the noble Lord, Lord
Armstrong. I got her agreement and we were able to go ahead. That
demonstrated her indefatigable energy, her immense capacity for work
and her decisiveness when
convinced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:21:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000029">I
will add two separate points. On one occasion in Brussels, I collapsed
with a burst ulcer in the middle of the night and had to be carted away
briefly to hospital. I was astonished the next morning to receive a
very large bowl of flowers and a warm sympathy note from 
<?notus-xml column=1182?>Baroness Thatcher herself. It was another example—we have heard
many today—of her kindnesses in so many ways. I was greatly
touched<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:22:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000030">I
very much support—because I had experience of this
myself—the points made by my noble friend Lord Fowler and others
in relation to the way in which she absolutely tore into you if you
were not a master of your brief and in full command not only of the
facts but of the arguments. This was a bit disconcerting at first. You
thought that she was basically disagreeing and that you would get
nowhere, but if you persisted and knew the facts of your brief, she
would agree. It took me some time to realise that this was her style,
because I recognised that it was what I did to civil servants who put
forward briefs to me. I always looked overnight for the points that I
was not happy about or did not agree with, and started off with those
before in the end agreeing with the conclusions that the paper had
made. That was a great feature of all the negotiations that we as
individuals had with Baroness
Thatcher<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:23:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000031">My
last example is her final speech in the House of Commons on her
resignation. As Leader of the House, I was sitting next to her during
the speech. It was obviously an immensely difficult occasion and I was
very nervous for her. I need not have worried. She defended her record
and achievements with great clarity, power and eloquence. Half way
through she was questioned by some opposition Back-Benchers—in
particular, if I remember correctly, Dennis Skinner—to whom she
responded with great gusto, drawing a huge response from her own
Back-Benchers. At the end of the put-down she said something like,
“Now, where was I? You know, I’m enjoying this”.
It was absolutely typical of the way in which she approached these
speeches. It was a remarkable speech, and a performance that displayed
the qualities of great courage and conviction that have been referred
to frequently today and by which I will always remember
her.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_10_PT_1/C838837A7A0D50743D11A4FEA0B0FB5FA7FF4FDF" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 April 2013">Wednesday,

Hamilton of Epsom:</Member></B> My Lords, I joined my noble friend Lord
Jopling’s Whips’ Office in 1982. The highlight of our
year was when the Prime Minister came to have dinner with us, which
normally ended with a question and answer session when her praetorian
guards of Whips were treated rather like backsliding leftists. However,
it was always a very invigorating occasion. It was a great honour for
us when she then suggested that she might return the favour and that we
might come with our wives to have lunch at Chequers. Unfortunately,
that never happened because the Brighton bomb came in between, so
instead dinner was laid on in Downing Street for both the Lords and the
Commons Whips.</hs_para>

same way, with the Prime Minister saying, “Right, does anybody
have any problems or concerns they would like to raise?”. I
remember that my noble friend Lady Trumpington asked the first
question, about pensions. She got slapped down pretty swiftly, and then
John Major, who was the Treasury Whip, piped up and said, “Prime
Minister, there is deep concern in the country on the following
issues”. She went for him such as I have never seen. A row
erupted of such seriousness that it ended on a 
<?notus-xml column=1183?>very sour note. At one stage, we thought that John Major might even walk
out of the room, and we were very concerned that he may have completely
destroyed his political career. As we walked from the dining room to
the drawing room in Downing Street, Denis Thatcher came up to him and
said, “Don’t worry, dear boy, she gets like this
sometimes”. The next day, she reconciled the position with John
Major, and three months later he was a junior Minister in her
Government. That story is becoming better known and is very
significant, because it indicates the sort of woman that she was. She
loved the row but never had any feelings of bitterness. She respected
people who stood up to her and never held it against anybody at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000034">I came to
get to know her much better in 1987, when I was made her PPS. If I am
brutally frank, I was not terribly good at the job. I did very badly
when Alan Clark came to see her as Minister of Trade, and  I
totally failed to tell the Prime Minister something. I do not think she
was aware that Alan Clark always rather prided himself on having two
attributes of Adolf Hitler, namely that he was a vegetarian and hated
foxhunting. His pitch to the Prime Minister was that he considered it a
very good idea if labels were to be put on furs saying, “The fur
being sold here has been caught in an extremely inhumane trap”.
It would have been rather like having a health warning on cigarettes.
The Prime Minister was absolutely appalled by this and said,
“Alan, what on earth makes you so concerned to do this?”.
He said, “Prime Minister, didn’t you know that I’m
a vegetarian?”. She looked at him and said, “But Alan,
you are wearing leather shoes”. He drawled, “I do not
think you expect your Ministers to wear plastic shoes, Prime
Minister”. Needless to say, the pleas got nowhere because the
calculation that Alan Clark had not made was that because the Prime
Minister was MP for Finchley, many of her Jewish constituents were
furriers and the last thing she was going to do was ruin their
business.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000035">She
was very interesting. She never read the daily papers. I remember
taking that up with her at one stage and asking why she did not. Every
morning in Downing Street, we used to get the most wonderful summary of
absolutely everything that was in the daily papers from Bernard
Ingham’s press department. I would give my eye teeth to get hold
of that today; it was a brilliant piece of work. However, she used to
say, “I never read the daily papers because they write such
harmful and personal abuse about me and my family that I could never
get the job done that I have to do”. Later, when John Major was
Prime Minister and having his problems with the media, I raised this
with him. I said that she had never actually read the daily papers, and
he looked at me as if I had gone slightly weak in the head. Certainly,
part of her thing in life was that you have to do the job you are faced

had no opportunity to present his paper as such.

kept to the timescale, which was half an hour for the meeting. We were
coming to the end, and she summed up by saying, “Of course, I
agree with absolutely everything you are trying to do here. I just
thought I’d play devil’s advocate and make sure that

Conservatives she was always terribly bored that the socialists had
something called “Socialist International”. She thought
that this gave a lot of respectability to left-wing parties, and she
could not quite understand why the Conservatives should not have the

called the European Democrat Union, which later moved on to be the
International Democrat Union. Although she never took me, as her PPS,
on foreign trips, this was a party political occasion, because the IDU
meeting was being chaired by Chancellor Kohl. We sat in the most
enormous room in the Reichstag building—this was, of course,
before the wall came down—and Chancellor Kohl gave a speech to
welcome everybody that I strongly suspect was written by somebody else.
She just made a few short notes, and when it came to her opportunity to
speak she pointed through the window and said, “People tell me
that the building that we can see over the Berlin Wall, out through
this window, is the headquarters of the East German intelligence
service. People also say to me that they are probably listening to
every word we are saying here today, in which case I would like them to
know—”, and she then went into a great tirade about how
freedom was what we were all fighting for, and that freedom would
conquer in the end. How right she was; the wall came down not very much

going on about the worrying question of women priests. She said that
she did not think that there should be women priests in the Church of
England because she thought it would split the Church of England. I
took issue with her and said, “I don’t think, Prime
Minister, that as a woman Prime Minister you can really take objection
to women becoming priests. Anyway, I don’t know what

Naseby:</Member></B> My Lords, in paying my tribute to Margaret
Thatcher, I can now share with the House a little piece of history. I
was Airey Neave’s unofficial PPS in 1975, and chief bag carrier.
My job was to help him organise the future leader of the Conservative
Party. In the initial stages, we met in Room J3 in the House of
Commons; it was my job to book it, et cetera. The first person that the
Neave team supported was not Margaret Thatcher; it was Edward du Cann.
That campaign produced 80 or 85 supporters; it was 
<?notus-xml column=1188?>around those sorts of numbers. However, Edward came to that group and
made it clear that he did not wish to stand as the future leader,
because he had recently married and he and his wife had discussed the
situation and he was withdrawing his
candidature<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:46:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000058">We
had an immediate meeting of the group and went through the others
forecast to be running, and the consensus was that we should ask
Margaret to join us. At that point, the information was that Margaret
had precisely two supporters. I was asked to make contact, which I did,
and Margaret came to address our meeting in Room J3. It was clear from
the way that she addressed that meeting that this was a woman of
considerable potential. Several Members this afternoon have mentioned
“strategy”; she had a very clear strategy at that
meeting, and had sensed what the party wanted in a new leader. Airey
turned to me when Margaret had finished and said, “We’ll
have no questions now. Would you be kind enough, Michael, to take
Margaret to the room next door and come back?”, which I did. We
had a fairly lengthy discussion. The unanimous view of the people
present, except for three, was that we should support Margaret
Thatcher<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:47:25"></hs_TimeCode>. Most

second example I give of Margaret and her ability and understanding of
people and countries was after we took over in 1979 and I was on the
Back Benches as a PPS in Northern Ireland. Even then,  I had an
interest in Sri Lanka. Judith Hart had commissioned something called
the Victoria Dam in Sri Lanka. I knew about the dam—it would
cost about £100 million—and I asked to see the Prime
Minister to suggest to her that the project should go ahead. I had an
audience with her, and with the then Overseas Development Secretary of
State, and Margaret said, “Michael, there are two points I make
to you: first, that if we as a country have an agreement with another
country”—as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, said
earlier today—“we stick to it. So the agreement is that
the project will go ahead. Not only will it go ahead but, secondly, I
wish to be there at the opening”.</hs_para>

years later I was pleased to be there with Margaret and Denis, and we
had a garden party before the formal opening at the dam. The big thing
in Sri Lanka in those days was the President’s elephant named
Raja. Denis was asked whether he wished to give bananas to the
elephant, and of course accepted. Unfortunately for Denis, he was not
too good on the anatomy of an elephant. Denis decided that elephants
took bananas through their trunks. Just as Margaret was about to tell
him, “No, don’t put it in his trunk”, it was too
late. Denis put half a dozen bananas in the trunk of the elephant,
which then did a typical elephant snort and the rest of us were covered
by bananas. Margaret said, “I thought I told you early on,
‘Put it in his mouth, not in his trunk’. Did you not hear

Governor-General of the Bahamas and, with your wife, enjoy the rest of
your life”. It is said that Clem Attlee would say, “Look,

memory I will share with the House goes back almost to her last day in
government. I was Minister for Housing and she summoned me to the
Cabinet Room. It was a one-to-one meeting—I was on my own with
her—and she said the words that will always be in my mind. We
had had our meeting and I was packing up my papers when she said,
“Michael, you know we’ve failed to destroy the dependency
culture”. That stuck with me. A lot has been said today about
her caution, and I will say a word about it myself. What has not been
said is that she did in some cases regret that caution. That is
something that has not fully come over. It was not just the dependency
culture, although she did regret that she had not done anything to make
sure that the welfare state was focused on those who really needed
support. In the modern idiom, she would have “done her
nut” had she realised that it would be a Conservative-Lib Dem
coalition Government who would be the first to do something about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:53:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000066">On
privatisation, there were all sorts of things that she would have
liked. She did not privatise coal, the railways, the nuclear industry

electricity—as it happened I was the Minister who took the Bill

of persuasion of my noble friend Lord Parkinson against the advice of
Walter Marshall, her great friend and mentor in many ways, that created
the Bill that we eventually put through Parliament. It was very much

stress her caution only because others have emphasised her sense of
direction and the wonderful things that she achieved. Her caution

of an antidote to some of the more critical things that have been said
about her extremism and her desire to do things in a hurry. Far from
it—I think that sometimes she felt that she had not done things

her impetuosity has been much misinterpreted, and that has come across
in several speeches today. She was a very cautious and very wise
person, and that is why she was so effective. It was a great honour to

Selkirk of Douglas:</Member></B> My Lords, I express sympathy to Mark
and Carol Thatcher, and I endorse the view of several noble Lords that
Margaret Thatcher was prepared to go the extra mile on small,
non-political, non-party matters last thing at night when she returned
to her office in Downing Street. I remember being told that by the late
Ian Gow, who took me into her office and showed me the kinds of letters
that were sent to her, as well as bottles of whisky for charity fetes
and the like. Just like an old trooper, she would settle down and sign
the

a Minister in her Government was challenging, interesting and never
dull. In Scotland, home ownership went up from about 30% to about 60%
under her premiership, which was a massive change. Lady Thatcher
believed very strongly in expanding home ownership, and one episode is
extremely vivid in my memory. The Prime Minister was in Uphall, West
Lothian, for the first rent-to-mortgage sale in Scotland to former
public sector tenants. As we stood in their sitting room in that small
house, a girl who was the editor of the local school magazine asked Mrs
Thatcher, as she then was, what her favourite sport was. The Prime
Minister immediately made the surprising revelation that it was skiing.
She then went on to say that neither she nor any of her Ministers would
be doing any skiing at all, as none of them could afford the time off
if they broke a leg. As it happened, I looked across at Michael
Forsyth—now the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean—who
was Secretary of State for Scotland and was standing just beside her. I
knew for a fact that both he and I had just completed our arrangements
to go skiing within days, if not hours. We gave each other a smile but
said not a

transfer of ownership, I was invited to go with her in the Prime
Minister’s car and, as we left, a protestor hurled an egg
straight at us. The driver accelerated and the egg landed harmlessly in

happened, and it was then that I realised that she was not called the

Butler of Brockwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I have listened to all the
wonderful tributes paid this afternoon and this evening, and I have
asked myself whether there is anything which I can add. There are just
one or two aspects which I should like to add. I was not going to speak
about the Brighton bomb because her resolution and courage on that
occasion has been widely dealt with. However, since the noble Lord,
Lord Deben, who I am glad to see in his place, referred to it and to
the tragicomic aspect of it, I should supplement the picture that he
gave of his crawling to the door, opening it and meeting Margaret
Thatcher’s face on the other side. As he may remember, she was
gorgeously attired in the blue evening dress that she had been wearing
for the blue ball, which added to the absurdity of that tragic
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:00:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000077">I
am very pleased that reference has been made to the kindness shown to
Lady Thatcher by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth. I believe that another
person should be added. He is a colleague of mine on the Cross Benches
and was a colleague at No 10; namely, my noble friend Lord Powell of
Bayswater. He and his wife have been splendid to Lady Thatcher in her
latter days. Indeed, I think that on Sunday evening, he was the last
person, outside her family, to visit
her<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:01:17"></hs_TimeCode>. About a
month ago, my noble friend said that he had been with her on a Sunday
afternoon. I asked him what he talked to her about because, of course,
in her latter months, she found conversation difficult. He said,
“We didn’t talk. We turned on the television and we
watched ‘Songs of Praise’ and we sung the hymns
together”. I think that that is a lovely picture of those two
doing
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:01:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000078">The
noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, has spoken splendidly about the support
which Margaret Thatcher gave him as Cabinet Secretary, and her support
for the Civil Service and the esteem in which she held it. I do not
want to add to that, except to endorse everything that he said as being
the case during my experience in the post which he occupied before
me<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:02:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000079">I
should like to take up what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay,
said about her role as a lawyer. I am very glad he referred to that. I
had a word with him outside the Chamber. Another aspect that needs to
be emphasised was the way in which she upheld the rule of law, which
was a very important principle in her life. I was travelling in a car
with the Prime Minister when we saw on a newspaper hoarding that the
High Court had found against the Government in the judicial review
about the Government’s banning of unions at GCHQ. She was going
to the House of Commons that afternoon and it was clear that, quite
understandably, the Labour Party would make a lot of this and would be
jubilant about it because it had supported the trade unions in opposing
the Government’s action. She said, 
<?notus-xml column=1192?>“Well, we must appeal but if the court rules against us, we must
of course accept its judgment. We cannot ask the miners to accept the
rule of law if we, the Government, are not prepared to accept it
ourselves”. That is just one illustration of the principle that
she
held<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:03:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000080">When
judicial review was gaining force and I was head of the Civil Service,
I suggested to Margaret Thatcher that we might arrange a seminar
between senior civil servants and some of the judges so that the judges
would know more about the way in which decisions were taken in
government. “Absolutely not”, she said. “I am not
going to have any appearance of the Executive appearing to interfere
with the independence of the judges. We must keep them strictly
separate”. That is an aspect of her principles and her
Administration that I do not think has been much
mentioned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:04:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000081">The
noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, spoke of his experience working with her as
Cabinet Secretary. Although the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, was here
earlier, nobody has spoken about the experience of working with her as
a Private Secretary. Like the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, I was her
Principal Private Secretary, in my case between 1982 and 1985. Inside
No.10, having the privilege of seeing her in that intimate setting, we
of course saw a very different person from the one that the public saw
outside. The public saw the bravura performances and the confidence.
She has been charged with being overconfident, even arrogant, but you
saw a very different picture, before the great public appearances,
inside No. 10—somebody whose motivation and force was not built
on overconfidence but was in fact built on lack of self-confidence. I
say that because I heard her say it herself publicly, after she left
office. She said it was something that the media never really realised
about her. I believe that that was the driving force behind her
perfectionism in her appearance, in her dress, in her speeches and in
her grip on her briefing. All those things had to be perfect before she
would appear in public. There was a reference earlier to the conference
speech after the Brighton bomb and her sitting in the green room,
saying, “I am not sure I can go through with this”.
Gordon Reece said, “Of course you can go through with
it”. I am absolutely certain that she was always going to go
through with it. Many times, I saw her say beforehand that she was not
sure she could do something and then go out and give a bravura
performance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000082">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:06:50"></hs_TimeCode>
I was Principal Private Secretary, in briefing her for Prime
Minister’s Questions, I did not brief her on the
facts—other people did that—but regarded my job as being
to calm her down, usually by reassuring her that her case was good in
answer to a Question and, just occasionally, if she was sleepy after
lunch, to work her up a bit and say, “Prime Minister, I think
you have to worry about this Question, this is quite difficult”.
It was about getting the horse to the starting gate with exactly the
right amount of perspiration on the flanks, and then she would perform
superbly in the House of
Commons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:07:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000083">I
was very glad that the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, said earlier that
criticisms that she never listened were quite misplaced. She did
listen, but talked at the same time—she could listen while she
talked. It is true that she regarded attack as the best form of defence
but she 
<?notus-xml column=1193?>was also always willing to learn. Finally, I just offer an anecdote to
the House which I think illustrates these three characteristics. It
relates to a time after she had ceased to be Prime Minister and after I
had ceased to be Cabinet Secretary. She very kindly came to my college
at Oxford to talk. In the course of her remarks to the students, she
said that one of the things that she worried about in modern life, and
the life facing their generation, was the number of children born
illegitimate. When it came round to questions, one of the students said
to her, “Lady Thatcher, don’t you think it is a little
unfair to use the word ‘illegitimate’ of a child
throughout its life when it has had no influence over the circumstances
of its own birth?”. Her eyes flashed and she said, “Well,
what would you call them? I can think of another word but I think it
would be even more unkind”. I thought, “Goodness,
what’s going to happen?”, but the moment passed. She came
to dinner and chapel, and in the lighter part of the evening we were
having a drink in the Master’s Lodgings before she and Denis
went back to London. We were talking about other things completely when
she suddenly said, “You know, Robin, that young man who asked me
this afternoon about the word ‘illegitimate’ had a point
didn’t he?”. That was quite characteristic. I will wager
that she never used the word illegitimate again. She was always
prepared to learn, even from a student. She hit back immediately but
then she thought about it and took the
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000084">Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:10:10"></hs_TimeCode>

Freeman:</Member></B> My Lords, after that very powerful and moving
speech by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, I want to talk very briefly
about the late Baroness Thatcher’s relationship with Parliament
and the Conservative Party in the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:10:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000086">I
have two reflections and two comments to make, the first as the present
chairman of the Carlton Club, preceded by my noble friend Lord Wakeham
a few years ago. Baroness Thatcher was elected an honorary member in
1975, at a time when women were not members to the club. Incidentally,
the Carlton Club, in 1922, broke the coalition, although I am in no way
indicating that history is going to repeat itself. The Carlton Club has
as members 65 Members of your Lordships’ House and the other
place, and has long revered and treasured Baroness Thatcher’s
involvement with the club. I am quite certain that her quiet
determination and conversations with many ultimately led to the club
opening its doors to women members. She did not argue the case, she
just quietly and consistently encouraged
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:12:00"></hs_TimeCode>, and I think
that all members of the club are in her
debt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:12:05"></hs_TimeCode>. In 1990,
some colleagues will remember that our club was bombed by the IRA, and
we lost one Member of Parliament and several other members. She came
almost immediately to the club and spoke to those who were injured and
to the families of those who were killed. That was very much
appreciated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:12:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

wider party in the country, and I speak with modest experience as
someone who had responsibility for the selection of candidates to my
party. Baroness Thatcher made a tremendous effort to tour the country
and encourage candidates. She always took the trouble to write to the
candidate afterwards. I think that many of those who were subsequently
elected to the other place still keep those letters. They were not just
two or three lines; they were complimentary and encouraging words,
which I think made a tremendous
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:13:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

very brief anecdote. In 1986, which seems a long time ago, I was
summoned to Downing Street to become a junior Minister. I said to the
Prime Minister, “Thank you very much. This is a great day. My
wife has just had a baby daughter”. She said,
“What’s the hospital? What’s the telephone
number?”. Fortunately, I could remember it. She dialled the
hospital, and the receptionist answered. The Prime Minister said,
“This is the Prime Minister speaking”. I could hear the
lady at the other end say, “Pull the other leg”. The
Prime Minister said, “I don’t think I will, my dear. Just
put me through”. That really was appreciated by my wife, who
talks about it

Storm, the first war in Iraq. We have heard that it was to some extent

her watch. She said, “It is not sufficiently or fully realised
that I was a scientist before I became a politician. As a scientist
what we need are facts, evidence and proof. If we have the facts, and
we have the evidence and we have the proof, we can check and recheck,
and check as many times as is necessary before coming to a considered
view. The answer to your question is that we had very few facts. We had
no evidence and we certainly had no proof, so I would not have
committed one single member of the armed services to a war from which
they may not have returned. What I would have done was to give George
Bush the sort of assistance that Ronnie Reagan gave me in the
Falklands; that is to

Burns:</Member></B> My Lords, like many other noble Lords, I owe
Baroness Thatcher a huge debt of gratitude. Towards the end of 1979, on
the advice of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, I was appointed as
chief economic adviser to the Treasury, a position that I held
throughout the rest of Mrs Thatcher’s time as Prime Minister.
During that 10-year period, I had the privilege of attending many
meetings with her. I had enormous opportunities to watch the particular
style of debate and the method that she used when challenged, something
that I had never seen
before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:19:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

speechwriting sessions which I occasionally got involved in, most of my
experiences were of accompanying the Chancellors of the day, initially
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, and then of course the noble
Lord, Lord Lawson. By their very nature, we were dealing with the major
issues of economic policy and, even more so by their nature, they were
usually very controversial. We normally had these sessions because
there were some difficult issues to sort out. They were very tense and
very often there were tricky issues to resolve. At times one did not
expect to reach
resolution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:19:46"></hs_TimeCode>. On
more than one occasion when I left she said to me, “I just want
you to look as you go out at what it says on that door”, to
remind me that it said First Lord of the Treasury. She was trying to

course, those people who did not work with Mrs Thatcher
assume that by her very nature she began and ended with an entrenched
position and refused to listen. The main point that I want to make
today, like many noble Lords who have spoken, is that that is not at
all how the process took place. Part of her enormous talent was her
ability to question, challenge and press you on issues as a way of
trying to find whether the views that she held herself could stand that
stress-testing. I always felt that she was trying to test her own ideas
and your ideas to see how they stood up to this process of
questioning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:21:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000097">Like
all very great leaders, she had a strong set of principles and values
and a clear sense of what she wanted to achieve. But thinking back
through some of the episodes and having spoken, sometimes at length, to
people who have been writing biographies of Mrs Thatcher,
the issues that we dealt with were looked at in enormous depth. The
notion that these ideas were pulled off in a casual way and immediately
pursued could not be further from the truth. They 
<?notus-xml column=1196?>were issues that we went through time and time again, very often at
meeting after meeting until all the aspects of the problem had been
identified and she was satisfied that we had covered the issues.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:21:44"></hs_TimeCode> often think
that it was as a result of the extent of that process and the argument
and debate that she gained strength in the end to make decisions and
stick to them in the way that is well
known<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:22:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000098">As
many people have pointed out, she was not always right. She often
changed her position on issues. But whatever view you take of
individual parts of it, I join with many others in thinking that her
contribution in terms of the transformation of the British economy was
enormous. I have little doubt that it came about by this combination of
a very clear strategic mind and the ability to concentrate and look at
issues in depth, stress-test them and go through them at great length
before finally coming to a
conclusion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:22:45"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:22:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000099">In
recent days, I have heard it suggested that somehow the recent
financial crisis has its origins in her approach to economic policy.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Those who worked with Mrs
Thatcher know that she disliked financial excess whether in the private
or the public sector. In the early 1980s, when we were struggling with
rapid growth of the money supply, she frequently asked why there could
not be some limits to the leverage ratios of banks, even in a
deregulated system. She was only very reluctantly put off this
approach, which has now become much more fashionable after the events
of recent years.</hs_para>

Marlesford:</Member></B> My Lords, I suppose that one thing that one
thinks most about Margaret Thatcher is that she was the most courageous
challenger. One reason why I think she will have an increasing part in
the history books is that she presided over and contributed to the
ending of one of the great political struggles in this country: the
struggle between capitalism and socialism as economic
systems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000103">Margaret
Thatcher could always see the real point. For three and a half years, I
was in Whitehall as an adviser and worked a certain amount with a think
tank. I remember well that, on one occasion, the presentation made at
Chequers by the think tank was to show where the Government were going,
even if they did not want to go there. I remember that the 
<?notus-xml column=1197?>noble Lord, Lord Butler, was demonstrating the way in which inflation
would reach unthinkable double digits. There was a silence, broken by
Margaret Thatcher thumping on her blotter at the Cabinet table in
Chequers, saying, “If that chart is true, we
have lost the next election”. Then Tony Barber, who was the
Chancellor at the time, waded in to say that it was not true—but
of course it
was.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000104">I point
out to the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, who said what a pity it was that
Margaret Thatcher had not tried to talk more to the union leaders, that
no one could have tried harder to talk to the union leaders than Ted
Heath. Indeed, we had something called tripartite government, which was
government, industry and unions. A fat lot of good that
did.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000105" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000105">After the
1974 election, I used, as a fonctionnaire, to attend meetings of the
shadow Cabinet. They were very difficult meetings because Mr Heath did
not accept that he had made mistakes and that things had to change. He
and Sir Keith Joseph used to spar. I remember, on one occasion, Ted
Heath saying to Keith Joseph, “I suppose that you’d let
British Leyland go to the wall”. Keith Joseph said, “Of
course I would, if it could not put its house in order”. Ted
replied, “In that case, you would have blood on the
streets”. It was all awkward and difficult. As the shadow
Cabinet left the room, I was following behind, when Margaret Thatcher
came up to me and said, “Mark, you know, Keith has nearly had
enough, and the day he goes, I go”. It was basically from that
moment that she realised the need to make a challenge that had never
previously been
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000106">I was
struck by the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Soley, about the
unions. Of course there was huge variation. Some union leaders were
people of great patriotism who did a wonderful job, but there were
others, often in powerful positions, who used their position not in the
interests of their members but to lead them over the economic cliff,
often into economic suicide and unemployment. In British Leyland, Red
Robbo was leading the union. It was a hopeless system. Now, as a result
of restructuring, we once again have a great automobile industry in
this country. We could never have done that if that challenge had not
been made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000107">I
would describe one of Margaret Thatcher’s great contributions as
being to what I call liberation politics. She liberated a lot of people
who had had no prospects because they were in the proletariat herd. She
hugely enlarged the middle class—the bourgeoisie—of this
country. As a result of the structural changes that she introduced, we
are a much more equal society than we were then. Far more
people—tens or hundreds of thousands of people—now have
the opportunity to run their own lives in a way that they did not have

many of us. I remember sitting in the Lords’ Gallery in another
place in 1979 at the vote of no confidence, watching some left-wing
Labour MPs singing the “Red Flag” and thinking,
“Who is going to be able to change this?”. Mrs Thatcher
stopped the rot of what politicians had been doing for so long and what
they started to go back to once she had been unceremoniously removed
from power. They used to agree to take firm action but, by the time
they had got back to their desks, their resolve had started to wane and
the condition of the country, as so many have said, deteriorated. She
gave not just herself but all of us a belief and a confidence that
things could change. It required a woman to give us men and other women

when I was invited to a reception in Downing Street. I was taken by my
kinsman by marriage, the late Earl of Swinton. I said, “David,
will you introduce me?”. He did. There was a receiving line with
many more important people behind me. Mrs Thatcher stopped, took me out
of the line and spent five minutes showing me the pictures and other
important things in Downing Street. For any chief executive to take

time. I came out of the meeting thoroughly chastened and realised that
unless I learnt more and more I would be one of the next to be sacked
from her Government—and rightly, because she was the chief
executive. How did she know more about the one little section of the
Home Office of which I was in charge, when she had a whole country to

is one aspect that noble Lords have not mentioned. We have talked about
how she changed her mind but not about how loyal she was when she had
changed her mind. I remember this from my time as a junior Minister.
Most of the speeches today have been from former Secretaries of State
in another place. I am one of the diminishing band of people who have
been elected to this House rather than appointed to it by a Prime
Minister and have been part of the Government. When I was at the
Department of the Environment, I had a discussion with her and she
agreed to change a policy. It was a long and tough discussion that
involved various other departments. When she grasped that the policy
needed changing, 
<?notus-xml column=1199?>she was the one who led from the front, leaving one carrying the
standard behind her. I had never experienced a chief executive like
that in all the jobs that I had done in the private sector. I had never
experienced that sort of leadership. It was tremendous support for a
junior Minister—not just for tea ladies and staff, or
Secretaries of State, but for all levels of government. With a
Government of 100 people, and given the number of times they change, it
is a remarkable lady to whom we pay tribute

thought that I was being asked to have dinner here. What I mean is that

glass ceiling analogy but when Margaret Thatcher was elected as Prime
Minister, there was a frisson among every woman in my peer group who,
with qualifications, had been struggling to get up the ladder a bit, to
do a bit more development study and to work that bit harder. We asked
ourselves, “Will we ever get there?”. Suddenly we saw
this lady who was perfect in every way. No human being is perfect but
she seemed to be perfect in every way and she was a role model for many
of us. I am now going back to the 1970s, when quite an interesting
thing happened. Suddenly—I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady
Dean, also experienced this—there was a burgeoning of
women’s networks. I am referring not necessarily to networks in
which it was said, “You know somebody in that company. Do you
think I can get a job?”, but to networks in which women tried to
see how they could, in turn, take their rightful place in this
country.</hs_para>

four years. In fact, I took over from another Member of this
House—my noble friend Lady Platt. She is the wonderful woman
who, ever since the 1940s, always had a screwdriver in her 
<?notus-xml column=1200?>bag. She was an aeronautical engineer and a role model for me—not
that I could do engineering, physics or chemistry. She set up the Women
in Banking and Finance network, whose members are remarkable people. A
lot of them have senior positions in accountancy and consultancy firms,
and they have done very well. How do they do it? They do it by meeting
frequently, networking, going on development courses and playing golf
together. It is not equivalent to a men’s club—it is
nothing like that—nor is it a sorority, as they have in the
States. There are groups in all sorts of industries. The retail sector
has them, and there are professional groups such as lawyers. Just
because the word “Women” is in the title, men say,
“Oh, you’re off doing this”, but men have been
doing it for years. We have a lot of catching up to

avidly for the past four or five hours—I am not sure how long we

that history is becoming more and more fashionable. In fact, my right
honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education is trying to
highlight history as part of the curriculum, and that is very
important. This is a zany idea but in about four or five weeks’
time, or perhaps in the new term in September, why can we not have a
copy of today’s <I>Hansard</I> placed in every school so that
they can learn from it? I have taken that idea from one put forward by
Michael Gove—that of putting the King James Bible in every
school. As I am a Bible follower, I do not want to suggest that there
is an equivalence between the Bible and today’s <I>Hansard</I>

that it is an idea to bear in mind. We have history here today which is
alive. It is compelling and I think that people out there of any age

Wilson of Dinton:</Member></B> My Lords, I add my own tributes to the
wealth of tributes which we have heard today—not, of course, at
a political level, but as an official who served the Prime Minister,
Mrs Thatcher, for three years, from 1987 to 1990, as head of her
domestic and economic secretariat under the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong,
and then under the noble Lord, Lord Butler. It was period of
extraordinary and rapid change in so many areas: local government, with
the community charge—I still cannot call it the poll 
<?notus-xml column=1201?>tax; we were trained not to—the National Health Service;
privatisation; education, with the introduction of the curriculum; the
inner cities; and so on. The list felt
endless<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:41:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

very heavily on briefing. She would use it once she came to the
conclusion that she could rely upon you, and she did so very
intensively so you had to get it right. There were occasions when she
would disagree with one of her colleagues in a meeting. She would
challenge them as to whether they were right or not on the strength of
a brief. I can tell you, you learn things about the human
body—your pores open in moments of stress—which I will
not
forget<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:42:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

coin was that she worked enormously hard; this, I am sure, is well
known. We delivered lots of briefs to her in the evenings, and by the
morning she would have mastered and be ready to use them to challenge
with enormous skill. I remember saying to her on one occasion,
“You must have worked very late to get all this into your
mind”. She said, “Well, I find midnight is the worst. By
12.30 I get a second wind”. That, for me, captures
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:43:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

generous in the way in which she treated people who worked for her. She
attributed to you qualities which you certainly did not have. I
remember sitting down next to her at one meeting. She was deep in
thought, and turned to me and said, “Now, can you explain to me
what a put option is?”. That is quite a difficult question cold,
when a lot of other Ministers are coming
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:43:30"></hs_TimeCode>. On another
occasion, when Ministers were discussing the national curriculum, she
was passionate about the importance of schoolchildren learning poetry
by heart. She launched unexpectedly into some Robert Browning, which
she quoted at some length. Then she could not remember what came next,
and turned to me as the secretary and said, “Now what
happens?”. Of course, I had not the faintest notion what happens
next. It was very generous of her to think that one might know, but of
course I did
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:44:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

sometimes in a rather clumsy way. I was summoned on a Saturday to
Chequers to explain to her a very complicated submission which I had
put to her on the Friday night about how we might make the poll tax
work or avoid some of the more difficult consequences which it seemed
likely to have. It was really, really technically difficult. I was
shown in to see her and she gave me a cup of tea. I had that in one
hand and in the other she put an enormous cream bun, so covered in
icing sugar that when we spoke there were clouds of it. We then had
this very difficult and serious discussion while I held these two
objects in my hands. It was a good meeting but it was slightly
unusual.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13041022000128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000128">We
have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Spicer, about her caution. There
were all sorts of sides to that quality. I used to be astonished by the
certainty with which she felt that she knew and understood what the
British people were feeling and thinking, and where they stood,
whatever everyone else among her colleagues were saying or
thinking.</hs_para>

to mind was that a decision had been taken that the National Dock
Labour scheme should be abolished. That was being planned in great
secrecy and we had reached the point where Ministers were in a position
to give the go-ahead. There was fear of a strike, and so on. When we
met the Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher said, “I can see that all
the plans are ready but I should say that we are not going to go ahead
with this decision today. We are not going to make the announcement. It
is January and it is cold and foggy. The public are depressed and have
had enough bad news. This is not the right time. We will wait until the
spring, when the sun and the daffodils are out, and it will be all
right”. I found myself thinking, “How do we record
this?”, but we recorded it and lo and behold, the Government
waited until the spring and the decision went exactly as she said. It
was fine, but there was a sense in which she was certain about the
timing. It was all going on in her head and it was very
impressive.</hs_para>

Thatcher, which I hope does not get overlooked, was her interest in
science. I remember No. 10 organising groups of PhD or post-doctoral
researchers to come and meet her. She would grill them for an afternoon
and they would emerge looking exhausted, while she would look hugely
refreshed by the experience of having cross-examined them on their
science.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13041022000131" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000131">I
think it was in the autumn of 1988 that, having read over the summer
about climate change, she decided that it was a really big problem
which people had underestimated. I am not sure that the world remembers
it but she made a speech to the Royal Society—way ahead of
international opinion, or opinion in this country—in which she
very clearly set the problem out in scientific terms. She drew
attention to the threats that it had for future generations and the
moral imperative that she thought that Governments had to act on it.
That was a very important landmark in people realising that it was a
problem. It illustrates the limitations of the power of even a great
Prime Minister such as  Mrs Thatcher that very little happened
immediately because of it, but it is interesting that her scientific
background led her into that insight.</hs_para>

Lord, Lord Butler, will not mind my remembering that when she had
finally surrendered her office to Her Majesty the Queen, he gave a
small impromptu party to enable some of us who had worked for her to
say farewell. I remember two things about that occasion. One was that
she was going round saying very intense things. I am not even sure that
she entirely knew what she was saying to everyone. I remember her
coming up and saying to me, “What I always feel about problems
in government is that the important thing is to work out what is the
right thing to do. You may not be able to achieve it, or not
immediately, but that has to be your starting point. That has to be
your goal”. For me, that is what marks her out as an outstanding
and extraordinary leader, perhaps above all.</hs_para>

remember is the noble Lord, Lord Butler, himself saying in his speech
to her, “Prime Minister, when we are old and retired the only
really interesting thing about us will be that we worked for 
<?notus-xml column=1203?>you”. That was a lovely compliment and today we are all proving
that compliment to be right. I certainly feel hugely privileged for
having worked for her. Those are three years that I would not have

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, I pay tribute to Margaret Thatcher, who
I believe was easily the greatest Briton of my adult lifetime. I will
refer to six particular points, some of which have been touched upon by
others. First, something which has struck me strongly has been the
enormous loyalty, devotion and affection felt towards Lady Thatcher by
all those who have worked for her, including the police who were
responsible for her safety, and which she very much reciprocated. She
was in many ways such a warm person, quite the opposite of her public

is related to that, as many noble Lords pointed out earlier, is that
she was a person of great kindness, compassion and modesty. Ahead of
every general election she would pack her bags at No. 10 because she by
no means took it for granted that she would win an election, even if
she was ahead in the
polls<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:50:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041022000136" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410-0002.htm#13041022000136">For
millions of British people from all walks of life, men and women, she
was their heroine. So many people who met her have said to me,
“That was the highlight of my life”. They realised
greatness when they were in its

and again, this is a point that was made by others but which comes out
so strongly, she was someone of great integrity, honesty and principle,
and she had a strong sense of duty both in national politics and in her
own private life. She was also the key champion of personal aspiration
and of equality of opportunity, and this was not only about enabling
people to own their own houses, but about enabling them to start their
own businesses and buy shares. She was the person who very much got rid
of damaging old-fashioned class loyalties and turned a
majority  of this country into the broad, non-offensive label
of middle class. What she achieved has led to

was also the architect not just of our turning round the British

people forget that before her time even the terms venture capital and
entrepreneur hardly existed in the English language, and certainly
there was very little of it in practice. So much of what has been a
success story in this country since then has been the growth of small
businesses and new businesses, employing more than 13 million people. I
cite, although it is 
<?notus-xml column=1204?>perhaps a little specialist, the Cambridge cluster that has come up: 629
businesses with a turnover of more than £11 billion, employing
53,000 people, and in the key new areas of IT and technology, life
science and physical sciences. Lady Thatcher would have been proud of
that, and she would have seen that it promised a promising economic
future for this country. Certainly, in the first 20 years of my own

family of Lady Thatcher. I hope the message that will come from this
debate to them will be simply of the sheer greatness of their mother
and grandmother. Shortly after Margaret Thatcher retired as Prime
Minister, there was a meeting of the ACP to decide how her retirement
would be marked. There was considerable navel gazing but in the end
Lord Boyd-Carpenter was deputed to organise a dinner for her and Denis

it was a very jolly event. At the end of the dinner, Humphrey Atkins,
the then chairman of the ACP, said, “Margaret, this evening is

of civil penalties for the late filing of company accounts was
carefully considered by Parliament during the passage of the Companies
Act 2006. The changes to the penalty regime were the first to be
introduced since the introduction of civil penalties in 1992, and the
scale of penalties then in force was becoming less effective in
encouraging the timely filing of accounts. The provision of up to date
company information is one of the building blocks of the UK economy and
the register of company information maintained by Companies House is
accessed millions of times every year, striking evidence of the value
placed on company information by the business community. Since the
changes introduced by the Companies Act 2006, compliance
rates have increased and the number of companies receiving penalties is
declining. The percentage of companies now filed up to date stands at
almost 99% with 94% filing on time. Therefore, I consider that the
levels of civil penalties laid down under the Companies Act 2006 are
appropriate.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13041011001777" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410w0001.htm#13041011001777">Companies

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member> A review of the evidence on alcohol misuse
and harm in England was produced in support of the Government’s
alcohol strategy and as part of the Department of Health’s
evidence to the Health Committee’s inquiry into the alcohol
strategy. The review found that alcohol-related crime is estimated to
cost around £11 billion per year and suggests a strong link
between alcohol use and crime, particularly violent crime. The latest
data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales show that in 2011-12
in almost half (47%) of violent incidents the victim believed the
perpetrator to be under the influence of alcohol and a fifth (20%) of
all violent crime occurred in or around pubs or
clubs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041011000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410w0001.htm#13041011000111">Department

small and medium-sized businesses and as such any improvement would
have an impact on GDP, although data are not available to quantify
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13041011000152" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410w0001.htm#13041011000152">Recent
research by Experian indicates that the average amount of time
businesses are taking to settle invoices is falling, from 25.7 days
after agreed terms in 2011 to 24.7 days in 2012. This is positive for
the economy, but there is still scope for considerable improvement,
which the Government have sought to push for by encouraging companies
to sign up to the Prompt Payment
Code.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13041011001797" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130410w0001.htm#13041011001797">Finance:

It is a key principle that NHS services should be free at the point of
use, based on clinical need and not an individual’s ability to
pay. This has underpinned the National Health Service since its
establishment in 1946. It is enshrined in the NHS constitution and
reaffirmed in the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Charges for NHS
services can be made only where expressly provided for in
legislation—for example, prescription
