My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T14:42:08"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, the
Government do not have any plans to hold such a discussion with the
Iraq inquiry. Sir John Chilcot advised the Prime Minister last July
that the inquiry would be in a position to begin the process of giving
those subject to criticism in the report the opportunity to make
representations by the middle of 2013, and that the inquiry would
submit its report once that process had been
completed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T14:42:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304224000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Dykes" PimsId="3061" UID="1304224000283" xid="1706" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000283">Lord
Dykes:</Member></B> With thanks for that Answer, can the Leader of the
House reassure the House on a very important point—that high
official circles in the UK and the US have not sought to interfere with
the independent findings of the Chilcot inquiry, especially on the
crucial decision to go to war

Hill of Oareford:</Member></B> I can give that assurance. It is
extremely important that this inquiry is independent; it was set up
very deliberately to be independent and it must have that independence.
It must consider the evidence that it has and reach its conclusions,
which we will all be able to see in the fullness of time, but it must
have a free hand to do
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T14:42:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304224000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Morris of Aberavon" PimsId="1989" UID="1304224000285" xid="1770" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000285">Lord
Morris of Aberavon:</Member></B> My Lords, having been involved in the
setting up of some public inquiries, I have noticed a tendency for them
to be longer and longer. I understand the need to collect all the
material evidence, and for all due processes to take place. In future,
if any public inquiry is set up, should not a time limit be imposed
and, furthermore, an extension
granted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T14:43:24"></hs_TimeCode> only in

Hill of Oareford:</Member></B> I understand that point. However, with
some of these very big inquiries it is difficult to be absolutely clear
at the outset about what a suitable length of time is. It is right that
the Chilcot inquiry on Iraq has been able to follow the leads that it
feels it needs to follow, and had the time to do that. On the more
general point about inquiries, I am sure the noble and learned Lord
will know that one of the post-legislative committees that this House
will set up in the new Session will look at the operation of the
Inquiries Act 2005 and ask exactly these kinds of questions about
whether we can learn lessons about the conduct of these inquiries,
whether they can be done more quickly, their cost and so
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304224000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Williams of Crosby" PimsId="4612" UID="1304224000287" xid="1846" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000287">Baroness
Williams of Crosby:</Member></B> My Lords, I was one of those in this
House who was perhaps most extensively and intensively involved in the
whole of the Iraq issue—the invasion of Iraq and the situations
that arose from the post-victory occasions, including the involvement
of many contractors in the building up or otherwise of Iraq after the
war. While I fully take the points made by the Leader of the House into
careful account, it is also the case that the lessons to be learnt from
an inquiry—and the lessons to be learnt from this are probably
among the most important of all—depend a little on the passage
of time between the findings of that inquiry and the use of those
lessons to affect policy. I ask him to bear in mind, as he considers
this, the gap between the necessary and right attempt to give people
the right to respond, but also the importance of the conclusions for
the future work of this Government’s policy as well as the
policy of the Opposition.</hs_para>

the conclusions from the Chilcot inquiry, wherever that takes

wide as to be almost infinite, and that the timing of the

representations but on the Government’s own clearance of what is
to be included in the report? Will he undertake that that process will

reply. Is he aware that in 1983 I supported a Bill outlawing female
genital mutilation in this country, which was strengthened by further
legislation in 2003, but that according to research currently as many
as 65,000 women living in this country have suffered FGM? It is feared
that some may have undergone the procedure here and others sent abroad
for the practice, but there has not been a single prosecution.

2007 to 2009 and led to modest growth in exports. The impact may have
been negated somewhat due to global demand weakness, especially in the
European Union, which is our largest export market. Evidence suggests
that export growth is driven more by changes in foreign
demand than by price competitiveness or other
factors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T15:07:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T15:07:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Popat:</Member></B> My Lords, the value of the pound is determined by
the international market. The fall in exports is mainly due to the
current economic crisis, not just in the UK but in Europe as a whole.
Half our exports are to the European Union and there are real issues in
the European Union. The currency changes that take place quite often
have a limited impact due to the very high import content in our
exports. Hence any depreciation or the value of the pound going down
will not have real impact on our exports.</hs_para>

Cormack:</Member></B> My Lords, this is the third time that I have
raised this subject on the Floor of the House and I hope that my noble
and learned friend will feel that this amendment is more modest and
more acceptable than the two previous ones. The background is that the
monarch in our country is also the Supreme Governor of the Church of
England. Whether we use a modern or—as I personally
prefer—a traditional liturgy on Sundays, and whenever we pray
for the monarch, we pray for the Queen as the Supreme Governor. Because
of the importance of this, and of establishment in our country, many of
us feel that this Bill, to which we  do not take exception in
its main provisions, ought to have in it a recognition of this basic
fact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T15:13:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304224000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000063">This
modest amendment seeks to make explicit what is already implicit. When
he replied to my amendment on Report, my noble and learned friend Lord
Wallace of Tankerness—with whom I have had a number of
discussions on this matter, for which I am extremely
grateful—made quite plain that the monarch could not be a Roman
Catholic, even though this Bill allows for successors to the Crown to
marry Roman Catholics. This amendment does not in any sense cut across
that and does not make any reference at all to the gender issue, which
has been accepted throughout the House and in another place. What it
very modestly seeks to do is to insert the following few words before
Clause
2:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1304224000239" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000239">“Notwithstanding

there is absolutely no alteration to what is in the Bill. The amendment

this point with some force throughout our debates. However, I wonder,
as the noble Lord, Lord Deben, said, whether we are not pushing too
hard on this point. Obviously the case has been made in an attempt to
ensure that the Anglican supremacy is preserved. However, all that it
serves to do is push our attention further toward the fact that the
removal of the ban on Catholic marriages—obviously a welcome

particular prohibition on Roman Catholics, one risks causing offence. I
am sure that that was not intended, but one does risk causing offence
to many of Her Majesty’s loyal subjects when there is no good
reason in law to do so. I do not believe that we should put into a Bill
words that could cause unnecessary offence and reopen wounds. It has
also been said that the amendment is unnecessary in law and could
therefore lead to other jurisdictions that have responsibilities in

the wording had been discussed with the Cabinet Office. I have the
specific consent of Monsignor Stock to say that he was speaking on
behalf of Archbishop Nichols as president of the Catholic
Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales, and can inform the
House that the view taken by the Catholic Church in England and Wales
is that in the instance of mixed marriages the approach of the Catholic
Church is pastoral. It will always look to provide guidance that
supports and strengthens the unity and indissolubility of the marriage.
In this context the Catholic Church expects Catholic spouses to
sincerely undertake to do all that they can to raise children in the
Catholic Church. Where it has not been possible for the child of a
mixed marriage to be brought up as a Catholic, the Catholic parent does
not fall subject to the censure of canon

Lord Deben knows that when he left the Anglican Church to become a
Roman Catholic, I honoured him for that decision. A similar decision

beautifully constructed watch, in that if you take one little piece out
the whole thing will fall apart, that I have expressed my concern in
three brief debates. The last thing I wish to do is to cause offence to
anyone, particularly Roman Catholics, as I hold the Roman Catholic
Church in high regard and always have. I very cheerfully pray, as we do
frequently in Anglican churches, for the Pope. I would have liked to

James of Blackheath:</Member></B> My Lords, this is in the nature of
being a semi-probing amendment. I want to test the extent to which we
have arrived collectively at answers to each of the four questions that
I have developed through the currency of this Bill, and see whether my
noble and learned friend the Minister can satisfy us, in his
conclusions, that each of the tripwires and pitfalls that we have seen
are now capable of being avoided. I come to this very much in the
spirit of the finest executive I ever had the privilege of working
with, who used to say, “Don’t give me people around me
who know all the answers. I want the people who know all the
questions”. It is in that spirit that I come, even though I
stand here as somebody without any shred of qualification. I do not
even have an 11-plus pass. Given that circumstance, it might be said
that I have a right nerve to stand up here and ask these questions
today in such an intensely legal affair but then, on the other hand,
somebody has to.</hs_para>

expressing my appreciation to my noble and learned friend the Minister
for the considerable time, and the enormous patience and care, that he
has given to answering each of the questions that I have raised
directly with him. He has been absolutely splendid. My noble and
learned friend will not be surprised to hear that while I have
read  
<?notus-xml column=1224?>every word he has written with great care, that is not the same as
agreeing with every word I have read. It is clear that the principal
point of difference between us is that he believes that I am relying on
the entrenched status, as such, whereas it is the status and ordinary
meaning of the statute law as it now stands, and as it relates to our
duty and the Crown’s duty, that concerns me. I repeat: our duty
and the Crown’s duty, which I do not believe are the same
thing.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1304224000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000100">I was
grateful to the Bill Office for agreeing to write to the Clerk of the
House of Commons<I> </I>to ask what basis of interpretation it had
placed on the use of a delegation of the royal prerogative in
addressing its own debate on this subject. If I understand the very
complicated answer correctly, it is along the following lines. The
Crown cannot delegate something that it does not posses; it can
delegate only the authority that it has, in which case it can delegate
the power to us to give an opinion as to whether we want a Bill to pass
and say “Content”, but it cannot delegate to us the
authority to give it assent. That is retained by the Crown in all
cases.</hs_para>

to adhere to that in strict accordance with the coronation and
proclamation oaths which precede it. Those oaths, passed through the
Declaration of Rights in 1689, relate to all the powers that the Crown
rightly held before the revolution. It ensured that the Crown could no
longer deny that it was bound by the statute law with explicit changes
to the coronation oath, made by enacting the Coronation Oath Act 1688.
The settlement has been said by her Majesty, on the occasion of the
300th anniversary of that great document, to be the sure foundation of
our constitution. I am sure that Her Majesty would take that same view
without any amendment today. It will be interesting to see, when and if
the Bill passes to her for Royal Assent, how she will interpret that
obligation in the context of those oaths.</hs_para>

would arise if the passage of the Bill was deemed to represent a
precedent by which to justify far more draconian changes than could be
permitted to the established laws of this land under the Bill of Rights
and to the detriment of the rights and liberties of the subject. By
relying on such a precedent, in theory it is possible to introduce
arbitrary power with a Bill of no greater apparent significance than
this, to reintroduce the use of judicial torture or repeal the
principle of “no taxation without representation”. These
are, clearly, highly undesirable outcomes.</hs_para>

with the addition of the amendment that I have proposed, from the next

opportunity that we ought to take. It is like a deep third man, in
cricketing terms, by sweeping up all the bits that might otherwise
trickle through. I commend my measure as an opportunity that we ought
to take to hope, and later ensure, that no precedent might arise from
this to the detriment of the rights and liberties of the subject. If we

two instances in which Governments have been forced to resign in this
case involved, first and most notably, a not insignificant prime
minister called William Pitt the Younger in 1801. He had been in
receipt of that enormous reorganisation document on the future order of
battle and conduct of the British Army compiled by Sir John Moore,
whose “corse to the ramparts” we bore in the poem. Sir
John had written this far-reaching plan for the future of the British
Army but had said, “This is ridiculous; we are wasting half the
potential officer talent because we do not allow Catholics to be
officers. Let them in”. Pitt said, “Great idea,
let’s do it”. He went off to see the Crown, the Crown
said, “Resign immediately”, and he did, despite the fact
that there were 650,000 French troops on the shores at Calais waiting
to invade under Napoleon.</hs_para>

1807, almost the same thing happened again. This time it was a certain
Sir Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, who with his usual
forthright style had gone off to take the expeditionary force into
Portugal. He had written to the Ministry of Defence and the War Office
and said, “I am trying to fight a war against a Catholic army in
a Catholic country and I have nothing but English schoolboys who are
all well educated and stupid and all Protestants. I need some Catholic
officers, please”. Lord Grenville, Prime Minister of the
ministry of all the talents at the time, agreed, went back to the King
and three days later he was out of power along with 
<?notus-xml column=1226?>the whole Government. Are this Government going to last the week? Do we
want them to? Yes, we do; we want the orderly continuity. Has anybody

this Bill in its present form will represent a denial by this House of
the words and intentions of the Bill of Rights and the Act of
Settlement. This legal point is not reliant, in the words of my noble
friend; the argument must therefore be that some statutes are of such
constitutional significance that they cannot be amended or appealed.
The solution I have proposed in this amendment was the Duke of
Wellington’s eventual solution, by which he got Catholic
officers, of which there are now a very large number, into the British
Army. This was achieved as a means of providing a sort of stopgap
whereby you could suspend the oath for a period and then re-establish
it, and hope that nobody did anything to alter the law against the
interests of the subject in the mean
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304224000230" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000230">I am

also added the excellent extra clause, which addresses a separate

aside and ridden over roughshod, we appear to be placing ourselves
above and outside the scope of the present law. This is far and away
beyond the intended scope of this simple and otherwise desirable Bill.
If, however, your Lordships now resolve to be content with the Bill, I
first ask noble Lords either to consider passing the amendment, which
would be a solution to all four points, or to take their chances in

Eden of Winton:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a bit of a minefield, so
I tread with care and trepidation. I will make a very brief
intervention, primarily to say to my noble friend how much I recognise
the concerns he has expressed and the care with which he has followed
these matters through. I know that he is extremely anxious, not only on
his own behalf but on our collective behalf, that the legislation now
going through the House is correct in so far as it seeks to affect the
role and rights of the sovereign and sovereign succession and that it
in no way undermines the position of any Member of your

answer to the questions that my noble friend raises rests in the
sovereignty of Parliament. It is, as I perceive it, the right of
Parliament to make alterations to legislation, even including the Bill
of Rights. As I interpret it, the primary purpose of the Bill of Rights
was to protect the interests and the rights of the people. The rights
of the people are currently preserved in the powers and obligations of
the Houses of Parliament and of the Government of the day. It is for us
to make such amendments as we feel are necessary or desirable. In this
particular case, a narrow amendment is being suggested which in a way
underlines what was required of the sovereign at the time of the Bill
of Rights; namely, that the heir to the Throne shall be a Protestant.
There is nothing more to it than that. It therefore seems to me that we
are exercising a traditional and constitutional right of Parliament to
make amendments and alternations as we think proper. We are not in any
way going against the obligations or commitments of the Crown. In
carrying these matters forward, we shall be preserving the
constitutional requirement in this country that the future monarch
shall be a Protestant and a practising communicant member of the Church
of England.</hs_para>

reassure him immediately that my concern here is not about the religion
of the monarch. I gave up religion at the age of 19 when I was studying
for ordination to the Church of England. I discovered that while the
Catholics burnt people because they thought it released the soul to go
to heaven quicker in order to plead for mercy, the Protestant church
was allowing hanging, drawing and quartering on the forecourt of St
Paul’s Cathedral—where we all walked last week—to
be able to discharge the secular crime of treason under the guise of
being a religious crime against the church. At that point my faith
crumbled very rapidly and was never restored.</hs_para>

primarily those factors. It is that we are putting Her Majesty in a

would not do under any circumstances. I have provided a suggestion as
to how we may circumvent that by borrowing an initiative of the Duke of
Wellington from 120 years ago, but none the less we need to be sure
that it would work and that is my concern. If the noble Lord will
answer that, I will be happy to withdraw my

have been completed and we are in a position to commence the

be of interest to your Lordships, I can inform the House that since our
debate on Report, Royal Assent was given to the Canadian Succession to
the Throne Act on 27 March. We received confirmation from the
Government of Antigua and Barbuda that, based on the nature of their
constitution, they will not need to legislate to give the changes
effect, and that the Council of Australian Governments agreed on 19
April, last Friday, to a process to change their laws.</hs_para>

I have indicated on a number of occasions, the provisions in this Bill
have been carefully worked out in agreement with the realms, and it is
important that 
<?notus-xml column=1229?>we now proceed to pass this Bill and show that we have been able to
fulfil the task asked of us by the realm Prime
Ministers in Perth in 2001. It is an important piece of legislation
that has its roots in securing better equality, and certainly we await
with great expectation the birth of a child to their Royal Highnesses
the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. We wish them every health, in
particular the Duchess as she proceeds towards the birth of her child.
In doing so, we know that if this Bill passes, and if the required

whether it is a boy or a girl, will take its place in line to the
throne ahead of any subsequent siblings. Therefore, I beg to move that

Trefgarne:</Member></B> My Lords, I do not intend to delay the passage
of this Bill for more than a few moments. It is sad that this Bill has
been driven through with such speed. Many of us would have preferred a
Joint Select Committee, for example, to consider some of the important
constitutional implications that it raises, and indeed changes.
However, that has not been the case, and therefore that, for now at
least, must be that. This Bill has also set running the hare of what
happens to the hereditary peerage with regard to the succession
arrangements for hereditary peers. I must tell your Lordships that
those arrangements are, as I understand it, a great deal more
complicated even than they are for the Crown. I dare say that if Bills
come forward for that purpose they will delay the noble and learned
Lord very much longer than this Bill
has.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="1304224000396" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000396">Bill

thinking behind our proposal on extending the existing permitted
development rights for homeowners wishing to extend their property. As
I said at an earlier stage of the Bill’s consideration, these
changes will make it easier for thousands of families to undertake
improvements to their homes. In bringing forward these changes, we have
looked across England and recognised that many people want to enlarge
their homes. They want to do so not by much but sufficiently to create
more living space, perhaps to care for elderly relatives or because of
a growing family, and without the cost of having to relocate.</hs_para>

Adjoining neighbours—not just the ones on either side but those

consulted where a homeowner wishes to use the new extended permitted
development rights to build a good-sized extension. If neighbours think

appeal against a refusal or may wish to submit a full planning
application. The home owner will be able to appeal against a refusal of
consent but, as with normal planning consents, neighbours will not be
able to appeal against a grant of permission. This approval process

tabled this Motion, which insists on the position originally taken by
your Lordships, as the clock was 
<?notus-xml column=1233?>ticking on Friday without our then having sight of the government
amendment. The Secretary of State, in announcing an
uncharacteristic conversion to the spirit of consensus, gave neither us
nor the Commons a clue as to what this revised approach to permitted
development rights for home extensions might be. We have to continue to
deliberate on these matters without the benefit of the results of the
consultation on extended permitted development rights that concluded
some four months ago. It is difficult to believe that they would not
have some relevance to the matter in hand, yet still the information is
withheld from us. However, I hope that the Minister might at least
confirm one point for us this afternoon. The consultation included the
proposal that changes to permitted development rights, including those
relating to the curtilage of a dwelling house, should be in place only
for three years and that developments would have to be completed within
that three-year period. Does the consultation support that

correspondence from Ministers, and have to assess how far it addresses

the House of Commons. I do not propose to restate in depth the points
made by the noble Lord, Lord True, and others with which we agreed,
other than to say that the amendment reflects a demonstrably localist
approach, scepticism that the extension of these particular permitted
development rights would make a meaningful contribution to
kick-starting growth, concerns that an unamended Article 4 direction
process was not inevitably a secure or speedy route for local councils
to override inappropriate centrally set permitted development rights,

Gardner of Parkes:</Member></B> My Lords, I noticed that many of the
views expressed by the spokesman for the Opposition agreed with points
that I think are important and on which I therefore wish briefly to
comment. The most important thing of all—from my own experience
I found this very unsatisfactory—is that you cannot rely on
getting notification. In cases in the past 12 months where I have been
the immediate neighbour, I have twice not received notification.
Secondly, clever people always put in their applications on Christmas
Eve or at some time when they know that no one is around. It is
important in those circumstances that extra time is allowed for the
consultation based on the number of working days, not just days. The
unprincipled policy is used regularly by clever people, even under
normal planning regulations. Those two matters are

other issues, I have been satisfied by discussions with the Minister
that the Government really are thinking about these matters. The sunset
clause is good but, for notification, the system that has been in use
for years should be continued whereby a notice is posted on a lamp
post, a hedge or something like that, so that some friend or neighbour
passing by would say, “Did you see that they are building
something next door to you?”. Even if you are away on holiday,
you can ask your friend to let you know. However, if you come back from
a three-week holiday, which is not unusually long—particularly
if you go to Australia; it is hardly worth going if it is any less than
that—it is important to be sure that nothing underhand is going

local authority knows that better than I do.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:32:55"></hs_TimeCode> second thing
that the local authority could do would be to say, “We think
that this is a serious planning matter”—in other words,
it was not a matter of neighbours, but something very fundamental, and
it would therefore call it in, in effect, for a planning
decision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304224000178" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000178">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:34:53"></hs_TimeCode>,
it would most likely say that this was a matter of neighbours and that
they were going to appoint an arbitrator. Local authorities would have
a panel of arbitrators, who would be very ordinary people, whose only
job would be to go and see what the fair deal or reasonable thing would
be in the case. Having decided that perhaps a slightly smaller
extension would be fairer as far as the neighbour was concerned, they
would say, “We will agree to this, if this change is
made”. Alternatively, they would say, “We agree to it
entirely”. They would start from the assumption that 
<?notus-xml column=1238?>they would want to agree to the development; in other words, there would
be an assumption in favour of development, because that seems to be
reasonable given the nature of
property<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:34:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304224000179" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000179">The
Government have taken this up. It is a huge improvement on the previous
suggestion and a generous way of moving forward. I think my noble
friend Lord True will probably feel that it is not quite what he wanted
but we have gone a long way. However, there are three bits to it which
I hope that my noble friend will think again about. In no spirit am I
complaining about what she is doing—I am very pleased about
this—but there are three things. First, I think that
28 days was probably a better period, simply for the reason
that it is helpful for people over holidays and the like. Secondly, I
wonder whether she could look again at enabling the local authority,
even if it were not in the statute, to decide that this kind of thing
was done by an arbitrator, not through the planning committee. I wanted
to remove from the planning department questions such as, “Can I
have a car port? Can I build a room in the already present roof of my
garage? Can I put up a bit of an extension which seems quite sensible
as my neighbour has exactly the same?”. All those things are
really neighbours’ issues, and, frankly, when you consider the
time spent and the shortage of planning officers, it is much more
sensibly done by having a sensible man or woman looking and saying,
“That seems perfectly
reasonable”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304224000180" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000180">Thirdly,
I hope that my noble friend will look at the one series of protections
that we specifically put in, which is that this would not apply in an
area which had been designated as a conservation area. In that area
there should be a wider consultation than merely with one’s
neighbours. I say to the Minister that I entirely support that it
should be one’s contiguous neighbours because frankly, if we are
going to go out to everybody who could possibly see the house, we are
in real trouble. The idea that I could say that I ought to be able to

Earl of Lytton:</Member></B> My Lords, I will not detain the House for
long. My interest as a practising chartered surveyor in matters to do
with planning is well known. The concern about this area of the Bill is
not to prevent development from taking place but to ensure that the
community should have some input. There is a serious and objectively
important issue here. It is that the density of development is a
construct, particularly in urban and suburban areas, that needs
constant review and monitoring. Filling up open space with
development—perhaps “filling up” is a rather
pejorative term, but noble Lords will get my drift—touches on
and concerns that issue, and produces long-term, quantifiable effects
on value, amenity and the general sense of space. That affects not only
the public perception but individual neighbours. It is very easy for
someone with a very short-term agenda who simply
wishes to have further space for whatever reason
to try to construct something that is less than worthy in the context
of the locality. I pay tribute, as I have before, to the way in which
local planning authorities have protected this construct, this facet,
of our built environment. It is important that there should be
oversight. Policies to protect amenity space, light and air should none
the less still have house-room
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304224000203" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000203">There are
a couple of issues that I hope the Minister will be able to clarify.
Another qualitative consideration that risks being lost is to do with
materials—things like colour, finish and texture. They risk
being lost under the process of prior notification where the principle
of development is enshrined in a permitted development context. I
appreciate that design guidance 
<?notus-xml column=1243?>in supplementary planning documents may overcome this if it is

area, that has already been pointed out by the noble Lords, Lord
McKenzie and Lord Shipley, is the question of definitions—back
garden as opposed to side garden, curtilage as opposed to plot area,
setting as opposed to something else—and the basis of
identifying the proportion of the plot actually built upon if you want
to get some sort of absolute measure. I remember a situation where I
made an application for a tenant’s garage. It was turned down
because, although it was in a rural road, the planning officer decided
that it was offensive to the “streetscene”. Anyone
walking up the “streetscene”, where they saw one house
every half-mile, will realise what I mean when I say that I did not
think that “streetscene” was a concept that applied to
something that was stuck behind a hedge up above a high bank. This
occurred because, needless to say, the building was not built with a
frontage onto a highway, as you might normally expect, but was built
end-on to the highway, so front and back gardens had a boundary with
the highway. It is this sort of muddle that needs to be sorted out,
because for every plot that is governed by the standard criteria of an
urban street, there are other ones that are not so governed because

reiterate that the revised approach that we are taking responds in a
targeted and direct way to the concerns that have been raised. As noble
Lords have said, there are already existing permitted development
rights that have operated effectively for a number of years. The change
is that those permitted development rights are extended with regard to
the size of buildings. This is not new, although I well understand the
concerns that noble Lords have raised. Our revised approach will now
ensure that under the new rights, in the case of larger extensions, any
objection from immediate neighbours will be fully taken into account

been a raft of questions and I will do my best to answer as many of
them as I can. If I am deficient, noble Lords whose questions I have
missed will let me know. First, I was asked how the decision is to be
made by the local authority. Unlike permitted development at the
moment, where they can just carry on, the process will be that somebody
who wishes to build an extension will have to notify the local
authority. Not only that, they will have to produce some plans and
details of what that extension is going to do. That picks up the point
about materials and design as well. Local authorities will know what
they have, even if it is in outline. Where neighbours object, the
decision will be made by councillors or by delegated responsibility.
Local authorities will decide themselves whether this is appropriate
for delegated power or whether they would want to hang onto
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1304224000213" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000213">I was
asked about ward councillors. I want to dispel any suggestion that
local ward councillors will be taking a decision where an objection has
been made—that would be way outside the normal procedures that
any of us are accustomed to—but councillors will be notified
when the council is notified of a development, so that they are aware
that they may need to knock on someone’s door and say.
“Are you going to object to this? Do you realise that there is
such a proposal?”. The noble Lord, Lord Deben, suggested that
this should be done by arbitration. As his report has clearly been
closely studied by others and that proposal has not been put forward, I
come to the inevitable conclusion that the decision has been that this
stays within the planning system.</hs_para>

wishing to develop will have to notify the local authority but the
objections can come only from an adjoining property. They must come
from people who are on either side of the fence or at the bottom of the
garden. There is no room within 
<?notus-xml column=1245?>these proposals to take account of anyone else who  is adjacent,
diagonal, overlooking or whatever. This  is confined to people
who are adjoining. With that, it is clearly important that
local councillors are involved and know what is going on. With regard
to those who can object, it is from the adjoining properties, as I have
said, but other people may put their comments in. They will not have
the same impact but the local authority might need to take them into

amenity and what should be included, amenity is a pretty well
understood concept in planning and local authorities have a great deal
of experience in applying it. It covers such things as light and
privacy. This is going to be a light-touch process but will include a
lot of the things that planning would deal with anyway. It might, for
example, take into account the overbearing appearance of the property
to the neighbours next door. There might be a significant loss of
daylight to the garden or to the principal windows and habitable rooms
or kitchens of neighbouring properties, or indeed a significant
reduction in privacy for neighbours. These are all the sort of areas

the amenity of people
nearby.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304224000216" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#1304224000216">Why
only adjoining neighbours? As I suggested, we need to protect the
amenity of neighbours immediately affected and we think that the most
significant impact of single-storey extensions—and these can
only be single storeys—will be on adjoining properties.
Neighbours further away are unlikely to suffer a loss of light or
privacy and it is not a question, as noble Lords have suggested, of
whether or not they can see it or like the look of it or whether, if
they have a pair of binoculars, they could see into the garden. It is

Planning permission currently has no timescale of how long it should
take people to do a development once they start. Indeed, I am sure that
many noble Lords have torn their hair out at something that seems to be
going on for a very long time indeed. Of course, the district surveyor
or building regulation enforcers might begin to get worried about why
progress was not being made, but I do not think that we can expect to
put details of that in legislation. That also goes for the question
raised by my noble friend Lady Gardner about
enforcement. There will be the normal enforcement procedures of local
authorities, which they are able to implement when they have
concerns that something is being or has been built outside what has
been approved. The problems with enforcement are much the same with any
planning development as with our new, light-touch

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I start by thanking the
Minister for dealing extensively with the queries that were raised and
all other noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. There are two
strands to it. Most noble Lords believe that sufficient progress has
been made by the amendment to be able not to stick with the amendment
of the noble Lord, Lord True, if that is where they originally were.
The noble Lord, Lord Shipley, said that it had gone far enough to be
supported. The noble Lord, Lord Deben, said that it was a huge
improvement, even if it was not as radical as he would have wanted,
based on the Quality of Life report. The noble Lord, Lord Cormack, was
thankful for the movement. The noble Earl, Lord Lytton, believed that
it had gone some way. The noble Lord, Lord True, himself, believed that
there had been real
progress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T17:14:13"></hs_TimeCode>. The
other strand is how much still needs to be consulted on, and some of
the details still need to be fleshed out, notwithstanding what we have
heard today. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, the
“legal eagle”, said that there should be minimum room for
discretion, effectively, because this generates a lot of angst among
people.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042231000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#13042231000002">The
key issue seemed to be about the period. We heard 21 days but the noble
Baroness, Lady Gardner, and several other noble Lords, did not believe
that was sufficient. On fees, bearing in mind the state of local

the imposition, is a real issue. I also believe there should be further
discussion and movement on the limitation of these arrangements to the
immediately adjoining properties.</hs_para>

means that if an employee turns down an offer to move to an employee
shareholder contract and they then suffer a detriment, such as being
passed over for promotion or for a pay rise for no good reason, they
may be able to make a successful claim at an employment
tribunal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T17:19:06"></hs_TimeCode>. These
two protections allow employees to turn down an offer of an employee 
<?notus-xml column=1249?>shareholder contract if it does not suit them and they can do this with
the knowledge that the law protects their
decision.</hs_para>

clause has further protections. The shares, which must be worth at
least £2,000 when given to the employee shareholder,
must be fully paid up by the employer. This is an important point
because if the company became insolvent and the shares were not fully
paid up, the employee shareholder would otherwise be liable to pay any
outstanding amount against the value of the share. It is important that
we consider the context in which the new employment status fits.

Lea of Crondall:</Member></B> I am most grateful to the Minister for
giving way at this stage. However, he has rattled through the
circumstances in which someone could apply for a job: he says there is
no compulsion and that there are options. I want to put a question
absolutely clearly and directly. It arises from the guidance, which
post-dates where we were last time in this House; in fact, it
post-dates where the Commons were a week ago. The guidance refers to
the circumstances where the vacancy is an “employee shareholder
job vacancy”. Where, therefore, is the option for the jobseeker
who does not want to be an employee shareholder? There is none. Is it
not disingenuous to suggest that there is an
option<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T17:20:49"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042231000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#13042231000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13042231000070" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0001.htm#13042231000070">Viscount

where the noble Lord is coming from. If a jobseeker is seeking a job
there are various options for him or her to look at in terms of roles,
and the employee shareholder role will be treated equally alongside any
other option. The only difference is that there will be absolutely no
detriment to that individual if they apply for an employee shareholder
role, and if they decide to turn it down. On the matter of guidance, I
clarify that it remains in draft form. If this is an issue concerning

not right for all. There are already three established employment
statuses in the labour market, all of which have different rights
associated with them. The employee status has wide-ranging rights,
including unfair dismissal, statutory redundancy pay, TUPE, maternity
leave and pay, and adoption leave and pay, to name a few. The worker

be a long-term relationship. I would not expect anyone to enter into an

employees to enter into such contracts without careful consideration,
and he thinks that this will be a long-term commitment. However, the
articles of association of most companies place restrictions on the
sale of shares. Will the Government require that there be no
restriction on the employee’s ability to sell their shares for
the highest price they can achieve, as opposed to having to sell the
shares back to the employer at whatever price the employer might
justify as being fair in those circumstances? Otherwise I do not see
how the employee can form a view on the value of the consideration that
they are being offered in exchange for giving up valuable employment
rights. Will the Minister give us a clear answer on that
question? I feel that he did not offer an entirely clear answer to the
previous question from my noble

matter of what types of shares and what shares are offered is very much
left to the employee and the employer. That is a negotiation between
the employer and the employee. The Government will not prescribe how
that will come about because there are different types of shares, as
the noble Lord will know only too well from his experience. It will
very much depend on the type of company, the wishes of the individual

position would be. At the very least, should not the employee be given
independent legal advice as to the valuation and the nature of the
transaction he is entering into, which, after all, applies under
existing employment law for compromise agreements and things of that
kind? If it is to be a negotiation, surely the employee has to be

there are established means through actuaries whereby shares are

of the cost of independent legal advice. If that is appropriate for a
compromise agreement where people are surrendering certain of their

their employment rights and entering into what may be a complicated and
major financial decision, given the proposed levels of tax relief with

them. The owner of a company offering the status should think about the
impact of giving up equity in the company. This is a decision that is
not easily reversed, as once you have given away your shares it may not
be easy to get them back. We must remember that the owner is giving
away a stake in the company. Companies will need to be sure that the
person to whom they offer the contract is right for the company. An

Pannick:</Member></B> My Lords, on 20 March, your Lordships’

reasons of principle and practicality as to why your Lordships’
House so voted remain valid. They were not altered by the vote of the
House of Commons last week. Indeed, the debate in the House of Commons,
which was limited by a timetable Motion to 45 minutes, barely

sides of this House on

remind your Lordships why your Lordships’ House voted to exclude
Clause 27. I want to do so because the noble Viscount’s speech
conspicuously avoided, if I may respectfully say so, all the concerns
which the House expressed on Report. I commiserate with him because he

first point is that Clause 27 frustrates the very purpose of employment
rights. We can, and do, disagree around this House and in the other
place as to what the content of employment rights should be. That is
entirely proper. They are debated and amended from time to time as we
see the balance between employer and employee and as we perceive the
public interest. However, over the past 50 years all Conservative and
Labour Governments have recognised that an employer and an employee
cannot be allowed to contract out of those employment rights which
Parliament has seen fit to guarantee. That is because it would defeat
the very purpose of conferring those employment rights. They are
conferred precisely because freedom of contract—a voluntary
agreement, as the Minister describes it—does not protect the
worker or the job applicant who lacks basic bargaining power. To allow
basic employment rights to become a commodity to be traded in the way 
<?notus-xml column=1255?>that Clause 27 proposes would frustrate their very purpose. We would not
envisage for a moment allowing a manufacturer of goods to contract out
of his, her or its obligation to the consumer simply because
the latter chooses, voluntarily, to pay a lower purchase
price<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T17:49:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042231000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042231000048">The
need for protection in the employment context is most obvious in the
case of the person who is seeking employment. The Minister in the House
of Commons, Mr Michael Fallon, emphasised last week that a Clause 27
agreement is voluntary. The Minister repeated that statement today but,
as he accepts, the employer may under Clause 27 advertise the vacancy
on the basis that it will be filled only on Clause 27 terms. In the
real world, outside the House of Commons, a person who is offered
employment on Clause 27 conditions only is not voluntarily accepting
such conditions. In the current economic climate, he or she will have
no practical choice. I welcome the fact that the Government have
removed one aspect of the unfairness of Clause 27—that is that a
person refusing work on Clause 27 terms would have lost
jobseeker’s allowance; a quite extraordinary position—but
the fact that the Government have removed the most outrageous aspect of
this proposal does not mean that what remains is
acceptable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T17:42:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042231000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042231000049">The
first objection is that the clause proceeds on a theory of voluntary
agreement that frustrates the very purpose of conferring employment
rights and is wholly unrealistic. The second objection is the damage
that this clause will cause. A number of noble Lords from the
government Benches—I repeat, from the government
Benches—made this point on Report and in Committee far more
powerfully than I could hope to do. The noble Lords, Lord Forsyth of
Drumlean and Lord King of Bridgewater, both of whom served
as Employment Ministers, the noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft, the noble
Lord, Lord Deben—all of whom I very pleased to see in their
places—and other noble Lords on the government Benches
explained, from their extensive business and political experience, just
how damaging it would be to industrial harmony to allow employers to
buy off basic employment rights, how no sensible employer would
consider this to be beneficial and how Clause 27 would do enormous
damage to the cause of promoting employee share ownership. I am very
sorry indeed that the Government have chosen not only not to listen to
this House but not to listen to the wisdom and experience on their own
Benches. The Minister must know that there is not just a lack of
enthusiasm for this measure on his own Benches, there is a positive
hostility to it that makes the Government’s insistence on
pursuing this cause and this clause, in the word used by the noble
Lord, Lord Deben, in Committee,
“mystifying<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T17:44:21"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para>

third objection to Clause 27 is that even the case which was advanced
by the Government in  the House of Commons
last week does not begin to justify the broad scope of the clause. The
Government’s case, as expressed last week by Mr Fallon, is that
Clause 27 will encourage new and small high-tech companies which will
be more willing to employ people with special skills. Even if noble
Lords were to accept that assumption—and it begs a large number
of questions —it would justify only a specific and
narrowly drawn statutory provision tailored to the specific
circumstances 
<?notus-xml column=1256?>which are said to justify its enactment. The generality of Clause 27
inevitably means that it will be used and it will inevitably be abused
by the Gradgrinds of this world. This concern was expressed on Report

and final objection to Clause 27 has already been raised this afternoon
and is that the clause contains no provision for independent advice.
The Government have refused to accept that statutory rights should be
lost only if the employee has received advice from an independent
adviser on the legal and financial consequences of the agreement. These
consequences are inevitably complex and the suggestion that jobseekers
can simply go off to lawyers or accountants and get advice on these
matters, as the Minister suggested this afternoon, is quite
unrealistic. As the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, has already mentioned,
Parliament has, in Section 288 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations
(Amendment) Act 1992, required independent advice in the context of
compromise agreements to settle employment disputes in individual cases
in employment
tribunals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T17:46:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

no answer as to why independent advice is a statutory requirement
before a compromise agreement is reached in a tribunal but no
independent advice will be required before the employee signs away
these employment rights altogether. This is a major decision for any
employee, especially when there is, of course, no guarantee that the
shares will increase, or even hold, their value. Indeed, if the company
is making employees redundant, which is the context of this clause, it
is highly likely that the shares will be worth less than £2,000
or nothing at all when the individual is made redundant. This concern
was expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Myners, earlier in this

all these reasons, Clause 27 frustrates the purpose of employment
rights and is damaging to industry. The Government’s own case
does not explain why we need so broad a provision and there is no
requirement for independent legal or financial advice. I invite your
Lordships’ House to stand by its principled objection to Clause
27. The Government and the House of Commons have simply failed to
address the concerns about this clause on all sides of the House. They

noble Lord, Lord Pannick, who has set out very clearly and persuasively
the points that we discussed before and which are causing concern to
the House. I share his concern about the Commons debate, which, as he
indicated, was guillotined. All the serious points that were raised in
this House have not really been addressed by my noble friend. I
exonerate him from any blame in that respect but they are important
points. Many of them may be slightly peripheral to the substance that
we are discussing here, which is about employment rights, but, for
example, I remain concerned as to whether the estimate made that this
could result 
<?notus-xml column=1257?>in more than £1 billion disappearing in tax-avoidance schemes is
correct. It is not clear to me whether the Treasury has found ways of
ring-fencing this scheme, which provides for up to £50,000 of
capital gains tax to be relieved, and whether this could not be used as
a great tax-avoidance

afternoon from a Mr Mark Florman of the British Venture Capital
Association, who wanted me to know that all his members were absolutely
behind this scheme and very much supported it. I said to him,
“Why are they concerned about a scheme that enables people to
give up, in effect, only their rights against unfair dismissal if they
have been employed for more than two years and can have £2,000
worth of shares, tax-free? What conceivable interest can that be to the
membership of the British Venture Capital Association?”. He said
that it was keen to encourage share ownership and for employees to be
involved in share ownership. I am sure that people on all sides of this
House are keen on that concept. That is why I would strongly support
any schemes that encouraged share ownership. However, this proposal
mixes up two things—one is employment rights and the other is
share ownership<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T17:51:44"></hs_TimeCode>.

moderate sort of fellow, I looked at where we had got to in this
debate, and I looked at the vote in the House of Commons, where the
majority was actually somewhat less than the Government’s
majority. I looked at the short-term nature of this matter and thought,
“Is it possible to find a way of making this look not more
sensible but more practical?”. It seemed to me that the
Government could have done two things. One was, as the noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, pointed out, to ensure that people who were embarking on an
employee shareholder contract were given independent legal advice that
the shares were worth what the employer was telling them, on what the
arrangements in respect of the valuation of the shares would be at the
end of the period, and on what employment rights they were giving up
and the consequences of that. That seems to be an entirely reasonable
suggestion.
Regarding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T17:53:34"></hs_TimeCode> the
idea that people on low incomes can go and get legal advice on these
matters or that issuing and putting values on shares in private
companies is straightforward, I have to say to my noble friend that the
entire investment banking industry is based on the premise that the
valuation of shares is not straightforward.</hs_para>

is also the idea that by giving people shares in return for employment
rights the employee is in a negotiating position. However, they want a
job and are not in a position to say no. Even if the provision was that
the employer may provide legal advice at the request of the employee,
that would not be enough because the thought would be,
“It’s going to cost the employer £1,000 and if I
say I don’t need the advice, I might have a better chance of
getting the job”. The fundamental point was made by the noble
Lord, Lord Pannick: the reason that we have employment
rights—while I think they go too far in some respects—is
that they even up the position between the employer and the employee. I

Government for at least taking up one point, which is to
alter the guidance in respect of the

letter that he sent us, but I have to say that amending the guidance to
say that people who refuse to take up this voluntary agreement would
not be found to be intentionally refusing employment is not a
concession; that was just a mistake by the Government that they have
now corrected. It is not
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T17:54:52"></hs_TimeCode> to present

other thought was that the Government say that this proposal will be of
interest to small firms. Some people suggested to me that there could
be an exemption stating that the measure would apply only to small
firms. However, on reflection, I do not think that that is the issue at

it clear that these schemes can include a provision that requires the
employees to give the shares back. What is the deal here? It is:
“You give up your right to be protected against unfair
dismissal. We will give you some shares that we tell you are worth a
certain value, but you have no idea whether or not we are right, and
when you get those shares you have to pay tax and national insurance on
them if their value is more than £2,000. Then at the end, I, as
your employer, if I decide to sack you, can take them back at a
valuation that may be less”. That does not seem to be a scheme

In terms of giving up rights, there are three important areas,
including unfair dismissal rights—which are not given up as

statutory redundancy pay, and certain rights to request flexible

is broadly for the company to decide the amount of employee shares that
it is going to offer under this scheme. To repeat the point, the
employment rights which are being surrendered, particularly as viewed
by ambitious entrepreneurial types, are not perceived as of particular
value. The grant of free shares is of value and, to the extent there is
a tax bill, I wish it were lower, but the tax bill is not entirely

in dealing with the kind of company that the noble Baroness, Lady

unacceptable that someone should lose their jobseeker’s

position that I think the Government were seeking to place, but I do
not think that they have done it. I do not want to say to the
Government that we do not want any of it, but I would have hoped that
the Government could have gone a lot further in listening to the advice
of people who did not wish them ill but wanted to find a better way
through this. Although they have removed a thing that made it, in my

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> My Lords, there are already in existence
what I suppose you could call partnership schemes, where people can of
course have shares and a partnership with a company without the
necessity for the abandonment of employment rights. As this legislation
stands at the moment, one cannot help feeling that this is a way in
which the Government want to get rid of employment rights without
appearing to do so by introducing a scheme under which the employee can
be persuaded to voluntarily give up an employment right where they
normally would not consider doing so because that would not be
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000011">I do
not think that we can judge this on the basis that “We ought to
have a scheme where people do participate.” Schemes like that
are available. What is difficult about this is that the basis seems to
be the abandonment of employment rights before the employee can get
involved in any sort of share or partnership scheme. I think that that
is what we object to very strongly; I, at least, have done so from the
very beginning. It has always seemed to me that the Government
themselves are not keen on employment rights. This is a way of getting
rid of those rights without appearing to do so, simply by offering an
employee something that really does not compensate for the loss of the
very important employment rights that we have been discussing today. It
is that sort of basis which is why I oppose this clause and why I fully
support what the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, has said with great clarity.
This is the situation that I take now, and I hope that the Government
will be disposed to accept what we have said on this side of the
House—indeed, on every side of the House—which is: do not
proceed with this scheme. Not only will it not work, but it is not
right and it does no good at all to employment and employment

candidates and the fact that they will be not penalised, but I have to
also agree with other colleagues on both sides of the House who have
admitted that this is really the rectification of a mistake rather than
a major concession. However, it is essential. It is critical because
before it, any of the guidance to the DWP and Jobcentre Plus offices

who are currently unemployed and are being sent to interviews by
Jobcentre Plus; it actually applies to anyone. I think of a young 23
year-old that I know who has just joined a high-tech company in
Cambridge where I think hardly any of the employees do not have at
least one degree and most have at least two. However, if you asked that
23 year-old about the way shares work, he would not understand them at
all and would clearly need advice as well. Helpfully, the firm that he
has joined has made sure that any new employee who gets access to the

the debate in the Commons last week, I shall focus on the
Minister’s referral yet again to this being suitable for small
high-tech companies, particularly in university areas and high-tech
areas. Confession time: in the 1980s I was a venture capitalist,
spinning ideas mainly out of universities, although not only Cambridge
University, and that is one of the reasons why I have quite a lot of
experience and knowledge of what is happening in those companies
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000016">It is
quite clear that good, small high-tech companies already use employment
share schemes, or share schemes for all their employees who come in
right at the start. The reason why they do this is that they know it is
going to be a very hard road to make the product successful,
particularly if it has not even been developed yet. They know that as
time goes on further rounds of money will be coming into the company,
and that they will be diluted not just once or twice but to a very
minimal amount. Therefore, £2,000 worth of shares on day one,
which for argument’s sake might represent 10% of a brand new
company, might actually end up being a tiny percentage once you have
had three, four, or five rounds of venture capital and hedge fund money
going in. As a result, an employee will have to wait a very long time
before they see any
benefit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000017">Again,
having to pay for those shares up front is not just an issue for those
who come from unemployment; it is an issue for those coming in at a
very low starting salary who, in addition, have to give up their
employment rights and are being told, quite frankly—in
Cambridge, which I know quite well, everyone freely admits
this—that it is extremely unlikely that you will see any return
on any investment in the first 10 years of a high-tech company. If you
do, then it is a real star and is to be applauded. However, the vast
majority, 95% of firms, do not do that, and 90-plus% of the firms do
not actually provide a return to shareholders because they are often
sold at the point at which the shares are virtually worthless. So
please can we stop deluding ourselves that small high-tech companies
are perfectly suited to this? The good ones do it already, but why on
earth would they then want to give up employment rights in return for
an extra part of this very risky journey? It just does not add

references being made implied that self-employment might be an option
for those working for the firm, and I think that would definitely be
against HMRC guidance; if somebody is working principally for a firm
then they should not be self-employed. I am concerned that we are
perhaps beginning to develop a dialogue of a third tier of employment,

Wheatcroft:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord King mentioned
a degree of embarrassment at finding himself in this situation, which I
certainly share. At least those of us who are opposed to this
legislation are not alone. The <I>Financial Times</I>, that great
bastion of employee rights, ran a leader the day after the last debate

is not what any of us in this House want to see. We know that employee
share ownership is a good thing. We want to support the Government in
everything they can do to spread it, but this clause is not the way.
The number of ways in which this clause could backfire has been
enumerated this afternoon. Not much attention has been paid to the
potential tax avoidance involved. It has been mentioned, but the Office
for Budgetary Responsibility itself put a label of around £1
billion on the costs that might be in there. Is that really what the
Government want to see happen? How is that compatible with the current
agenda of trying to cut back, quite rightly, on tax
avoidance?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000037">It
is the way in which this clause could detrimentally affect the idea of
share ownership that causes me the biggest problem. It might not be big
companies that will use it, and it is a very strange defence of a piece
of legislation to say that hardly anybody is going to use it. I have
heard that rather often and it seems an odd way to go about government
business. There will be unscrupulous companies below the FTSE 250 that
see this as a way of getting the labour force that they want on the
least good terms. That is not going to encourage good employee
relations. We want to do what my noble friend Lord Deben referred to
and encourage the feeling that we are all in this together. If we are
to 
<?notus-xml column=1270?>go for growth, getting that sort of motivation will be
important. Depriving people of basic rights is not
the way to do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000038">There is
a potential exception for start-ups, where everybody starts off in the
same boat and you do not risk this idea of a two-tier scheme of
employees. Small companies probably need a bit more flexibility. They
already have two years in which they do not need to worry about
tribunals or redundancy, but they might need a little longer than that.
In that case, perhaps we might ask my noble friend the Minister once
more to see whether he can persuade the other place and the Government
that this clause should be very narrowly restricted in its implications
and application. As a clause that creates something open to any
business it is potentially very
dangerous.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000039">We
have also heard about the problems of valuing the shares. In his
valiant attempt to defend this proposal, my noble friend Lord Flight
said that we might well reach a stage where the Government have to
stipulate the price-earnings ratio on which these shares would be sold.

fraught with problems. This entire clause needs another rethink, even

House of Commons saw fit to devote to it last week. In the hours of
debate in this House, there has been one Member only, besides the
Minister, who has wholeheartedly supported this proposal, and we pay
great tribute to him: the noble Lord, Lord Flight. Even he sounded a

Tory or Lib Dem manifestos. It was not in the coalition agreement. It
was not in any report on wider share ownership or employment rights in
any recent period. The Nutall report, which was exhaustive on the
extension of employment rights and was published six months before this
proposal saw the light of day, did not even so much as discuss it, so
frivolous would it have been regarded by the eminent advisers to the

does this report come from? We all know: it is on the rebound from the
Beecroft proposal to do away with certain employment rights in respect
of unfair dismissal and instead to substitute a single payment that
would have resulted from it. The Business Secretary was not prepared to
go along with that. Then, as we have heard from various parts of the

the Business Secretary to resurrect a version of the Beecroft proposal
in return for

supporting a proposal that appears to stand against
everything that all of them came into politics to achieve. I look at
them from here. I do not think that any of them came into politics to
remove basic, fundamental employment rights in return for a mess of
potage, which is what this proposal before the House is. When we last
debated this, to my great surprise the Lib Dems almost entirely went
into the Lobby with Government, apart from the noble Baroness who spoke

Minister for Employment in the House of Commons used three arguments to
support this plan that have all disintegrated in the course of the
debate this afternoon. First, he said that the new employment status
would be “absolutely voluntary”. There is no
“absolute voluntarism” when the power relationship is so
unequal and there is no right to independent advice either on the
nature of the contract on the table or on the rights that are being
forgone. I hear overwhelming support for the idea that there should be
independent, legal and financial advice available to anybody who might
be faced with signing a contract of this kind, before they are obliged
to enter into it. I hope that the noble Viscount will take this support
back to his colleagues in the Cabinet. In all parts of the House, there
has been no movement on that issue in the course of our
deliberations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000047">When

Bill does not say anything about that. It does not have any such
restriction. It is of general application. If the intention is that it
should apply only to a very limited extent, surely it is our duty to
see that the legislation states that. It does not state that, and part
of the reason—I latch on to the remark of the noble Lord, Lord
Forsyth—is that it would be quite difficult in law to specify
how it could apply to only a certain category of companies to which the
Government intended that it should apply, and not to others. They need

third argument is that the business community wants to see this change.
Having read the Office for Budget Responsibility’s report, I
have no doubt that quite a number of company employees might find the
tax status of these shares attractive. We should remember that shares
up to a valuation of £50,000 will be free of capital gains tax.
If the legislation is passed, I can well understand that this will
prove highly attractive to tax planners. Many people may quickly
transfer their employment status in order to take advantage of it.
However, the idea that there are large numbers of companies or putative
companies that want to take advantage of this status in order to engage
in more entrepreneurial activity, which is the justification for the
scheme, is not borne out by any of the
consultation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T18:50:56"></hs_TimeCode>.

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> I thank noble Lords for their
contributions to this debate. I reiterate that the Government would
like to give individuals and companies more choice in how they discuss
and agree employment contracts. The employee shareholder status
provides this additional choice. I will start by addressing the issue
raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, about who the policy is
aimed at. She asked, in effect, whether anybody would want this
employment status, and who would want to employ an employee
shareholder. These themes were raised also by my noble friends Lord

clarify again that we understand that the new employment status will
not be appropriate for all companies and will not be taken up across
the board. It will simply add to the options and flexibility available
to companies and individuals in determining their employment
relationships in the same way that workers or employees, part-time or
permanent staff, are not suitable for all companies. We expect that the
new status will probably appeal mainly to fast-growing, small, start-up

are seen to impact the
most<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T18:55:05"></hs_TimeCode>. We have

noble friend Lady Brinton again raised the issue of who this might
apply to. She cited the Cambridge example. She is quite right that
companies that are likely to take this up are those that are new. They
are likely to be making products that they want to be successful in the
long term. She is right to say that this can be an extremely long road.
However, she is taking a particularly negative view of the opportunity
for employee shareholders. If I heard her correctly, she 
<?notus-xml column=1274?>said that employee shareholders would have to pay for the shares up
front. That is not the case. They will be given the shares, which will

noble friend Lord Forsyth raised the issue of tax, and the cost of the
new status. The Office for Budget Responsibility has stated that in the
long term the policy may cost up to £1 billion, but that relates
to periods beyond the 2020s. It is simply not possible to be certain
about costs so far in the future. The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, also
raised this issue. Moreover, the tax rules will contain protections to
prevent abuse—again, this issue was raised by several noble
Lords—such as serial use of the scheme, and rules to ensure that
those who have a material interest in the company and who thereafter
can influence decision-making will not be eligible for the tax
advantages. The Government will keep the rules on tax under review. I
hope that provides a measure of
reassurance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000058">The

the no-fault dismissal proposal. Individuals will become shareholders
of the company at the start of the employment relationship. This is an
important benefit conferred by employee shareholder status. Unlike in
the case of no-fault dismissal, the employee shareholder status will be
agreed between employers and individuals in contractual negotiations.

their shares as a condition of the shares. However, this type of
restriction will affect the value of the shares, which the company must
assess when granting the shares and attaching restrictions. This comes
back to what I said earlier about negotiations needing to take place in
advance of the contract being signed by both the employee shareholder
and the

that of the worker. Companies are not required to provide independent

is already a market for the valuation of private company shares that is
normally carried out by accountants or actuaries, to which I alluded
earlier. This clause is all about flexibility, and it is not for the
Government to be prescriptive in terms of who should value the shares.
As I mentioned, practitioners have established ways for valuing shares,
including examining the company’s performance and financial
status as shown in its accounts for a period up to the date of the
valuation, considering the plans of the company by looking at order
books and analysing future commitments, and comparing with similar
companies or sectors the value of companies, in particular the
appropriate yields and price-earnings ratios, and accounting for the
commercial and economic background at the date of valuation. I was
grateful for the supportive comments made by my noble friend Lord
Flight in this respect. Although I said at the beginning that this is
straightforward and I stand by that, it may be the case that, given
certain negotiations, it becomes more complicated. However that
depends, again, on the discussions that are undertaken between the
employer and the potential employee

people are prepared to pay for them. In small private companies where
there is no liquidity, how will you deal with

shares, as raised by my noble friend Lord Forsyth, we recognise that

is important that, where appropriate, a buyback clause will be useful
to both the employee and the employer. This is an issue that the noble
Lord, Lord Myners, raised as well. We introduced in the other place a
power to bring forward the regulations that would govern these buyback

that this is not about removing rights, it is about creating a new
employment status that offers a different set of rights and a mandatory
share ownership. The status, I say again, is not compulsory for
companies to use, and it will only be suitable for those companies that
want to share ownership with their workforce. We must remember that
employee shareholders will retain the majority of employment rights,
including, for example, automatic unfair dismissal rights and the right
to be paid the national minimum wage. We have consistently said that
the new status will not suit all people or all companies. This is very
much a common theme. However, for those who choose to use it, the
employee shareholder status offers more flexibility and allows greater
risk- and reward-sharing between people and

employee shareholder scheme is open to tax avoidance, an issue that I
touched on slightly earlier. It is a key aspect of the policy to allow
employee shareholders to share in the success of their employers
without paying capital gains tax on at least some of their gains.
However, to guard against abuse of the tax exemption, there are several
rules that limit the number of shares that can be exempt. For example,
the rules will prevent repeated consecutive use or multiple
simultaneous use of employee shareholder status to get around the
limit. In addition, anybody who controls, alone or with other connected
persons, 25% or more of the voting power in the company, will not be
able to receive exempt shares. We will not allow people such as spouses
or children who are connected to individuals who control 25% or more of
the company to benefit from the
exemption.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000069">We

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving Motion A I will
speak also to Motion B. We are now discussing the provisions in the
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill, which seek to reform the remit
of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. I will turn in a moment to
the specifics of the Motion and the amendments before us. First, let me
remind the House why we are discussing the EHRC, or what we often more
commonly refer to as the commission, Britain’s designated
equality body and “A-rated” national human rights
institution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000084">In
May last year, we set out our plans to support the commission to become
the valued and respected national institution that we all want it to
be. Even the commission’s many supporters in this House have
acknowledged that the first few years of its existence were anything
but trouble free. I am not going to go into the detail of these
problems again today, but I do want to be clear that the
Government’s motive in making changes was and is to secure a
successful future for the commission so it is in the strongest position
possible to do its vital
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000085">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T19:29:42"></hs_TimeCode>
are already making progress. In the past three months alone we have
agreed with the commission a new governance framework document and
budget, both of which ensure that the commission is able properly to
fulfil its important duties and protect its operational independence.
The new chair, the noble Baroness, Lady O’Neill, and other
members of the new board have now been in post for several months and
are building on the work of their predecessors. We believe that the
commission is going from strength to strength. Indeed, the working
relationship between this Government and the commission is marked by a 
<?notus-xml column=1282?>mutual respect and clear understanding of the distinct roles that each
is there to fulfil and how we can work together towards a fairer
society. I believe that this will be evident when we come to the next
debate on caste discrimination.</hs_para>

introduction, let me move to the Motions in front of us. In the ERR
Bill, the Government originally put forward two legislative changes
that we believe will underpin the positive changes which our
non-legislative reforms have already helped to bring about. This House
rejected the Government’s amendments on Report, but the other
place has
disagreed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T19:28:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000087">First,
we are asking noble Lords not to insist on their Amendment 35, which
would remove from the Bill the repeal of Section 3 of the Equality Act
2006, what is otherwise known as the commission’s general duty.
Section 3 imposes a general duty on the commission to perform its
functions with a view to “encouraging and supporting the
development” of a fairer society and it sets out five ways in
which it should do this. As I have made clear during all of our
debates, the statement included in that general duty is one we can all
support because we all want a fairer and more equal society. However,
it is this Government’s view that making this a statutory duty
for the Equality and Human Rights Commission, in addition to its
specific responsibilities to promote and to protect equality, diversity
and human rights, dilutes the clarity of purpose necessary for it to be
effective and
successful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000088">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T19:29:20"></hs_TimeCode>
Government are clear that the commission’s core purpose is what

human rights. That purpose is underpinned by the detailed duties
contained in Sections 8 and 9 of the Equality Act 2006. The repeal of
the general duty does nothing to affect the commission’s ability
to fulfil these duties. It is our view that its focus on them will
enhance its

I understand many noble Lords’ wish for Section 3 to remain,
during the debates in both Houses we have not heard any example of how
its repeal would prevent the commission carrying out the kind of work
which has had real impact. Indeed, in its most recent briefing paper,
circulated to all Peers, the commission explains that its programme of
work is guided by the specific powers and duties in the Act. The work
for which it is respected and which has had great effect, such as its
inquiry into disability-related harassment—and there are many
others—would not be affected by the removal of the general duty
at Section 3. Again, the commission itself has confirmed this in its

influence and change. However, to go further and ask it to assess how
“fair” society is gives rise to ill-targeted and costly

Campbell of Surbiton:</Member></B> My Lords, it is with great sorrow
that I find myself here at ping pong, seeking to reinstate Section 3 of
the Equality Act 2006. I really do not do this lightly. I know that a
challenge to the Government at this stage should be made only when it
is absolutely necessary and all other routes have been exhausted. I had
hoped that the Government would listen to the many and exceptionally
well considered arguments made by all but two noble Lords on Report. I
expected something more than a blanket
no<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T19:34:31"></hs_TimeCode>. That is why,

single example of how the commission’s capacity to act as the
guardian of equality and human rights in Britain will be improved by
repealing the general duty in Section 3, a duty which gives a holistic
direction to the commission based on principles of dignity, respect and
fairness, and takes it to, but not beyond, legal enforcement in helping
society change for the
better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T19:35:24"></hs_TimeCode>. The

recall where the duty came from and to consider where its repeal may
take us in the future. Twenty years ago today, Stephen Lawrence was
murdered by a group of young men for no reason other than the colour of
his skin. The Metropolitan Police made a catalogue of errors in the
investigation into his murder. Our criminal justice system failed
Stephen Lawrence, and it failed his family in their quest for justice.
It is a sad truth that it took this tragedy to create a moment of
enlightenment. The inquiry, led by Sir William Macpherson, identified
that racial discrimination could not be seen as the lone action of a
few bad apples. It was part of the institutional culture of the
Metropolitan
Police<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T19:37:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

sea-change in our approach to equality law and the structural support
to promote and enforce it. The general duty embodies this
shift  in thinking. The role of the commission is not simply to
seek compensation for those who experience discrimination. As Age UK
has noted, it is to pursue cultural change to prevent such
discrimination from occurring in the first place. This is not only
about racial discrimination. It is about institutional discrimination
and violations of human rights in all their guises and across
society—for example, in parts of the NHS and our care system, as
the EHRC demonstrated in its inquiry into older people’s
treatment at home. It is also widespread in the criminal justice system
and local authority practice, as the disability hate crime inquiry
revealed. It is rife in the exploitation of migrant workers, exposed by
the inquiry into the meat processing
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T19:38:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that the general duty is symbolic and aspirational, as if this were
enough to dismiss it out of hand. The general duty symbolises our
commitment to preventing the kind of injustice faced by the Lawrence
family, or the routine abuse of disabled young people in institutions
because of indifference and cruelty. It aspires to a society founded on
dignity, respect and equality—notoriously absent in these cases.
However, contrary to what Ministers claim, the general duty is not, in
fact, merely symbolic. Its repeal could have major implications for the
commission’s role in monitoring equality and human rights. In

of a unifying link between equality and other fundamental human
rights—I was rather surprised that the Minister sought to deny
that one in her wind-up—the fact that there is nothing in

that Section 3 does not add anything to the EHRC’s core equality

Committee, there are reasons for thinking that the repeal of Section 3

Section 3 could undermine the commission’s ability to carry out
its functions. I submit that it is a clear example if the removal of
Section 3 would mean that the commission was more vulnerable to
judicial review in carrying out its functions. I would be grateful if

four reasons, which I will briefly state. First, the public have shown
in their response to the Government’s consultation that they are
against repealing the commission’s general duty by six to one.
Secondly, a large number of civil society organisations including Age
UK, the Equality Trust, the Fawcett Society, Justice, Mind and the
Refugee Council have expressed their opposition to repeal, indicating
that it would leave the EHRC a weaker body if Section 3 were no longer
in place. Thirdly, there is the cursory nature of the Commons rejection
of our amendment. It was rejected in the briefest of exchanges, which
scarcely sought to answer the arguments advanced but simply reiterated
the arguments that had already been answered. Fourthly, and this is

the debate in the Lords and commentary by parties have underlined the
importance which is attached to the general duty. Many people clearly
believe that, both in terms of the perceived mission and role of the
Commission, and the coherence of the legislation, it is valuable to
retain the general duty. Unless the government can provide additional
robust reasons for removing the general duty in the current situation,
our analysis suggests the case for removing the Lords’ amendment

part of the equalities legislation then that should be done with prior
consultation and the involvement of the Joint Committee on Human

asserted boldly that Section 3 of the 2006 Act should be repealed
because it was not a core purpose of that Act. With great respect, that
is exactly what it was. Section 3 was in a sense the core purpose of
the 2006 Act, that purpose being to bring together for the first time
in legislation equality rights with other fundamental human rights. The
specific duties under Sections 8 and 9 were to be the means of bringing
about that core purpose. That was the very point made by Professor Sir
Bob Hepple in his report. He said that Section 3 is important because
it states for the first time what he called the “unifying
principle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T19:55:33"></hs_TimeCode>”.
It is most unfortunate that the Minister in the other place, when he
came to his reply, did not reply to that argument or to any of the
arguments advanced in the other place; sound arguments and convincing
arguments, they were all, unfortunately, left aside because there was

is a hint, elsewhere in what the Minister said, that Section 3 is
undesirable because it would, as it were, take the commission’s
eye off the ball to the exclusion of the important duties under
Sections 8 and 9. There was never much danger of that. In any event,
the commission has now made it clear, if I am right, that it would now
welcome the retention of Section 3. If that be so, surely we should

said, the Minister did not deal with any of these arguments in his

considerable symbolic importance and, like any major organisation, it

hold up a mirror to society and would be able only to hold up a mirror
to itself in terms of what was happening when it produced its reports.
I absolutely disagree with that. In my opening remarks, I made it clear
that the new monitoring requirements would allow the commission to
continue to hold up a mirror to society. It is our view that the new
monitoring requirements will lead to a much more focused report, which

noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, and others pointed to the
commission’s recent briefing and its statement that it supports
maintaining the position established by the Lords for retaining its
general duty. In response, I acknowledge that that is what the
commission has said publicly and I understand and respect that view.
However, in the same briefing paper it has also made it clear that
removing the general duty would not affect the commission’s
ability to do its work. On those matters, it is worth making clear
again 
<?notus-xml column=1293?>that by removing the general duty we are not preventing the commission
doing any of its very important and good work. It will not lose any of
its vital powers of promoting equality, tackling discrimination and
promoting human rights. As I have already said, when it comes to
monitoring, producing quinquennial reviews in future should lead to it
provide something more analytical and of greater value to those who
want to use it as

I said when I first stood up, I am very aware of the strength of views
expressed around this House. This is an issue where the noble Baroness,
Lady Campbell, supported by all those who spoke tonight, feels
differently from the Government. I have tried to set out again why the
Government feel that this change will lead to a stronger Equality and
Human Rights Commission, which is what we really want. When we come on
to the next discussion about caste discrimination I will be able to
reflect how important the role of the Equality and Human Rights
Commission is. I ask your Lordships to agree with the Commons in their
disagreement of the Lords amendment and the noble Baroness to withdraw

Campbell of Surbiton:</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to thank the
Minister for her reply and to thank noble Lords who have contributed to
this debate, the last debate, the one before it and the one before
that. I have never worked so hard to protect a piece of legislation
which the majority of people want and about which so many noble Lords
from all sides of the House have spoken in favour. I find it quite
incredible that something so symbolic and so important to the proper
functioning of the Equality and Human Rights Commission has been such
hard
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T20:20:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000144" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000144">I
do understand that there has been improved mutual respect between the
Government and the commission and the quality of the work has been
enhanced. That is to be celebrated, but I still believe it is critical
to retain the general duty and the monitoring duty for all the reasons
that we have given in these debates since last year. I would like to
thank the noble Lord, Lord Low, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Lloyd, for helping me tonight to expand the arguments for the general
duty. It would be wrong to rehearse them again now: we have exhausted
them. I was particularly pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Cormack,
express his passion and his very clear understanding of why the general
duty is necessary to the work of the Equality and Human Rights
Commission and also to the messages that we send out to the Lawrence
family, to disabled people who are undergoing considerable difficulties
in situations where, without a culture change, they will continue to be
abused in institutions, and to others that we have mentioned throughout
these debates. For them, I ask your Lordships to agree with my
amendment tonight and to send it back to the Commons saying,
“Please consider these arguments”, because they were only
looked at in a very cursory way during the Commons debate. In fact, I
believe the debate suffered a guillotine in the winding-up speech only
three minutes after the Minister stood up. I ask the House to send this
amendment back so that a proper  
<?notus-xml column=1294?>debate can be had and the arguments examined properly. I ask your
Lordships to agree to this Motion. I wish to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="13042260000308" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000308">8.23

about the implications of legislation. These concerns have not come
only from those we would expect to be against legislation. Her
Majesty’s Opposition also raised 
<?notus-xml column=1298?>legitimate and serious questions during the debate in the other place.
As I said during our earlier debates, this Government are not against
legislation as a way of tackling caste discrimination. However, we do
not have all the information that we believe is necessary to decide
that the power in the Equality Act 2010 should be exercised. We think a

implications of legislation before going down that route.</hs_para>

must ensure that whatever we do next does not create new, unintended
consequences which could make it harder for people to seek redress.

there need not be a requirement for new primary legislation and
therefore any unnecessary delay. I should note, however, that the
amendment brought before the House today would not permit any
meaningful public consultation or allow any flexibility through
secondary legislation in the way that the Opposition, among others,
have been arguing. Caste would simply join colour, nationality and

that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000160" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000160">In a
moment I will explain what additional information and steps we think
are necessary before the Government will decide, and what the timescale
is for that decision. First, I shall summarise some of the concerns
that have been raised. First, there are concerns about whether we are
actually legislating on the right ground. Some organisations have
suggested that descent is more appropriate than caste, and this is an
issue that the Opposition have also raised in debates in the other
place. I am aware that there are differing and strong views on the
question of descent, which we cannot go into today. However, the fact
that there is genuine uncertainty over the definition of what we are
legislating about clearly suggests that we should not be adding further
to the law before carrying out the sort of consultative process
proposed by both the Government and the Opposition, although I
acknowledge that  the Opposition have a different proposal in
terms of
consultation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000161" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000161">There
are also concerns about individuals having to indicate their caste in
any monitoring. The NIESR report is clear that some people would not
want to do this or indeed admit to caste existing at all. We all have
to consider what business would need to do to comply sensibly with such
a provision and, if so, what costs this would entail. Would there need
to be a code of practice, and if so, would it be reliable in such
sensitive matters? To take one important stakeholder in this area, the

the moment, I believe it is not clear that we have all the information
that we need on these and other questions. A significant number of
Hindu and Sikh organisations, including some representing people from
the perceived lower castes, have expressed concerns that they have not
had a chance to provide considered views and would be strongly opposed
to immediate legislation on this. For example, the GAKM UK which
represents the Mochi community, which is deemed one of the lower
castes, believes that by enacting the clause in law, the Government
could undo all the work done by our communities over the past 20 years
to try to remove the differentiation by caste in all aspects of
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000163">I am, of
course, aware that some noble Lords may say that this is the sort of
argument that could have been used to delay the advent of race or
indeed of any other discrimination law. However, there is a fundamental
difference with caste in that not only do we wish to get rid of caste
prejudice from British society, we actually see no useful value in
caste itself, or of anyone defining themselves by their caste. In that
sense it is not like colour or ethnic origin, or any of the other
protected characteristics. We need to ensure that the action we take,
particularly if in legislation, sets us towards this aim and not in the
opposite direction of embedding caste as a concept in domestic
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000164" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0002.htm#13042260000164">As your

a programme of educational work within the affected communities. At
that time we also said that the Equality and Human Rights Commission
will investigate the right way of tackling the problem of caste
prejudice and discrimination, using the evidence in the NIESR report
and earlier material from ACDA and other groups as its starting point.
In last week’s debate in the other House, the Minister for Women
and Equality announced that in parallel with this work a public
consultation will be undertaken on the use of the caste power in the
Equality Act. As I have already stated, a full, balanced public
discussion is something that has not previously happened, and we think
it is crucial that it now does so.</hs_para>

should like to give your Lordships more detail about this consultation.
The Government intend to start the consultation before the Summer
Recess and finish it before the end of this year. In the same
timescale, as I have already mentioned, the Equality and Human Rights
Commission will investigate independently the right way of tackling the
problem we see in the evidence presented by NIESR and other studies. We
have always accepted that the NIESR report identified a small number of
cases where the evidence suggested that caste discrimination or
harassment had probably occurred. I should therefore explain that the
initiatives we are proposing are specifically intended to supplement
the NIESR report by dealing with two key aspects which that report did
not fully address. The EHRC will look, in the light of the evidence
from existing studies, at what is the right way—legislative or
otherwise—of tackling caste prejudice and discrimination. 
<?notus-xml column=1300?>We are pleased that the commission, as our country’s designated
equality body and human rights institution, chaired by the noble
Baroness, Lady O’Neill of Bengarve, will be playing a key role

seek views widely from all individuals and groups with an interest in
caste and the problems it creates. It can of course raise those issues,
and others that I have just mentioned as causing particular concern to
Hindu and Sikh groups, with businesses and other interests which have
not previously been involved in this debate. Apart from the
Government’s own assessment of the consultation responses, we
are certainly happy to share that material with the EHRC once the
consultation closes. The EHRC can then reach its own conclusions and
recommendations in full awareness of what respondents to the
consultation have been telling us.</hs_para>

outcome of the consultation and the commission’s own conclusions
and any recommendations it may have for Government by the end of the
year and we will publish the Government’s response early next
year. If it is clear from this assessment that legislating is
necessary, the Government will then take steps to do that. No
Government can give away their legislative responsibilities. However,
if the report from the Equality and Human Rights Commission—a
body uniquely qualified to take a view on anti-discrimination
law—makes a firm recommendation to legislate, that would be a
key element in forming the Government’s decision.</hs_para>

Government and Opposition have, rightly, been talking to people who are
disquieted by the prospect of legislation. One point needs to be made
quite clear: caste is primarily a social and cultural phenomenon and
its presence is not confined to any one religion or indeed to a
religious view at all. It can even infiltrate religions that are in
principle totally opposed to all forms of caste discrimination. A few
years ago, for example, the Pope had to warn Christian communities
about the way in which the caste system had taken hold in certain
congregations in the Indian subcontinent. It is in essence a social and
cultural phenomenon, and this amendment should not in any way be taken

Asia, has accompanied some migrants from the subcontinent on their

caste is not peculiar to the Hindus; it is a cultural phenomenon that

that there is still a small amount of the practice of untouchability in
Indian society in Britain and that it must be countered. I agree
entirely. However, by using caste as a general category, you are going
to catch too much at one end and too little at the other. The fact that
there is untouchability is not only corroborated by some of the reports
that have recently come out, but I myself discovered it in 1986 when I
was deputy chair of the Commission for Racial Equality. I received a
letter, sent from Birmingham, written by an Indian gentleman 
<?notus-xml column=1305?>who said that his doctor had refused to examine him physically when he
came to his home because he was an untouchable. In those days we used
to have domiciliary visits, which sadly have stopped now. We wrote to
the doctor and it turned out to be true. The doctor was reprimanded and
I would like to hope that the practice had stopped. Of course, it does
not stop just like that but a warning had gone out to the medical
fraternity. This was in 1985 or 1986, and even after that there have
been many cases of untouchability and therefore discrimination does
occur. It needs to
stop.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000195" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#13042260000195">However,
untouchability is only the egregious, extreme form of the caste system,
because the system covers everybody. Although caste does not mean
anything to me personally, you cannot be a Hindu without belonging to a
particular caste, full stop. Talking about abolishing the caste system
is extremely problematic because it could mean getting rid of the
category, getting rid of the hierarchy among the categories or getting
rid of the principle of heredity which determines the caste.
Where do you start? I suggest that caste as a category of
discrimination is therefore not in the same league as race, religion or
any of the other protected categories. If we were to introduce this,
there would be four major difficulties and I want to alert the House to
them.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042260000196" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#13042260000196">First,
there will be frivolous complaints based on caste. I do not know how
many of your Lordships are students of sociology or have Indian
friends. However, let us say that I belong to a caste—whatever
that may mean, since I have married outside my caste and my children
have married outside their caste, race and religion. Nevertheless,
technically I was born in the caste of goldsmiths because my father
used to make gold and silver ornaments, so I am a goldsmith. Supposing
that someone were to apply for a job in the university where I am a
professor who happens to be a blacksmith, a shoe smith, a Brahmin or
God knows what, and I do not appoint him because he is not terribly
good. Supposing that he were go to the court and say, because I would
be doing this not as a Lord but as a Professor, “Professor
Parekh refused to appoint me on the grounds that I belong to a
different caste”. We would belong to different castes, although
he is not an untouchable. Since every Indian who is Hindu carries the
caste mark with him, every action that he does with respect to another
can be subsumed under one or another form of caste discrimination, so
the first difficulty is that you will have an enormous range of
frivolous complaints with no way of arguing for or against.</hs_para>

away the untouchability bit, there is no evidence of any kind to show
that caste discrimination takes place. With respect to the
untouchables, they do not have horns or carry any distinct mark of
being untouchables. Sometimes, their surnames are a giveaway if you
know Indian society but a large number of them—I have worked
with them and I greatly admire them—have changed their surname
so that it is not a giveaway. When somebody applies for a job, how
would you therefore recognise that he is an ex-untouchable? That would
be the second problem.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042260000198" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#13042260000198">The third difficulty
that one would have is that, as the Minister rightly said, we will be
introducing the 
<?notus-xml column=1306?>category of caste in our domestic legislation and once you do that,
problems begin to arise. How do you define caste? Sociologists have
tried for 200 years, ever since the Portuguese invented the word caste.
It is not an English but a Portuguese word; when they came to India,
they found that we were classified in a certain way and called it
caste. In India, caste is very much in flux thanks to globalisation,
urbanisation and so on, and in Britain it is even more so. Castes are
therefore difficult not only to define but to distinguish. Once one
introduces this kind of indeterminate, inherently nebulous category in
law, one invites difficulties. One could easily pave the way so that in
10, 15 or 20 years’ time there might even be a pressure of the
exact kind we have now, where people might be saying,
“Let’s have a question on caste in the
census”.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T21:10:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

my grandchild were to ask me today or 10 years from now,
“Grandpa, what caste do I belong to?”, I would not know
what to say. A category as indeterminate as that does not deserve to be
enshrined in domestic legislation. For these and other reasons I would
be opposed to the amendment, while making it absolutely clear—so
that I am understood outside this House—that untouchability
exists. It is an abominable practice; people are sometimes
discriminated against and the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord
Harries, at a meeting he organised, produced people who were able to
give
evidence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000200" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#13042260000200">Take<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T21:10:09"></hs_TimeCode>

there is a person who works on the buses who he would not want to team
up with because the guy is supposed to have a surname that indicates he
may be an untouchable. It exists in small pockets in those places where
people are recognisable. It is not a pervasive phenomenon, but even if
it is not pervasive, it is still not acceptable. The point is that it
is only one extreme form of caste. By introducing caste as a general

misinformation and ignorance used in the other place to argue against
legislation. The Minister in the other place made a statement, which
was repeated today, that caste is a problem in the Sikh community as
well as among Hindus. It is not only inaccurate, but frankly insulting
to the Sikh faith. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, totally
condemned the whole system of caste. Opposition to discrimination based
on caste, birth, gender, race or religion or social status is an
essential pillar of Sikh teachings. Sikhism emphasised equality of
respect and opportunity for all members of our one human family

gurus repeatedly taught the absurdity of caste, in which the shadow of

<?notus-xml column=1307?>Sikh opposition to caste, quoting Guru Nanak’s observation that
in his mother’s womb no man knows of caste. Let us get it right.
The concept of caste is a hierarchical division of Hindu society into
the Brahmins, the top or priestly caste, with Khatris or warriors
below, followed by those in commerce and then at the bottom Sudras,
cleaners or scavengers. Caste has two essential components: a hierarchy
of importance and a notion of ritual purity. Both are rejected in Sikh
teachings. When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T21:13:29"></hs_TimeCode>

Nanak warned us about the negative cultural practices that over the
years attach themselves to our different religions and distort
underlying ethical teachings. It is true for all faiths and it is
certainly applies to caste which has little to do with the ethical
imperatives of Hinduism. As far back as the 1930s many leading Hindus
condemned the iniquity of caste. While Gandhi felt education was the
answer, Dr Ambedkar felt education was not enough and legislative
action was also necessary. Later, as author of the Indian constitution,
Dr Ambedkar successfully included prohibiting discrimination on grounds

very difficult to draw the distinctions. They say that the matter is
being healed anyway because there is a great movement to ensure that it
does not happen. They say that people will become more discriminatory
if the law intervenes. That is what they always
say<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T21:17:59"></hs_TimeCode>. It may be
more true about caste than about other things. I merely say that those
are the same arguments, and I find it difficult to take those arguments

the Government have rightly said, and I am proud that they have done
so, that discrimination on the grounds of caste is unacceptable in any
circumstance. We do now at least start this discussion from the same
basis. That is not how it has been in the past, because there have been
arguments that caste is somehow different, and that you should not say
this because there are cultural and religious reasons why you may not
make that statement. I think that we are now as one on that. I thank my

however, put forward two arguments in the discussions that seem
mutually contradictory. On the one hand, they have said that their
legal advice is that the present law clearly covers caste. They have
then gone on to say that they do not want to include caste because it
would be expensive to employers. You cannot have it both ways. If the
present law covers caste, that is a cost to employers anyway. If
putting “caste” in merely clarifies matters, you do not
increase the cost at all. You can increase the cost only if by adding
“caste” you have a different category that was otherwise
not covered.</hs_para>

Government’s whole case falls down. I really hope we will hear
no more about the cost argument. If we do, we should not be saying that
people cannot be discriminated against unfairly, wrongly and wickedly
but that because it is expensive to deal with it we are not going to
deal with it. I am sorry, but that is not the politics I entered into
and I am not prepared to take that. Let us just get rid of the idea
that, somehow or other, we can argue this case on the basis of finance.

raised by my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay. He will no doubt
make the point himself, but it fits into my argument at this point so I

that because the previous Government—and this is no criticism of
them—had put into the law a triggerable mechanism that could say
that caste specifically was referred to, the courts might find it
suggested that caste was not covered by the present legislation. The
Government therefore have a real responsibility to ensure that their
opposition to caste is not befuddled or mixed up because of an odd
circumstance that was meant to be helpful but that has this downside in
the legal

for a legal remedy is not just to help the individuals concerned but to
lay down a quality of our society that says that this is not
acceptable. It is after all a quality of Indian society that it is not
acceptable. It is a quality of Nepalese society that it is not
acceptable, and the Bangladeshis are presently seeking to have exactly
the same quality. The idea that passing this law would in some way be
insulting to Hindus seems to me to be absolutely outwith sense, and we
have to make that absolutely clear. All we are saying is that we would

disagree with the Government on both these issues, because first of all
there has been as much consultation as was necessary. It is also quite
clear how you deal with caste. That happens to be my view. However,
this House has to take seriously the Government’s role in this.

noble Baroness will ask me later on—not, I fear, at Second
Reading because I will be unavoidably in the United States, but
thereafter—to support the concept of allowing gay people to get
married. I happen to believe that is right. My view is that there is a
difference between Christian marriage, which I uphold entirely, the
Catholic teaching on that, which I accept utterly, and the way in which
state marriage works.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T21:31:22"></hs_TimeCode> reason I
come to that view is that I believe society ought to protect anybody in
a way which is necessary for their own fulfilment. I do not care how
many Dalits there are. I do not care how many cases of discrimination
there are. If there is only one case of discrimination—I do not
want to burden the House by referring to the gospel story—where
one person is discriminated against, I do not want to live in a society
that does not enable that person to claim

in the courts. That is not a society that we ought to be prepared to

us have no argument about there not being very many, so it will be all

society allows doctors to say that they will not examine a patient
because they are of a lower caste? What kind of society has no
recompense? He said, “We talked about it, and in the end we
think that is all right”; but it may not be all right. He does
not know whether it is all right. I want to be in a society in which,
when a patient is treated like that, he could perfectly properly claim

Almost all Race Relations Acts made provision for the Commission for

that I have in the past 15 to 16 years succeeded in moving amendments
to secure equality in a number of legislative measures. Over the past
two years, I have chaired a substantial 
<?notus-xml column=1312?>number of consultations with communities and individuals on matters of
caste discrimination. Let me make their point of view clear in case
there is any doubt: they fully appreciate the need for equality
legislation. Indeed, ethnic communities would not have a voice without
such legislation. They are adamant that they would not want to deny any
disadvantaged group the right to have recourse against discrimination
on any grounds. Almost every one of them has made that position very
clear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000232" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#13042260000232">Caste<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T21:36:40"></hs_TimeCode>

second point I wish to make is that race relations in this country have
always been based on sound research. The work of the former
organisation that some may remember, which campaigned against racial
discrimination and was headed in its early days by the famous Lord Pitt
who sat in the House of Lords, produced evidence which resulted in the
first Race Relations Act outlawing discrimination in public places. The
substantial evidence produced by the Street report in 1967 identified
discrimination in employment, housing and general services and resulted
in the introduction of the Race Relations Act
1968.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T21:38:02"></hs_TimeCode> Similar
evidence on institutional racism resulted in the introduction of the
1976 race relations legislation. However, in essence, there is a lack
of evidence on caste matters. The report produced by the national
institute clearly acknowledges that there is no evidence to suggest the
existence of large-scale discrimination in this country based on
caste<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T21:38:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042260000234" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#13042260000234">Communities
feel let down that during the passage of the Equality Bill through
Parliament, having acknowledged that the available evidence did not
indicate that caste discrimination was a significant problem in Britain
in the areas covered by discrimination legislation, Parliament
proceeded to accept an amendment to the Equality Bill to include caste
as an aspect of race by a ministerial decision. By doing so, the Act
which was supposedly designed to simplify and streamline discrimination
law in Britain seems to have defeated this very objective by including
the concept of caste that has eluded clear definition in common
parlance, let alone in legal terms—the point made by the noble

it would be a big mistake to extend the scope of the act to include
caste in Britain without substantial evidence. Laws should be based on
sound evidential research. The research by NIESR clearly acknowledges
that there is no large scale caste discrimination in Britain. The
sample was far too small to reach a fair conclusion. Therefore, to
yield to pressure groups and include caste within the scope of the Act

fear that we are still studying something that may be on the surface. A
generation of people born here have broken the links with caste

noble Lord, Lord Parekh—where caste may have played some role
but there are ways of dealing with this subject. I had discussions with
my colleague, Lynne Featherstone, when she was looking at the issue as

participated in consultation to set up their own formal structure which
could be the basis for eradicating discrimination practices. A

found that all Governments in this country have a great belief in
so-called “community leaders”. Ever since immigrants
first came to this country they have created this myth of community
leaders: community leaders know everything about the community; they
will tell us what the community wants; they are the important ones.
They are not the ones to speak for all communities: they are the ones
who shout the loudest. It has always been a big mistake to listen to
people who say, “We are the community
leaders”. Have you ever seen a woman as a
community leader? Have you ever seen any women in
any consultation? Have you seen any women among all these men who have
been shouting outside the House of Lords about the caste amendment? The
Hindus have come together for the first time ever, to my knowledge, to
shout about the caste amendment because they feel that this dishonours
them in some way. They dishonour themselves: caste is a fact. It is not
created by us or in the minds of the British or other people; it is a
fact that people discriminate on the basis of caste. It is endemic in
social issues like marriage. As far as public things like employment
and education are concerned, we have to watch out: we have to say,
“No discrimination on the basis of caste”. It is no good
our saying, “Leave it for next time”; that happens all
the time. There will be more consultation and more evidence, but there
is already plenty of evidence of discrimination. As someone has said,
if there are six people being discriminated against, we should do
something about it. We do not know how many people are discriminated
against<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T21:44:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in response to the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, I will
just clarify something that I said which he picked up on. The
Government are not suggesting that we should replace the word

not something that we are proposing; I raised it purely to highlight
that it that had been raised by others in the course of this

views have been expressed in the Chamber this evening. The noble and
right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, questioned a comment I made that
some people do not want to be defined by caste. He argued that that
should not lead to a decision that we should not recognise caste in law
in order to protect against discrimination. I will make a couple of
points in response to that. First, over the past couple of weeks in the
discussions that the Government have had with different bodies, it has
been made very clear to me while attending those meetings that some
people do not want to be defined by caste and are worried that caste
legislation would allow that. In response to the noble Baroness, Lady
Flather, the person who made that point most forcefully to me was a
woman from the Hindu
community.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000004">It
was interesting and illustrative that the noble Lord, Lord Singh, made
the point that caste is absolutely not a feature at all in the Sikh
religion. The noble 
<?notus-xml column=1318?>Lord, Lord Parekh, said that caste is something that can be recognised
across a wide range of different faiths. Indeed, the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries, talked about this being something that can
be found in the Christian faith. There are clearly, just in the debate
that we have had this evening, several views being expressed in this
regard.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1304239000238" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000238">10

me on to the point about consultation and the need, in our view, for
this consultation to take place before we decide what action is
necessary. The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord
Harries<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>, and the
noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, suggested that it might be possible to
decide and then consult afterwards. I think, by definition, that if we
were to do that, we would narrow the terms of the consultation. Some of
the issues that have been raised by noble Lords this evening would not
be given the opportunity to be properly considered and reflected
upon.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1304239000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000006">I would
also make another important point about the consultation that picks up
on a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, about who the
Government are listening to on this matter. Our consultation proposals
are not simply intended as a platform for community leaders, they also
reflect the fact that there has never been a public consultation on
this important and emotive issue. So far, the debate both for and
against legislation has been led by a very small number of individuals
and groups. What we want to do is to give the very people who the noble
Baroness talked about the opportunity to make their views and their
voices heard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000007">I
should respond to a couple of specific points. The noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries, and others suggested that by putting
forward their proposal to consult after deciding to legislate, this
should reflect on whether employers should consider caste in terms of
their work. Somebody made the point that actually, as for any kind of
characteristic, caste is not something that one is legally required to
disclose. However, it would seem odd to decide to legislate and then
consult or issue guidance on whether an employer should be asking
somebody to disclose their caste. This is just another illustration of
the
complexity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000008">To
clarify the remarks that my honourable friend in the other place made

dismissal, but the claim of caste cannot be successfully brought. I

clarification.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000009">Let
me be clear about the Government’s position. We accept that the

legislation is the right

Government. I would like to say to him and to other
noble Lords, particularly those who are in favour of the amendment,
that I recognise the scepticism that has been expressed by them and
their concern as to whether the Government will act. I see that this
issue has been around for a certain length of time and I agree with the
point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, that it is because the
Government have listened very hard to the points that have been made by
noble Lords in this House that we have actually taken additional steps

what additional work is necessary so that we can reach a decision. The
Government have committed themselves to carrying out a full public
consultation. I have made clear—and am happy to do so
again—that we will make the findings of the consultation
available to the Equality and Human Rights Commission before it reaches
its own conclusions and makes recommendations to the Government. I have
said today that if the commission makes a firm recommendation to
legislate, that recommendation would be a key element informing the
Government’s decision. I cannot go any further than that, as my
noble friend Lord Deben has said, but I very much take on board that by
making that clear and asking noble Lords to accept my reassurance, and
the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, to withdraw his
amendment, I am asking the House to have great confidence and faith in
what I am saying.</hs_para>

important. My noble friend Lord Deben queried a point that I made in my
opening remarks, about what he called the cost argument. I think he is
right: there are bound to be some issues to do with cost and I am not
saying that the Government should not be aware of them. That is not
important. What is important is recognising that this problem is real,
that there needs to be action to address it and that the Government are
prepared to act, but we need to ensure that we do this in the right way
and that we consider all the issues before we act, not afterwards. For
that reason, I hope very much that the noble and right reverend Lord,
Lord Harries, is able to withdraw his amendment and the House accepts
the Motion that the Government have put

Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> I thank the Minister again for the
great care, thought and seriousness with which she has addressed this
issue this evening and on other occasions, and the way in which the
Government have clearly moved quite a long way in the direction of the
supporters of the amendment. I thank all noble Lords for what they have
contributed. I also pay tribute to those outside this House who believe
that they are discriminated against, who have ensured that we have had
this serious debate this
evening.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000014">In his
thoughtful speech, the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, said that the issue of
caste was so wide that ill founded complaints of discrimination would
arise. He gave the example of himself from a goldsmith background
perhaps not employing somebody from a blacksmith background and this
being the subject of a complaint. But I cannot see that this would be
essentially different 
<?notus-xml column=1320?>from other areas of discrimination; for instance, a woman might complain
that she is discriminated against because she is a woman and a tribunal
would have to make up its mind whether it was because she was a woman
or she simply was not up to the job. The situation is absolutely no
different. The noble Lord then said that caste is such a wide concept
that it really cannot be included in legislation at all. What about the
example of India, which includes in its constitution the fact that
caste discrimination is totally contrary to the legal
system?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000015">The
noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, suggested that people in the third and
fourth generations are not aware of their caste and, as it were, have
outgrown it. I have to point out that that is not the evidence that the
NIESR found. It found that there was bullying going on in school
playgrounds on the basis of caste. The noble Baroness, Lady Flather,
also mentioned coming across it when she was a teacher—sadly, it
has not
gone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000016"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T22:09:20"></hs_TimeCode>The

sorry—we are old friends; we know each other from previous

Government have in mind a wide-ranging consultation to decide whether
legislation is necessary. Many of us are convinced that it is and that
the consultation needed should be more sharply focused to ensure that
the actual regulation that goes with it reflects what the communities
most affected by it believe will be clear and workable in
law. There is a clear difference between the kind of consultation that
we have in mind and that the Government have in mind. We believe that
it is important at this date to make it quite clear that legislation is

Younger of Leckie</Member></B><B> </B>My Lords, this is an issue that
has already been debated in some detail. Noble Lords will recall that
the Government were nearly successful in persuading the House to accept
the vote on Report, losing by the smallest of margins—indeed, by
just two votes. Nevertheless I reassure noble Lords that the Government
have listened to and carefully considered both the extensive arguments
made, and the heartfelt concerns expressed, about the possible effects
of this change. However, the Government feel strongly that a measure to
reassure business is necessary, and the other place clearly endorsed
that view by a majority of 75 when it voted on this issue last
week.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000024">This
measure is one of a number of reforms designed to address the much
wider issue of the perception of a compensation culture and the fear of
being sued that this generates. It is a fear that drives employers to
overimplement the law, incurring unnecessary costs, and that undermines
their confidence to grow and develop their businesses. It is a problem
that I believe we all recognise needs to be tackled, and one that we
have not only considered in relation to this clause but, as many noble
Lords will recall, debated in some detail in relation to my noble
friend Lord Young of Graffham’s 
<?notus-xml column=1324?>report <I>Common Sense, Common Safety</I>. It is because of this wider
context and its detrimental effect that the Government remain of the
view that it is not reasonable or fair that employers should be held
liable to pay compensation when they have done nothing wrong and taken
all reasonable steps to protect their employees.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1304239000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000025">We acknowledge that this
reform will involve changes in the way that health and safety-related
claims for compensation are brought and run before the courts. However,
to be clear and to avoid any misunderstanding that may have arisen,
this measure does not undermine core health and safety standards. The
Government are committed to maintaining and building on the UK’s
strong health and safety record. The codified framework of
requirements, responsibilities and duties placed on employers to
protect their employees from harm are unchanged, and will remain
relevant as evidence of the standards expected of employees in future
civil claims for negligence.</hs_para>

the clause provides for a power to make exceptions. It is already
planned to make such an exception in respect of pregnant workers in
order to comply with the terms of the relevant EU directive. We have
thought carefully about whether there are more exceptions that should
be made at this stage, but have not identified any other examples.
However, I assure the House that we will seriously consider any further
exceptions that are suggested.</hs_para>

providing the reassurance that businesses need to overcome their fear
of being sued, we need to take decisive action that will send a clear
and effective message. The Government believe that the proposed single
amendment to the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act achieves this by
providing a consistent approach to civil litigation across all health
and safety legislation, which will be simple for both employers and
employees to understand.</hs_para>

detail, I should also explain that amendments regarding the words
“so restored to the Bill” have the effect of reinstating
government amendments agreed without objection in Grand Committee.
These amendments were made to comply with the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee recommendation to remove a new
regulation-making power that had been inserted as proposed new Section
47(2B) of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. The Government
reflected on the committee’s comments and accepted that it was
not necessary to take such a power, as there are no current plans to
extend the policy to other legislation.</hs_para>

Report, noble Lords expressed concerns in support of deleting the part
of the clause that removed this right of action. In short, these
reasons or concerns were, first, that the current law is settled and
well understood; secondly, that the law achieves a fair balance between
the respect of the rights of employers and employees; thirdly, that no
rights should be removed from citizens unless there are sound and
justifiable reasons for doing so; and, finally, the consequences of
this change for employees and their families would result in injustice
and were unacceptable. These concerns were clear from the <I>Official
Report</I><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T22:30:46"></hs_TimeCode></I>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000034">I
seek your support for the amendment in my  name for three
principal reasons. The first is that, despite the obvious concerns of
noble Lords, the Minister in the other place failed to address those
concerns and the reasons for Amendment 38. Moreover, the Commons has
given no reasons for rejecting Amendment 38. I appreciate that the
procedure in the Commons may have contributed to that difficulty, but
this House is entitled to a consideration of its reasons and to know
what the House of Commons’s reasons are for disagreeing with
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000035">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T22:31:50"></hs_TimeCode>
second reason is that it is the undisputed effect of Clause 61 that it
will deprive some people of any remedy for injury caused to them or
their deceased relatives. On 14 January, at col. GC176, the Minister
acknowledged that to be the case. It is impossible for anyone to
specify the nature of the injuries in cases that will no longer qualify
for compensation or to quantify the number of such cases. However, it
is not fanciful to imagine that some of the cases where a remedy is
denied will involve fatalities or accidents resulting in catastrophic
injuries. I say that it is not fanciful because at col. 236 of the
debate in the other place on 16 April, Mr Andy McDonald cited three
cases from his own experience. The first involved a fatality and the
other two resulted in catastrophic injuries. All three cases succeeded
because injury was caused by a breach of regulations, and that was
established. Equally, though, none of those cases would have succeeded
at common law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T22:33:09"></hs_TimeCode>.
These cases illustrate that some people who have suffered catastrophic
injuries, or the families of employees who have been killed, will be
forced to depend upon state benefits rather than receive compensation
reflecting past and future loss of wages and any special needs
resulting from their injuries. The financial burden will thus be shared
between 
<?notus-xml column=1326?>widowers, children, the permanently disabled and the state and
transferred from insurance companies, which will be the principal
beneficiaries of this
clause<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T22:33:45"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
manifestly unjust when the cause of the injury will have been the
employer’s breach of statutory regulations, which are designed
to protect employees from injury or
death<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T22:34:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000036">The
third reason in support of this amendment is that we should not deprive
citizens of existing rights unless there are overwhelming reasons for

claims for workplace accidents are on the decline. The perception is
misguided. The solution is to dispel such a perception by information

Faulks:</Member></B> My Lords, I was unable to attend previous debates
on this clause but I have had an opportunity of reading what was said
in your Lordships’ House and in the most recent debate on the
amendment in the other place last week. I declare an interest as a
practising barrister with experience in this area of the law and as a
former special adviser to the last Government on an inquiry into the
compensation
culture.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000044">Noble
Lords, and particularly the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, in a number of
thoughtful contributions to the debate, suggested that to legislate on
the mere perception of a compensation culture was to do so based on a
“flimsy structure”. He accepted that there had been a
problem of overcompliance with health and safety but he said that there
was now a problem with undercompliance. I am unsure of the basis for
this last assertion and it is not reflected by the report of Professor
Löfstedt or by the report two years ago by my noble friend Lord
Young of Graffham.
Both<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T22:42:26"></hs_TimeCode> identified
a perception of a compensation culture, as did the report produced by
Parliament when I was a special adviser. This cannot be dismissed on
the basis that to respond to it is simply to pander to myths. There is
a strongly negative effect on employers and indeed on schools and local
authorities which feel the need to set up elaborate systems to combat
largely hypothetical risks. Overcompliance costs time and money and
makes it more expensive and less attractive to employ anyone,
particularly for small- and medium-sized enterprises.</hs_para>

to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to protect the health and
safety of employees, but at the same time employers should not be
overburdened with unnecessary and elaborate bureaucracy which can be
the enemy of enterprise. I accept that this is a very difficult target
to hit and I confess to being a little nervous about how much is left
to regulation. However, I feel much more confident in saying that the
debate, principally in the other place, was positively riddled with
hyperbole. Both there and in your Lordships’ House the
Opposition Front Bench used the expression “a near impossible
burden” when describing the prospects of a claimant bringing a
successful action for injuries at work. I simply do not accept that. A
breach of a regulation will be regarded as strong prima facie evidence
of negligence. Judges will need some persuasion that the departure from
a specific and well-targeted regulation does not give rise to a claim
in negligence.</hs_para>

regulations are sensible, comprehensible and can be effectively
interpreted both by employers and the courts but this is not always the
case. For example, the Management of Health and Safety at Work
Regulations 1992 were revoked and re-enacted by similar regulations in
1999. Originally they did not give rise to a civil course of
action—they now do. The regulations are extraordinarily wide and
extraordinarily vague and seem to require extremely elaborate
arrangements, ostensibly for health and safety purposes, in particular
as to risk assessments. What a risk assessment is and how you prove you
have done an appropriate one is problematic. It seems to require quite
a number of employees simply to be devoted to compliance with the
regulations rather than actually doing the underlying
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000047">It was

I am afraid that I do not agree with the burden of those comments. Nor
are the Government seeking to turn back the clock a hundred years.
Rather, these provisions are a response to an overreaction to an
entirely appropriate aim which is to ensure health and safety at work.
The problem of overreaction is having a negative effect on enterprise.

Pannick:</Member></B> My Lords, I supported the noble Baroness, Lady
Turner of Camden, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, on
Report, and I continue to do so. The Minister said earlier in this
debate that we are considering cases where the employer has done
nothing wrong. With great respect, that is a fundamental
misunderstanding. The employer is liable only if the claimant can prove
a breach of health and safety legislation. The employer is liable only
if the claimant can prove that the breach has caused the injury. To
require the employee also to prove negligence would impose an
unreasonable burden. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord
Faulks, that it is not an 
<?notus-xml column=1329?>impossible burden. However, I suggest that it is an unreasonable burden
because the relevant information will normally be information in the
knowledge of the employer, and the costs and delay of the
litigation—a point which the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, did not
mention—would surely be disproportionate in all these
circumstances to any legitimate interest, especially when the reality
is that the employer can, and normally does, have liability insurance.

some circumstances it has been accepted, I believe, that there is a
near-impossible burden. That is not necessarily the case, but even the
route to proving negligence is a greater burden than the route to
proving breach of statutory duty, which is what operates generally at
the moment. The “near-impossible burden” description was
particularly applied to those 
<?notus-xml column=1330?>areas where strict liability applies in circumstances related to the
provision of equipment, where purchased, maintained and sourced by the
employer, and the employee is in a disadvantaged position in seeking to

impact assessment recites the belief in a compensation culture which is
having an impact on the behaviour of business. However, even if true,
why on earth should it be a justification for reducing access to
justice for employees injured or made ill by their work? This cannot be
a rational basis for acting. Why should employees bear the strain of
tackling these perceptions? Where is the evidence that unreasonable
claims are being made and indeed settled? If there are fewer claims,
the beneficiaries, as we have heard, will be the insurance companies,
the providers of employer liability insurance. Where the Government are
particularly remiss is in failing to see this from the perspective of
the individuals who are injured at work, because one way or another
they and their families will bear an increased burden. They may be
forced to place greater reliance on the health, caring and benefits
system. What does the Minister say to those families whose
circumstances may have been eased by receiving compensation but who
face a life on benefits in the future? Health and safety impacts on the
lives of millions of individual employees every day of the

some overcompliance with health and safety requirements, but there are
ways that this can and is being tackled. The register for consultants

undercompliance. The noble Lord, Lord Faulks, asks what my evidence is
for that. Let us look at the data. People are still being killed at
work and hundreds of thousands of people are injured every year. I
spent three and a half years as Minister for health and safety. We know
those sectors where there is a struggle to get compliance. It does not
operate across the board. There are some very good employers who try to
do the decent thing, but there are some who do not. This
undercompliance has been made worse by restrictions on funding, by
limiting the regulator’s role in proactive workplace
inspections, and by the portrayal of health and safety as red tape and
its undermining by myths that bear no relation to
reality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T22:53:11"></hs_TimeCode>.
Promoting the changes in Clause 61 will also send the wrong message to
those employers who would undervalue health and safety and cut corners,
safe in the knowledge that their chances of being held to account are
diminished. This is to the detriment not only of employees but of those
many employers who do the right thing.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, I have again listened with
interest to the arguments made and thank noble
Lords for their careful consideration of this very important issue. I
start by challenging the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, and the
noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, on whether there is a compensation
culture<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T22:54:48"></hs_TimeCode>. The
noble and learned Lord raised that point. I clarify again that my noble
friend Lord Young and Professor Löfstedt underlined that health
and safety regulations, more than any other area of regulation, suffer
from misinformation and overcomplication in the media and elsewhere. I
was grateful for the intervention by my noble friend Lord Faulks on
this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T22:55:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000059">As
Professor Löfstedt found in his independent review, these myths
lead to confusion about what the law requires and a fear of being sued
which drives employers to overimplement the law in an effort to protect
themselves. This does not lead to better protection for employees but
means that employers are spending significant time and resources on
activities and services which are not necessary or far in excess of
what the law requires. Concern about “getting it wrong”
discourages employers from looking at ways to develop and grow their
business and consequently from taking on new employees. I reiterate to
the House that this is a real issue and that there is a perception in
this regard. We believe as a Government that we should be tackling
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000060">The noble
and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, referred to certain cases which were
raised in the other place by the honourable Member for Middlesbrough.
We have been able to check the facts of two of those cases. In both of
them there is prima facie evidence of negligence on the part of the
employer. We would expect that such cases would still be brought as
negligence claims if brought after this amendment to the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act. It is important to clarify that
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000061">The
noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, mentioned removing the right to
compensation and depriving families of it in the event of an
employer’s breach of statutory duties. The Government’s
view is that it is fair and reasonable that this burden should be
removed from an employer who has done nothing wrong. The fact that
someone has been injured at work does not mean that they are
automatically entitled to compensation. Ours is not a no-fault system.
Many health and safety duties require the injured employee to show
fault on the part of their employer. It is interesting to note that
currently claimants do not recover compensation in about 30% of
claims.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000062">There
can be cases of misfortune to which I alluded on Report, which cannot

noble Lord, Lord Pannick, spoke of the burden of proof shifting to the
employee, as he put it, being unreasonable. However, the cases that
will be most significantly affected by this change are those which
would have previously relied on an absolute or strict liability duty.
Under the existing system, employees have to prove that their employer
breached the standard required in the regulations and that the breach
caused 
<?notus-xml column=1332?>the injury. In practice, the issues and evidence that will need to be
examined in relation to a claim for negligence will be similar to those
currently examined in relation to a claim for breach of a duty which is

noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, said that a different approach
had been taken to Professor Löfstedt’s recommendation.
The Government agreed with Professor Löfstedt’s
recommendation in principle, recognising the unfairness which results
where employers are liable to pay compensation regardless of having
taken all reasonable steps, and agreed to look at ways to redress the
balance. Excluding civil liability only in relation to specific strict
liability offences would mean making a large number of amendments to
more than 200 regulations and could result in different approaches to
civil liability being applied within a single set of regulations and
across the regulatory framework. This would add a layer of complexity
to the current system leading to greater uncertainty for both employers
and employees about the duties that apply in respect of compensation
claims. Making a single amendment to the Health and Safety at Work etc.
Act has the significant advantage of delivering a consistent approach
across all health and safety
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T22:59:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000065">I
reiterate that this reform is not about reducing  the number of
claims made, but about establishing  the important principle
that employers should always have the opportunity to defend themselves
against a compensation claim when they have done nothing wrong and have
taken all reasonable precautions to protect their employees. By
providing the reassurance that they will not be liable if an accident
happens which is totally outside their control, this change will
support responsible employers who take care to protect their employees
by giving them the confidence not only to take sensible steps to manage
health and safety risks but also to expand their businesses into
new areas and activities and to take on new employees to
achieve this. The Government believe this to be
a fair and proportionate response to the impact
that strict liability duties currently have in the civil litigation

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, on Report we debated the
amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, on letting
and managing agents. I made it clear then that the Government could not
accept her amendment but that we were giving most serious consideration
to the issue of redress. The noble Baroness confirmed that it was a
redress mechanism that she was seeking in her
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000200" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000200">The
Government have given serious consideration to these issues. We have
considered reports by the Office of Fair Trading, <I>Which?</I>, the
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and others, and we have
listened carefully to the debate here and indeed in the other place.
The Government recognise that the fact that not all agents belong to a
redress scheme has been an issue of growing concern. We are satisfied
that making this a requirement would provide both the means of
addressing complaints when things go wrong, and a means to improve
service quality across these important parts of the housing
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000201" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000201">Providing
access to redress would deal with many of the failings that people are
concerned about in their day to day dealings with letting managing
agents. At the same time, the existing consumer protection and
leasehold legislation remains in place and is already available, and is
indeed used for the more serious
matters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000202" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000202">Having
listened to the concerns raised most specifically in this House by the
noble Baroness, Lady Hayter,  and others, including my noble
friend Lady Gardner, the Government have introduced in the other
place  an amendment in lieu of the amendment tabled by 
the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter. The government amendment gives powers
to require letting and managing agents of privately rented and
residential leasehold homes to belong to a redress scheme. It gets to
the heart of what the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, was seeking, but
without subjecting letting and managing agents to the additional layers
of regulation that are in the Estate Agents Act and on which her
amendment was
based.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304239000203" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-0003.htm#1304239000203">I am

Government’s approach has also been welcomed by key
organisations. For example, the National Approved Letting Scheme
welcomed it as a common-sense approach to improving the consumer
experience of renting and letting, and a sensible alternative to the
heavy handed bureaucracy of a formal regulatory regime. Similarly, the
National Landlords Association has endorsed the Government’s
approach of meeting the challenge of

has mentioned, such as <I>Which?</I>, Shelter and RICS, which have
given me a lot of help not only in drafting but in the persuasion, if I
may say, of this House and then the Government, who perhaps were a
little reluctant to start with but have made a very large step forward.

the professional organisations to which some of these bodies

an ombudsman will decide a case. That is perhaps a backdoor way to the
adoption of a code, but is very welcome for all that.</hs_para>

made a big difference, particularly when we have had various
round-table meetings. People have adopted the attitude that they want
to look into things further. We have been given hopes that that they
will look into everything much further later in the year, and I will be
pressing that in my questions. As you know, I am particularly

Dykes:</Member></B> My Lords, I am most grateful to the usual channels
for the opportunity of launching this vital debate today. Sadly, I have
to say at once that the rather controversial and rather expensive
funeral event last Wednesday provides a sombre memorial to this theme,
recalling to all of us the negative attitudes towards Europe of someone
who was—again, I feel sad about saying this—one of the
most rebarbative Prime Ministers in Britain’s post-war
history.</hs_para>

present Prime Minister, however, was obliged to call off visits to EU
capitals to discuss some changes in our links to the rest of the member
states. It is very self-defeating if leading Tory Ministers and
politicians refer to the over-repeated phrase “British national
interest” as if that were wholly different from our membership
of the Union and totally different from that of all the other members.
At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T15:32:10"></hs_TimeCode> least the
late-interred Prime Minister ended up usually agreeing with the others
on treaty changes, despite all the Sturm und Drang in those days of
shrill arguments. Mr Cameron, however, is now in danger of launching a
risky plan which is designed to appease his wilder anti-EU MP
colleagues, and which could quickly get out of control.</hs_para>

also looks somewhat hilarious if a British politician starts trying to
educate our German friends on the goals of economic and mercantile
efficiency, bearing in mind the huge gulf in our economic performance.
We have a UK trade deficit of around £100 billion, despite a
quarter fall in the value of sterling over the past four years.
Germany’s trade surplus is the other way round, but even bigger.
We should all be grateful to the German ambassador for his polite but
riveting comments at Bloomberg’s last July on the dangers
inherent in irresponsible isolation and to Dr. Rudolph Adam, the
plenipotentiary at the moment. He complained to William Hague’s
assistant last October that Britain’s refusal to take a lead in
Europe meant that we would just see the red lights of the train that
has already left the station.</hs_para>

alarmed at this possible Cameron demarche. I refer to very prominent
business leaders such as Richard Branson, Martin Sorrell

Government intervened collectively and individually to say,
“Please do not go down this path”. Former EU and US
British envoys such as Sir Nigel Sheinwald have taken this approach.

never a weakness for any country, struggling as we are with our
economic problems in an exposed position, to pay attention to what
others think of us. Sadly, we have to recall, painfully, the derision
which many mainland Europeans felt when we were first driven
out of the exchange rate mechanism on 16 September 1992 as the Treasury
was unable to keep the pound from falling below the agreed minimum
level. We then became so scared at the huge obligation and discipline
involved in a single currency that we effectively decided not to join
at all, despite Tony Blair’s
pretences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T15:34:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042212000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042212000008">We
have to recall, therefore, the huge disappointment of the other members
in other areas. We received the unique budget rebate but did not then
become more co-operative on other areas of European endeavour, despite
that unusual privilege. We have to recall the irritation, too, when we
sought the biggest number of opt-outs and exclusions when Maastricht
and the later treaties, including Lisbon, came along.</hs_para>

cause when a UK Minister arrives for a Council of Ministers meeting is
palpable. We have become the bad member of the club, whingeing and
moaning about European things again and again. One of the dottiest
reasons for this irrational behaviour is because an unusually large
number of old-fashioned nationalist Tory MPs are the only politicians I
know—apart from some of the scallywags in UKIP, many of whom
benefit from the PR system for the European Parliament—who have
a notion of national sovereignty which is, literally, at least 100
years out of date.</hs_para>

positive Europeans have to remind such people that pooling sovereignty
by way of signing unanimous treaties, achieved by consensus, is not a
loss of real sovereignty, it is an increase? We have done it in other
treaties, to no ill effect, all over the world. It is quite
extraordinary and myopic that a false pride in our so-called special
relationship and so-called hyperbolic link with the US can induce
British leaders such as Mr Blair, Mr Brown and, indeed, the present
Prime Minister, to go into rather questionable military
adventures—which we usually later regret—but also cause
us to suffer hot flushes when confronted with a perfectly sensible
measure of EU co-operation such as a new financial support system
between the central banks. They were watching our reactions very
closely at that time.</hs_para>

to emphasise the muddle, Mr Cameron seeks to remind us that he wants
after all to stay in the Union. Before we irritate the others to the
extent that they muse again about the Lisbon treaty provisions allowing
for recalcitrant member states to leave if they wish, we really need
some clarification on these vital—indeed,
existential—matters.

symbolically too—as in Berlin and Madrid, and most other
capitals, the EU flag flies proudly alongside the national tricolour.
They do not feel the one cancels out the other. The UK is the only

the report of sub-committees E and F of the EU Select Committee showing
the huge weight of non-political evidence that abandoning the JHA
provisions, or the principal ones, in most of the specific policy areas
such as EAW, would be a monumental disaster. I will refrain from
commenting too much on what Kenneth Clarke said at the end of January
on these matters. How the Prime Minister must now  
<?notus-xml column=290?>regret the way in which the Government, including when they were in
opposition, have encouraged the most Europhobic MPs to fuel this
anti-EU strategy with the business community outside—although
not many leading businessmen are now still involved—to the
extent that it is even becoming part of future leadership moves by some
ambitious new Tory MPs. The bitterness felt by the EPP in Brussels and

the way in which the banks behaved and the speculative spivery
background of some people in the City offend some of our continental

from them, I commend in this context the lengthy but convincing last
two paragraphs of the speech by the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, the chief

other member state agrees with our peculiar attitudes, these

Howe of Aberavon:</Member></B> For pretty well all of our 40-year
membership of the Union, successive British Governments have sought to
maintain a position of strength for this country at the top table of
the European Union politics. Whatever opportunities may have been
missed and whatever mistakes might have been made, a common thread
throughout the period has been that consistently Prime Ministers and
Foreign Secretaries attempted to avoid the development of anything
approaching a two-speed Europe. We have accepted opt-outs and
derogations in specific cases, but we have never allowed Britain to
lose its place at the heart of EU decision-making, although we have
been sliding away from the centre.</hs_para>

Cameron’s first acts as Prime Minister was to decline to attend
eurozone summits, whereas his predecessor, Gordon Brown, not exactly a
noted Euro-enthusiast, fought tenaciously to ensure that he was always
invited. Our absence has made it more difficult to articulate
Britain’s voice on some of the key decisions in the eurozone
debt crisis. I do not need to spell out at great length my anxiety
about the imminent shift in responsibility for banking supervision, for
example, from the traditional EU institutions in Brussels to the
European Central Bank in Frankfurt, based on a new banking union from
which we seem determined to exclude ourselves. It is worth recalling
that when the EU Act was debated here at Westminster, two years ago, we
were assured that it would have no operational effect in this
Parliament, yet we now know that fear of the need for the passage of an
Act of Parliament helps to explain why the Prime Minister vetoed the EU
treaty change that Mrs Merkel wanted in December 2011.</hs_para>

Quin:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord on securing
this debate. He has consistently advocated the importance of close
relations between ourselves and our European partners and has always
argued for making Britain’s membership a success, as has the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, whom it is a pleasure to
follow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T15:46:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042212000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042212000026">I
am not opposed at all to a Government arguing for change within the
European Union, nor am I opposed to wide public debate about that
issue, providing that it is well informed and open, because there is no
doubt that Europe is changing and has to respond to a large number of
challenges. However, I have great concerns about the
Government’s goals and the lack of clarity surrounding them. I
also have concerns about the timing of recent government initiatives,
which are sometimes unhelpful, particularly as they come at a time when
the eurozone countries are, quite understandably, concentrating on
trying to resolve current difficulties. I also have concern about the
Government’s approach to alliance-building, both
with  
<?notus-xml column=292?>other Governments and in the context of the European Parliament, where
the Government seem sadly to have cut themselves off from the European
mainstream<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T15:47:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042212000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042212000027">In
the short time that I have available, I would like to question the
Government about their goals. There is a lot of talk within the
Government, and within the Conservative Party particularly, about
having a looser relationship with the European Union. The more I read
about this, the less I understand exactly what is meant by it, and I
would like some clarification of what is in the Government’s
mind. For example, what does it mean for environmental policy, an area
that has become very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T15:47:40"></hs_TimeCode> in EU
work in recent years? What involvement do the Government expect to have
in that very important area of policy in future? What about economic
policy? It is not just about the euro but about many other
things. How are the Government going to approach this? For example, I
was disappointed recently that they managed to get themselves in a
minority of one over the bankers’ bonuses issue, even though it
is an issue that is of concern to citizens across the European Union.
What does it mean for development policy? Will we be involved in
development policy in future, in the Government’s view, or is
that something that they want to see left to national Governments? What
about the extent of foreign policy co-operation, an increasingly
important area within the European Union’s work?</hs_para>

we know that the Government said a lot of things in opposition to
social policy, which was a part of the EEC from the outset—so it
is not a dangerous additional add-on. I remember, when I was first in
Parliament, the warnings that the Government gave about what they
called the job-destroying social chapter, even though, after the Labour

senior officials and politicians from some of Europe’s major
countries as well as many of the world's leading investors and some
substantial business heads who can make investment choices about this

the summary report, perhaps online, or skim-read and form a quick

do not think he has yet done, and seek to counter the damaging

40 years the General Synod has affirmed that, while it has reservations
over certain characteristics of European integration—not least
its demographic deficit—our propensity as human beings created
in the image of God to be creative, productive and generous beings has
been enhanced by pooling certain elements of national sovereignty in a
common European project. This project, it is worth remembering, has

principle that powers can flow not only from member states to
institutions but the other way too, and that national parliaments
should become more closely involved in EU decision-making. However,
there remains a lingering doubt as to whether the Government’s

value of this debate is that it is a reminder of how much need there is

renewed vision for Europe and our own understanding of how we might
best realise it. The churches of Europe see themselves as very much
part of that debate and with much to contribute to it. They are deeply
embedded in European culture and, although we are distinct, it is still
possible and right to think of the family of churches in Europe in
terms of the historical embrace of a single faith. Even perhaps
particularly as Europe becomes increasingly characterised by the
diversity of faiths within it, our own long experience of interfaith
dialogue and co-operation has a valuable contribution to make to the
pursuit of that founding vision grounded in the common good.</hs_para>

at the top table of Europe any more. Well, when it came to the budget
negotiations the Prime Minister was very much at the top table in
encouraging the budget to be cut.</hs_para>

Bowness:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Dykes for
posing this timely question, which should concern everybody who wants
to see the UK remain a member of the European Union. That, of course,
includes my right honourable friend the Prime Minister who sought to
make that clear when he indicated his intention to attempt a
renegotiation of our relationship with Europe, to be followed by a
referendum on the outcome.</hs_para>

or not, that has put on the table the possibility of the UK leaving the
European Union with all the uncertainty that that creates in
people’s minds and the regrettable boost which has been given to
UKIP and its fellow travellers. Leaving to one side the question of a
referendum, which I personally regret, the UK has to have a twin-track
approach if there is to be anything approaching a successful outcome of
any negotiation and subsequent referendum. To achieve the first, we
have to be clear and realistic about what it is we seek to change. The
Government’s review of competences will not be complete until
the autumn of 2014. There have been press 
<?notus-xml column=297?>reports that at least two member states—France and
Germany—have refused to contribute to the process. Is that
correct? I do not expect my noble friend to disclose details of the
observations of individual member states but can she indicate whether
there have been any responses from anyone and, if so, the nature of
those responses?</hs_para>

seek to change prior to the outcome of the competences review and, if
so, what is the point of the competences review? Are Ministers looking
at matters which could be dealt with by an amendment of existing
European legislation? This may be a more productive route and likely to
find us more friends among other member states as opposed to treaty
change. If we seek treaty change for our benefit, shamelessly
exploiting the possible need for eurozone members to make changes for
the economic governance of the eurozone, how will we prevent the other
member states raising their own particular issues and how many will
welcome that process being turned into a wholesale treaty review? Might
they not prefer to come to their own arrangements not involving treaty
change and, therefore, maybe not involving the United Kingdom? If
substantial treaty change is in mind, how do the Government intend to

us to have influence within the European Union, whether in the Prime
Minister’s promised renegotiation or generally, the atmosphere
has to change. We must sound as if we want to remain members, that

have talked of actively discouraging citizens of Romania and Bulgaria

thereby created a climate whereby the desirability of having admitted
citizens from other EU member states after 2004 is now called into

nationals of other countries outside the EU, does not win allies,

we must follow if we are to succeed in convincing our partners that we

that we are not going to dance to UKIP’s tune. UKIP policy on
Europe is not the policy of the Conservative Party. The Tory party must
not allow itself to become an umbrella under which the otherwise
unelectable articulate UKIP views. In passing, would it not be a good
thing to change the system of election from closed lists

Lord Lamont and Lord Flight, telling us how the euro was about to
collapse and they had been right all along because they had been saying
for years that it was bound to collapse. I remember replying that they
slightly reminded me of the Marxists of the earlier 20th century who,
every time there was a recession said, “We were right all along;
this is the final crisis of capitalism”. I am not sure they

disaster to gloat over. The latest news is actually rather encouraging.
I am quite convinced that both the EU and the eurozone are emerging
strengthened from the crisis. It has been very positive to get the
growth and stability pact and to achieve the banking union. The
handling of the Cyprus banking crisis has been extremely successful. We
have established the principle now that there should be no bailout
without a bail-in. We have established the principle that anybody who
has more than €100,000 and wants to keep it all in one bank has
some responsibility to take a view on the creditworthiness of that bank
and, equally, that people who have less than €100,000 in
deposits should be protected by public guarantees. All that has been
very positive.</hs_para>

of us has very much time to speak, but I do not think that there is an
alternative to the EU for achieving what we need to achieve in this

to look very carefully now, because

leave the noble Lord with one thought this afternoon. It is time for us
to look pragmatically, coolly and calmly, without hysteria, at the
possible advantages to us of joining the Schengen agreement. It would
not merely remove a lot of the existing burden on the UK Border Agency,
which we have seen so much of in the past few months, but it would
address a much more serious problem. This country is losing hundreds of
thousands of pounds, perhaps even millions of pounds a year, in tourism
particularly from visitors from the Far East who tend to travel in
groups. Their travel agents arrange a Schengen visa for them. They come
to Europe and visit Amsterdam, they go down the Rhine and visit Paris,
Rome and Madrid. They have a lovely time, but they never come here

additional delays and costs to get visas.</hs_para>

congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, on securing this important
debate. I wish to confine my comments to an area where there have been
unintended consequences of European legislation—in the delivery
of healthcare here in our own country. This is a vital issue. As we
move forward, there may be an opportunity for British people to become
isolated because they feel that there is an impact on the delivery of
healthcare that was unintended and is having a detrimental effect.
Before doing so, I declare my own interest as Professor of Surgery at

number of issues have been raised with regard to European legislation
and directives that relate specifically to healthcare. They relate to
the area of professional qualifications and the free movement of labour
within the European Union. There has been important progress with the
issue of language testing. The General Medical Council, it is proposed,
will now be allowed to test the language skills of all doctors who wish
to be registered by the council in the future, including those who come

there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:13:36"></hs_TimeCode> is still
concern about the ability to test professional qualifications and the
nature and structure of the postgraduate training that has been 
<?notus-xml column=300?>delivered to healthcare professionals throughout the Union. This is an
important issue because doctors coming from other parts of the world
are subject to that kind of rigorous testing before they are allowed to

issue that I would like to focus on is the European working time
regulation. In 2010, when the coalition Government was formed, the then
Health Secretary committed to begin negotiations with the European
Union on ensuring that working time regulations could be applied in a
more flexible fashion with regard to working in our hospitals to
reflect the fact that the nature of the delivery of
healthcare—the structure of our hospitals and broader healthcare
environments—is somewhat different from other European
countries, and a degree of flexibility would be important.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:14:33"></hs_TimeCode> recall that
the then Health Secretary and the Business Secretary were to commence
discussions in January 2011 on this matter, but all seems to have gone

taking place.</hs_para>

need to be very sensitive to this issue. Recently we have started to
see coroners’ narrative verdicts starting to cite European
working time regulations as a contributory factor in patient death. We
have seen in the Francis report into the problems that were experienced
at Mid Staffordshire hospital that the working time regulation was
identified as a potential contributor to an inability to provide
continuity of care within the hospital system. These kinds of
descriptions in coroners’ verdicts and in important reports,
such as the Francis report, can cause unnecessary anxiety.</hs_para>

increasing pressure in the healthcare system, we need to be sensitive
to problems identified by, for instance, the Royal College of Surgeons,
which estimates that 400,000 surgical hours a month are lost from the
healthcare system as a result of the application of the working time
regulation to surgical rotas and that some £750 million a year
is now spent on locums to ensure that locum doctors can fill gaps in
those rotas. Equally, the Royal College of Physicians has identified
this whole area as a major issue for the delivery of
healthcare<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:16:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

like to ask the Minister what progress is being made with regard to the
discussion about the working time regulation. This was identified as
important on the basis of patient safety and the need to ensure
continuity of training to a high standard for our trainees, who will
lead the healthcare system in the future. It seems to have become mixed
up in the broader question of competences and of bringing them back
from Europe. If this issue is not addressed, there could be major
problems in the future that will be attributed to it and this could
have a detrimental impact on the public perception of Europe, because
health was never an issue of competence and this matter is specific to
the delivery of healthcare in the United Kingdom. Is the Minister able
to guarantee that this important discussion, which started long before,
will be continued in a timely

Coussins:</Member></B> My Lords, one of the underlying causes of the
UK’s isolation in the EU is our lack, as a nation, of the
foreign language skills to enable us to

educational benefits from membership. I declare an interest as chair of

languages.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042240000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042240000002">There
are three main ways in which our language skills deficit is damaging.
The first is in terms of influence. The Foreign Office itself has noted
that a shortage of British staff in international institutions is
detrimental to the national interest and undermines our policy
influence. UK nationals make up only 5% of the European Civil Service,
although we are more than 12% of the population. In 2011, a mere 2.6%
of applicants were from the UK—fewer than from any other member
state—and a key reason for this was that English-speaking
applicants must offer either French or German as a second
language.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042240000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042240000003">Secondly,
poor or non-existent language skills prevent UK nationals taking
advantage of labour mobility within the single market, while of course
leaving them open to competition from incomers. UK employers are
dissatisfied with the language skills of British graduates and end up
recruiting far more multilingual graduates from other EU countries than
employers from any other member state. Although this shows that the
single market is working well in terms of the free movement of people,
British workers are limited in their ability to take advantage of this
freedom in the opposite
direction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042240000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042240000004">This
is, of course, linked to export growth. The Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills noted recently that the proportion of the
UK’s exports to the other 26 member states is falling and now
stands at less than 50%. A considerable body of evidence now links
export growth to languages. Business leaders say that it is language
availability that drives export decisions, not market
strategy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042240000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042240000005">Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:19:08"></hs_TimeCode>,
UK participation in EU mobility programmes is worryingly low, yet this
is what equips people with the skills to work across borders. In 2011,
more than twice as many French and nearly four times as many Germans
took part in work experience placements within the EU. UK university
placements under the Erasmus programme are around one-third of those of
France and Germany.</hs_para>

to increase the number of UK nationals able to compete successfully for

Giddens:</Member></B> My Lords, like noble Lords here present, I have
been travelling widely across Europe over the past few months and
talking to a range of political leaders and academics. My reading of
the situation with regard to the UK is a bit different from that of
other noble Lords who have spoken because I think it is much more
serious and difficult for Britain than we imply from the speeches that
have been given hitherto. Being an academic, I shall express this in
terms of a number of steps of reasoning and ask the Minister to say
where the flaw in the argument lies because I do not see
one.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042240000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042240000009">It goes
in seven quick steps: first, the economy of the UK is heavily dependent
on that of the wider European Union and there is no chance of
diminishing that dependency in the short term. Secondly, saving the
euro and returning the eurozone to prosperity is of key importance to a
stable future for the EU and hence to the UK’s economic
fortunes. The collapse of the euro would have catastrophic consequences
for all of us. Thirdly, the euro cannot be saved without greater
European integration, including, at a minimum, some form of banking
union in the eurozone and, almost certainly, some sort of loose
federation for the EU as a whole down the line. Fourthly, you cannot
have greater integration and variable geometry at the same time because
they are mutually exclusive. This is the reason why our normal allies,
such as the Danes, gave such a tepid response to the Prime
Minister’s speech in January. Fifthly, the chances of treaty
change along the lines the Prime Minister wants to produce are
therefore, to my mind, pretty close to zero. The main reason is that
they are simply in the opposite direction to that in which Europe has
to travel if the eurozone is to be saved, and the eurozone must be
saved; at least, it must be stabilised in the short term as a minimum.
Sixthly, hence, if by some miraculous happenstance the Government win
the next election, the Prime Minister will be forced, when a referendum
is called, to campaign for a no vote. Seventhly, since the Prime
Minister says that he wants the UK to stay in Europe, this outcome can
be described in Shakespearian jargon

question of this debate takes as its premise that UK isolation is a bad
thing, but is that the case? In my role as chief executive of London
First, I talk to many business people who have given serious thought to
how a UK that is not part of the EU might fare. Some point to our
historic success factors—an open business culture, our time
zone, English law and the English language—none of which comes
from Europe. They question whether our membership really makes it
easier to do business in Europe than with, say, Norway. Further, they
argue that our focus should be on the emerging economies. Others
challenge 
<?notus-xml column=303?>the assumption that leaving the EU would damage London’s role as
a financial centre. Supposing the EU were, in effect, to shrink to the
eurozone, a new European financial centre would almost certainly
emerge, but with an inward-looking focus, and meanwhile the UK would
expand its global financial
role.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042240000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042240000011">However,
it seems to me that these views merely represent pragmatic ways of
dealing with a situation that few would actually welcome. Certainly,
business people complain about red tape and employment law emanating
from Brussels, but of those multinational companies that I speak to,
not one has advocated divergent regulation within Europe. Furthermore,
they understand the logic of negotiating global free trade agreements
from a base of 500 million people rather than 60 million. While the
need to shore up the euro necessitates reviewing relationships in
Europe, I have yet to meet a senior business figure who would actively
have sought a referendum at this

Europe remains a major trading partner for the UK. We must value and

competitive with the Americas and Asia. What the UK needs is friends to
make that point, rather than enemies who resent the Anglo-Saxon
business model. This is about tactics in Europe as much as whether one

lose its position but there are also European firms and member states

that we have lost sight of that reality? The challenges today demand
that same vision. Of course, there are weaknesses and huge flaws within

that Britain’s always turbulent relationship with the other
member states of the EU is not currently going through a more than
usually troubled phase, and for that reason, I thank the noble Lord,
Lord Dykes, for his initiative. The misguided attempt to veto a fiscal
Union treaty in December 2011, the balance of competence review, whose
purpose often seems obscure to its authors, let alone to most of the
other member states which treat it with deep suspicion, and the Prime
Minister’s reckless commitment, in my view, to an in/out
referendum in 2017 all contribute to a negotiating climate that could
easily end up negating the objective of establishing a more settled
relationship for a Britain firmly engaged as a full and fully
participating member of the European Union.</hs_para>

is such an outcome, which would be so damaging to Britain’s
national interest, to be avoided? First, we certainly cannot afford to
sit around waiting until we see the result of the 2015 general election
before embarking on a process of reform. Nor can we afford to found
such a process on the entirely false premise that the other member
states, particularly the members 
<?notus-xml column=305?>of the eurozone, are poised to embark on an overall rewrite of the
treaties, which would provide the opportunity for us to put forward a
wish list of our own. That will simply not happen any time soon, and
certainly not in the timescale envisaged by the Prime Minister. Nor can
any such process of reform afford to be based on a purely British list
of vetoes, red lines, no-go areas, items for repatriation or
renegotiation. We need a positive reform agenda which takes proper
account of the wishes and interests of other member states, and thus
has some chance of enlisting their support. That positive agenda needs
to enlist cross-party support in Britain; it must not be a ragbag of
items designed to appease the unappeasable in UKIP and the wilder
shores of Euroscepticism, neither of which forces has the slightest
interest in an approach that would leave Britain inside the European
Union<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:33:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

agenda be put together? I believe that it can but it would need to move
beyond the comfort zone of Britain’s traditional EU
agenda—completion of the single market, with stronger provisions
on services and a digital market, further enlargement and freer and
fairer world trade, valuable though those components continue to be. It
will need to include a more wholehearted embrace of a common foreign
and security policy and it should surely include, too, some
strengthening of the common security and defence policy to face up to
the impact of austerity on defence budgets. It should be focused on
policy reform rather than on institutional reform. There will, of
course, need to be some areas of increased flexibility in the operation
of an EU moving beyond the soon-to-be 28 member states. Variable
geometry is alive and well—here I rather disagree with the noble
Lord, Lord Giddens —and has been operated
successfully in Brussels since the end of the 1980s. We need only look
at Schengen, the eurozone, justice and home affairs opt ins and opt
outs. There will probably need to be more of that as the eurozone moves
to a more integrated economic and monetary union within a European
Union where there is still likely to be a substantial number of member
states not yet within the eurozone, nor likely to be so in the near
future. What needs to be avoided is making such a variable geometry the
main operating principle of the European Union—that would be to
sound the death knell of the single market; and to avoid, too, any
fixed group of inner and outer circles of member states, which would be
inherently unstable and unsustainable. It makes no practical sense
anyway, as Britain is an essential leading player in any strengthening
of common foreign security and common defence
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042250000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042250000004">If I
had one immediate plea, it would be for the Government to jettison
their silly and untrue slogan of wanting less Europe—untrue

it separates us from our natural allies in Germany, Sweden, the
Netherlands, and in central and eastern Europe, who will never march
into battle under the banner of “less Europe”. Shaping

Jay of Ewelme:</Member></B> My Lords, it is perhaps worth remembering
that the EU has three great achievements to its credit: it brought
cohesion to western Europe after World War 2; it provided east and
central Europe with a democratic home after the collapse of the Soviet
Union; and it has created an almost but not yet complete single market
of some 500 million people. All those greatly benefit Britain and the
rest of the EU. The second and third of those owe a great deal to the
influence exerted by successive British Prime Ministers and
Governments, including on enlargement, and here I differ
slightly from the view of the noble Lord, Lord Dykes and of Lady
Thatcher.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042250000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042250000006">The
EU now has no such great forward-looking project. Indeed, in creating
the euro, it has created huge, although not—and I agree with the
noble Baroness, Lady Valentine—insurmountable problems for
itself, brought on and exacerbated by the financial crisis. I believe
we were right not to join the euro, but we also benefit hugely from the
single market of 27 member states. Therefore, our interest as a nation
surely lies in the maintenance of a coherent European Union of
27 or 28, with the euro at its core and the single market
intact. That is easy to say but it is not a straightforward goal to
achieve. There are strains between the eurozone and the rest, and
within the eurozone, not least at present between Germany and France.
Achieving that goal, crucial to our interest, will require patience,
determination, tough negotiations and compromise, because negotiations
always do require that. It will, above all, require maximising our
influence, which we should never underestimate.</hs_para>

in Paris and elsewhere in the EU that Britain’s traditions of a
liberal market economy, an international outlook and democratic
strength are really needed in the EU, and the more the EU is in
difficulty, the more, frankly, those qualities are needed. I fear,
however, that we are also not alone in sensing that some at least in
the EU seem increasingly to have given up on us, sensing that there is
no longer a commitment in Britain to the European Union at a time when
our contribution in our own interest, as well as in the interest of the

our influence and our interests: state clearly our commitment to an EU

key member states; and in that framework fight hard for British
interests. As it is sometimes said, if you are not at the table, you

assumption lying behind our present predicament is that, because of the

in Europe as France and Germany. I think that that assumption is
flawed. I am sceptical about whether the steps necessary to save the

key thing is that we present a positive vision for the future of the

is the need to demonstrate the role of the European Union in tackling
the big long-term challenges that all our European societies face,
including innovation, climate change, demography and inequality. On
innovation, we should be pressing for more co-operative research. On
climate change, there is an urgent need to do something about the
minimum carbon price. The failure in the European Parliament last week
was extremely significant. We cannot have a credible national climate
change policy without a complementary European
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:43:19"></hs_TimeCode>. On
demography, we should be talking about how we manage the challenges of
migration, rather than making cheap points about benefits to Britain.
On inequality, we should look again at how we use European legislation
to strengthen a more Germanic model of responsible
capitalism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:43:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042250000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042250000013">Thirdly,
there is the crucial role that the EU can play in the world. We heard a
lot in the aftermath of Margaret Thatcher’s death about how she
put the “Great” back into Britain. But given that we
account in our changing world for about 2% of world GDP, which will be
our position in about 10 years’ time, the idea that Great
Britain can on its own influence the world is for the birds.
We have to do it through the European Union; that is the only way in
which we can protect our essential values and interests, and that is
what I believe a Labour Government would try to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042250000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042250000014">Along<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:44:42"></hs_TimeCode>
with that would have to be sensible institutional reforms. A belief in
a stronger EU in some areas is not an argument for a more centralised
EU. Powers should 
<?notus-xml column=308?>flow in both directions—the Prime Minister is right about
that—and we should look at the present acquis to see what can be
got rid of, as well as arguing for political reform that makes Brussels
more accountable both to the European Parliament and to national
Parliaments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:45:12"></hs_TimeCode>. But
the fundamental point is that this has to be an agenda of reform, not
of unilateral negotiation of some special deal for Britain, which is
really a blind
alley<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:45:25"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:45:27"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-22T16:45:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042250000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042250000015">I
shall finish by asking the Minister two questions. Will she take this
opportunity to rule out once and for all on behalf of the Government
that there are any conceivable circumstances, if they should be in
power after the next election, in which they would recommend withdrawal

Senior Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local
Government &amp; Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness
Warsi):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord
Dykes, on securing this important debate. Our discussions on this
subject are timely as the Government continue to work effectively with
partners across the EU to agree on practical, pragmatic reforms that
are good for the UK and the European Union. I hope that the noble Lord,
Lord Liddle, realises that in that statement I have probably answered
his second question.</hs_para>

friend Lord Howe of Aberavon is right to say that the UK needs a
positive vision. I believe that we have one. The Prime Minister has set
out his vision for keeping the UK at the heart of a reformed EU. It is
a vision of a more competitive, adaptable and flexible EU with a strong
mandate from the citizens of the EU. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Birt,
for his positive comments and assure him that the Prime
Minister’s approach is one of reform and commitment, not of
obstruction and exit. Unfortunately I disagree with much of what the
noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said, but I can assure him that policy reform
is a key element of the Prime Minister’s speech, and I agree
that the European Union is about much more than just a single market.
There is more that we can do to make the common foreign and security
policy more effective and to step up the agenda on enlargement, trade
development and other matters.</hs_para>

Jay, referred specifically to a coherent EU of 27 members. I believe
that the Prime Minister has set out his vision that tries to address
that, based on boosting the competitiveness of the EU as a whole and
ensuring fairness for those inside the eurozone and also for those
outside it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042262000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000004">I
shall return to the original question raised by the noble Lord, Lord
Dykes. His question is quite clear; I want to be equally clear in my
response. The UK has not been, and is not, isolated in the European
Union. The proposals the Prime Minister has set out for reforming the
EU ensure that this remains the case. This view is shared by others.
The responses of many of our European partners to the Prime
Minister’s speech in January acknowledged the key role the UK
plays in the life of the EU.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=309?><hs_para UID="13042262000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000005">Many also agree on the
need for reforms: countries such as Portugal, Sweden, Austria and
Estonia have all said so recently. The Netherlands, Finland, Hungary,
Portugal, Belgium and the Czech Republic have all said that they too
want a more flexible, diverse and democratic European Union. The Prime
Minister of Italy at the time, Mario Monti, said he shared the Prime
Minister’s opinion that prosperity and growth must be
Europe’s priority. Noble Lords can see that the idea of the UK
being isolated from partners such as these who are on the record as
agreeing with the importance of our reform agenda does not stand up to
scrutiny.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042262000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000006">The
supportive words of our European partners are valuable, but I want to
talk about actions, not words. I ask noble Lords whether an isolated
member of the EU could achieve the scale of progress we have recently
achieved in reform-focused decisions across so many EU policy areas.
The Government have, as usual, been busy, influential and successful.
Let me share with you some examples. The noble Baroness, Lady Quin,
asked specific questions on policy areas, and I hope that some of these
examples will answer those questions. Last December, we worked with
partners such as France and Germany to secure an agreement on banking
union which preserved the integrity of the single market. In February
this year, we led efforts to finalise a deal on a unified patent court
which will reduce costs for businesses and encourage innovation. Just
last month, we worked with other states including Denmark, Germany,
Sweden and the Netherlands to abolish the policy of discarding caught
fish as part of a wholesale reform of the common fisheries
policy.</hs_para>

delivered the first ever cut in the multiannual financial framework.
This is an excellent example of how we have worked with our European
partners. Few were happy with the idea of reducing the budget when we
started negotiations, but we worked hard to form a coalition and
persuaded all member states to agree a good deal for European
taxpayers. In the European Union, you cannot reach agreements like
those with 26 partners if you are unsupported and isolated.</hs_para>

recently announced their decision to pursue negotiations on a free
trade agreement. It is influential member states such as the UK which
drive this process behind the scenes. Such agreements are of critical
importance to growth and prosperity across Europe and the United
Kingdom.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042262000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000009">In
2011, we concluded a free trade agreement with South Korea. Last year,
we reached agreement with Singapore. This year, the UK is continuing to
play its usual leading role as we come close to concluding talks with
Canada. If we completed all of the negotiations on agreements currently
on the table, it would be worth an additional €60 billion for
the EU every year, according to the European Commission. From free
trade to fisheries reform, from banking union to bailout rules, we
continue to agree sensible changes to benefit the UK and the European
Union.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042262000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000010">The
noble Baroness, Lady Quin, raised the specific issue of banking union,
as did other noble Lords. Our key objective is to gain member
states’ support that no banking union measures harm the unity
and operational 
<?notus-xml column=310?>integrity of the single market. Banking union is a single currency and
not a single market issue. As the UK is not a member of the eurozone,
we have been clear that the UK will not participate in the sharing of
eurozone risk or the new supervisory system. However, while it is for
those who will join the banking union to design the framework, the UK
will continue to play an active role during negotiations to ensure that
the operational integrity of the single market is

noble Baroness also raised concerns that the Government are in the
minority on the issue of bankers’ bonuses. This is clearly a
very politically sensitive issue within the European Union at the
moment. This made the debate very difficult. We voted against Capital
Requirements Directive IV. Obviously we are not satisfied with the
outcome. We have argued that the agreement on remuneration will have an
adverse effect on financial stability. But this should not obscure the
fact that many aspects of the agreement represent a positive
achievement for the UK such as on higher prudential standards and the
treatment of investment

Prelate the Bishop of Exeter asked, “Is this reform or
repatriation?” as detailed in the Prime Minister’s
speech. I can assure him very clearly that this is reform. The Prime
Minister’s speech does not mention the word
“repatriation”. We all need to help re-engage what the
European Union means to European citizens and what citizens want. He
also spoke about the common good and not to lose the soul of Europe,
but I am sure he would agree that we will lose the soul of Europe if
the current democratic deficit is not addressed. I hope that he and the
church will feed into the balance of competences

noble friend Lord Bowness referred to the balance of competences and to
France and Germany’s contribution. The balance of competences
review will give us an informed and objective analysis of the
UK’s relationship with the European Union. Several foreign
partners have already responded in the first semester along with a
number of international organisations. Ultimately, the analysis will be
focused on what the EU means for the UK and our national interest. We
have already received 500 pieces of evidence and we will publish the

noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, raised some very specific issues in the area
of health. I hope that he, too, feeds into the first semester of the
balance of competences review, which reports in summer later this year.
But in relation to the specific issue about the working time directive,
the coalition Government have committed to seek to limit the
application of the working time rules. We are continuing to work with
EU partners whose votes we need to bring this

question was raised in relation to Schengen. The UK already
participates in some parts of the Schengen acquis where it makes sense,
such as co-operation in managing borders. However, I can assure noble
Lords that in 2012 more than 31 million people visited the
UK, according to VisitBritain. The noble Lord, Lord
Bilimoria, 
<?notus-xml column=311?>referred to the Business for Britain campaign, which called for a
national drive to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s membership
of the European Union. I welcome his contribution and the contribution
of that campaign on how the UK can continue to be an active member of a

noble Lord, Lord Dykes, referred to our opt-outs on the JHA in 2014.
Discussions are ongoing and we have committed to a vote in both Houses,
which will take place in good time. Of course, the national interest
will be a key factor in deciding which measures we agree to rejoin. The
noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, referred to foreign languages. This has
been a longstanding issue and we recognise the importance of increasing
UK nationals in EU institutions. We have reintroduced language training
and indeed, the language school at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
We have also supported the European fast-stream work and foreign
languages in curriculums in

noble Lord, Lord Giddens, set what seemed like a series of
undergraduate questions. He was clearly back in academic mode and I
quickly went into undergraduate mode, with sweaty palms, and realised
that I had not crammed enough to answer his questions, but I will try
to answer them in writing. The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, stressed
the importance of EU free-trade agreements and trade with Europe. The
Prime Minister has been very clear that the UK’s national
interest is best served as an active member of a reformed EU. We seek
reform of the EU for the benefit of all member states, and many
European partners agree with us. I fully agree with the noble Baroness

Government are actively supporting an ambitious programme.</hs_para>

British objectives, whether in the Horn of Africa or the West Bank, and
whether it was to improve policing in Palestine, Kosovo or in Georgia,
British personnel were in key positions of influence and multinational
efforts to help local populations deal with the legacies of conflict.
The noble Lord, Lord Judd, also realises that there are flaws and
weaknesses in the system, and it is those that we are

the most recent events I have given today, I hope that the facts speak
for themselves, but this is not just about what the European Union is

The Prime Minister started the debate in January and it has aroused
healthy discussions. We do not deny

information, but much of their material is already familiar from

commitment to a nuclear future. Nevertheless, they do nothing to dispel
the doubts about this future.</hs_para>

concerning the nuclear programme and the energy policy of the UK in
general. This document, which comes in two volumes, contains the brief
and cogent report of the committee, together with a mass of oral and
written evidence from numerous parties. It is to this report that one

doubts that affect the Government’s programme arise mainly from
the fact that it persists in seeking a wholly market-based solution to
the energy problem. Their stance implies that they will have a limited
control over the outcome, unless there are contingency plans for the
eventuality that the markets will fail to deliver what is required. As
the Commons report asserted, there is no evidence of any such
contingency plans and it is likely that the markets will fail to
deliver.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042262000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000029">It
is also clear that, in the absence of a successful nuclear renaissance,
the UK will fail to meet its commitments, proclaimed in the Climate
Change Act 2008, to stanch its emissions of carbon dioxide. According
to existing plans, which have been influenced by our climate change
commitments, the UK will lose in the coming decade about a quarter of
its coal-fired power stations. We will lose all of the old oil-burning
plant. We will be losing most of the existing nuclear plant, which
consists of the eight advanced gas-cooled reactors and the one
pressurised-water reactor, Sizewell B. This is the only current reactor
that will still be operating after 2023. That is the reality of the
energy gap, which the Government are hoping that the private sector can
be induced to fill.</hs_para>

with, in the absence of new nuclear plant, is an electricity-generating
sector dependent almost entirely on gas and wind power. This assumes
that the UK would continue to fulfil its climate change commitments. In
such circumstances, the UK will be faced with the choice
between breaking those commitments or suffering an even more severe
dearth of energy
supply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000031">One
might look to the obiter dicta of some of the Ministers to discover
what the Government really intend. We know that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, George Osborne, has been vocally supportive of the
UK’s shale gas industry, arguing that this prospective energy
source could be a cheap and secure way of meeting the country’s
energy needs, as ageing power stations are decommissioned. However,
most experts have doubts regarding the extent of the shale gas
in  
<?notus-xml column=314?>the UK and its accessibility and they point to the environmental damage
that would arise from its extraction. If the UK were to depend on gas,
it would need to be imported from abroad. The global supplies of gas
are limited and are liable to be pre-empted by other nations that have
forsworn the use of nuclear energy. The supplies of gas from abroad
will be both insecure and
expensive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000032">Another
possibility for filling the energy gap, in the absence of nuclear
power, would be by burning coal, which nowadays the UK imports in large
quantities. Some people have been able to imagine that this would be an
acceptable recourse, if it could be accompanied by the as yet
unrealised technology of carbon capture and storage. This technology
appears to be a fantasy and the prospect of continuing to rely so
heavily on coal fills all but the most ardent climate change sceptics
with
horror.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000033">Finally,
there is the suggestion that, in the absence of nuclear power, we could
rely on wind power and wave power, on biomass energy and even on energy
abstinence. The supply of biomass is limited and its burning is highly
polluting. The energies of the wind and the waves are intermittent and
they have to be accompanied by other sources of power to meet the
base-load requirement. These renewable sources can play only a marginal
role. Moreover, when the full costs of renewable energy, including
those of the base-load provisions, are taken into account, they are
seen to be
exorbitant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000034">Now
I must explain why the Government’s intention to achieve a
nuclear renaissance by means of free market enterprise seems so
improbable. For a start, one can point to the fact that no commercial
supplier has yet given a firm commitment to build nuclear plant in the
UK. A significant number of prospective suppliers have already
withdrawn. One should also note that there are no other examples of
nuclear power stations that have been constructed without the major
involvement of a national Government. A new nuclear power plant has a
life expectancy of 60 years. Ten years can pass from the initiation of
a nuclear project, when the first expenses arise, to its completion,
when the revenues begin to flow. Seventy years  hence is way
beyond the horizon of any commercial
enterprise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000035">The
logic of commercial project appraisal depends on a rate of discount
that is applied to future earnings and diminishes their present value
as they recede into the future. The commercial rate of discount
obliterates the value of future earnings to the extent that no
enterprise would undertake investment in such a long-term project as a
nuclear power station unless it was heavily subsidised. Nuclear power
is virtually incompatible with private enterprise. At present, the only
realistic hope for a new nuclear plant in the UK is one that would be
constructed by what is essentially a state-owned enterprise, namely
EDF, or Électricité de France. The heavy subsidy that EDF
can expect to receive is  largely on account of the high cost
of the alternative sources of power with which nuclear energy would be
competing. Even so, it is unclear that this would offer a sufficient
inducement for it to bear the risks of such a project.</hs_para>

should the Government do in the face of the eventuality that commercial
enterprises will not be prepared to undertake the building of the much
needed nuclear power stations? The answer is that the Government should
commission and finance the projects directly, as has been the case
invariably in the past. By financing the projects directly, the
exorbitant costs of the risk premia that are demanded by the financial
markets would be avoided and the benefits would accrue to the
public.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000037">The
Government should not allow themselves to be hamstrung by an atavistic
free market ideology. Nor should they be obsessed by the totem of their
nominal borrowing requirement. If the Government can afford such
massive financial quantitative easing as we have witnessed recently,
surely it can afford to finance our energy future. I earnestly hope
that the Government have a contingency plan and that it is one that is
dictated by common
sense.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13042262000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000072">5.10

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, in my three minutes I really
only want to make one point. The assumption behind all the documents
published last month was that nuclear energy is going to have to play a
major role in the low-cost, low-carbon supply of energy to this
country. Of all the reports that were published last month, may I
express particular enthusiasm for what the noble Viscount has called
the Beddington report, namely the report about the response to the
Lords report on nuclear research and development? The other report, on
strategy, is also extremely positive and forward-looking. With it, we
also have the road map reports, something that the Select Committee
called for specifically.</hs_para>

should now provide Ministers with all the guidance that they need on
how to ensure that the UK nuclear industry can achieve three things.
First, nuclear power should play a long-term role over the decades
ahead in providing security, which the Question refers to, and a
low-carbon source of electricity. Secondly, by expanding focused
research on new technologies, the UK should be able to rebuild its
leading role in global nuclear development, something which again the
Select Committee looked forward to. Thirdly, the reports should enable
the UK industry to become a major nuclear exporter to the rest of the
world. These things are all spelled out in the documents with great
clarity, certainty and force. I do not share the pessimism of the noble
Viscount.</hs_para>

support for all 12 recommendations. However, I would like to ask my
noble friend just two questions. The first concerns the role of the
National Nuclear Laboratory, about which we had a great deal of
evidence in Select Committee. When will Ministers be able to announce
details of the proposed new structure and role of the laboratory and
the details of the programme referred to in the report? There is also
recognition that extra funding will be needed. We know that this cannot
come from DECC, because it does not have any money, but BIS does. It
is, in a sense, the research department. Therefore, I hope that we can
look forward to the funding necessary to deliver the programme spelled
out in the report.</hs_para>

Giddens:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I congratulate my noble friend
Lord Hanworth on having initiated this debate. Three minutes on nuclear
power is not very much, so I am going to limit myself to three
questions to the Minister.</hs_para>

lessons have the Government learnt from the notorious examples of the
Olkiluoto plant in Finland and the Flamanville plant in France? Both,
as everyone here will know, have been subject to horrendous delays and
cost overruns. With Olkiluoto, the whole process was initiated in 2000
and the plant was supposed to come into service in 2009. However, the
date now given is 2015 and we do not know whether that will be
achievable. The project is billions of euros over its original
estimated cost and an unseemly squabble has broken out over who will
pay the difference. How are the Government setting out the lessons to
be learnt so that we can avoid those
outcomes?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000045">Secondly,
even if built more efficiently, the reactors planned by the Government
will take many years to come on stream. The level of technological
innovation in the energy sector is now very high—much higher
than it was a few years ago. What will prevent the reactors becoming
expensive white elephants? The report sent to the Government by their
three main scientific advisers proposes the development of fast
reactors using nuclear waste as a power source, thorium reactors and
perhaps nuclear fusion. I would support all of those, but how will such
development be carried out alongside the building programme and who
will
pay?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000046">Thirdly,
what is the Government’s latest position on the convoluted issue
of subsidies, which seems to run and run? As I understand it, the
Government are no longer sticking to their position that nuclear
investment could go ahead only if there were no subsidy. I do not know
anyone working in or around the industry who ever thought that that was
possible. Does the Minister agree with the calculations of the energy
analyst Tom Burke, who has mounted a series of attacks on government
policy? According to him, if the strike price at Hinkley Point was just
under £100, the constructors would receive something like a
£50 billion subsidy from the Government if the contract were for
40 years and the market price averaged £50 to £60. Does
the Minister agree with
that?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000047">Finally,
with nuclear power there is the constant issue of insurance. What
insurance scheme do the Government envisage? Will the taxpayer be
mainly  
<?notus-xml column=317?>responsible if there is a nuclear accident where the costs are over
£1 billion, which is mentioned in the government analysis? It
would be very useful to know just what kind of insurance scheme the
Government have in mind, because different countries use different ones
and no one has come near to paying the costs of a serious nuclear
accident.</hs_para>

Parminter:</Member></B> I add my thanks to the noble Viscount, Lord
Hanworth, for posing this important Question. I would contend that the
complexity and, indeed, the continually rising costs involved in
building nuclear reactors and in putting in place appropriate safety,
waste management and decommissioning arrangements will limit the role
that nuclear energy can play in helping the UK to meet its
essential climate change and energy security goals. I have three
principal concerns, to which my noble friend Lord Giddens
referred.</hs_para>

noble friend about the costs of new build. He referred to the costs of
the proposals in Finland and France. I would add to that the costs of
dealing with existing waste. Decommissioning of the UK’s civil
nuclear facilities—principally Sellafield and
Dounreay—is estimated at being in excess of
£86 billion and is expected to rise. By contrast, as
observed by the <I>Economist</I> in its recent study on nuclear, the
costs of many renewable energy technologies are falling fast.</hs_para>

issue of accidents—again, referred to by my noble friend Lord
Giddens. With corporate liability limitations, it is the British
taxpayer who is liable for the clean-up of any major nuclear accident.
As the total clean-up costs for the Fukushima nuclear accident are
likely to top £160 billion, it is clear that if the nuclear
industry had to insure itself properly, its electricity would be
unaffordable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000052">The
noble Viscount mentioned the recent report of the House of Commons

concluded that the failure to deliver nuclear new build does not pose a
significant to threat to our energy security. A viable and sustainable
option to deliver a successful and cost-effective decarbonisation of
the UK’s power sector by 2030 is an increased deployment of
renewable energy technologies coupled with a greater focus on improving
energy efficiency. Increasing the UK’s interconnection with
European grids must also be a priority, with gas playing a role as a

conclusion, I shall ask the Minister two questions: first, when do the
Government expect a decision on whether the current electricity market
reform proposals are illegal state aid under EU law, given that
tendering for nuclear electricity does not fulfil the requirements of

Moynihan:</Member></B> My Lords, I am a supporter of nuclear power for
the main reason that it will be a critical component in our future
security of supply. The main case that needs to be made by government
is the economic case for nuclear power. The decision to go ahead with
new-build nuclear on existing sites should be driven by government,
independent of direct links to the pricing of, say, future projections
of renewables or new-built CCGT. New-build nuclear must secure a
significant part of our essential base load supplies of energy. These
stations require substantial up-front capital requiring low marginal
and operating costs. They face, as was pointed out, major
decommissioning costs. However, above all, the Government should not
carry the risk of escalating construction costs. The industry has, as
has been pointed out, a bad track record, with Olkiluoto in Finland and
Flamanville in France both late and substantially over budget. Can the
Minister confirm that the contractor will bear in full any cost
escalation during the construction and operating phases of the
project?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000055">The
second point I shall raise today relates to the proposed contracts for
difference. Will the Minister confirm how the proposed plan to fund
nearly all low-carbon generation through CFDs and the prospect that
nearly all future generation will effectively be remunerated under a
contract determined by government can be consistent with overall
European Union aims for a competitive single electricity market? As the
noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, pointed out, this would be
extraordinarily difficult. As the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies
has pointed out, the European Court of Justice’s 2010 judgment
in Federutility, concerning regulated electricity tariffs and the
presumption of the EU’s internal energy market legislation, that
the market mechanism should be allowed to operate, would indicate that
the Energy Bill appears to fly in the face of the Commission
guidelines.</hs_para>

promotion of renewable sources on the one hand and the development of a
European barrier-free market on the other. Will the Minister inform the

question obviously depends on the timescale and, in a different sense,
on the nuclear industry overcoming the legacy to which the noble Lord,
Lord Moynihan, referred, of economic overconfidence, not to say
mendacity on part of the economics of nuclear power. I support nuclear
power, but I recognise that history. We have to overcome it and the
continuous slanging match between those who support renewables, who
slag off nuclear power, and those who support nuclear power who slag
off the renewables lobby. We have to get over that because both are
vital if we are to meet the climate change target. Mutual recrimination
only benefits longer-term use of damaging fossil
fuels.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000058">In the
short term, nuclear power will not make a huge contribution to carbon
targets. To meet our carbon trajectory, we will have to rely on
increased renewables and a switch from coal to gas. In the medium term,
however, it could be different. In the nearest thing to a road map that
the Government have come up with—the carbon plan—it is
envisaged that at the end of the fourth carbon budget we will have
10 to 14 gigawatts of new nuclear power on stream,
potentially rising to 20 gigawatts by 2030. On present form that seems
pretty improbable, but it is no more improbable than that, in the same
plan, we will also have 35 to 50 gigawatts of renewable energy, which
will be equally difficult, even if we have the subject of the next
debate on stream and working. It is important to take decisions now to
set the guidelines for nuclear investment to ensure that we get
somewhere close to the 27 or 30 targets for nuclear
contribution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000059">The
immediate prospect before the Government is the Energy Bill, which will
be before this House in a couple of months. The test case for contracts
for difference is the nuclear investment by EDF in Hinkley Point. It is
a terrible dilemma for the Government and a severe test of whether the
contract for difference can actually work. It will also determine
whether we have a viable means of delivering nuclear investment in this
country. Part of the media coverage on this has been misconceived. The
Treasury has a stronger hand against EDF than is indicated. There is
not a lot of demand for nuclear power in Europe. The state-aid issue,
to which the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, referred, will be an
important inhibitor on what the Government can do for EDF in any case.
The idea that we all have to roll over to EDF demands to bring Hinkley
Point on stream is exaggerated. That is not to say that it will be an
easy negotiation or that the precedents set in the outcome of that
negotiation will necessarily be tenable for other proposals for
investment into other nuclear sites. I urge the Government to play
hardball in this respect, and ensure that the deal that is done on
Hinkley Point, which I very much support, is one that benefits the
British people and the British economy rather than straightforwardly
EDF.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13042262000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000077">5.28

Lord Bishop of Hereford:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the debate
and congratulate the noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, on securing it. In
the three minutes allotted to me, I shall make four overrushed points.
First, I am hugely supportive of us walking the nuclear path. 
<?notus-xml column=320?>I would love the 85% target for 2050 to be achieved, and I
stress that thorium and molten salt reactors should be on the medium
and long-term radar. There is four times as much thorium in the world
as radium. One tonne of thorium is equivalent to about 200 or more
tonnes of uranium, which is equivalent to 3.2 million tonnes
of coal, which would produce 8.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and
900,000 cubic feet of waste fly ash. That is a no brainer when we are
starting to be green and looking to be green. There is no argument
about that, apart from one of cost, but it could be turned on its head
and we could say, “Can we not afford this? Is there a way to
achieve those reductions without it?”. I do not think that there
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000061">Secondly,
research and development are vital. I appreciate very much the steer
towards putting a bit more money in. What a shame that since 1995 we
have had almost no money in R&amp;D for fission. I understand that at
the moment in our universities there are only five PhD students doing
R&amp;D in fission and, if noble Lords would like to guess the number
of post-docs, it is 0.2 of a researcher. That is desperate, and we are
heading for a massive skill shortage unless we do something about this
now and step up hugely the amount of money spent on research. It is
greatly needed.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042262000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000062">Thirdly, the national
decommissioning authority must surely be given a remit that is new, fit
for purpose and joined up with the rest of the documentation we have
here. Instead of the national decommissioning authority working on its
own brief to its own agenda and therefore not being able to use its
money to help with the research, we need to make sure that we change
the mindset so that some of what is regarded as waste can be regarded
as fuel. If we have four molten salt reactors, that would be possible.
We need to recognise that the new generations of reactors have far less
wastage and therefore there is ultimately far less to decommission,
which is another good reason for walking this path, and we need to cut
down the £2.3 billion a year that is being spent, which I
understand is 80% of DECC’s annual budget. That seems an
outrageously large sum, and we need to close the
gap.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042262000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000063">My fourth
point is that this cannot and will not happen without government
putting in the initiative, as the noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, has
made clear. Anything that has a 15 or 20-year, let alone a 60 or
70-year, lead time is hardly going to be commercially attractive. It
needs government to do it. We are having such trouble finding anybody
to build our reactors at the moment because we have trusted to private
enterprise, and things of this scale have to be joined up and have
government support. I would like us also to have something that is far
more clear, coherent and comprehensive with a commitment from the
Government to go for that, and then others would come aboard with
university and other research money to
follow.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13042262000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000078">5.31

Judd:</Member></B> My Lords, clearly the demands of climate change mean
that this issue has to be promoted to a top priority in government
consideration and action. We have got to stop dithering and get on with
it. If we are going to get on with it, there are several points 
<?notus-xml column=321?>which have to be addressed. The first is why we are not deliberating our
energy policy more seriously than we do with a real drive for energy
conservation. Are we just fatalist about the level of energy
consumption and therefore trying to meet it, or do we have a policy on
energy conservation, and how is that being pursued and resourced?
Talking about further education, higher education and skills, how much
effort is going into producing the people who can be expert and
relevant in this field?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042262000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000065">Next comes the issue of
real cost. That has been well illustrated in what has been said
already. We have to look at the long-term costs. We have to be very
certain. I do not believe that there can be any total certainty, but we
have to be as certain as we can be about what those real costs will be
and stop shadow boxing. In that context, the real costs of the
alternatives have to be evaluated. What is the competitive advantage?
There are special dimensions to this, and it would be foolish to
overlook them. There is safety, of course, and there is also security
in an age of international terrorism and the rest. What we need to be
clear about in these extra costs is exactly where the responsibility
lies. From the outset, we have to be clear about what the taxpayer may
be expected to fork out in the future and what the industry itself is
expected to meet. There are some huge issues in that sphere, but we
have to be clear about them. We cannot just drift into another example,
like the banks, of de facto welfare capitalism in which when something
goes wrong, taxpayers are expected to fill the bottomless pit with
their taxes.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042262000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#13042262000066">The noble Baroness,
Lady Parminter, referred to waste. I simply say that I think it is
irresponsible to move into the next generation of nuclear energy before
we have demonstrated what we are going to do with the existing stock.
This has immense implications for future generations for hundreds of
years ahead. I cannot understand why in Britain we do not have a
costed, carefully researched list of suitable sites for the storage of
nuclear waste across the country as a whole—suitable
geologically as well as on security grounds. Of course, voluntarism in
this area matters, but voluntarism should come into operation in the
context of what is clearly the best place and what are clearly the less
good places in which this waste should be stored. I simply do not
understand why that is not being done and I believe that it should be
done as a matter of
urgency.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_22_PT_1/0B0EC369825D3F6DC81FE660A4A0A78BC7C13912" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 April 2013">Monday,

Davies of Stamford:</Member></B> My Lords, we must have a nuclear
programme. Renewables are not a substitute, as the House knows very
well, because they are not base load. Carbon capture and storage is not
a satisfactory substitute because it is still an unproven technology,
and it would be deeply irresponsible to set our future by making a bet
on that particular number on the board. The same applies to shale oil.
I think that we should seriously pursue shale oil opportunities, but
there are very serious environmental concerns about it. There are
suggestions that the fracking process could permanently pollute the
water table, and that should obviously be taken extremely seriously.
However, even if that matter is resolved, combined-cycle gas-fired
power stations continue to emit carbon. If we really 
<?notus-xml column=322?>are serious about reducing our carbon emissions to the greatest possible
degree, we must at least try to replace a proportion of our energy with
electricity generated through nuclear fission. As has already been
said, that is a very tall order because all the stations except for
Sizewell B will be decommissioned by 2023 and it takes 10 years to
build a nuclear power station. Therefore, we can see the problems that
we have got ourselves into.</hs_para>

noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, or indeed with my noble friend Lord
Judd, with whom I normally agree on most things, that the problems of
nuclear waste storage should in any way hold us up in taking decisions
about investing in a new generation of nuclear power. We have that
problem anyway with the existing stations that we are closing, and the
problem is much greater with the present nuclear power stations because
current technology is much less efficient and much more waste is
produced. Therefore, I do not think that that is a very good
argument.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1304235000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#1304235000003">I
want to take the opportunity, as I think we all do this afternoon, to
ask a very simple question of the Government. What the devil are they
doing? What do they have to show in this area after nearly three years
in office? They have been arguing about contract differences for two
years. They would have been in a much better position to come to a deal
two years ago, when we had two German groups, as well as EDF, who were
extremely keen on getting involved in the nuclear project in this
country. Therefore, I fear that the Government may have got themselves
into a very unfavourable position simply by not being sufficiently
dynamic or focused earlier in this Parliament.</hs_para>

what is the fallback position? If the Government cannot come to an
agreement with EDF, what do they do? We know that the Government do not
have a fallback position on the economy and their economic policies
have not worked. They have not thought through that situation properly.
They have not thought through the possibility that the initial strategy
that they are pursuing might go wrong. That is a very irresponsible way
to run any business or any country. What fallback position do the
Government have in mind for our energy requirements if they cannot come
to an arrangement with the private sector to build new nuclear power
stations?</hs_para> <hs_time UID="1304235000145" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#1304235000145">5.39

Jay of Ewelme:</Member></B> My Lords, I must declare an interest
straight away as a non-executive director of the main Paris board of
EDF. Indeed, I am the only non-French member of that board. I should
stress that I favour nuclear energy not because I am a member of the
EDF board; I was delighted to accept membership of the board because I
believe that nuclear energy should be part of our energy mix. I hope
very much that the present negotiations between the Government and EDF
over Hinkley Point will succeed. A year or so ago, I would have said
that they seemed condemned to do so. However, having observed
negotiations more recently, albeit indirectly from both Paris and
London, I do not think that success is in any way assured. Robert
Peston got it right in his <I>FT</I> blog last week, when he talked of
both sides proceeding 
<?notus-xml column=323?>with “cautious pessimism”. I hope that I am being too
pessimistic myself. If we do not renew our nuclear capacity over the
next 10 or more years, I believe that we will face real problems of
energy security as existing nuclear and coal-based plants close, as gas
prices rise when, as it is hoped at some point, the economy picks up,
with shale gas being less significant inevitably on this side of the
Atlantic than on the other side, and as wind power remains expensive
and
intermittent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304235000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#1304235000006">We
would also find it much harder without nuclear as part of our energy

a nuclear power station will emit around five tonnes of
CO<Sub>2</Sub><Sub> </Sub>per gigawatt hour of electricity generated,
compared with nearly 500 tonnes from gas and 900 tonnes from coal. I
add, in case the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, is listening somewhere, that
climate change is not the only reason for clean energy. There is also a
very strong public health reason for clean energy as anyone who has
experienced Beijing smog in recent years will know.</hs_para>

welcome the Government’s commitment to nuclear power. I also
welcome the conclusion of the Government’s nuclear industrial
strategy—in particular its review of the nuclear research and
development. Nuclear R&amp;D needs to be far more robust than it is at
present. That approach is needed if we are to respond to
Britain’s needs and, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, if we
are to exploit the rise of nuclear power elsewhere in the world, which
is the real opportunity for us as a society. Finally, like the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford, I hope that molten salt
reactors and thorium fuel will get the attention they deserve in our R

Foulkes of Cumnock:</Member></B> My Lords, we should be grateful once
again to my noble friend Lord Hanworth for drawing our attention to the
looming crisis in the electricity supply industry. We raised it in the
energy sub-committee of the Cabinet in 2001. To be fair, successive
Governments have done nothing about it—I was going to use
another phrase there, but nothing about it is more polite. A total of
19% of our electricity now comes from nuclear power and all but one of
the existing power stations will close by 2023. What are the Government
planning? They hope to build 16 gigawatts of nuclear
capacity by 2025, but we have already heard from my noble friend Lord
Jay that even he is pessimistic about EDF being able to deliver the
only one that is in prospect, which will produce just over six
gigawatts. It really is a looming crisis.</hs_para>

Hanworth said, the markets are failing to deliver. In the past, nuclear
power stations have either been funded by Governments, and we cannot do
that any more because we privatised British Energy and now it is owned
by the French—we know we have one person looking after our
interests there, but mostly by the French—or were provided on
the balance sheets of companies against their other revenue and assets.
As the departing chief executive Volker Beckers of RWE nuclear power
made clear, balance 
<?notus-xml column=324?>sheet financing is not now an option. Therefore the only option is to
try and find these loans from the market, and they are proving both
illusive and expensive. That is why, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin,
said, they have been pulling out of the option of building. What is the
way forward? By contrast to these expensive loans, the cheapest source
of funding would be for the Government to build the nuclear power
stations and then either sell them to the utility companies or bring
companies in to operate them.</hs_para>

a strike price. Secondly, I did not anticipate the European Parliament
having the vote that it did, throwing the carbon market up in the
slates. The first question that we have to ask the Minister is what the
Government propose to do to retrieve the situation so that the price of
carbon can be made clear so that potential investors in all forms of

there is a problem, it is not the Government as such; in my view it is
the Treasury. In my recent experience of the nuclear industry within
the past decade, I remember two occasions. One of them concerned the
pay and conditions of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, where
there was a dramatic leakage of staff because of the skill and
expertise of these individuals and because their pay and conditions was
of a Civil Service character. It took the Treasury years to come to an
appreciation of the fact that these people had to be put into a
special employment box, as it were. Thankfully, the Government’s

there was the whole question of the contractorisation of Sellafield and
the insurance thresholds that had to be set for that. It took months
and months of trying to get the Treasury to appreciate the significance
of this insurance question. The insurance question was quite
straightforward. There had to be a raising of the threshold whereby the
Government would become responsible for any potential difficulty. It
was not an issue that was raised by a single company although the one I
was associated with at the time, the Washington Group, had been the
favourite company to take the Sellafield account. It eventually took
the intervention of the shareholder executive from BIS to get the
Treasury moving. We know the merits of the case one way or another and
it has been described already, but the Treasury is the department

prepared to come in and spend money and to use different forms of
generation and different reactors, which could widely expand our
industrial base. If nothing else, given that we are no longer going to

caveats were put down by speakers today. My noble friend Lord Whitty
said that we may want to pay for nuclear power, but not at any price.
It must not be at the expense of
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304235000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#1304235000016">The
noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, made very important points about waste.
Waste is an issue. We cannot move to 60 or 70 gigawatts of nuclear
power with a once-through fuel cycle. It generates far too much
high-level waste. We need innovation if we are to be able to solve that
waste problem. My noble friend Lord Judd quite rightly said that we
cannot in all conscience go forward planning lots of new reactors until
we have solved the problem that we already have today and, importantly,
worked out what it costs.</hs_para>

common theme that the noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, started off: what
is the contingency plan? If our current proposals to move ahead with
these large-scale pressurised water reactors do not happen, and a
number of speakers raised the fact that they are very difficult for the
private sector to deliver with the timescales and capital costs
involved, the contingency plans and the insurance, it is a very
difficult issue. A number of noble Lords mentioned that in the past
there has always been a fairly high level, if not a complete level, of
state involvement. It is not clear that this is going to work out as we
might hope, therefore there needs to be a contingency plan. Many noble
Lords mentioned the cost overruns of the Flamanville and Finish
reactors. We need to learn lessons from them if we are to pursue this
course.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304235000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#1304235000018">I shall
make a few suggestions, picking up on something that the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Hereford mentioned. There is a way for the state
to get involved in nuclear R&amp;D at a much higher level than it is at
the moment through rethinking our approach to decommissioning. At the
moment, a huge proportion of DECC’s budget goes on the NDA and
its role in 
<?notus-xml column=326?>decommissioning our existing reactors. The legislation that created the
NDA in 2004 was written at a time when we did not conceive that nuclear
would need to have a renaissance or that it would come back to help us
tackle climate change, and therefore the NDA was given a very narrow
and limited remit just to dispose of the waste. When is waste not
waste? It is when it is fuel. Some of those fuels that are currently
stored as waste could kick-start a new generation of nuclear reactors,
whether fast-breeders or any kind of closed-cycle nuclear system. If we
use thorium, which a number of noble Lords mentioned, we can move to
much more sustainable nuclear power, so if the Government do not have a
contingency plan, I ask that they develop one and base it around the
concept that we could bring about quite a high degree of innovation in
the nuclear industry and get back to what the UK was very good
at.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1304235000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#1304235000019">We have a
very good history of innovation in nuclear power. It was only in the
1980s that we started to see a precipitous decline in R&amp;D and the
closure of eight of our 12 nuclear research labs. With the Beddington
report, I hope that we are starting to turn that cycle. Let us get
involved in nuclear fission research again; let us increase the budgets
and make sure that we try to help bring the world a much more
sustainable nuclear future in which nuclear can compete with carbon
capture and storage, renewables and all the other solutions that will
be necessary to deliver us from climate change. I do not think it is an
either/or, or that it is nuclear or renewables or CCS. They all have to
play a role, but we probably need a new type of nuclear, and I would
love us to play a part in bringing that to
reality.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_22_PT_1/E31153533C0277E3D9D2B5A203FD890AF2694D11" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 April 2013">Monday,

largest power stations in the UK. The noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth,
specifically focuses his Question on our assessment of how nuclear

contribute significantly to our economic growth, creating long-term
employment and supply chain opportunities. The Energy Bill currently
going through the other place is bringing in some of the largest
changes in reforming electricity that the UK has ever seen. The Bill
will put into place measures to attract the £110 billion
investment that is needed to replace current generating capacity and
upgrade the grid by 2020 as we see a rising demand for electricity. The
Bill puts into place the certainty that generators have looked for in
investing in large projects and, through our capacity market, is also

Evidence given

go. In any case, you have to provide enough generating capacity of
other types to fill the peak while the barrage is resting.</hs_para>

Bristol believes its operations would be fatally maimed by the building
of the proposed barrage. Forty years ago, Bristol City Council, which
owned the docks, built the new Portbury Dock to add to the existing
Avonmouth Dock. Some years later, under a Labour council, it sold the
whole complex to the present company. Since that sale, over £500
million more has been invested, making Bristol one of the most modern
and productive ports in our country. More major investments are planned
to support continued growth, but they are currently inhibited by the
existence of the Hafren Power proposals.</hs_parafo>

port. Ships come from all parts of the world with a very wide variety
of cargoes. If the Hafren Power scheme were constructed, the navigable
water depth at high tide would be reduced by over two metres
and perhaps by three metres, depending on the silt, which I mentioned
earlier. In the older Avonmouth Dock, ships over 30,000 deadweight
tonnes with draughts of nine metres and above would be unable to enter.
That would kill important business for the port. In the newer Portbury
Dock, the effect would be similar, but it is larger and vessels with a
draught of over 13 metres would be very restricted, and the existing
largest vessels, currently up to 130,000 deadweight tonnes, could not
enter. Of course, ships with lower draughts would be able to enter, but
on many fewer days in the year. The port would be commercially
unviable, and the current investment would be
wasted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304235000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#1304235000047">The new
locks to be incorporated within the barrage are another problem. They
would necessarily be in the deep water channels, and the ships
approaching them would be exposed to the full force of the Atlantic
weather, unlike the sheltered approaches to the existing ports. There
would be delays and risks attached to their operation. There would also
be large costs, not only for lock operations but for dredging,
pilotage, survey and towage and for the shipping companies. These costs
must be paid by the barrage and guaranteed for its lifetime, but we
have not been allowed to see the
calculations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304235000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#1304235000048">Hafren

On the face of it, it is a fairly major contribution to meeting our
climate change targets—5% of Britain’s electricity could
be generated by this. It also has economic upsides of substantial
employment. There are probably enough speakers on the list who will
emphasise the Welsh dimension. I also emphasise that in the south-west

there are economic and ecological downsides. I declare a past interest
as a member of the board of the Environment Agency. I was persuaded,
with some reluctance, that we should oppose this proposition, largely
on the grounds of the effect on migratory birds and fish and the need
to find compensatory habitats, as well as the effect on the whole
ecology of the Severn estuary. It is not possible to replace the
habitats that exist in south Wales for migratory birds, nor frankly is
it possible to construct turbines that do not have some fairly negative
effect on large numbers of fish. Nevertheless, this is a conflict
between two different environmental objectives. We have to bear in mind
that to meet the trajectory of carbon reduction to which we are
committed—in a sense the subject of the previous
debate—we will have to make some unpalatable decisions and face
up to some fairly unpalatable costs, whether it is nuclear energy or
some of the major renewable projects, including this
one.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304235000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#1304235000053">I do not
think that I will have quite changed my mind again. Despite what the
noble Lord, Lord Cope, said, I think that the new proposition has some
mitigating factors, although they are not entirely convincing, even to
me. We need to look at the latest version with some considerable
scepticism, but the project as such has some serious merits. However, I
want to seize on the last remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Cope, on
whether there are other ways of making use of the great tidal
difference in the Severn. There were earlier propositions of having a
series of lagoon-type projects that would not save so much
carbon—we have to be fair about that—but which would
probably cost only slightly less, and would not have either the
negative ecological effects nor the damaging effect on the Bristol
ports to which the noble Lord, Lord Cope, referred. I ask the Minister
specifically whether those other alternatives are still being
considered as well as the latest Hafren proposal. I would not want to
be as dismissive of it as the noble Lord, Lord Cope, but the Government

the elusive trail that we have had over many decades to try to harness
the power of the Severn estuary. I wish that we could call it the
Bristol

the line between Newport across to Avonmouth was the line of the Severn

the problem is that we have only nascent technologies, which have not
yet been brought to a level where they can be put into action in
demonstrable projects. The whole energy sector has been dogged, for
example, by the difficulty of creating appropriate turbines to deal
with the rise and fall of the tide. I understand that, in the current
proposal, Rolls Royce own the concept and patent for a nascent turbine
that will work in both directions, but there is no sense that it has
been developed beyond a prototype into something that could be seen to
work. That is why, for example, a lagoon would allow that testing to

Bearing in mind that the Severn—or the Bristol Channel as it is
quite rightly named—is very deep there, it has already got

finance it in the private sector”. That is not good enough
nowadays. You need a lot more study, effort and investigation of all
the effects, including on the ports, which are extremely serious. I am

the barrage there, as the Severn surge comes up the channel and the
Parrett is trying to empty the flood water down into the channel has
not been properly modelled by Hafren. I doubt whether anyone will be
able to model it sufficiently. By dint of simply having the barrage,
you might be writing off a large part of 
<?notus-xml column=337?>Somerset. You only have to look at what was flooded this winter to see
how likely that is. That is a tremendous downside, especially,
obviously, for the people of Somerset. It is a matter that needs to be
settled.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304235000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#1304235000074">The
noble Lord, Lord Cope, remarked on what he called ditheritis, which is
an extremely important point. Back in 2004, Friends of the Earth
published a good comparison between the barrage and smaller, more
varied schemes, particularly tidal lagoons. It is now 10
years later and we have lost the lead that we might have had on tidal
lagoon technology. It is not too late to imagine that we could still
forge ahead with it, but which investors will put their money into
anything like that before they know what will happen with the barrage?
This needs to be settled and settled

smaller schemes offer tremendous upsides as well. If we are thinking
about technology that we can export, we can pilot a number of
things—the tidal stream and the tidal lagoons, as suggested in
Swansea bay, which join up with the land and ones that do not join up
with the land as suggested for Bridgwater bay. They relate better to
communities and would undoubtedly bring the same sort of employment
opportunities as a whole barrage but with a more varied application
throughout the world. Not everyone has the place to build an enormous
barrage. It might be a world tourist attraction, but it would not be
the sort of technology that would lead to replication across the world.
There would be only one or two other places where a barrage-type
structure as proposed would be applicable, whereas the tidal lagoons
could happen in a number of other places.</hs_para>

helpful, and we had a discussion about habitats and so on. He, of
course, was a Defra Minister and it was the responsibility of another

Severn by senior politicians seem to have generated more heat than
light. Following the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, I suggest that we should
learn from France. The tidal scheme, La Rance, opened in Brittany in
1996. It generates 240 megawatts, is extremely reliable and has never
had to have a major refit. It operates on an average tidal difference
of 8.2 metres, whereas the mean for the Severn is 14.5 metres. A much
smaller generator at Strangford in Northern Ireland has been working
since 2007.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304235000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0001.htm#1304235000133">The

proposed up-river at a site known as the English Stones. Tidal lagoons

Dixon-Smith:</Member></B> My Lords, one certainty has not been
mentioned so far, which is that simply leaving the estuary alone will
cost nothing. We have to deal with rising sea levels, and the Severn
estuary is highly vulnerable to them. We already have a London barrage,
which we know all about, and which will have to be replaced. That
problem writ large all the way up the Severn estuary will be a problem
not only in Bristol but in every other city anywhere near the estuary,
and all landowners will have to face it too. It is not an easy question
to answer. This is part of a much wider issue. That is the first thing

to answer a point made by my noble friend Lord Cope, intermittency is
not an issue. It would be perfectly simple to build some barrages on
the east coast where we have some quite large estuaries. The time
difference for high water is almost precisely six hours. If barrages
are built on both sides of the country, there will be an even flow of
electricity into the system. That point needs to be made.</hs_para>

we do not sufficiently consider the energy pattern and requirements
caused by our Climate Change Act. By 2050 we shall have had to say
goodbye—I say good riddance—to the internal combustion
engine. All land transport will have to be driven by some other system.
My bet would be on hydrogen, which requires electricity to generate it.
Those who say that it cannot be done because there is no hydrogen
infrastructure have got it wrong. The hydrogen infrastructure already
exists. Wherever you have electricity and water you can make hydrogen.
It is actually much more efficient to use that in a vehicle than to use
batteries, and there is not quite the waste disposal problem because
hydrogen is permanently recycled. The electricity generating
requirements as a consequence of that are at least twice as big, if not
two and a half times as big, as anything we are considering at present,

this may be more important to the country than the port of Bristol, but
when the chips go down in 10, 15, 20 or 30 years’ time, that may
be a reality that we all have to face. If it is a choice between future

renewable sources of energy to mitigate the potentially catastrophic
effects of climate change. A Severn barrage would utilise predictable
and sustainable tidal power on a scale to provide perhaps 5% of
Britain’s energy requirements, the carbon payback time would be
a matter of only months, and the installation could be expected to
generate energy for perhaps 120 years. If it is not to be Hafren

considerations first. The ambition is to build an 11-mile line of more
than 1,000 slowly spinning turbines, housed in massive concrete blocks,
between Brean in England and Lavernock Point in Wales. It is certainly
worthy of our consideration. Such a barrage will generate electricity
as the tides go

will be spread right across the estuary, so the currents and navigation

Grantchester:</Member></B> My Lords, any proposal that presents the
opportunity to harness tidal power, and in doing so generate 5% of the
UK’s electricity needs, while also bringing in much-needed
inward investment to the south Wales, Bristol and Somerset region, is
one to be considered very seriously. The many and varied contributions
to the debate today highlight not only the interest but the extent of
the effects that building such a barrage shall have, bringing lasting
energy, economic and environmental changes. It is on these three
parameters that any scheme must be assessed, with extensive effects not
only on the estuary but throughout the region. The clear conclusion of
the debate is that the Hafren Power scheme is unsatisfactory. On that
basis, however, the balance of the debate was to try to find some
scheme to capture the advantages, albeit with an understanding that
there are inherent difficulties. Even the noble Lord, Lord Cope, and
the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, hinted that better was to
come.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304235000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0002.htm#1304235000101">The
Department of Energy and Climate Change reported on initial feasibility
studies in October 2010. The noble Lord, Lord Touhig, highlighted the
background canvas against which the energy assessment can be made. The
report assessed five potential schemes to be feasible. As the
Government’s feasibility study and 
<?notus-xml column=343?>Hafren Power’s own plans highlight, the barrage has the potential
to generate up to 5% of the UK’s electricity generation, around
15 terawatt hours a year. As well as having the advantage of being
entirely free, the reliability of the tides that power the barrage also
removes the problem of intermittency that affects other renewable
energy sources. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, suggested a second
tidal scheme. However, it could not be constructed in time to
contribute to the UK’s 2020 renewable
targets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304235000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0002.htm#1304235000102">On
economic considerations, the potential gains to the local area could
also be very significant. The expansion of the steel works at Port
Talbot and Bristol, and the new factories that Hafren proposes to build
in south Wales and Bristol to make the innovative bi-directional
turbines that the barrage could hold, could lead to a much broader
economic regeneration in the area, which is much in need of inward
investment of this magnitude. Indeed, one of the highlights of this
project is that, if it were to go ahead, it would be almost unique as
one of the few large-scale infrastructure projects not planned for the
south-east. But as well as having many positive effects, the designs as
they currently stand raise several notable economic concerns that would
need to be thoroughly addressed: notably the effect of the barrage on
Bristol’s docks, which support up to 8,000 local jobs, is
crucial.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1304235000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0002.htm#1304235000103">My
noble friend Lord Courtown reminded us that the environmental
consequences of the barrage are even more challenging than the economic
or energy impacts. My noble friend Lord Berkeley said that something of
this sheer size and with this kind of design has never been tried
before. As the government study makes clear, among other things it is
unclear how the current regulatory framework would apply to such a
structure in an environmentally sensitive area. The 200 or so turbines
that would power the barrage still need to be designed, tested and
built; something that will take nearly a decade
alone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304235000104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0002.htm#1304235000104">The
Severn and its many tributaries are internationally recognised natural
heritage conservation sites. Many characteristics of this unique
environment will be changed by the presence of a barrage.
Hafren’s controversial suggestion of allocating £1
billion for providing compensatory habitats for affected wildlife,
while seemingly attractive, will go no way towards the value of such a
unique habitat. The department’s report concluded that tidal
power in the Severn estuary would be at high cost, high risk and at a
value of money less attractive than other renewable energy
technologies.</hs_para>

Whitty asked what other schemes were still under consideration. The
noble Lord, Lord Cope, despite being against, still wanted further and
better schemes to come forward. Rather than embark on a massive scheme,
my noble friends Lord Berkeley and Lady Jones, and the noble Baroness,
Lady Miller, asked whether there were some smaller schemes worthy of
being undertaken to gain expertise and experience that could, by small
steps, provide insights into the future, albeit that they may appear
less than attractive on their own merits? As the noble Lord, Lord
German, and my noble friend Lord Howarth suggested, the lead should be
given by her department.

power from the Severn estuary could clearly be a significant asset for
the UK, but this has to be done sustainably. That is why my department
led a two-year cross-government study investigating the potential of
Severn tidal power schemes. The study concluded in 2010 that it did not
see a strategic case for a publicly funded tidal power scheme. The
Government have remained open to the possibility of a privately funded
project coming forward. Our study has provided us with a wealth of
evidence on the potential effects of the Severn barrage. In particular,
it highlighted how little we knew about the dynamic environment of the
estuary itself. It concluded that environmental impacts, particularly
on fish, birds and habitat, are likely to be larger than expected and
extremely challenging to mitigate and compensate for.</hs_para>

that a barrage might provide a net benefit to the regional economy,
with net value added to the economy and jobs created. However, these
would come at the expense of a potentially large negative impact on the
current ports, fishing and aggregate extraction industries. The study
also identified the likely cost of the Severn tidal schemes to be as
much as £34 billion for a barrage at a time when there are
easier and cheaper alternatives. Despite the extraordinary amount of
work produced, the government study barely scratched the surface of the
potential effects of a Severn barrage. Any specific proposal for a

its particular
design.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1304235000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-gc0002.htm#1304235000111">This

allow us to assess whether the proposal is credible. Nor does it

detailed mitigation plans; detailed evidence around flooding impacts;
and detailed evidence to support job creation figures. Those are
questions that a number of noble Lords have already raised here today.
Crucially, the project will require substantial revenue support to
provide a return on the investment. It is therefore vital that Hafren
Power provides robust evidence that the level of support sought for the

key part of this response was an employee-focused event held in Arley

attended. This gave them access to a range of advice and information
services on their entitlements and options as well as information about
alternative employment opportunities. To follow up the event, employees
will receive an information sheet providing details of support
available at both local and national level. In addition an information
sheet is being prepared for local businesses informing them of support
available should they be impacted by the closure of Daw Mill. I would
like to commend all the local partners for their joined-up
approach in supporting the workforce and local community, and
particularly in organising 22 March 2013 event which I know was

the Netherlands, Finland and Germany jointly sent a letter to President
Barroso on 6 March 2013, emphasising the importance of the rule of law,
human rights and democracy; the fundamental values of the Union. The
letter called for an EU mechanism to protect these fundamental values,
and suggested that the European Commission should play a greater role
in this area. At the request of the signatories this issue will be
discussed at the GAC. I will underline the importance of safeguarding
the rule of law, human rights and democracy within the Union. I will
also acknowledge the link between effective justice systems and
economic growth, as identified in the letter. I will highlight the
important role already played by the Council of Europe in relation to
fundamental values and encourage the Council to bear this valuable
contribution in mind. The letter did not go into detail on how any EU

reported to the Food Standards Agency a positive test for the presence
of very low levels of bute in its 340g tins of smart price corned beef.
This product was tested by Asda as part of the 
<?notus-xml column=133?>industry testing programme and found to be positive for horse DNA above
1% and was withdrawn from Asda’s shelves on 8 March 2013. As
with all products that tested positive for horse DNA over 1% it was
tested for bute, as required by the Food Standards Agency. Bute was
present at a level of four parts per billion—4ppb. This level is
close to the limits of laboratory detection so a very low level of bute
has been found in this product. Since the horsemeat investigation began
in January 2013, this is the only meat product that has tested positive
for bute. Asda has recalled the product.</hs_para>

Officer has previously stated that horsemeat containing phenylbutazone
at very low levels presents a very low risk to human health. In the UK
horse carcasses must have a negative bute test before they are allowed
to enter the food chain. The Food Standards Agency is currently
investigating this specific issue and will take action as necessary. It

April, the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority
(NVWA) recalled 50,000 tonnes of meat sold as beef across
Europe over a two-year period that may contain horsemeat. The
Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority said 370
different companies around Europe and 132 more in the Netherlands were
affected by the recall because they bought meat from a Dutch trading
company. The FSA has been informed by the Dutch authorities that a
small number of UK businesses may have received products from the
trading company that operates under the names of Willy Selten and
Wiljo. As the NVWA was unable to say with certainty whether all of the
customers had been identified the authority took the unusual step of
publishing Selten and Wiljo’s names. The FSA is following up
with these businesses as a matter of

action plan including specific measures on the following: fighting food
fraud, testing programme, horse passports, official controls and origin
labelling. A copy of this plan has been placed in the Libraries of both
Houses. This five-point plan was discussed at an EU Working Group
meeting of experts on 10 April which was a useful exchange of views in
advance of further discussions at official level later this week. We
have submitted UK data on our own testing programmes to the Commission.

of British people travel abroad every year. Most have a journey free

things go wrong and British nationals can be victims of serious crime,
require hospitalisation or be caught up in a major crisis. The Foreign

better crisis response, building regional structures and the start of
transferring passport work. By 2016, the FCO will have a modern,
efficient service supporting British nationals overseas. We will do
more to help those who need it most: those who are most at risk because
of who they are, where they are or what has happened to them. We will
deliver more services through expert partners, and where it is 
<?notus-xml column=135?>reasonable, ask people to help themselves. The FCO will also introduce a

are using a number of channels to give British nationals the latest
information and advice on what they should do if they need our help in
a crisis. This faster and more practical system supersedes the Locate

comprehensively assesses the global human rights situation in 2012 and
provides information about some important developments in early 2013.
It sets out what the Government are doing through the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office to promote human rights and democratic values
around the world in three principal areas: it documents how we are
seeking to exert a positive influence in a range of countries where we
have serious concerns about the human rights situation; it assesses
progress on a number of thematic issues that cut across geographical
boundaries; and it reports on areas where we believe we have seen
positive developments over the past year.</hs_para>

changes to the format of the report itself this year, including the
introduction of new chapters. As our topical theme for the 2012 report
we have chosen “promoting and protecting human rights through
the UN”. We believe that the UN’s Human Rights Council is
coming of age and that its Universal Periodic Review process has
already developed into a valuable mechanism for holding countries
accountable for their human rights record. The theme is also timely as
the UK is standing for re-election to the Human Rights Council later
this year. We have also introduced a new chapter on our Human Rights
and Democracy Programme and added a section on the Preventing Sexual
Violence Initiative, which I launched last year.</hs_para>

report, we decided to review the criteria we use for deciding which
countries are of most human rights concern to the UK. We drew on
feedback from the Foreign Affairs Committee and consulted with the
Foreign Secretary’s Advisory Group on Human Rights in coming up
with a revised list of
criteria.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042219000270" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-wms0001.htm#13042219000270">The
primary criterion for inclusion as a country of concern is the gravity
of the human rights situation in the country, including both the
severity of particular abuses and the range of human rights affected.
The other criteria then considered are: whether a deterioration or
improvement in the human rights situation in the country would have a
wider impact in the region; whether the human rights situation in the
country has an impact on wider UK interests; and the level of UK
activity and engagement in that
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042219000271" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-wms0001.htm#13042219000271">FCO
geographical directors, drawing on input from our embassies and high
commissions and taking account of evidence from other expert sources
such as the UN and civil society, assessed all the countries in their
regions against this newly revised set of criteria. Ministers then made
the final decision on the list of countries of concern to be included
in the report. As a result of this analysis, we retained 27 of the 28
countries highlighted in 2011, dropping only Chad.</hs_para>

should retain case studies, which we introduced last year as a way to
report on countries that do not meet the overall threshold for a
country of concern but whose human rights performance we judge to be on
a changing trajectory. While many case studies focus on countries on a
negative trajectory, 
<?notus-xml column=139?>in others we want to highlight a particular thematic
issue. These countries remain subject to in-year monitoring and
reporting.</hs_para>

reporting system underline the Government’s determination to

Rights Council so the UK can continue to play a leading role in this
important institution.</hs_para>

backdrop of continuing pressure on public finances, we need to continue

fund the Crown Court defence of those who can afford to pay, for civil
cases that lack merit, for weak judicial review cases, or for matters
which are not of sufficient priority to justify public money and which
can be resolved through non-legal channels. We are also clear that

aid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042219000292" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-wms0001.htm#13042219000292">The
primary focus of our proposals is in relation to crime, where we are
still spending over £1 billion a year. We are proposing to
introduce a model of competitive tendering, initially in criminal legal
aid work only and over a longer period in civil and family services.
Our preferred approach is to introduce competition for the full range
of litigation services (except very high costs cases (crime)) and
magistrates’ court representation. For criminal advocacy, we
propose to restructure the Crown Court advocacy fee scheme in ways that
should help encourage efficient working and the prompt resolution of
cases, consistent with our overall objectives for the criminal justice
system, and to reduce the use of multiple counsel. We are also
proposing to reduce fees paid in very high cost cases (crime), which
are the small number of cases that attract a disproportionately high
level of spend. The overall effect on advocates will be to rebalance
the fee income so those at the top take the greatest reduction, while
those earning the lowest fees may actually see a small increase. We
also propose limited reform to civil 
<?notus-xml column=142?>legal aid and experts’ fees to ensure they are fair and
consistent with those paid for similar work, represent better value for
money and reflect efficiencies within the justice

Government share the commission’s concern about non-compliance
with the apprentice minimum wage and we are clear that employers must
pay their staff at least the minimum wage. However, we believe that it
is important to maintain the relative position of the apprentice rate
compared to benefits and the youth rates to preserve the attractiveness
of apprenticeships  
<?notus-xml column=143?>for young people. The Government have concluded therefore that a 1%
increase in the apprentice rate would be appropriate. This is in line
with the recommended increases in the youth rates; evidence in the
commission’s report shows that the majority of apprentices paid
on and just above the apprentice rate are young people. It is also the
planned level of public sector pay and benefit increases. We consider
that the modest level of this increase would not have significant
adverse effects on employment or training for apprentices. In
conjunction with this, we are putting in place a package of measures to
improve compliance, including focused communications and targeted
enforcement by HM Revenue and
Customs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042219000309" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422-wms0001.htm#13042219000309"><I>Accommodation

Department for Education does not currently collect information on
adoption breakdowns but has recently commissioned research to
understand better the number and causes of adoption breakdowns. This
research is expected to be published in early 2014. Current research
does not support the idea that adoptions will be more likely to break
down if there is no ethnic match. It suggests that disruption rates are
much the same and there are few differences in most psychosocial
outcomes, including self-esteem for children placed with prospective
adopters who are an ethnic match and for those without an ethnic
match<Sup>1</Sup>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042232000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422w0001.htm#13042232000009">Information
on the number of children who return to care following a breakdown of a
previous adoption will be collected for the first time in 2014;

De Mauley:</Member> The majority of decisions taken by parties to the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna
and Flora (CITES) are by consensus. This was the case at CoP16. Unlike
many other environmental treaties and organisations, 
<?notus-xml column=360?>the CITES Rules of Procedure contain agreed voting provisions that apply
when consensus cannot be reached. This includes provision for secret
ballots where a request for secret ballot is supported by at
least 10 countries. Where a vote is taken and this is not by secret
ballot, the way in which a country votes is recorded in the summary
record and is publicly available. The EU, fully supported by the UK,
tabled proposals to reduce the use of secret ballots to improve
transparency. Although debated at considerable length the UK was very
disappointed that these proposals were not adopted. However, the need
for greater transparency was
acknowledged.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042232000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422w0001.htm#13042232000159">While
the majority of decisions taken by parties at CoP16 were by consensus
there were still a significant number of votes, of which many were by
secret ballot. The UK, voting in line with a common position of the EU
and its member states, in general voted in favour of proposals to
improve species conservation in line with scientific evidence.
Additionally the UK, in line with the EU, supported proposals that
strengthened the operations and governance of CITES, including improved
transparency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042232000160" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130422w0001.htm#13042232000160">On
more than one occasion where a secret ballot was subsequently held at
CoP16, Ireland, which currently holds the presidency of the EU, made a
point of publicly declaring the vote of the EU member states and
Croatia, which would have included the UK position. A number of other
countries similarly publicly confirmed their vote. These are a matter
of public record in the Summary Records of CoP16 produced by the CITES
Secretariat. If there are specific votes taken at CoP16 by secret

achieve Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and meet the Teachers’

scheme started in 1964, levels of dental decay have been consistently
lower than in Manchester which has a similar socioeconomic profile, but
does not have a fluoridation scheme. By way of illustration, the most
recently readily available comparable statistics from child dental
surveys conducted as part of the National Health Service Dental
Epidemiology Programme (NHSDEP) show that in 2005-06, five year-old
children in the area served by Birmingham City Council had an average
of 1.36 decayed, missing or filled teeth (DMFT) compared to an average
of 2.39 DMFT in the area of Manchester City Council. Evidence that the
protective effect of water fluoridation is maintained during the
development of permanent teeth may be seen from a later NHSDEP survey
which showed that, in 2008-09, 12 year-old children in Birmingham had
an average DMFT of 0.65 compared to an average of 1.12 DMFT for
children in Manchester. Health profiles maintained by Public Health
England show that there are no significant differences in the general

the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool merged to become the Conflict
Prevention Pool. A separate instrument, the Stabilisation

applies and contains powers (but not any obligation) for the Secretary

under Section 75 only allows the Secretary of State to make a
“full” designation—that is, for all of a

exercises executive authority. These arrangements are clearly set out
in the Pitcairn constitution. It is entirely appropriate, and healthy,
