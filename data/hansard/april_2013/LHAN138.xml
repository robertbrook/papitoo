the UK and we are investing greatly in our diplomatic and economic
ties. We have no plans to impose a visitor visa regime in
Brazil. In the non-visitor categories, visa applications from
Brazil in 2012 were up by 8% when compared with 2011, while in the same

clarification and I thank the Minister for that. However, does not this
kind of media misunderstanding and reporting demonstrate the fact that
the tourism sector, despite its importance and huge potential for job
creation, still believes that it is the Cinderella of British business
sectors? Does this not argue for a much more joined-up, strategic
approach between the Home Office and other government departments in
partnership with the industry to ensure that Britain’s visa
policy is not a disincentive to visitors and actually builds on the

difficulties over visas? Only yesterday, eight distinguished
parliamentarians from Peru visited our Parliament. Not only did they
have to send their valued diplomatic passports to Brazil for the issue
of the visas, but they had to pay up to $800 each in order to obtain
them. Is it not time that we returned to the tried and trusted system
of the issuance of visas by our embassies abroad, where local knowledge
and discretion can be
applied?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000009"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="13042554000337" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000337"><B>Lord

cases, that is exactly what happens. If the delegation from Peru had
some difficulty and had to pay the premium price for speedy and
accelerated service, that lies in its own hands. It is important that
people recognise that all processes, particularly ones that are
designed to protect our security, have to be thorough.
I reinforce the point that there is no problem with
visas from Brazil. There are no visitor visas from
Brazil.</hs_para>

the triple whammy that has hit the tourism industry of the visas, the
air passenger tax and the lack of runway space in the south of England?
It means that British Airways goes to Madrid from South America, so of
course many of the visitors from South America now stay in Spain and
continental Europe. It is a triple whammy for the tourist industry,
which would tell the Government that if they would only listen to
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000011"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="13042554000339" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000339"><B>Lord

of Borders and Immigration, who has highlighted some very serious
issues that cause delays in decisions on visa applications? Previously,
the chief inspector has complained about his recommendations being

the UKBA, which will mean that the processing of visas is separate from

given to me by the Minister, I have been encouraging Iranian women
applying for visas to this country to continue to do so. Unfortunately,
however, I understand that while they are in an Arab country that can
give them visas, they are required to stay for a long period before
they can actually get them. The expense therefore remains prohibitive,
which means that many students who wish to study here, whom the
Government assure us they wish to come, cannot do so simply because of
the delay and the huge expense of living outside

Lords, the Government are committed to taking decisive action on
climate change. Our electricity market reform is the biggest change to
the UK electricity market since privatisation and is needed to ensure
that we have a diverse range of energy supplies and achieve our
emissions reduction targets. At EU level, the Government support
current proposals to strengthen the EU emissions trading system and
support the 2050 low-carbon road map, which sets out the cost-effective

Green, the Minister for Policing, recently met the National Black

strategies such as this. There have been suggestions that elements in

drivers that ensure that the police more fully reflect the communities
that they serve must be a good thing, so I cannot join with my noble
friend in this regard. A lot of progress has been made in increasing
the number of police officers from BME backgrounds but there are still
too few, and there are still too few in the higher ranks of the police
force. I hope that one of the considerations of the direct entry scheme
will be to ensure that some of the higher levels of the policing

any candidate. However, I am confident about that policy and I believe
it will enhance the policing profession. I have some figures here.
There are 6,604 BME officers in the 43 forces in England and Wales,
representing 5% of total police officer strength. The proportion of
those of chief inspector rank or

was stabbed to death and after the Macpherson report on institutional
racism, it is time to look at this issue again? In particular, does he
not agree that it would be right to ask HM Inspectorate of Constabulary

spending six days out with team A of Southwark Metropolitan Police
Service. During that time, we conducted a stop and search of a black
man outside the Damilola Taylor Centre. Including myself, there were
three representatives of the Metropolitan Police Service handling the
coercive power of the state, and every single person who walked past us
was from the black community in the area. When will my noble friend the

they reflect the populations that they serve, give a time limit for

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My noble friend reinforces much of
what I have been saying. In January 2012, the Commissioner of the
Metropolitan Police initiated the “stop it” campaign as a
way of trying to ensure a better balance. The police must use stop and
search in a proportionate fashion, and we will consider the outcomes of
that strategy. I commend my noble friend on joining in that particular
exercise. I attended a dinner here with the Commissioner of the
Metropolitan Police the other evening for the
parliamentary police programme, which is widely supported by
parliamentarians—indeed, Members of this House were present. I
commend that programme. Anything that makes us, in politics, more aware

to tackle the crisis in the euro area, but the challenges facing growth
in Europe continue to be serious. We have seen a welcome fall in
borrowing rates, particularly for Spain and Italy, from the very high
levels they reached last summer. This reflects the gradual progress
that the euro area authorities have made in tackling the crisis and, in
particular, the commitment by the ECB to stand behind the euro, but
recent events in Cyprus remind us that the euro area continues to be a
fragile environment. Only a sustained period of successful reforms and
improvements in financial markets can lay the foundations for
growth.</hs_para>

the European Union remains very subdued. EU GDP contracted by 0.5% in
the last quarter of 2012 and recent economic indicators suggest that
the slow end to 2012 has carried over into 2013. In the euro area, most
periphery economies are in serious recessions, with weak labour
markets, adverse credit conditions and an ongoing process of
deleveraging all weighing on growth. Without sustainable economic
growth, the EU will be unable to repay its debts, create jobs or
maintain its standard of living. In order to return the EU’s
economy to a sustainable footing, ambitious and far-reaching structural
reforms will be required. These are the reasons why the EU semester is

survey presents the Commission’s view of EU policy priorities
for the forthcoming year. It highlighted five broad priority areas for
reform in EU member states for 2013: pursuing differentiated
growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, restoring lending to the economy,
promoting growth and competitiveness, tackling unemployment, and
modernising public administration. These priorities closely reflect the
Government’s approach to growth through low-cost, supply-side
structural reforms while maintaining the importance placed on fiscal
consolidation as set out by the Chancellor at Autumn Statement 2012 and
Budget 2013. Budget 2013 set out the Government’s assessment of
the UK’s medium-term economic and budgetary position. As
confirmed by the OBR, the UK economy is still recovering from the
biggest financial crisis in generations, one of the deepest recessions
of any major economy, and a decade of growth built on unsustainable

This economic plan combines monetary activism with fiscal
responsibility and supply-side reform. Although it is taking longer
than hoped, the Government have made significant 
<?notus-xml column=1532?>progress. We have restored fiscal credibility, allowing activist
monetary policy and the automatic stabilisers to support the economy.
The deficit has been cut by a third over three years and is projected
to fall in every year of the forecast. One and a quarter million

there is obviously still much more to do. In March the OBR revised down
its forecast for global economic growth and sharply revised down its
forecast for eurozone growth and world trade. The euro area is the
destination for over 40% of UK exports, so this has necessarily had an
impact on our growth performance. Over the past year net trade was the
key factor in the underperformance of the economy relative to earlier
OBR forecasts. As a result of this challenging global economic outlook,
the OBR revised down its growth forecast for the UK for this year and
for the year after.</hs_para>

has not had a larger drag on the economy than the OBR expected in June
2010. The UK’s fiscal vulnerabilities argue strongly in favour
of maintaining our commitment to deficit reduction. Despite progress
since 2010, the UK is still forecast to have the largest
deficit in the EU in 2013. Public spending remains well above the
historic average and debt is now forecast to start falling in
2017-18, two years later than set out in the supplementary debt

achieve the ambition for the UK tax system to be one of the most
competitive in the world, including a further cut in corporation tax to
20% from April 2015, which will be the joint lowest in the G20. We will
increase capital investment plans by £3 billion a year from

measures will make a difference, but we are far from complacent about
the challenges we face. That is why the Government support the aims of
the macroeconomic imbalances procedure, a new EU-level mechanism for
identifying and correcting potentially problematic macroeconomic
imbalances. The alert mechanism report is the first stage in the
macroeconomic imbalances procedure and presents the results of a
“scoreboard” of macroeconomic indicators. The report
finds that the UK exceeds pre-determined threshold values for three of
the 11 indicators: public debt, private debt and export market shares.
The UK, along with 12 other member states, was therefore
subject to the next phase of the procedure—that is to
say  
<?notus-xml column=1533?>an “in-depth review” carried out by the European
Commission. The results of this study were issued on 10

Commission’s findings are that the UK does not have an
“excessive imbalance”, but it concludes that the UK has
macroeconomic imbalances relating to external competitiveness and
private debt. The Government accept this analysis. We recognise that
the UK economy is experiencing imbalances and have set out a
comprehensive strategy to rebalance the economy and deal with

announced £70 million in additional funding for UK Trade &amp;

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, made
clear, the Government are required by the European Communities
(Amendment) Act 1993 to submit an assessment of the UK’s
convergence programme towards the economic structure of the eurozone.
This requirement is perhaps more apt this year than in past years. On
the broadest economic assessment, the Government’s convergence
programme has been a great success: the eurozone is stagnant and so is
the UK. Despite the welcome announcement of some growth in the past
quarter, overall performance for the past six months has been growth of
nil, and output is still 2.6% below the 1998 peak. Things have come to
a pretty pass when growth of 0.6% per year is a cause for celebration.

healing is surely

growth-friendly fiscal consolidation—in the week in which, as a

know that the eurozone is stagnant and that the outcome of the
Government’s policies has been to condemn Britain to the same
fate. We have, indeed, converged. Therefore, the fundamental question
raised by the Budget report and the OBR’s economic and fiscal
outlook is whether growth-friendly fiscal consolidation is an economic
oxymoron. Will the austerity policies advocated so consistently by this
Government result in persistent stagnation, or will they restore the
sustained economic growth of over 2% a year that this country

assumed increase in revenues consequent upon the assumed reappearance
of economic growth. It is revenues that do all the heavy lifting, but
those revenues are predicated on the assumption that the economy will
return to medium-term growth. It is just an assumption; there is no

Austerity does not beget growth. In the face of austerity, monetary
activism does little to support demand, other than by piling greater
risk on a household sector that is already, as the European Union
report shows, overleveraged. Supply side reform will bear fruit only if
this is incentivised by the prospect of growing future demand to take
advantage of any beneficial changes. That is why there is a need for a
substantial increase in infrastructure spending now; that is
why there is a need for monetary activism and government funding
guarantees to be focused on investment and new construction; and that
is why expanding investment in the skills and technology of the future
should be a national
priority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000103">Productivity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T12:04:59"></hs_TimeCode>-focused

the OBR charts deteriorating export performance, notably driven by
Britain’s falling share of export markets: in other words, by
Britain’s failing competitiveness. This worrying trend has not
been offset by the sharp devaluation of the pound that has recently
been experienced. The fact 
<?notus-xml column=1538?>that devaluation has not reversed the trend suggests

Government refer to the wider and broader financial crisis, I ask that

he was hijacked on the question of complacency in respect of the
financial transaction tax, on which we published an extensive report
last year and which we followed up this year. We asked why the
Government have been so supine as not to invoke a legal complaint
against the 11 countries under the enhanced co-operation which are now
moving forward towards the financial transaction tax, with disastrous
consequences for the City of London and, indeed, for financial services
throughout the European Union—not just the United Kingdom. How
happy I was while settling down to the “News Quiz” last
Friday to be rung up by Greg Clark, the Financial Secretary to the
Treasury, and told that the supine Government were indeed
getting up off the floor and making that challenge, broadly
along the lines suggested in our report. I would like an

life gets complicated for the noble Lord, Lord Newby, in particular as
I understand that the Government are going to raise the
legal query under Article 327—a deemed establishment

should be done on the issuance principle introduced at a late stage by
the Commission in its refashioned approach to the financial transaction
tax. Does that make a difference? It certainly does because under both
these items, dealings in shares which have counterparties within the
FTT can require that a charge is made which we would then have to pay
under the FTT. It is not only those which are current but under the new
one that approaches. The point is that under the issuance principle, a
party within the

the time was to urge the then Government of John Major—Sir John
Major as he is now—to make a report on the convergence
procedure. The first time the debate took place, they elected not to do
that but simply to send in the Budget report instead. I complained
mightily, but of course to no avail. All Governments since then have

Noakes:</Member></B> I am very pleased to learn that. I think that
backs up my case for the repeal of Section 5 as having no meaning
whatever. In addition to repealing Section 5, I hope that the
Government will, as part of their current review of EU competences,
also look carefully at whether the economic policy articles of the EU
treaty, which are basically the source of the documents that we are
reviewing today, have any real meaning for the UK. I believe that we
should be seeking to disapply those articles as part of our membership
renegotiation. Some of those articles talk about the co-ordination of
economic policies, but it is clear that the context for them is
economic and monetary union, which has no relevance to us. For example,
the convergence reporting included in the first Motion would be fine if
we were preparing to join the euro, but we are not and I sincerely hope
that we will not.</hs_para>

Harrison, taunted us a little by saying that we would not qualify
anyway. I would point out to him that most of the current members of
the eurozone do not qualify at the moment, so I do not think that is a
particularly good argument. In any event, we are not going to join the
euro, so why are we bothering to submit information that we call a
convergence programme? Under Article 126, member states have to avoid
excessive deficits and submit to monitoring by the Commission, but
under the existing UK protocol we are not subject to any sanctions
whatever for non-compliance. There is no point in submitting
information that simply allows Brussels pen-pushers to find things to
do during the

our economic policy is none of the EU’s business. We should stop
this charade of pretending that the eurozone architecture has some
meaning for us. The economic challenges for the UK have nothing to do
with our convergence with the rest of the EU or whether our economy
complies with eurozone rules. To that end, I find it difficult to
support the sentiments behind the second of the Minister’s
Motions, which are predicated on the relevance of the
reporting and surveillance regimes set up under the European
semester. These may well be relevant to the eurozone—I have no
real view on that—but I am clear that they are not relevant to
us. Of course the UK has an interest in the economic health of
countries within the EU and we have an interest in the stability of the
eurozone, or at least in the avoidance of a disorderly break-up of the
eurozone. However, our interest derives from the fact that European
countries are our trading partners and not from our membership of the
EU. We are always interested in the economic status of countries with
which we trade, whether they are in the EU or not.</hs_para>

Lord, Lord Eatwell, on the importance of the UK being competitive in
export markets on a global basis. However, we should remember that
European countries account for a minority and a diminishing proportion
of our external trade. If we knock out the Rotterdam-Antwerp effect, we
probably export less than 40% of our exports to EU countries at
the moment, and that 40% really only represents five countries that are
important to us. Furthermore, we have a substantial trade deficit with
EU countries— £46 billion in the latest
statistics—and the growth prospects for the EU are at best
weak.</hs_para>

rest of the world is much more important to the UK both in terms of the

Since growth prospects for rest of the world are distinctly more
promising than for the EU, our focus should be on looking not at what
the EU is doing but at what is happening in the rest of the world. The
IMF forecasts for 2014 show the emerging economies powering ahead at a
little short of 6%, the US—a major trading partner for
us—at 3%, but the poor old EU struggling along at around 1%. I

thought that I want to leave with the Minister today is that the tax
mood music is certainly making a better sound than we have heard for
many years but it is not yet playing the tunes that make us dance for
joy. We still have high rates of tax on individuals, including some
very nasty marginal rates in the £110,000 to £120,000
range. The corporation tax destination rate of 20% is great by G20
standards, and was a really encouraging move in the Budget, but it is
not a low rate when compared with the rest of the world. We do not
compete only with the G20 when investment decisions are made. We need
to be competitive in a much broader context and cannot be complacent on
that. Low tax rates—both personal and corporate—are
strongly correlated with economic growth and wealth creation, which
increases tax revenues. High rates do the reverse. Our economy needs

more timely than on previous occasions when we have had this type of

see that the strategy is not working. However, as far as this side of
the House is concerned, we have never believed that the strategy would
work. We did not need to see the evidence that it was not working. We
never thought it could because it was based on three major fallacies: a

<?notus-xml column=1545?>wrong diagnosis of the problem, which led to a
faulty remedy and was linked to an absurd myth about the problems for
future generations. These are three basic errors in thinking that have
led to practical untold misery for millions of our people. I do not

fundamental rethink on these three basic

will quickly go through them. First, what is the problem that caused
the crisis? It was not, as is put about, the profligacy of the
Government. I have been looking at the lovely Green Book that the
Treasury produce and have found a really remarkable fact, which is that
public sector net borrowing, cyclically adjusted, was lower at the
beginning of the financial crisis than in the last year of John
Major’s Government. That is a very important point. So we rule
out government profligacy as the cause of the problem. The cause was
the profligacy of the private sector banks. These banks imploded and
that led to a collapse of private sector spending and a rise in private
sector saving. That is what caused the recession but it is also what
caused the government
deficit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000135" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000135">I
should like to be sure that we are all clear on the fundamental
identity that every A-level student knows, which is that the budget
deficit is automatically, at every moment in time, equal to the private
sector saving plus the balance of payments deficit. The budget deficit
can be reduced only if either private sector saving falls or the
balance of payments improves. Nobody is expecting a big improvement in
the balance of payments so the budget deficit can be improved only if
there is a significant fall in private sector saving. That is the
condition. Of course, that is also the condition for a reduction in
unemployment. Both the things that we are worried about require a fall
in private sector saving. That will simply not happen if the Government
go on depressing the
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000136" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000136">The
only way forward now is less austerity, in order to get private
spending going. In the conditions of a liquidity trap, this has to
involve fiscal policy; it cannot be done by monetary policy alone. Of
course, we have the proposal from Milton Friedman for dealing with the
recession by an increase in government spending, financed by the
central bank. This is the way we should be thinking today. The noble
Lord, Lord Turner, has proposed it; various people have proposed it.
This must be the way forward.</hs_para>

to the public that the extra debt is not a debt owed by the Government
to anybody; it is simply a debt of one bit of the Government to another
bit, which they own. So there is no change in the debt held by the
public. We really must consider going down this route. The only
objection of any validity is that there would then be an increase in
the base money, which, at some future point when people were less
willing to hold base money, could lead to an inflation. Then, of
course, either the Bank of England can sell some of the debt or, which
has a lot to be said for it, the commercial banks can be required to
hold more base money as their reserves, which would improve their
liquidity and
stability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000138" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000138">That
brings me to the third error that is bedevilling this whole debate,
which is that we cannot have this debt because it impoverishes future
generations. You 
<?notus-xml column=1546?>hear this every day on Radio 4. It is a complete
misunderstanding because even the debt that is owed by the Government
to the public is owed to the British public. If there is less
austerity, this higher debt will have been bought out of higher income,
so it will have added to the wealth of future generations. Of course,
at the same time, it will have impoverished them because they will have
to service the debt, but they will be paying themselves and there will
be no net change in the wealth of future generations. This is a
fundamental fallacy and we have to scotch it because it is intolerable
that we should be depressing our economy, depressing business and
causing mass employment because of simple fallacies that are being put
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000139" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000139">Existing
policy is based on these three fallacies. Of course, it is also based
on bad values. It is extraordinary to me that a Government would say
that their overriding objective was to reduce the budget deficit.
Surely that must be the means to some useful end. The useful end must
be a better life for the people, in particular a higher level of
employment. Is there any limit to employment caused by a higher level
of debt? This has been a matter of controversy. The main research that
claimed that there was a limit has now been discredited and it is quite
clear that there is no simple limit to the debt that a country
can sustain if it has its own independent central bank. It is absolute
nonsense to point at any of the euro countries, which are not supported
by an independent central bank, and say that we might have got into the

per annum for five years—that is real government spending on
behalf of our people. It is absolutely horrific to contemplate. If you
think of the cuts we have already had, we are already seeing
major social institutions that we have built up over the years

three fallacies: a faulty diagnosis, a mistaken remedy and a myth about

the view of the Government on these three propositions that we hear on

just a PR exercise to frighten the children? We are in a situation

believing them. How anyone can believe a forecast for five years ahead
I find difficult to imagine. Today’s forecast happily does not
show that we are in recession, but that will be revised in a few
weeks’ time by 0.1% or 0.2 %—who knows? That is
only for this quarter. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, like everyone else
in the Government, keeps telling us that they have cut the deficit by a

forecast that they would eliminate the budget deficit by 2015. It is

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T12:56:33"></hs_TimeCode> previous
Chancellor, my right honourable friend Alistair Darling, like everyone
else, did not see the 2007-08 banking crisis coming, nor the damage
that it would do to our public finances, but in the eye of the
financial storm, he did an excellent job of judging what needed to be
done. He organised the huge recapitalisation of the banks. He sought to
find the most effective balance between policies to repair the public
finances and reduce public debt and also to promote growth. He
recognised that the UK’s ability to finance its ballooning
deficit would require the support of the bond markets, which would need
to be convinced that the Government were prepared to take the tough and
correct measures to achieve those joint objectives. He rightly
anticipated that external events might call for additional rebalancing
of the policy mix, over and above the deployment of automatic
stabilisers. His was a pragmatic and thoughtful response to an
unprecedented crisis, and it commanded broad support at home and
abroad<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T12:56:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000153" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000153">What
happened next? One of the present Chancellor’s first and very
important decisions on coming into office was to ratchet up the
austerity targets and to 
<?notus-xml column=1549?>shun the flexible, carefully nuanced approach of his
predecessor and instead opt to wear a very tight financial
straitjacket. That approach, which we now know as plan A, was given

by that report and the plaudits from the hedge funds and bond investors
in the city and, crucially, strong backing from the IMF, the Chancellor
believed that he had struck exactly the right policy balance between
austerity and growth which would lead to the elimination of the
structural deficit by 2014-15. Crucial to that judgment was the
forecast of strengthening economic growth over that period.</hs_parafo>

we have heard from all sides of the House today, that has not come to

GDP numbers all confirm that the economy is flatlining. The UK is now
the worst performing major economy. As the UK’s performance has
weakened, as each forecast is missed and as austerity measures are
tightened and extended, confidence—an ingredient vital to
economic growth— has evaporated. Domestic consumer spending is
depressed, export performance has fallen well short of forecast and

far reaches of monetary adventurism. He has made it crystal clear that

extended negotiations to secure Mr Carney’s services for the

more supply-side reforms and fiscal measures to stimulate demand to

new governor’s arrival could just provide the opportunity for
the Chancellor to alter course. To do that, though, the Chancellor and
the Prime Minister would have to move off their favourite mantra that
you cannot borrow your way out of debt. In one sense, that particular
fox has already been shot, as the automatic stabilisers have allowed
increased borrowing to fill in the financing hole left by no growth.
The Chancellor now needs to take that lesson one step further and
introduce fiscal measures such as lower NIC and measures to promote
investment in infrastructure and new housing stock. Borrowing to invest
to promote growth will pay back in increased economic activity, greater
confidence and rising tax

Marlesford:</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly support the fundamental
economic strategy of my right honourable friend the Chancellor. On the
other hand, I am not wholly happy with the way in which he has been
attempting to carry it out. The objectives are right but the methods
are rather questionable.</hs_para>

reduce the deficit, and particularly government spending in many areas,
which I support. There is no doubt at all that the expenditure on the
whole welfare area has been wildly out of control, and it absolutely
has to be gripped. Equally, there is no doubt that growth will come
from actual economic activity on the ground.</hs_para>

of the problem is caused by the behaviour of the banks. I give credit
to Alistair Darling for the way in which he handled the crisis. The
mistake was then to use, or to expect to be able to use, the
banks as a means of generating growth in the economy through
quantitative easing. Far from lending the money that they had been
supplied, they used it to reinforce their extremely fragile balance
sheets, so QE did not achieve the objectives that the then Chancellor
hoped for. The Chancellor should probably have abandoned at a much
earlier stage what was effectively his support of the banks and their
balance sheets. Their behaviour in the past few years since the crisis
has been lamentable. It has been as unethical, selfish and greedy as
ever, and it has been incompetent.</hs_para>

regard to the stimulation of the economy, the time has come for more
direct government expenditure on our infrastructure. There are masses
of things that can be done. I am of course not talking about nonsenses
such as £30 billion on HS2, which is wildly outside any
parameter of time and is most unlikely to produce any useful return for
the taxpayer or the nation. I am talking about things such as housing,
road construction and the maintenance of our national infrastructure,
because that is true investment. Giving banks more money through
quantitative easing to restore their balance sheets is not true

Chancellor’s tax policies in one important area have been
unwise. I am talking about the petrol tax. The Chancellor has already
forgone some £1.5 billion of revenue by not increasing the
petrol tax as planned. 
<?notus-xml column=1552?>The extraordinary thing to me is that the petrol tax
figure that we are talking about is always about 3p per litre, and that
alone costs £500 billion a year, yet the price of petrol at the
pump varies by more than that. The price at the pump basically goes up
and down according to the price of oil. The Chancellor has made a huge
mistake in effectively wasting the opportunity cost of the petrol tax.
I hope that as soon as the time is appropriate he will go back and
change that particular
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000172" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000172">I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Harrison—I sit under his
distinguished chairmanship on Sub-Committee A of the European Union
Select Committee—that the single market in Europe is very
important and should be enhanced and nurtured. However, I do not
believe that, for strategic planning, Britain can rely on Europe for
the future. Europe is in a frightful mess. People say that 40% of our
exports go to Europe; that may be. What we should be doing is switching
our effort into markets where we can compete and which are expanding,
such as Asia, the United States and Latin America, and not pinning our
hopes on Europe, because in Europe there is very little hope. My worry
is that the European Commission has proved itself to be incompetent in
offering advice to member states on how to run their economies. During
the euro crisis, it came to the realisation—very late, but in a
big way—that it had been a great mistake to confuse the toxic
debt of banks with the toxicity of sovereign debt, and decided that
they should not be confused.</hs_para>

what<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:13:21"></hs_TimeCode> happened
with Cyprus. The European Commission, having made the mistake with the
wretched Irish, the Spaniards and the Greeks of making them take the
bank debt on to the government books, the very next thing was what
happened in Cyprus. That is an example of unparalleled incompetence.
What happened was that the Cyprus Government came forward with a plan
to rescue their banking sector. Of course, they would come forward with
whatever they thought suited themselves and their friends, perhaps
including the Russian oligarchs. The plan that they came forward with
involved raiding the balances of deposits in banks. It had been
for some while a crucial component of confidence in the banking
system throughout the EU that deposits in individual regulated
lending institutions—banks, primarily—were underwritten
up to €100,000. My criticism is that the attempt to sweep that
aside so that the small depositors in Cyprus would pay their
share—although I could quite see the Cypriots putting that
forward—was signed off by the troika of the European Commission,
the European Central Bank and, just to remind the noble Lord,
Lord Layard, who is so keen on it,the IMF. Those three signed off on a
policy that will for many decades, I suspect, put a deep suspicion in
people’s minds about lending to
banks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:13:54"></hs_TimeCode>. The
United States has a much prouder record of protecting depositors in
banks. I believe that one of the roles of the state is always to
protect small depositors in a financial system.</hs_para>

was a very depressing example, and one reason why I am rather gloomy
about Europe being able to work out under the semester what its
progress is to be. It is still wrestling with the crucial question,
which applies primarily to the euro area, of whether there 
<?notus-xml column=1553?>can or should be mutualisation of debt. Is it possible to have a
Eurobond, a bond issued by the European Central Bank, to fund
individual countries’ Governments and is underwritten centrally?
For how much can this be done? We are not even clear what the total
sovereign debt of the euro area is at the moment. It is very doubtful
whether this Eurobond will work. There is a thought about having two
sorts of bonds: a blue bond, an ECB-guaranteed bond for national
Governments, and a red bond, which national Governments would issue.
This strikes me as a very questionable approach. What is it trying to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:14:52"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

the areas in which a great deal more care and thought is needed for us
to have confidence. The way in which the Europeans are organising
themselves inside the euro area is right. Another very good example,
which our committee has been looking at, is the banking union. When we
went to Brussels, we found that the European Commission was confusing
the regulation of banks and the supervision of banks. Regulation is
making the rules; supervising is making sure that they are carried out.
The first is much easier to do than the second. The European Central
Bank is now struggling manfully to supervise some 4,000 banks. That is
asking a lot when you bear in mind that even the managements of
banks—this applied in America and in Britain—did not know
what was happening inside the banks. One of the huge problems has been
the inability of the banks to know what their real debts are.</hs_para>

mentioned before the £55 billion of credit card debt that will
not be repaid because it is not what you and I spend on our credit
cards and pay off every month. It is incurred when people have used
credit cards to borrow at high rates of interest, perhaps between 17%
and 25%, and in no way can the sort of people who borrow pay it off.
That £55 billion is a significant figure, and it is for British
banks alone. Therefore, we have to be pretty sceptical. I agree with
the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, that we cannot separate ourselves; we
must be involved. Fortunately, the European Banking Authority, a very
important regulation-forming body, is in
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:16:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000177" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000177">The
financial transaction tax has been mentioned. It is an absurd diversion
that the European Union is still pushing for it when it is absolutely
clear that most of the world will not go for it. The only way that a
financial transaction tax could work would be on a global
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:17:14"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, I have very significant doubts as to whether the competence
at the moment of the authorities in Europe should enable us or allow us
to put a great deal of confidence in our economy being dependent on
Europe.</hs_para>

McFall of Alcluith:</Member></B> My Lords, in his manifesto defining
the Mais lecture of February 2010, the Chancellor, just before he
assumed office, announced a new macroeconomic and financial policy. He
asserted that economic theory and, indeed, evidence suggested that
tight fiscal policy would lead to recovery. He embraced the notion of
austerity politics, and the imprimatur of both the Chancellor and the
Prime Minister was very firmly on that phrase, “austerity
politics”.</hs_para>

youth unemployment of 1 million, which is unacceptably high, child
poverty levels ballooning, and almost zero growth. Notwithstanding

the past 18 months we have seen growth of 0.4%, that works out at a

solely down to the effect of the Olympics. As my noble friend has said,
the markets have now turned against the Chancellor. The comments of
Bill Gross of PIMCO, which has the biggest bond fund of $300
trillion, made it very clear that the austerity policy does not lead to
growth in the short term. As he asserted, the Government need to spend
money. He also said that it was a mistake to assume that the bond

belt-tightening.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000181" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000181">Given

70% it is today as a result of the financial crisis, yet with that debt

the Conservative Government, when public spending was on average 43.3%

know that in politics change is the law of life. The late US President
John F Kennedy said that those who look only to the past or present are
certain to miss the future. I suggest that by ditching the cruel hoax
of austerity politics—austerity is a hoax because it has been
proved that it does not work, and cruel because it hurts those who are

matter. I also understand why she does not see why these Motions are
necessary anyway as far as Europe is concerned. My noble friend Lord
Barnett did not doubt that the Motions might be necessary but on the

is fundamental is the concern about where the economy is at the present
time and what we are reporting to Europe about the state of the British
economy. It is quite clear that every target that the Chancellor set
himself in 2010 has been missed and that the timetable for recovery has
already been elongated by several years. As my noble friend Lord
Barnett indicated, it is now expected that it will be at least 2018
before the deficit will have been reduced.</hs_para>

the Minister stated that one of his items would bring confidence. As in
all economic debates about the position of the economy and the balance
of payments, confidence is of great importance. The Chancellor chose
one measurement of it, Britain’s 
<?notus-xml column=1556?>AAA credit rating. We saw Moody’s going first and now Fitch has
stripped away the AAA credit rating. What is reflected in that is a
degree—if the Chancellor was right to put so much importance on
them—of erosion of confidence. My noble friend Lord Barnett said
that the reason for that is pessimism about growth. That issue was
reflected, particularly on this side of the House, in every aspect of
the debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000191" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000191">My
noble friend Lord Hollick identified another area in which confidence
is being eroded. The intellectual support for the Chancellor’s
policy put forward by Reinhart and Rogoff has been destroyed by the
indications of the research and the propositions are inherently faulty.
That intellectual prop having gone, what is in its place? My noble
friend Lord Layard identified these issues with the greatest clarity.
What there is is a commitment to a right-wing ideology that does not
need too much in the way of intellectual support. After all, we have
been through these issues before under Conservative Governments. It is
about the creation of the virtues of the smaller state. In the
Government’s drive towards creating the smaller state, which my
noble friend Lord Layard identified has little to do with whether
economic growth can be produced or whether we can tackle the
fundamental issues of the economy, the price is being paid not by
millionaires who are being cushioned by taxation relief but in
increasing unemployment and low wages for those who are in employment.
It is already recognised that wages will have dropped by 2.4% this last
year. That is the cost to the people in work. Meanwhile, the
Government have some figure of the number of jobs being created by the
private sector. We know what a lot of these jobs are: they are
concealed unemployment. They are part-time jobs that give no
opportunity for people to work longer hours; part-time jobs on low pay
in which people are still struggling—although in work—to
make ends meet. Those people are paying the price for this
Government’s

extraordinary low growth: 0.8% in three years since 2010—which,
of course, we have had instead of the predicted 5.3%. This all reflects
the absence of demand, but it is the Government who have been stripping
demand out of the economy. Quantitative easing has not produced demand
in the economy because of what quantitative easing is being used for.
The banks, mindful of the catastrophe that they have gone through and
the total lack of confidence in the way in which they perform their
roles, use quantitative easing in order to ensure that their balance
sheets look suitably robust. Hence we have the clear indication that
the Co-operative Bank was not prepared to take on 600 additional

My noble friend Lord

introduced that concept in what was a very powerful speech indicating
what this House can contribute to the economic debate as far as Europe
is concerned. However, complacency is the one charge I would not lay
against the Government. They have been active enough, but in a way that
has hindered growth rather than promoting it. There is no room for
complacency. Make no mistakes about this situation; nothing happens
automatically to resume growth. Ask the Japanese about the absence of
growth and a flatlining economy, and how long it can last. One is all

balancing the economy, public sector cuts have ensured that employment
in the public sector has been reduced. Has the private sector picked up
those jobs? Figures would suggest so, except for two features. First,
there are the constant complaints on all sides that the jobs people are
taking up are too limited to sustain their living standards, and
secondly, there is a decline in productivity. What does that say about
the quality of jobs that are being created when we are facing a decline
in productivity? In the opening speech from this side my noble friend
Lord Eatwell explained quite specifically the significance of trade,
and my noble friend Lord Harrison also emphasised it. With our low
productivity, we are in a fairly serious balance of payments position.
It is all right to say, “Well, of course we ought not to rely on
the European Community, with all the difficulties it
has”. However, we are not competing well in the rest of
the world either, because we have not had the necessary
concentration on and investment in the development of skills and
ability and of course the development of increased productivity through
investment in new

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have taken
part in today’s debate. As the noble Lord, Lord Davies, said, we
have covered everything, from macroeconomic theory to House of Lords

raised as I

will start with the noble Lords, Lord Eatwell and Lord Barnett, who
both discussed growth, and in particular the growth forecast. The noble
Lord, Lord Eatwell, suggested that the growth forecasts were wrong for
theoretical reasons and because the assumptions 
<?notus-xml column=1558?>that were made might be unsustainable. The noble
Lord, Lord, Barnett, had a more fundamental problem, which was that he
does not believe any growth forecasts, almost by definition. We see in
today’s figures, with the 0.3% increase in GDP in the first
quarter, that, as they say, if present trends continue the OBR will
have got it wrong again. This time, however, it will have got it wrong
on the downside instead of the upside. I hope we will not be too
unhappy in those circumstances if they perhaps do not get it right. I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, that growth figures, or indeed
any forecasts for five years ahead, have to be treated with a very
large pinch of salt. However, there are only two alternatives. Either
you do your best and work on the best that you can do, or you throw
your hands up in horror. On balance, the Government prefer to do the
former<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:37:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

assertion of the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, that everything was fine in
2010, the economy was growing by 2%, and that if only the policies that
were in operation then had been carried on, growth would have continued
and possibly increased. In 2009-10 the borrowing was £158.9
billion, some 11.2% of GDP. At the time, my colleagues and I supported
that borrowing on the basis that the Government were dealing with what
Vince Cable called “a massive heart attack” to the
economy, and so this had to be dealt with by very significant public
expenditure to prevent a total collapse, and in particular, to shore up
the banks. What I cannot accept is that that level of borrowing was
sustainable in the medium term, and neither could Alistair Darling. A
number of noble Lords have spoken in support of Alistair
Darling’s economic policies, but remember that they were in two
parts. There was a high level of immediate expenditure, but we passed a
Bill that would have required by law the Labour Government, had they
been re-elected, to halve the deficit by the current financial year.
Does anybody believe that if Mr Darling had been in power, he could
have continued putting money into the economy at anything like the rate
he did in 2009-10 if he wanted to meet that outcome? It is inherently
implausible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:40:03"></hs_TimeCode>. The
question that was being debated as we reached the election in 2010 was
not whether there would have to be reductions in public expenditure,
but purely about their scale and size. Therefore, the suggestion that
all was well in 2010 and that we could have continued with high levels
of growth by pushing public sector borrowing along at an unsustainable
level does not hold
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:40:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000200" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000200"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Eatwell" PimsId="3069" UID="13042554000413" xid="1203" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000413">Lord
Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord has rather ably
misrepresented what I said. I said that the economy was growing at 2%,
which it was, and that the 2% growth would lead to a fall in
the deficit, which it did. I did not say that at the time there was a
need to increase the deficit. What happened was the destruction of
business confidence by the foolish remarks of the new Chancellor of the
Exchequer—the comparisons with Greece and so on—that led
to a collapse in private sector investment and
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:41:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000201" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000201"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13042554000414" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000414">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, businessmen take some notice of
politicians, but they do not make investment decisions purely—or
even largely—on what politicians say. They look around the
market and see what is 
<?notus-xml column=1559?>happening elsewhere in the world. The speech of the
noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, was notable in a number of respects. One was
that although he used the word “Europe” in his first and
last sentences, he did not refer at all to the crisis in the eurozone
and to the fact, supported by the OBR, that one of the greatest
problems and brakes on growth in the UK has been what happened to the
eurozone. It is a crisis in which we had no part and that we were
obviously unable to deal with. The eurozone countries are dealing with
it
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:42:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000202" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000202">I
will move to an area where I have a greater degree of agreement with
the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. It is the importance now of
infrastructure expenditure as a source of growth going forward. There
are two elements that are linked but separate. One is non-housing
infrastructure and the other is housing infrastructure. On non-housing
infrastructure, as the noble Lord will be aware, the Government have
made available up to £40 billion of guarantees to enable private
sector investment in key infrastructure. He will have seen that the
policy bore fruit yesterday with the announcement that the Drax power
station is using the facility to enable it to invest £75 million
in upgrading the station. We hope and expect that this will be the
first of many such
deals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:43:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000203" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000203">Housing
is a major problem. It was a major problem during the previous
Parliament and remains so, to the extent that the demand for new
housing is increasing by about 250,000 units a year. Nothing like that
amount of housing has been built for many years. The Government are
attempting to deal with this with a three-pronged approach. First, we
will make it easier to get planning permission for new housing
development. Secondly, we will increase demand. This is why we are
supporting first-time buyers and others who want to take out mortgages
in circumstances where the banks are requiring prohibitively large
deposits from most people. Thirdly, we will improve the supply of
housing. That is why, in addition to the £40 billion
guarantee for other infrastructure, we have in place a £10
billion guarantee programme for
housing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:44:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042554000204" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-0001.htm#13042554000204">There
remains a major problem with getting the banks involved in funding
developers, particularly small developers, and I am engaged in
discussions with the BBA to see whether we can help. However, in
terms of government support for new investment, both for
housing and general infrastructure, which the noble Lord, Lord McFall,
suggested we should be doing, I remind him that we have established the
Green Investment Bank. We are also establishing a small business bank.
This is a degree of banking activism that was absent during the time of
the previous
Government.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_25_PT_1/2CB9EE9D1A2720D82762C37DB879A612C1987D61" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 April 2013">Thursday,

aspects of the development of the EU. I will attempt to deal with some

For example, the PM, with 11 other heads of government, signed a letter
in advance of a recent European Council calling for ambitious EU-level
reforms. Government Ministers regularly meet their opposite numbers
from like-minded 
<?notus-xml column=1560?>countries. I have explained before how my colleague Ed Davey established

noble Lord also talked about trade. The collapse of the Doha round
meant that we had to switch attention to bilateral trade agreements. As
he knows, many such negotiations are either concluded or under way.
There is new impetus for an EU-US trade agreement. We are continuing to
try to conclude an EU-India agreement, as well as one with Canada, and
we have already signed a number of free trade agreements, including
with South Korea, which will be of considerable benefit in improving
trade. Of course, as the EU said in its assessment of the way in which
we are dealing with our current difficulties, export volumes grew 3.3%
between 2007 and 2011, at a time when overall GDP contracted.

earlier stage would have stopped a very significant move in many
European countries that was led by the trade union movement, which is

Annual Growth Survey which are in line with the Government’s
domestic growth agenda; supports the Government’s view that it
is important to focus on implementation of existing reform commitments;
agrees that European Union Member States should continue on the path of
growth-friendly fiscal consolidation and increasing competitiveness to
support growth and jobs; supports the Alert Mechanism Report and the
Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure as a means of strengthening European
economic governance, particularly in the euro area; and supports the
Government’s view that is it is right for euro area countries to
be subject to more binding surveillance of macro-economic imbalances,
with the prospect of sanctions for failing to take corrective
action.</hs_Question></NewDebate>

the Government’s belief that Tom Winsor’s report as a

the Government’s response to that consultation exercise, which

have carefully considered the detailed issues that were raised in
response to the consultation. My overriding concern has been to
establish a pay review body that is able to take as wide a view of
police remuneration as possible to act in a strategic forward-looking
manner and not to be constrained by the inefficiencies and time delays
brought about by the current system of collective bargaining. This is
in keeping with the thrust of Tom Winsor’s recommendations. The
new review body will make recommendations on police officer
remuneration up to and including the rank of chief superintendent. The
Senior Salaries Review Body will make recommendations on chief officer
pay.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042549000121" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425-wms0001.htm#13042549000121">The
changes to the way in which police pay and conditions are determined is
part of a wider programme of police reform that includes the
introduction of police and crime commissioners, the creation of the
College of Policing, the establishment of the National Crime Agency,
and legislating to ensure a more independent HM Inspectorate of
Constabulary. Police officers deserve to have pay and workforce
arrangements that recognise the vital role they play in fighting crime
and keeping the public safe, and enable them to deliver effectively for
the public. The Police Remuneration Review Body will help deliver this
and to provide pay and conditions that are not only fair to police
officers, but are fair to the public as

benefit or separate scheme like the Social Fund and the process
reflects this. They are an advance of the claimant’s benefit.
Where the claimant tells us they are in financial need (either at the
start of their claim or those who have had a change of circumstances
resulting in a significant increase in their benefit) then DWP staff
will consider a short-term benefit advance where appropriate. This will
most commonly happen at the new claims stage when staff are discussing
with the claimant what will happen next. DWP endeavours to pay any
benefit due where possible, and in many cases this is
happening.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13042559000577" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130425w0001.htm#13042559000577">British

little effect other than to incur unnecessary cost for public
authorities and the legal aid scheme. It is important that we take
steps to address this issue in order to preserve valuable court and
judicial time, drive greater efficiency, focus legal aid resources on
cases that really require it and increase public confidence in the
legal aid scheme. We therefore propose that providers should be paid
for work carried out on application for permission only if permission
is granted by the court. We estimate that there will be a saving of
approximately £1 million per annum as a result of approximately
800 fewer cases being funded as a result of this

Warsi:</Member> No comprehensive quantitative data exist on the extent
of the use of sexual violence as an instrument of war in Syria.
However, anecdotal and qualitative reports from the UN and
non-governmental organisations suggest high numbers of cases of sexual
violence perpetrated as part of the ongoing conflict. The latest UN
Commission of Inquiry of 18 February 2013 reports that sexual violence
has been perpetrated against men, women and children, particularly in
detention facilities and during house searches. The UK is determined to
set a lead in providing support to survivors and working to hold
perpetrators to account, as part of my right honourable friend the
Foreign Secretary’s personal initiative on Preventing Sexual
Violence in Conflict.</hs_para>
