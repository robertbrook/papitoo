Government are committed to ensuring that each and every one
of the roughly one in 10 adults in this country who are veterans
receive the support they require from across the whole of Government.
Responsibility for delivering mental health support lies with the
Department of Health, with which the Ministry of Defence
works closely. Together we are providing greater access to mental
health care for the first six months after discharge, an increase in
the number of veterans mental health professionals, a 24-hour helpline
in partnership with Combat Stress, and an online mental health support
and advice website called the Big White
Wall.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304154000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0001.htm#1304154000032"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chi Onwurah" PimsId="5617" UID="1304154000331" xid="1211" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0001.htm#1304154000331">Chi

women, proportionally, than any other region in the country, so I am
pleased to say that we have award-winning mental health services such
as a veterans well-being assessment and liaison pilot, in partnership
with Combat Stress and the Royal British Legion. They expect a surge in
referrals as our troops withdraw from Afghanistan next year, but the
pilot ends in March. What plans does the Minister have to meet the
expected increase in demand for mental health
services?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304154000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0001.htm#1304154000033"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Francois" PimsId="3316" UID="1304154000332" xid="216" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0001.htm#1304154000332">Mr

for the Department of Health, with which we work closely, but I take
the whole issue very seriously, and I have tried personally to meet as
many people as I can who are involved in this issue, for instance Sir
Simon Wessely at King’s, Andrew Cameron at Combat Stress and Dr
Hugh Milroy at Veterans Aid. The Government will continue to reach out
to these and other experts to provide the right care for those to whom
we owe such a debt of gratitude.</hs_Para>

members of the Territorial Army and other reservists who have come back

Francois:</Member></B> I understand the issue that my hon. Friend
raises. Like him, I pay tribute to the excellent “Fighting
Fit” report, which addressed mental health for both serving
personnel and veterans. He may be aware that there was a lacuna a few
years ago in that reservists returning from theatre were not subject to
the same decompression package as regulars and did not necessarily
receive the same mental health briefings as regular troops. We have
changed that so that reservists coming back from theatre get the same

Government’s work to support the armed forces covenant was set
out in the armed forces covenant annual report, which was laid before
the House in December 2012. Since then, new measures have included the
introduction of the armed forces independence payment, which is not
taxable or means tested, as well as the introduction of the new defence
discount service and the recent Budget announcement of further LIBOR
fines funding for service charities. The Cabinet Sub-Committee on the
Armed Forces Covenant, on which I sit, was established to ensure that
momentum is maintained, and it continues to provide a forum in which

response, because the devolution of blame for the policy overlaps with
how the Government have behaved over the Armed Forces Pay Review Body

Budget said that it would be paid, but the detail shows that it will
start on 1 May not 1 April, and will therefore run for only 11 months,
not 12. This means our forces are getting £2.6 million less than
was promised, or intended by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body. Could

</B>I announced to the House last May that we had eliminated the black
hole in the finances of the Ministry of Defence that we inherited from
the Labour party, and had brought the Defence budget into balance.
Since then, on the one hand, we have been required to make further
budget reductions in 2013-14 and 2014-15 of £1.2 billion in
total as a result of the Chancellor’s announcements at autumn
statement 2012 and Budget 2013; on the other hand, we have made further
savings through efficiency and renegotiation of contracts and have been
granted exceptional levels of end-year flexibility by the Treasury to
carry forward 100% of our 2012-13 underspend, including unneeded
contingency provisions, into 2013-14 and 2014-15. In consequence, we

first is that there has been a plethora of applications for wind

today had disappeared before we reached this point in proceedings. I
have indeed seen 
<?notus-xml column=18?>the recommendations of the House of Lords report. As
my hon. Friend will know, the Government’s position is clear:
Scotland benefits from being part of the United Kingdom and the United
Kingdom benefits from having Scotland in it. We are confident that the
Scottish people will agree. However, in the event that they voted to
leave the United Kingdom, the referendum, rather than being the point
at which Scotland would leave the Union, would mark the beginning of a
lengthy and extremely complex set of negotiations between the Scottish
and UK Governments on the terms of independence. If an independent
Scotland wanted to change the arrangements for the UK’s nuclear
deterrent, the considerable costs, complexity and time scale involved
in delivering alternative arrangements would inevitably be a major
feature of the negotiations. It is therefore incorrect to suggest the
need for an immediately deliverable contingency plan for the deterrent.
However, the House will be aware that the MOD plans for a huge range of
contingencies. For reasons of national security, we do not comment
publicly on plans relating to the nuclear
deterrent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T15:23:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304154000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0001.htm#1304154000144"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Kevan Jones" PimsId="1213" UID="1304154000438" xid="318" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0001.htm#1304154000438"><B>Mr

to meet the additional reductions in the budget announced by the
Chancellor in the autumn statement and the Budget, which is why we are
able to meet those requirements without cutting into the delivery of
our core outputs in 2013-14 and 2014-15. To amplify the point about the
pay settlement that is effective from 1 May, I will say this: the
practical reality is that the MOD’s pay system is quite fragile,

significantly high-risk. It would introduce a significant risk of a

respect to Leeds general infirmary, there are three issues that the

children’s heart services at Leeds on 28 March; was the decision
handled in the best way possible; and, given his public comments, is it
appropriate for Professor Sir Roger Boyle to have a continuing role in
the Safe and Sustainable review of children’s heart

was the right decision made? The answer is categorically yes. The
principle of “first do no harm” must run through the very
heart of the NHS. If there is evidence that patient safety is at risk,
it is absolutely right that the NHS acts quickly and decisively to
prevent harm to patients. However difficult or controversial, we must
never repeat the mistakes made at both Mid Staffs and Bristol, where
arguments over the quality of data prevented action that could have
saved patients’
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T15:38:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304154000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0001.htm#1304154000183">Secondly,
was the decision handled properly? On 26 and 27 March, Sir
Bruce Keogh, NHS England’s medical director, was given a range
of critical information about the quality of care at Leeds: statistical
data that indicated higher than expected mortality rates; concerns
about staffing rotas; and further concerns from parents and a national
charity about the way the most complex cases were referred. With the
agreement of the LGI, Sir Bruce took the entirely appropriate
decision to suspend children’s heart surgery while further
investigations were made. The families were informed on the day the
decision was taken to suspend services, 28
March<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T15:39:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304154000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0001.htm#1304154000184">On

third question is whether, in the light of his recent comments,
Professor Sir Roger Boyle can have a continuing role in the Safe and
Sustainable process. Sir Roger is one of our leading heart
surgeons. He did the right thing in informing Sir Bruce of his concerns
over Leeds’ mortality data. He has also played an important role
as an adviser to the Safe and Sustainable review of children’s
heart services. However, it is the view of Sir Bruce Keogh, with which
I concur fully, that Sir Roger’s comments to the media on 11
April could be seen as prejudging any future conclusions of that
review. It is therefore right that Sir Roger plays no further role in
its

Roger leaked data that were unverified to argue for the suspension of

“appalling” by their author. The information was
inaccurate and, when corrected, demonstrated that the Leeds unit was
safe. In fact, it showed that it is in a similar position to the units
at Guy’s and Alder Hey. Why did Sir Roger not recommend the
suspension of surgery at those units? Is it because those are the ones
that he and the Safe and Sustainable review recommended as designated
centres?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304154000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0001.htm#1304154000188">Furthermore<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T15:41:59"></hs_TimeCode>,

bias against Leeds and were irresponsible in respect of parents whose

predetermined manner? Is it not vital to put the patient’s
interests first, rather than NHS politics? Does my right hon. Friend
agree that Leeds has been treated disproportionately when compared with
other units that have similar figures? Is he aware that there are
reports of surgeons being anxious about providing data for fear of
reprisals? Is there not an urgent need for the Independent
Reconfiguration Panel to report to resolve the uncertainty that exists
across the country with regard to children’s heart surgery? Is
it not time to give serious consideration to the proposal that both
Leeds and Newcastle should stay open, which is supported by clinicians

locums on the staff rota who may or may not have been up to the

genuine concerns that led to his decision. But I hope the fact that
surgery was restarted on 10 April will assuage my hon. Friend’s

agree that patient safety must always come first, and not NHS or
national politics or whatever it may be, that also means that sometimes
difficult decisions have to be taken. What happened at Mid Staffs,
where we had a big argument about data that meant nothing happened for

whether he gave his approval to suspend surgery there. If so, was he
satisfied that the data presented were accurate and had clinical
support? On the issue of data, why did it take this recent episode at
Leeds for the information to be released into the public

does the Secretary of State accept that the suspension of surgery, with

suspend surgery so soon after the High Court’s ruling caused a

seriously have wanted anything different to happen? If the NHS
nationally is informed of data that show that mortality rates at a
particular hospital could be up to three times higher than they should
be, would he sanction the continuation of surgery, or would he say,
“We need to get to the bottom of the statistics before deciding
whether there will be any more operations”? If he is saying that
he would have wanted surgery to continue, I put it to him that he and
his party have learned nothing from the lessons of Bristol and nothing

Bristol and Mid Staffs by not acting when data suggested that there

had to travel further. The decision to suspend the Leeds unit created
that very situation. The Secretary of State needs to acknowledge that
children could, as it turns out, have been put at risk unnecessarily by
closing a unit that was in fact safe, because they would have had to
travel further, which for very ill babies is a risk in itself. At the
heart of this has been a lack of transparency and a failure to put
information into the public domain. I have had to table parliamentary
questions to try to get information about what is happening. Nobody
wants an unsafe situation. Will the Secretary of State now commit to

data transparency and because the Government have been encouraging
people to come forward if they have concerns about things going wrong.
As a result, we were presented with data on the basis of which the NHS
director decided that the safe and sensible thing to do was to suspend
surgery while we got to the bottom of these data, which could have
demonstrated some very serious outcomes. We need to take good advice
from clinicians about the balance of risk. Yes, there might be some
risks with people having to travel further for the surgery, but surely
the risks are much greater if potentially unsafe operations are allowed
to continue. That was why, on that balance of risk, it was decided to
suspend surgery at Leeds until we could get to the bottom of whether

about the distances that they would have had to travel if Leeds had not
reopened. That possibility, which we had previously mentioned, became a
reality. Sir Roger has now been suspended from the review, but he had

renown, in which the people of Yorkshire have tremendous faith, but in

fine hospital and a safe hospital, but data were presented to the NHS
medical director that said that mortality rates there for
children’s heart surgery were two and three quarter times higher
than should be expected. In that situation, there is of course a great
deal of inconvenience and worry caused by a decision to suspend
surgery, but I would rather have that inconvenience and worry than
continue with surgery when we have not got to the bottom of whether

is right that he does not take any further role in that, and we will be
getting independent advice on whether Safe and Sustainable made the
right recommendations, which I shall consider before making any

footwork. I am absolutely clear that if anyone, anywhere in the NHS,
has concerns about safety and if the view of the NHS medical director

suspend surgery at that institution, I will support the NHS medical

possible to their home. All other things being equal, it makes sense
for people to be treated where it is easy for friends and family to
visit them, as that can aid recuperation and convalescence. When more
complex surgery is required, however, there is clinical evidence that
mortality rates are better if we specialise surgery in a fewer number
of centres. That is the debate that we are having about

the heart of this is a change happening in the NHS, where heart surgery
is leading the way and we are discovering that we can make dramatic
improvements to mortality rates. It has happened in heart surgery,
where we have moved from being one of the worst performers in Europe to
one of the best, because of the collection of risk-adjusted data. That
has now been extended to cancer outcomes and to a total of
10 specialities. We shall gradually collect that data over
the next two years, which will allow peer review in a way that cannot
normally happen. It is a big change and part of the issue was that the
hospital in Leeds did not realise how seriously the data would be
taken, which may have meant that it did not supply as complete data as
it should have, and that led to the problem. There is a big change, but

Syria, the right hon. Gentleman asked about discussions on the transfer
of weapons. We had a long discussion about Syria at the G8 and with the
Russian Foreign and Defence Ministers when they made a bilateral visit
here on 13 March. So in the past month we have had two substantial
rounds of discussions with Russian Ministers—indeed, three
rounds in just over a month. Of course we discussed the continued flow
of weapons to the regime in Syria. Part of the problem is that the
regime can continue to receive weapons, but many moderate figures in
opposition groups say that they cannot obtain
them<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304154000285" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0001.htm#1304154000285">What
the Prime Minister said last month about the possibility that we might
have to do more is very much what I am saying here and what I said in
my last statement—that our policy cannot be static. He said, and
I repeated in the statement, that we have not taken any decision about
arming the opposition ourselves. There are legitimate arguments against
that. They have sometimes been put in the House, and the right hon.
Gentleman has raised some of them. If we were to take that step, we
would have to assure ourselves to the maximum degree possible not only
of the international legal position, but that the weapons could not be
misused by others for whom they were not intended. Those are major
considerations<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304154000286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0001.htm#1304154000286">It
must also be a major consideration that we currently face a
humanitarian catastrophe, with tens of thousands of people being killed
and millions in desperate need. A regime that is not bringing the
conflict to an end can get weapons and extremists can get weapons, but
people who are in favour of a free, democratic and moderate Syria find
it very difficult to do so. We all have to ask ourselves how long we
can go on with that situation if the conflict continues and if it
continues to get worse. Of course, what we need most of all is a
diplomatic and political settlement. Giving additional assistance to
the National Coalition is part of putting pressure on the regime to
come to a political
settlement<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

our discussions with Russia about that, we have discussed with our

nor the UK, has yet succeeded in agreeing with Russia the mechanism to
bring that about. A United Nations Security Council resolution would,
in our view, be the appropriate mechanism, but Russia and China have
vetoed that in the past and would do so again under current
circumstances. It could come about through each of the countries
involved—through us, the United States, the Russians and
others—putting pressure on all the parties involved to negotiate
that. We are ready to do so. We are always doing that with the national
coalition, but sufficient pressure has not been put on the regime to do
that, so we will always work hard on a diplomatic and negotiated way
forward. In the absence of that, we have to do what we can to save

discuss that with the new Chinese leadership over the next couple of

Hague:</Member></B> The answer, of course, is a mixture. I believe that
the National Coalition, which we met last week—we met the Prime
Minister designate, two of the Vice-Presidents and, indeed, the
President, Mr al-Khatib, whom I talked with on the phone—is
sincere in its commitment to democracy and human rights and to the
inclusion of Syria’s very varied communities in the
country’s future. I have met them and discussed that a
sufficient number of times to be sure of that answer. There are
extremist groups, however, and the longer this goes on the greater the
risk that they will gain more support. Estimates of the number of
fighters in the al-Nusra Front, which the shadow Foreign Secretary
referred to, are in the low thousands, but that is still thousands. The
number of fighters supporting various opposition groups is likely to be

international legal considerations. It would also require the
participation of aircraft on a very large scale, so the decision would
essentially be one for the United States, given the scale required. No

increased resources. As my hon. Friend will know, we allocated in the
strategic defence and security review an additional £650 million
to developing our capabilities in the cyber area. One of the things
that I discussed with my G8 colleagues is the setting up of our own
cyber capability centre, which they can take part in and contribute to.
I am satisfied that we are devoting the necessary resources. I think
that, around the world, countries are in different stages of waking up
to the scale of this threat. I discussed it with the South Korean
Foreign Minister this morning and I welcome the fact that, later this
year, they will hold the next international cyber conference, following
on from the series that I started in 2011, to raise our awareness and

to North Korea. I am sure that the Foreign Secretary accepts the

was a major conflict on the Korean peninsula, the Chinese Government

Korean peninsula would be deeply alarming to the whole world. China, as
a close neighbour, would be particularly concerned. That is always a
factor in China’s foreign policy calculations in such matters. I
welcome China’s agreement to UN resolution 2094, because it is
evidence that it sees that the avoidance of such conflict involves
additional pressure on the DPRK, although in

the Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin), who is no longer in

for Foreign Secretaries to express complete confidence in a happy

international community is united on both those issues, and given that
unity it would be wholly irrational on the part of North Korea
or Iran to continue down the path they are following at the moment. One
cannot, of course, rule out miscalculations and sometimes
irrationality, but I am at least confident that all countries that

Korea, and on Iran we work as the E3 plus 3, which includes all five

will promote growth and reward work. Unlike the Opposition, those of us

steps to make ourselves more competitive and help people with the cost
of living, and that is what we will do in the Bill. I will happily take
interventions this afternoon, but to give some structure to my speech
it is perhaps worth while my laying out to the Chamber the order in

measures that will support growth and enterprise, then the measures
that will tackle avoidance and evasion, and then the measures that will

with my right hon. Friend’s interpretation of the period as a
whole in relation to CGT revenues. In the year in question, there was
certainly a reduction in deals done and transactions completed after
the increase in the rate of CGT, but subsequent CGT revenues have
picked up. We also have to bear in mind the relationship between CGT
and income tax. I agree strongly with my right hon. Friend that

we have taken tough action to ensure that we continue to reduce it.
Would we like to be reducing it more? Of course we would. Why is that
not happening? The difficult economic conditions clearly apply. But is
the right approach to these difficult economic conditions to go on a
borrowing splurge, as the Labour party consistently advocates? The

our export markets and the fact that we have not been able to export as
much as the OBR had anticipated. The question is: how do we respond to
that? Do we try to put in place a competitive tax system that makes
businesses and industries want to locate and invest in the UK? We have

me return to what we are doing as a Government to ensure that we meet
our objective of having the most competitive tax system in the G20. We
have already made considerable progress. As evidence, let us look at
the KPMG annual survey of tax competitiveness, in which senior tax
professionals were asked to name their three most competitive tax
jurisdictions. In 2009, just 16% named the UK among their top three,
but by 2012 the UK was named by 72% of respondents, ahead of every
other jurisdiction. Since that survey was undertaken, the corporation
tax rate has fallen from 24% to 23%, but we will not be complacent.
Clause 4 will cut the main rate of corporation tax to 21% from April
2014. As we announced at the Budget, we will then reduce the
corporation tax rate by an additional one percentage point from April
2015—a measure in clause 6 that will mean that the United
Kingdom has the lowest business tax rate of any major economy in the

Gauke:</Member></B> I hope the reduction to 20% will have all-party
support, but I am sorry if it does not. The advantage of 20% is that we
will have a corporation tax rate that is consistent with the small
profits rate. It is the lowest in the G20 and sends a clear signal to
businesses around the world that the UK is open for business. That is
something that we in this Government are proud of and that we believe
is putting in place the conditions for growth. I hope that the
Opposition will support this measure, although Labour in government did
not make as much progress in reducing corporation tax rates as it might
have done and we lost a competitive advantage. This Government are
restoring that competitive advantage, which is something we are proud
of.</hs_Para>

success of the film tax relief, which last year supported investment in
more than 300 British films, clause 35 introduces new corporation tax
reliefs for the animation, high-end television and video games sectors.

for larger businesses but for smaller ones as well. Let us remember
that the small profits rate was set to go to 22% when we came into

allowance for that two-year period to try to stimulate investment at a
time that is not necessarily the easiest for many businesses. That is
part of what we have done to help small businesses during this

largely because the banking sector has continued to be afflicted by
economic difficulties throughout the world, as a consequence of the
crash, so fragile global conditions have played a part. I am not going

those with children, by the changes in tax credits. At the same time,

basic rate allowance, but he is rather less keen to discuss the 40%
threshold, which has gone from £37,000 to £34,000, then
to £32,000. The Government have dragged an extra 670,000 people
into the 40p tax rate, which used to be for the rich, and that is
before this year’s changes. He is rather less keen to
discuss that. I wonder

Gauke:</Member></B> The vast majority of those people will pay less
income tax in total as a consequence of the measures that we have
introduced. As a result of the change in thresholds, most support has
been focused on basic-rate taxpayers and people who have been taken out
of income tax altogether. For the vast majority of people who now find
themselves in the higher-rate band, the gains that they have made from
the increase in the personal allowance more than outweigh the
additional tax they will pay on the higher rate.</hs_Para>

that context, it is worth highlighting the steps that we have taken to
ensure not only that we protect the poorest but that the wealthy pay
their fair share of tax. Clause 16 will legislate to cap previously
unlimited income tax reliefs at £50,000 or 25% of an
individual’s income, whichever is greater. That will prevent
those reliefs from being exploited unfairly, so that individuals, many
with very high incomes, cannot use those reliefs to reduce their income
tax bills to zero year after year. As announced in the Budget last
year, clauses 91 and 172 will legislate for an annual tax on enveloped
dwellings. That is a charge on residential properties valued at more
than £2 million held by certain non-natural persons. To
complement that measure, the Bill includes the extension of capital
gains tax to certain non-natural persons disposing of UK residential
property valued at over £2 million. For too long, the
well-advised wealthy have found ways around paying stamp duty land tax.
The Government have acted to address
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041510000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0002.htm#13041510000106">Clauses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T17:57:03"></hs_TimeCode>
47 and 48 legislate for the further reduction of lifetime and annual
allowances for pension contributions. That is not an easy measure to
introduce, but it will leave the vast majority of those saving for
retirement unaffected while curbing the rising cost of pensions tax
relief. Other measures in the Bill will curb unwelcome rising costs.
The Government understand the costs that have the biggest impacts on
families and businesses every day, and as such, we have taken action in
the Bill to help those individuals and businesses that have
been impacted by persistently high pump prices. Under clause 177, fuel
duty will be frozen at current levels, meaning that it will be 13p per
litre cheaper than under the previous Government’s
plans<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T17:57:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041510000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0002.htm#13041510000107">The
Bill will cut the cost of the average pint of beer by 1p. Not only is
that good news for the beer drinkers among us, but it represents
excellent news for the brewing industry and for pubs. The reduced duty
under the small breweries relief has helped to build a thriving brewing
industry, which demonstrates that lower duty can lead to growth,
investment and jobs. That 1p cut will be a further step to supporting a
successful British

is the Government’s belief that the most effective tax policy is
that which is devised in the most transparent fashion, and as such, the
majority of measures in the Bill have been formulated following lengthy
consultation with interest groups, business and the public. Thirty-six
formal and eight informal consultations took place last summer.
In December last year, over 400 pages of draft legislation for
the Bill were published for technical consultation, alongside
explanatory notes, tax information and impact notes. We received more
than 400 comments on the technical consultation, which has helped to
make sure that the measures in the Bill are as easy to
understand as possible, and thus as easy to comply with as
possible.<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

Well, for the record, yes—we are interested in, and deeply
concerned about, the impact that the bedroom tax, the withdrawal of

interested. Why does he think it makes sense to tell 660,000 people,
most of whom have a disability, that they need to give up a spare room
but leave nine out of 10 with no option of moving anywhere smaller? Why
does he think that some of the poorest and most vulnerable can cope

earlier from a sedentary position, “Where are your
policies?” The difference between the parties is that they do
not understand that jobs, at the heart of welfare reform, are the way
to get revenues flowing into the economy. If they neglect economic
growth and do not recognise that growth has an effect on the wider
prosperity of society as well as on public finances, they will never
repair the deficit as they claimed they would, and they will never have
the fairer society that the Minister had the cheek to mention when
concluding his speech. Ministers talk about fairness: tell that to the
families who are losing £891 this year—households who are
in work—when at the same time they see these Ministers giving
away £145 million in the Budget to hedge fund managers by
abolishing stamp duty reserve tax on some unit trust investments; tell
that to those who are forking out 20% VAT and losing hundreds of pounds
through higher taxes while the banks are let off the hook; and tell
that to our constituents who we see, all too frequently, left with only

explains the ever-widening net of blame for why things have fallen so
off course, and it explains why the country’s fortunes have been

it has become ever clearer that in the coalition Government’s
first Budget in June 2010, they were, I accept, complacent about
growth. The short pre-election boom following the 2009 VAT reduction
and the very large early rounds of quantitative easing lulled the
coalition, on assuming office, into believing that the growth that had
come about in the two or three quarters before the 2010 election was
baked into the system and would somehow do the heavy lifting when it

is worth saying, however, that that is part of a tradition during all
my 12 years in this House. Every single Budget between 2001 and 2007
forecast that public finances would move back into surplus in about
three or four years’ time. Instead, as the hon. Gentleman will
remember, debt and the annual deficit rose inexorably while the
Treasury conjured the illusion of fiscal stability. Similarly, at every
autumn statement since June 2010, the OBR has, I fear, been forced to
downgrade growth out-turns while continuing to hold somewhat
optimistically to the notion that the public finances will be

wish to mention one or two relevant changes to pensions. I welcome the

for their pension and receive full tax relief worth £127,000.
This Government have cut tax relief to £50,000, which will fall
to £40,000, so the taxpayer cost of £127,000 will be
£18,000 by next year—a huge change that will bring in, I
believe, £4 billion. I also welcome the steps for 1992 Equitable

avoidance and evasion are getting more blurred. Cases such as that of
the bogus charity that was headlined in <I>The Times</I> only a couple

to support regions such as mine in the Tees valley; and the tenfold
increase in capital allowances from £25,000 to £250,000,

expectation that the regime would remain until 2027. The regime changed
retrospectively and, all of a sudden, its investment case was gone. I

industry. I hope that future Budgets cater for a project on Teesside to

Blenkinsop</B> (Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland) (Lab):</Member>
I should like to address the comments of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T19:15:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Redcar (Ian Swales) about capital allowances. I, too, welcome the
Government’s capital allowance proposals, but they are a
U-turn—the Government reduced pre-2010 Labour levels of capital
allowances to 25% of what they were, but have since returned them to
pre-2010
levels.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041515000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0002.htm#13041515000002">The
north-east leads the way on exports. Government Members have said that
the export recovery has not occurred, but the north-east already had
very good exports from industry. Compared with other regions in the
country, the north-east leads the way. For example, Cleveland Potash at
Boulby in my constituency today announced a £300 million
investment, which will create 120 new jobs and secure more than 1,000
existing jobs in the potash pit. That occurs on the one-year
anniversary of the recommencement of iron and steel production at the
Redcar blast furnace at the Teesside Cast Products site, which is under
the joint operation of Sahaviriya Steel Industries and Tata. That is a
victory for the campaign of local people on Teesside, of which I was
proud to be a part, as was
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T19:16:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Redcar. Success is now synonymous with Teesside, and people in
Teesside are proud to say that they are a success. We look forward to a
future built upon the industrial development and manufacturing legacy
of the 13 years under
Labour.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041515000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0002.htm#13041515000003">Organisations
such as the North East of England Process Industry Cluster were created
in conjunction with the Labour Government and One North East. NEPIC
centred on the north-east’s assets, particularly in the chemical
and steel industries, and the heritage of shipbuilding—TAG
Energy uses the Haverton Hill site, formerly a shipyard and dock, to
produce monopile construction units for the offshore wind turbine
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041515000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0002.htm#13041515000004">In
contrast, the words “double dip”, “double
debt” and “credit rating downgrade” are synonymous
with the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Government. Since the
autumn statement, growth, which was estimated to be poor, has halved in
just over three months from 1.2% to 0.6%. The accrual of debt by this
downgraded Chancellor from 2010 to 2015 is more than the total debt
accrued by the previous Labour Government in their entire 13 years.
Despite that and the overwhelming evidence, the Chancellor affirmed in
his Budget that borrowing is falling. Public borrowing shows that the
Government books were in the red to the tune of £121
billion last year. They are forecast to improve only marginally to
£120.9 billion in
2012-13.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041515000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0002.htm#13041515000005">Tax
revenues have fallen £5.1 billion short of the predictions in
the autumn statement, despite the hailed employment figures. That is
largely owing to the fact that, despite increases in nominal
employment, productivity has fallen massively. That is matched by a
huge fall in tax take. The irony is that we have always been told that
the private sector is more efficient. Supposedly, we have 1 million
more private sector workers, and gross domestic product is falling, so
more people are doing less. That is a re-unbalancing of the economy if
I ever saw
one.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041515000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0002.htm#13041515000006">Similarly,
the increase in the number of employed women is largely due to the fact
that fewer women between the ages of 60 and 64 have retired. Women are
working to a later age because state old age pensions 
<?notus-xml column=86?>have changed. That has undoubtedly helped employment figures. The
Chancellor was able to massage his borrowing down only by persuading
the OBR that Government Departments would spend £3.4 billion
less than their allocated budgets this year. Only three months after
the previous forecast, the budget deficit is expected to be an average
£11 billion worse throughout the five-year forecast period. In
cash terms, the problem lies with poor tax receipts, which have been
hit by disappointing revenues this year, and vastly reduced forecasts
for nominal gross domestic product, which is now at one seventh of the
original growth expectations set in June
2010.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041515000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0002.htm#13041515000007">On
the other hand, Robert Chote and the OBR assume the economy has the
scope for rapid catch-up growth of 2.3% of national income even after
April 2018. But with so much slack in the economy to be
assumed for the rest of this decade, it is strange that the OBR does
not show inflation falling below its target level of 2% at any time.
Are Ministers concerned by that? If the OBR admitted this to be the
case, it could no longer live within the Chancellor’s demands
and would probably have to admit not £9 billion, but something
more in the region of £17 billion a year of tax rises or
spending cuts, as a result of earlier Government
inaction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041515000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0002.htm#13041515000008">The
nation’s debt and the Government’s borrowing are
completely dependent upon the Chancellor’s “monetary
activism”. However, minutes of the Bank of England’s
latest meeting show that the new Governor, Mark Carney, failed to win
any support for his case for further quantitative easing. Most of the
MPC look worried about the potential damage of a run on sterling, and
the effectiveness in any case of further asset purchases as banks and
households look to clear debts. However, without further QE, the
Chancellor cannot keep his borrowing rates down, as the borrowing at
low rates to buy gilts in order to borrow at low rates is the true
reason for low interest rates, not the heavily front-ended,
growth-strangling cuts we have witnessed to
date.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041515000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0002.htm#13041515000009">Furthermore,
big businesses continual deleveraging will not be turned into sudden
investment with further corporation tax cuts. Corporation tax cuts will
just aid business to further deleverage debt. It has never been so
cheap for the state to borrow, and the Chancellor is neither using this
cheap accessible capital to pump-prime the economy nor persuading banks
and big business to free up their substantial reserves and corporate
funds. The Chancellor’s language and tone set the mood music for
the economy, and his constant message of national deleveraging has sent
everyone into a deleveraging frenzy. Banks are hoarding excess capital
and large corporate companies are simultaneously paying out large
dividends to shareholders while sitting on excess capital, with the
explicit purpose of holding it in case they need to make future debt
clearances rather than
investments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041515000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0002.htm#13041515000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Ian Swales" PimsId="5649" UID="13041515000041" xid="1133" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0002.htm#13041515000041">Ian

Blenkinsop:</Member></B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, certain
programmes, such as the Government’s rebuilding schools
programme—which has been delayed for a year in one school in
Guisborough in my constituency—are dependent on PFI
arrangements, which raise capital from the bond market. We had a
slightly different arrangement for the 
<?notus-xml column=87?>Building Schools for the Future project. We now have the sudden
realisation that the cancellation of such capital projects, in the
first two years of this Government, has sent the economy into a
spiral.</hs_Para>

issue for me, especially in the north-east, is connectivity. We want to
develop our economic base, but rail electrification will go only as far
as York. What we want is access to capital funds to get electrification
done as soon as possible. I hope that that will yield some results, but
it is already too late. We have already had nigh on three years with
little investment, and now the situation is desperate. Capital is still
very slow in coming from Whitehall, exacerbated by the lack of agencies
in the region to assist businesses, even given the regional
growth fund. How we solve that, given that those agencies have been
dismantled, I do not know, but we need to do
more.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041515000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041515000013">Added
to the Chancellor’s mood music and the deleveraging frenzy, we
have a Government delaying the payment of bills to hide borrowing. The
delaying of these payments—largely to big
businesses—leads to deleveraging big businesses, with vast sums
under the corporate mattress, using smaller businesses as an extra line
of credit. Current unpaid bills to small and medium-sized enterprises
total £36.4 billion, with some small businesses writing off
bills to the tune of £10,000. An illustration of this is the 7%
year-on-year contraction in construction, which has its lowest growth
rate since 1987.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041515000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041515000014">The
Chancellor is aware of this issue. In the north-east, according to the
regional Federation of Small Businesses, banks cannot apparently give a
regional figure for the take-up of the funding for lending scheme for
business. We need to hold banks to account for that. The north-east has
134,000 businesses—I mentioned two of the larger ones earlier. A
thousand employ more than 50 people, while 96,000 are sole traders, who
by and large do not pay corporation tax. This April, real-time
information will be introduced, but apparently only 25% of FSB members
know what RTI is. I suggest to Ministers that small businesses should
be given a proper period of slack on the introduction of RTI. The
Government have allowed six months, but extending this to 12 months
might be necessary so that businesses can adapt properly. However, the
closure of local HMRC tax inquiry offices in the north-east—a
region with a large sole trader community—means that we will be
far more exposed to transitional
difficulties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041515000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041515000015">The
sole traders, market town traders and small businesses on our high
streets will not only have RTI to contend with. The national minimum
wage is lower now, in real terms, than it was in 2004. It was raised by
1.9% today, but the consumer prices index is at 2.8%, so it is a
real-terms cut. Small businesses and their customers in the north-east
will see working tax credit freezes from this April, meaning those
working under 30 hours will lose between £303 and £428.
That is £303 to £428 less to spend. Benefits being capped
at 1% rather than CPI will mean that small businesses’ customers
lose up to £150. That is £150 less to spend. The bedroom
tax—a housing benefit cut of between 14% and 24%—will
mean they lose between £624 and £1,144. That is
£624 to £1,144 less to spend. The benefit cap, to be
rolled out nationally from September, will mean small
businesses’ customers will lose on average £4,836, which
is an average of £93 a 
<?notus-xml column=88?>week. That is £93 less per week for their customers to spend. The
council tax benefit cut—the Tories’ new poll
tax—will mean that 700,000 people in employment will lose
between £250 to £600 each, meaning small
businesses’ regular customers will have between £250 and
£600 less to spend. This will no doubt compound an already
obvious demand
crisis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041515000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041515000016">After
the mummy tax and the granny tax, the end of the pregnancy grant, and
VAT being increased again by a Tory Government, there will be obvious
consequences for sole traders and small business in general. How do the
Government think these reductions in the disposable income of small
businesses’ most frequent and dependable customers will resolve
this country’s economic growth problems? In the autumn
statement, private consumption was expected to be a crucial driver of
Britain’s growth in the years ahead. The OBR expected growth in
2012 to come from private consumption. Indeed, it revised it up to
37.5% of all growth after last year’s omnishambles Budget. Of
course, it did not happen. The promised—albeit simultaneously
derided—consumer growth was not delivered. Page 100 of the Red
Book assumes a jump of 0.7%, from 0.5% this year to 1.2% next year, in
household consumption, even though it simultaneously predicts
unemployment increasing in 2013-14 and the claimant count increasing
from 1.58 million to 1.63 million in the same period. The Chancellor
also failed to inform the nation that 400,000 disabled people on severe
or enhanced disabled benefits will now have to pay council tax for the
first time ever.</hs_Para>

conjunction with what I illustrated earlier, these are demand-sapping
policies on a monumental scale. Are they being taken because the
Government fear that their other policies will bring about inflation?
Are they attacking demand deliberately in order to control inflation?
We know that Mark Carney, the new Governor of the Bank of England, will
be constrained by a 2% inflation target. However, we also know that
inflation crept up to between 2.5% and 3%—around the 2.8% mark
between January and February—this year. That inflation rise, at
the same time as pay freezes, local real-terms pay cuts and benefits
reductions, has seen families subject to an unprecedented cost of
living crisis. According to uSwitch, Britons collectively owe
£637 million to energy firms— £159 million
more than last year’s projections. Some 20% of all energy
customers surveyed are in debt, a figure that has risen by 14% since
last year.</hs_Para>

conclusion, with falling disposal income levels and increasing
household outgoings, the temporary retail or consumer growth we are

type of growth, given the Government’s other policies, it is
unsustainable in the medium and long term. The Budget is fundamentally
unfair: it does not address growth, it doubles the debt and it does not
deal with the deficit—it actually makes it worse. It fails on
all the original criteria set out by the Chancellor in June
2010.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_15_PT_1/BD35D76D5AF63828914D9E8751EEB77F507FD0A9" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="15 April 2013">Monday

Hosie</B> (Dundee East) (SNP):</Member> May I start by making two
observations? This ought to be the keynote debate on the
Government’s annual flagship Finance Bill, but there are only
five Government Members in the Chamber—two Ministers, a Whip, a
Parliamentary Private Secretary and one solitary Liberal, who I suspect
will 
<?notus-xml column=89?>leave at the earliest possible opportunity—none of whom is now
standing to speak. It is a terrible indictment of the Government that
even the normal cheerleaders are not here to back the Chancellor. That
probably indicates that many Government Members consider the Budget to
be as miserable as we do.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041515000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041515000020">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T19:33:15"></hs_TimeCode>
was struck by the fact that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T19:32:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Redcar (Ian Swales) chose to defend the millionaire tax cut. One
reason he gave rather explodes the “we’re all in it
together” myth, which, as someone else has said, is rarely used
by Government Members these days. Even if this year’s Red Book
is right and the cost of the millionaires’ tax cut is only
£500 million in the next five years, I think we would all argue
that if £500 million is going spare it would be better to spend
it on direct capital investment, capacity for the future, and job and
GDP creation, rather than give it to people who are already
wealthy.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041515000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041515000021">The Finance
Bill is a consequence of the March Budget. Apart from some measures I
welcomed relating mainly to business tax, it was a pretty miserable
Budget. It was miserable because, by and large, it merely continued
with the Government’s failed policies. We know they have failed
because the Chancellor told us that they have failed—they failed
by every measure he set. The net borrowing requirement, which was due
to fall to £92 billion, has gone up to £121
billion. The national debt, which was due to peak at 92.7% of
GDP—£1.36 trillion—in 2014-15 on the
treaty calculation, is now expected to peak, on the same calculation,
at more than 100% of GDP. National debt on the treaty calculation is
due to reach 100.8% of GDP, or £1.58 trillion, by 2016-17.
Therefore, when we hear that the deficit is lower and debt will fall,
it does not really bear any scrutiny, even by the Chancellor’s
and the OBR’s own numbers. The Chancellor has failed to meet his
own targets on his original time scale for his own fiscal rules: that
the structural current deficit should be in balance in the final year
of the five-year rolling programme, and that debt should fall
as a share of GDP. Of course, according to the OBR those objectives
were highly dependent on GDP growth, which, as we have seen in previous
Red Books, was based on incredible, unbelievable, unmet and frankly
unmeetable rates of business investment growth.</hs_Para>

us remind ourselves that in 2010 the Government suggested that business
investment had to grow by between 8.1% and 10.9% a year for five years.
By the time we got to the OBR’s fiscal outlook the next year,
growth in business investment had actually turned negative, which was
extraordinary, and so it went on year after year after year. They were
at it again this year, forecasting future business investment rates of
between 6.4% to 10.2% from 2013 onwards. I suspect that nobody, even in
Government, believes that those targets will be met. The Chancellor, or
some other poor Minister, will be back at the Dispatch Box
at some point in the near future explaining why this was all somebody
else’s fault.</hs_Para>

for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field) is no longer in his

that perhaps we had all not been honest and that the cuts should be
deeper. However, last year’s Red Book told us that the total
cost of fiscal 
<?notus-xml column=90?>consolidation—discretionary consolidation; that is, tax rises and
cuts—would be £155 billion a year from 2016-17 onwards.
As I pointed out on Budget day, that 2016-17 figure of £155
billion of discretionary consolidation, tax rises and cuts had somehow
been deleted from the Red Book, and there was no forecast for
2017-18<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T19:37:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041515000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041515000024">It
is fair to say that the Government have made a U-turn and that the
fiscal tightening will continue to be the equivalent of approximately
7.5% to 8% of GDP stripped out of the economy in tax rises and cuts. It
is extraordinary that they think they can cut their way to growth at
the best of times, but that they think they can do so while pursuing a
policy which, according to their own numbers, will see fiscal
consolidation, discretionary tax rises and cuts of the equivalent of
between 7.5% and 8% of GDP in demand stripped out of the economy. If
they can cut their way to growth on the back of that, they should be
given a Nobel prize. The problem is that none of us believes it will
happen. Of course, the overall impact of 4:1 cuts to tax rises tells us
exactly who will bear the brunt of these austerity measures.</hs_Para>

which is the tenfold increase in the annual investment allowance to
£250,000. That is for two years only, however, and the
Government need to understand that even at this level investment
decisions may take some time to be agreed before businesses are able to
use the benefit. I therefore ask the Government to look again at the
temporary nature of the increase. While we would certainly argue that
it makes sense to have targeted tax allowances such as this—it
makes sense for businesses to be allowed to keep more of their own
money to invest, particularly when banks are still refusing to take the
full share of the risk they should take—the real problem with
the Budget, the Red Book and the Bill is that the Government continue
to set themselves against direct capital investment when the economy
needs it most, which is right now.</hs_Para>

argue that they have given Scotland an additional £279 million
in capital over the next two years. It is debateable whether
that is true, as I will come to, but even if it is, it would
still imply a 20% real-terms cut to the Scottish capital budget over
the four-year spending review period. But it is not real capital
expenditure: £266.5 million is classified as a financial
transaction, meaning that it can be used only to fund loans or equity
investments. That is a straightjacket. It is accompanied by
£103.5 million cut in hard cash from the resource budget, half
of which— £56 million—will be cut this
year from already-agreed budgets. This is not just daft; it is
economically really, really silly. I despair that the Government think

straight from the Labour party central office briefing note. The
Scottish Government quite rightly re-profiled revenue spending into
capital to make up for the capital cuts from the UK Government. We did
that because we recognised that—I think there is unanimity on
this—direct capital investment had a 1:1 impact multiplier in

is that we do not have enough economic growth, so the Scottish

terms of the 40% band used to be £37,400, but that was decreased
to £34,300 last year, so for every £326 changed up in the
Budget, at 20p in the pound, people have had to shell out an extra
£560 at the 40p rate, before this year’s changes.
So although the change in this year’s basic threshold is
welcome, we must recognise that the Chancellor pulled the same trick in
the middle again by pre-announcing another cut to the 40% threshold
down to £32,010 last year. That means that in three years the
Government have taken the proportion of taxpayers paying the 40% rate
from 10% to 13% of the total taxpaying public—up 670,000 in
three years. Over 25 years, the proportion has doubled to 2.1 million
extra people now paying a tax rate that was previously only for the
rich. With hundreds of thousands of people now paying a 40p tax rate
that was never designed for low and middle incomes, it is safe to say

want to turn to one of the most damaging small parts of the Finance
Bill, which is the planned increase in air passenger duty. APD has
become increasingly unpopular in the aviation industry and is now the
most expensive in Europe. We know that standard rates vary from
£13 for a short-haul flight to £94 for a long-haul
flight. The rates were increased by RPI on 1 April this year, as
announced in the 2012 Budget, and will be subject to a further increase
by RPI next April, as announced in this Budget.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T19:46:43"></hs_TimeCode> have

the Minister will know, the Scottish Government Deputy First Minister

the UK Government to devolve APD as soon as possible. We do so because
it makes economic sense.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T19:47:08"></hs_TimeCode>The study
“The economic impact of Air Passenger Duty”, published
only this February, confirmed that. It suggested that abolishing APD
entirely could boost GDP by 0.46% in the first year, with
benefits continuing to 2020, and that the GDP boost to the UK economy
would amount to at least £16 billion in the first three years
and result in almost 60,000 extra jobs over the longer term. We would
argue, therefore, that the time for continually increasing APD has gone
and that the time to devolve it is now.</hs_Para>

the devolution of APD. It is safe to say, however, that we have become
increasingly frustrated with the UK Government’s continuing
prevarication and the impact on Scotland and Wales of the further
increases in rates from April this year and April 2014. To be fair, the
Government have recognised, in devolving APD to Northern Ireland, that
a one-size-fits-all policy might not be appropriate, but increasing APD
throughout the rest of the UK and not devolving it demonstrates that
the Government do not understand the differences in the UK aviation

have got the Work and Pensions Secretary going on about new punishments
for people involved in benefit fraud. I am against benefit fraud, but I
am against all fraud. Let us try to get things into perspective. In the
last year for which figures are available, benefit fraud cost
£1.2 billion. A recent study by Oxfam says that in the last year
for which it has figures, tax fraud cost the taxpayer £5
billion. Needless to say, the Treasury said it did not
recognise that figure, which is officialese for: 
<?notus-xml column=93?>“I can’t think what to say;
I’ll have to find out what the boss says.” However, the
Treasury has to acknowledge—because it produced this figure
itself—that in the last year for which official figures are
available, £4 billion was lost to tax fraud. It also produced
figures for that year showing that tax avoidance—not tax
evasion—cost the taxpayer £5 billion. There was a further
loss of £4 billion for what is called
“non-payment”—in other words, businesses making
sure that when something went wrong, it was not the taxpayer who got
any of the money. That makes a total of £13 billion lost in one
year, mainly as a result of the desire and effective efforts by the
rich and big businesses not to pay tax. That means that the taxpayer
was swindled out of £13 billion in one year
alone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T19:51:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041516000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041516000003">To
be fair, that is partly because this House is notoriously bad at
producing tax laws that actually work. That might be partly an effect
of the fact that for years the Treasury has been advised on such
matters by the very banks and accountancy firms that are doing the
swindling in the first place. However, there is little real conviction
in the idea that Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs will do a
good job of getting the money that we have voted should be taken. In
fairness to HMRC, tax avoidance has become a major British industry. It
is not a sideline of the big four banks or the big four firms of
accountants; it is a major part of their industrial activity. They are
not exactly big taxpayers themselves: in one year, Barclays paid just
1% of its profits in tax.</hs_Para>

reduced to a scatter of sordid tax havens, where most of the fiddling

there helping the tax avoiders and helping the rich freeloaders to
avoid the tax they should be paying here and in other countries. Let me
give one or two examples. Barclays has just over 1,000

1,500 subsidiaries and, again, 36% are in tax havens. The Royal Bank of

think the British banks should be doing something a bit different. I
think they might possibly have done a bit of investing in this
country. In the past, small businesses all over the country could go
and see their local bank managers at one of the big banks and talk to
them about their problems. They knew one another and knew what their
prospects were. People could borrow money that way, and it worked. Then
the banks started centralising all the funds, so nothing is left with
the local bank manager and local firms now have to be interrogated by
an algorithm—that is what it boils down to—in the
banks’ headquarters. They have not been investing in this
country. We have to ask ourselves why a large proportion of the
industries that were privatised are now owned by foreign owners, such
as Électricité de France or the Australian outfit that
owns Thames Water. Could the British banks not have invested in British
businesses? Was there not enough profit for them? Does that mean that
the profits in the tax havens and from all sorts of derivatives
activities were going to raise them more money? That may be so, but
what has happened demonstrates just how awful the performance of the

reflect the scale of wrongdoing that needs to be put right—the
swindling that involved British companies and the damage that does to

today’s debate. This week, of all weeks, is an appropriate time
to reflect on economic and fiscal policy, and particularly on the
legacy of the free enterprise revolution led by the great Lady
Thatcher. There is much in the Bill that will continue this
Government’s work to revive the successes of Lady
Thatcher’s approach to business, free enterprise and
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T20:07:06"></hs_TimeCode>. I was
fortunate enough to meet Lady Thatcher on the general election nights
in 1983 and 1987. She inspired me and many others on this side of the
House. She was a towering figure who was well respected across the
world, and she richly deserved those election victories back in the
1980s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T20:07:24"></hs_TimeCode>.
More<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T20:07:49"></hs_TimeCode> than
anything, she understood that individuals and Governments needed to
live within their means, and that businesses were best placed to create
jobs and deliver economic growth. She trusted them to do that, and
created the right conditions for them to succeed. That is the proud
legacy that the Bill seeks to build
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T20:07:45"></hs_TimeCode>. Indeed,

jobs were created in the public sector in the north-west. During the

sector. That is completely unsustainable. What we are trying to do in
the north-west and throughout the whole economy is to have a more
sustainable approach to job creation, which has led to the creation of

desperate state—an ongoing recession. The Chancellor says that
his Budget is fiscally neutral, but when 2.5 million people are
unemployed and we have low or negative growth, we do not want a
fiscally neutral Budget. We should have had an expansionary Budget to
promote growth, but of course even a fiscally neutral Budget could
inject growth into the economy by raising taxes and spending more,
rather than doing the opposite. If taxes on businesses and the wealthy
are reduced, they tend to save their money—indeed, they put it
in tax havens—whereas if ordinary people are given jobs, the
first thing they do is to spend their money, and that money

hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster was right that
forecasting is difficult. I remember that in 1990—I am older
than everybody else in the Chamber—when <I>The Sunday Times</I>
carried out a survey of forecasting organisations, it found that the
London Business School was bottom of the league, scoring nought out of
10 for its forecasts, although of course that was the forecasting body
adored by the Conservative Government under Mrs Thatcher. The best
forecasts were by the Cambridge Economic Policy Group, a left-leaning
Keynesian group, which got six out of 10 to come top of the league. The
then Government were so annoyed by the Cambridge group that they took
away its Government grant because they did not like people telling them
that they were wrong, although they
were<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T20:27:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041519000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041519000054">Demand
for the things that people produce is a crucial factor if an economy is
to succeed, because although Governments can cut taxes for businesses
and introduce all sorts of supply-side measures, if no one is buying
anything, the economy will not grow. An equally crucial factor for
sustaining that demand is an appropriate exchange rate. Successive
Governments have ignored the exchange rate at their peril, but there
have been times when the depreciation of our currency has had dramatic
results, and I can cite three examples under a Conservative Government.
Following Golden Wednesday and the collapse of the exchange rate
mechanism, the economy grew strongly after a substantial depreciation.
By the time that 1997 came along, the Conservatives were still being
condemned for the collapse of the housing market and the people voted
Labour—thank goodness for that—yet the Labour Government
benefited from the strong demand generated by that depreciation. In
1979 Mrs Thatcher was praised for her economic policies, but the 1979
Budget, masterminded, if I can describe it like that, by Geoffrey Howe,
resulted in a catastrophic collapse in demand. A fifth of manufacturing
disappeared and unemployment soared to 3 million. It was only when
those policies were reversed that there was a recovery, and under Nigel
Lawson’s watch—I do not necessarily agree with everything
he did—the pound depreciated by over 30%. Again, the economy
grew strongly and unemployment came down.</hs_Para>

back even further into history, in the 1931 crisis, a Labour Government
mistakenly tried to sustain sterling on the gold standard, and tried to
keep its parity up. The Government fell apart, and
effectively a Conservative Government with a nominally Labour 
<?notus-xml column=103?>Prime Minister came in straight afterwards. The first thing they did was
take the pound off the gold standard and depreciate, and the recovery
began. That was only part of it; other factors were necessary to
sustain recovery in the 1930s. We had to spend a lot of money, and
towards the end of the ’30s the country built
thousands—indeed, millions—of houses, and that was how we
recovered. That is what we ought to do now.</hs_Para>

other countries, Germany built arms and autobahns; in America, there
was the new deal—spending money on all sorts of public works,
which created the demand in the economy that brought about recovery. It
was not fiddling around with tax rates and supply-side measures. That
did not work then, and it will not work now. The exchange rate is
therefore absolutely crucial, and the exchange rate at this time is too
high. Part of our recovery should depend on a significant depreciation.
An erudite and informed book by my friend, John Mills, has been written
about this, and I have quoted from it in the Chamber. It makes a
detailed case for such measures.</hs_Para>

trade statistics are disastrous, and some of us have been worried about
manufacturing for a long time. Our manufacturing sector is about half
the size of the German manufacturing sector as a proportion of our
economy, which is disastrous. We should be a similar economy to Germany
in many ways. Historically, we have been very similar in all sorts of
ways, but our manufacturing has collapsed. That was partly because in
1997, when Labour came to office, there was at the same time a
substantial appreciation of the pound, which began to damage
manufacturing. We were sustained by an asset price bubble, which
carried on, and thank goodness, we had a relatively strong economy for
some time. However, manufacturing did not do well, because of the
relatively strong pound. It was only the crisis of 2008, when there was
a significant depreciation, that saved us. Had we been stuck in the

disastrous—so we must applaud

begins to recover. At the same time, we can build millions of houses
that we need, particularly local authority houses, and we can provide
all the nurses we need in hospitals. Hospitals are under stress because
of a lack of staff on the wards. We can develop other areas too: local
authority services, children’s services, and social services for
the elderly, all of which are under stress and are things on which we
should spend to generate more employment. We generate employment
directly by spending money on areas with high labour

my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Swansea West (Geraint Davies), who has left the Chamber,
said, the rich do not spend money: they put it in banks and tax havens.
But ordinary people, especially if they have been unemployed, spend
every single penny of their money on supporting their families, dealing
with their debts and so on. They spend their money. They have what the
economists call a high marginal propensity to consume. We should give
as much money as possible to those who have that high marginal
propensity to consume, not to those who stuff it in banks and foreign
tax havens. That would help to regenerate the
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041519000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041519000063">Another
great thing about public services and construction is that they put
demand into the domestic economy, not into the foreign economy. If I
were given extra cash, which I do not need—I think I should pay
a bit more tax—what would I do? I would have another foreign
holiday. I might buy another case of French wine. That does not help
our economy at all. But if construction workers have extra cash, they
go out and spend it in the shops on food, their homes and their family.
They spend it in the domestic economy. They do not, as far as I know,
buy large quantities of French wine or have fancy foreign holidays,
especially when they are just coming out of unemployment. They would
spend their money in the domestic

great thing about construction is that it has a low import content.
Most of what is used in construction comes from the domestic economy.
Again, the demand goes into the domestic economy so the spending by
construction workers in their new jobs becomes someone else’s
income within the domestic economy. We get the multiplier effect of one
person’s spending becoming another person’s income going
around in a big circle and the economy is regenerated.</hs_Para>

population have said in opinion polls, I understand, that they would
prefer tax hikes to spending cuts. That is absolutely right. We are
frightened of saying that we should have higher taxes. Francois
Hollande in France decided to introduce a significantly higher tax rate
for a substantial proportion of the population. Some people 
<?notus-xml column=105?>will squeal about it and no doubt the right-wing
media in Britain would squeal about it, but there should be a bit more
tax, even on MPs such as myself. I have suggested that the first tax
rise should be the 50% rate not at £150,000, but at
£60,000, so that I would pay a little more tax. I am talking
about me as well as about other people. It is easy for us to make
changes that affect other people, not ourselves.</hs_Para>

a change could be made, if need be, but in the short term we do not

which are the subject of tax avoidance and tax evasion. We need a
radical economic strategy, including all the components that I have
suggested, to get us out of the mess we are in—and we are in a
mess. In his Budget speech, the Chancellor looked like a frightened
man. He looked very worried. Clearly, his strategy is not working. He
does not know what to do without doing a complete U-turn and adopting a
completely different strategy—the kind of strategy that I am

four weeks since the Chancellor delivered the Budget, not least because
of the terrible tragedy of the death of Jade Lomas-Anderson by a dog
attack in my constituency, so when I came to write my speech today, I
had to wrack my brains to remember what the Budget was all about. My
overwhelming memory is of the Chancellor sitting on the Front Bench
looking like a little boy lost, with no idea what to do about the
flatlining economy, no idea what to do to stop a triple-dip recession,
what to do about the loss of our triple A status, or what to do about
the level of borrowing, and no idea how to balance the books. So he
delivered a Budget that did none of those things, sitting on his hands,
hoping that things will just
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041519000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041519000068">Of
course, things are just happening. Unemployment in my constituency,
Bolton West, is up. One in 10 people in Greater Manchester skip meals
so that other family members can eat. Nationally, homelessness and
rough sleeping are up by a third. Shelter says that every 15
minutes another family is made homeless. The economy may be flatlining,
but people’s income and spending are not. The OBR has said that
in 2015 people will be worse off than they were in 2010. Wages are
£1,200 lower than in May 2010. This year a family with two
children and one earner earning £20,000 a year will be
at least £381 worse off, and next year will be £600 worse
off. Inflation, of course, is still running at
2.8<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T20:39:31"></hs_TimeCode>%. Behind
those figures are real people having a desperately hard

are in working households, 6.4 million people lack the paid work they
want and 1.4 million part-time workers want full-time work, the highest
figure in 20 years, and 100,000 of the so-called new jobs pay no wages
whatsoever. The churn of people in poverty or out of work is
substantial. While 18% of people are on a low income at any one 
<?notus-xml column=106?>time, 33%—one in three of us—experience at least one
period on a low income in a four-year period, and 11% of people are on

2012, 1.6 million people were claiming jobseeker’s allowance at
any one time and 4.8 million had claimed it at least once in the
previous two years. Those figures show that the Government’s
desperate efforts to categorise people as skivers or strivers are a
travesty of the truth. Some 2.5 million people, including 1 million
young people, are not shirkers or skivers; they are people who need the
Government to take action to create jobs. But there was no mention in

previous Labour Government cancelled or postponed planned fuel duty

wants a spare house to buy one—not a cheap one either, but one

budget is made up of pensions and in-work benefits. That does not fit
the picture that they try to portray of the skivers who are ruining the
economy. They forget to say that jobseeker’s allowance accounts
for less than 5% of the budget and to tell us that cutting benefit not
only forces people to food banks but harms the economy. They forget to
tell us that the private rented sector is far more costly than social

to build houses for people to live in, and to take action to rebuild
our economy. Instead, what do we get? A double-dip—thank heavens

triple-dip—recession, a doubling of debt, and a deficit that is

million people were unemployed, with the country being told that
unemployment was a price worth paying. My own family know that it was
not. They were impacted when the steelworks at Corby closed in 1980 and
10,000 people were put on the dole. People from communities
such as mine, where the films “Brassed Off” and

those is short term, bad debt and irresponsible; the other is
about investing in our future. It is about the decisions that
responsible businesses make to borrow to invest—the decisions

without any real regard for the damaging effects it would have on our

those who most rely on public services. Buses have been cut in my

next year and the year after. We are now told that there will be deeper

billion less on infrastructure than the previous Government had planned

Heseltine that the Government should boost the economy with greater
infrastructure spending. They make announcements such as that about the
A14—part of which runs through my constituency—which is
now not set to start until 2018. The electrification of east midlands

Government said that they wanted to go further and eliminate the
structural deficit. What is the effect of that? They are spending
£13 billion less on infrastructure—precisely what we need
to get our economy growing—and £13 billion more on social
security. It all sounds familiar to people in my constituency who
remember that when Margaret Thatcher, the architect of this kind of
trickle-down 
<?notus-xml column=113?>Reaganomics, came to office, 2 million people were

richer, the poor poorer, and many are paying the price of economic and
social failure. Meanwhile, in countries such as America, which should

Government’s Get Britain Building fund has gone to meet some of
the infrastructure gap, particularly as the council, and others, have
had to renegotiate section 106 agreements, which became too expensive
for developers to move forward. After three years, some of that money
has just begun to trickle to my constituency. If the Government support
the SEMLEP bid, there is a real opportunity to substantially reduce the
gap in budgets for infrastructure, which we need now that we are
renegotiating the section 106 agreements. We are not asking for
additional money; we are asking for flexibility such as an increase in

cash-strapped households. It does not promote additional demand for
Britain’s retail and services sectors, comprising three-quarters
of our economic output, and neither does it sufficiently boost output
in construction by adopting more immediate measures to increase the
supply of housing—or any new infrastructure

Parliament on the incomes of ordinary people, with the cumulative
impact in Scotland of the Government’s prior measures on pay,
tax and benefits being the removal of £1,488 a year by 2015 in
the spending power of the average household. That is at a time when the
Office for Budget Responsibility is expecting 
<?notus-xml column=114?>private and Government consumption to make up a larger share of GDP than
it forecast in December. The pound is a fifth lower in value than in

Government have not only presided over that failure, but the Bill fails
the even greater test of rebalancing the economy more in favour of
skilled service and manufacturing output. It also fails to recast the
welfare state around pro-employment and growth-friendly policies such
as extending child care provision or a jobs guarantee for the long-term
jobless. That is badly needed in Scotland, where the employment rate is
3.2% below its pre-crisis peak of 2007, and 1.6% below the rate between
October 2008 and September 2009. It is estimated that a further 850,000
jobs need to be created in the UK to match the employment rate of

Bill does little to address the growing crisis of falling living
standards, which are faced by millions of people across the country.
The median wage is some £3,200 a year lower than it was in 2009.
Real wages will fall more quickly this year than the OBR predicted just
five months ago and will be stagnant next year. Business investment is
forecast to be 1.5% lower on average than the December 2012 OBR

truth is that the Bill is less than the sum of its parts, and even the
OBR does not believe that its overall impact will be an increase in UK
growth this year, next year or any year to the end of its current
forecast period. The new US Treasury Secretary last week recommended
that eurozone countries should ease fiscal policy to boost
demand if they can. That call should resound in the UK Treasury too.
The Obama Administration tackles wage stagnation and declining living
standards, so we should not put up with the defeatism we have heard

developing those points, let me address the individual clauses and
schedules that deserve some degree of welcome—overall, the Bill
is a deep disappointment to Scotland and the UK. I welcome the fact
that the Treasury has listened to the strong campaign launched by the
city of Glasgow council, Members of the House representing Glasgow
constituencies, and the organisers of the 2014 Commonwealth games.
Clause 9 provides that Glasgow’s Commonwealth games will have
the same taxation treatment as the Olympic games in London and other
major sporting occasions held in the UK. That concession will mean that
the organisers can attract the very best athletes from the Commonwealth
to participate, and make the games the sporting and economic success
for Scotland and the UK that they will undoubtedly be. Procurement
contracts already decided and in the process of being awarded are
likely to benefit the economy in Scotland to the tune of £350
million.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041520000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041520000039">The
above-the-line R and D tax credits are strengthened by clause 34 and
schedule 14, which is welcome, but it is revealing that UK R and D
expenditure rates are still way below those of our international
trading partners. According to the World Bank, the UK’s 2011 R
and D expenditure, at 1.79% of GDP, and Scotland’s, at 1.56% of
GDP, are way below the most recent OECD average of 2.44% and the 2011
EU average of 2.03%. We spend 
<?notus-xml column=115?>less than half the share of GDP that Finland or Sweden spend on R and D.
That is a particular problem in Scotland, where business R and D
spending is only 0.56% of national income, which is half that of the
pathetic UK total. The Scottish Parliament could use powers in that
area of policy for the benefit of Scottish business and the Scottish
people. I also give a guarded welcome to the provisions on tax relief
for television production and video games development in clause 35 and
schedules 15 and 16, which will provide some boost to these industries
in Glasgow, Dundee, and other parts of
Scotland.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041520000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041520000040">On
living standards, the Bill will do nothing to counter the regressive
effects of the Welfare Benefits Up-rating Act 2013 or previous Finance
Acts, which have devastated household incomes among the working poor,
who receive nearly 21% of the entire welfare budget. The poorest four
deciles of the population in Scotland were hit three and a half times
harder than the wealthiest two deciles by the introduction of the 1%
benefit and tax credits cap last Monday. This measure alone will take
£47 million out of the Glasgow economy every year,
and will cost working-age adults in the city an average of £114
a year. Overall, 55,700 working-age households in Glasgow will lose on
average £109 a year through the cumulative cuts to tax credits

further reduce economic demand. The effects on the Glasgow economy
alone will be to take away £269 million in demand a year, or
£647 from the average household in the city. In terms of clause
1, four times as much will be taken away by higher VAT during this
Parliament from the poorest people than will be handed back through
raising the personal tax allowance, three quarters of the benefit of
which will go to people in the upper half of the income scale. With the
introduction of universal credit, two thirds of any benefit from a
higher personal tax allowance will be lost through deductions in
credit, which will be assessed on the basis of net income, not
gross. The further squeeze on real wages in 2013, down by a further
£200 on average over the course of the year, will cost ordinary
families on average four times as much as the Government will hand back
through the increase in personal allowance to £10,000 from next
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041520000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041520000042">The
Government have been guilty of another offence in the preparation of
the Bill. They have attempted to conduct a debate on welfare by arguing
that a majority of benefit recipients are scroungers or layabouts, in a
way that is deeply irresponsible, divisive, and corrosive of the social
solidarity that exists in Glasgow, Scotland and communities the length
and breadth of the United Kingdom. Some psychologists, such as Cass
Sunstein, have referred to this phenomenon as an availability cascade,
whereby a simple idea takes root and goes viral, quickly becoming the
new received wisdom. One wonders whether the Chancellor had that at the
heart of his thinking when he began his campaign against the poor.
Others may be reminded of the work of George 
<?notus-xml column=116?>Lakoff when he said that framing an argument in the lived experiences of
others is critical. One part of the coalition seemingly wants to turn
neighbour against neighbour, and shift their focus away from the
skyrocketing wealth of the super-rich, or from the role that the
Government should legitimately fulfil in ensuring the conditions for
greater equality in society, which is now seen in studies by the IMF as
critical to lasting economic growth in any democracy. But the recent
study by YouGov and Cambridge university shows that this campaign of
vilification of welfare recipients is not having the desired outcome
for the Chancellor, because it found that people in the UK were more
likely to empathise with the suffering being inflicted on the poorest
by these most regressive welfare cuts than voters in Germany, France or
the US. We need facts to drive this debate, not simply assertion from
the Treasury Bench or the peddling of prejudice. The constituents I
meet, who struggle with low paid, part-time work in  a weak
jobs market, are being forced on to housing benefit because of high
rental costs and declining real wages. That, and the fact that we have
2.5 million people officially unemployed but more than 6
million people desperately seeking full-time work, are the reasons why
the benefits bill remains stubbornly high.</hs_Para>

recast the debate on the welfare state, a debate that should have been
recast in the Bill, in three main areas: full employment, higher pay
and stronger family services. Simply to restore the employment rate to
its pre-crisis levels, we need to create 850,000 additional jobs now.
To get to a situation of reducing structural unemployment to 3%, we
need active labour market policies, such as the jobs guarantee policy
being promoted by Opposition Members, to help the long-term
jobless—a plan that put Sweden back to work in the 1990s, at the
same time as cutting its deficit too. A jobs guarantee, paid for by
restricting pensions tax relief for higher rate taxpayers, would help
600 long-term jobless people in my constituency who have been out of
work for two years or more to get the right to employment now. It would
also begin to boost tax receipts, which are forecast by the OBR to be
£55.2 billion lower between now and the end of its forecast
period since its December projections, with £2.8 billion of that
shortfall directly attributable to the Budget that the Bill seeks to
enact. It is only by increasing the levels of participation in the jobs

The biggest barrier to becoming economically active that as many as 1
million women face is the poor availability of affordable child care.
Shifting resources into providing households with more extensive child
care or early years education at an affordable cost should be a
priority for a pro-growth and pro-equality welfare reform and finance

care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T21:22:52"></hs_TimeCode> costs take
up as much as a third of families’ after-tax income in
the UK, compared with just 9% in Denmark. In 2009, the UK,
under the 
<?notus-xml column=117?>previous Government, was spending the joint third highest amounts in the
OECD as a share of GDP in terms of cash benefits to families, but the
Nordic countries were spending much more on supporting child care. That

the tax credit and housing benefit systems to reach any kind of an

in real terms now than it was in 2009. Welcome though the announcement
today on the increase of the national minimum wage in October by 12p to
£6.31 an hour is, that will represent the fourth successive year
of a real-terms fall in the level of the national minimum wage. It will
be returning to levels it was last at in real terms in 2004, and comes
at a time when the coalition appears severely divided in its commitment
to the national minimum wage. According to a study published by the
Resolution Foundation this morning, the top 1% in our society are
earning on average £60 a hour, taking home at least
£123,000 a year on a 40-hour working week. Someone on the
minimum wage would need to work 24 hours a day for 830 days in order to
match the annual earnings of a person in the wealthiest 1% of our
society. The failure to deal with that surging inequality under this

welfare and fiscal policies that reduce joblessness and inequality, not
a politics of division peddled by the Chancellor and pitched at the
very worst sentiments of human nature. As the Social Market Foundation

bank employees a tax cut of £54,000 a year, while 5.1 million

for Macclesfield (David Rutley), who is no longer in his place, will be
rather disappointed, because I cannot share his view that we have the
best of all possible worlds. Perhaps his name is really Dr Pangloss. I
hear an awful lot of Panglossian politics in Scotland, 
<?notus-xml column=118?>where it takes the form of, “If we were only independent and we
waved our magic independence wand, everything would be
wonderful,” but to get it here is
astonishing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041524000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041524000008"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T21:27:42"></hs_TimeCode>The
other surreal aspect of today’s debate, which would astonish
anyone listening who cannot see the Chamber, is that we have heard from
a grand total of three Government Back Benchers prepared to speak up
for their own Government’s Budget. They were not so shy about
coming forward last week to recall what were to them the glory days of
Lady Thatcher’s Government. They were all very keen to come down
here especially to talk about it. Many of my constituents thought we
should have talked about that today, and perhaps we should have, since
Government Back Benchers clearly did not think it worth debating the
Finance Bill. Much effort and money could probably have been
saved.</hs_Para>

was not one of those who came last week, because I spent most of the
recess talking to my constituents. If this were the Government’s
first Budget, not their fourth, we would be better placed to believe
the words they keep using. We were told in 2010 that this would
work—that we had a terrible financial crisis and that we all had
to tighten our belts and get through it together, but that it would be
worth it. Just how long do we have to wait?
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T21:29:15"></hs_TimeCode>These Budgets
and these Budget debates and debates on the Finance Bill are turning
into groundhog day. The Government say all the same things and, I have
to admit, they will no doubt say that Opposition Members all say the
same things, but that is because the debate has not moved on. On this,
the Government’s fourth Budget, we are indeed saying the same
things. Perhaps that is why Government Back Benchers did not feel it
worth coming—because they know perfectly well that there is no
point in saying the same things because the Government’s
approach is not working.</hs_Para>

Government’s answer to many of the criticisms of their
policies—particularly their policies to reduce tax credits and
benefits—is that people can get around those cuts by working
more hours. In fact, they even defend a lot of their measures by saying
that they will put a rod into people’s backs and get them out
there working those extra hours. The assumption seems to be not just
that unemployment is, as they allege, a lifestyle choice, but that
under-employment is apparently a lifestyle choice too and that, really,
people have to get up and go out there, and everything will be
fine.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041524000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041524000011"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T21:30:38"></hs_TimeCode>My
constituent Joe—one of the many people I talked to in the recent
recess—is affected by the bedroom tax because he was housed by
the council in a two-bedroom house. It was not his choice; that is
where he was given a house. He went to his supermarket employer to ask
whether it would increase the 15 hours a week he works in his job to
help to pay the extra amount. His employer said no. That might have
been partly because, at 15 hours a week at the minimum wage,
he is nicely underneath the threshold for paying national insurance.
Doubtless his employer prefers to have another part-time employee at
that level. However, even if his employer offered him more hours, at
whose expense would that be? Would it mean that another employee got
fewer hours or, if Joe was given full-time work, that somebody else
would not have a job at all? Unless the supermarket wants to employ
people to stand around doing nothing, one has to presume that it has
calibrated its work force according to the work that needs to be done.
It is not a charity. His employer is not there to give him a few extra
hours so 
<?notus-xml column=119?>that he can pay his bedroom tax. It needs only the workers it
needs. It is therefore a myth to assume that people such as Joe just
have to get out there and everything will be fine. That sums up exactly
what is wrong with this Government’s economic policy. Austerity
reduces demand. Indeed, it has reduced demand all over Europe, which is
one reason why we are not coming out of this recession through
exports—one of the promises made to us in 2010—because
everybody is in the same boat.</hs_Para>

Joe’s current employer will not give him the extra hours, he
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T21:32:30"></hs_TimeCode>could, I
suppose, find out whether there is another job out there. Perhaps he
should see who else  is hiring for his type of work in the
city. I would stress that, compared with many other areas—such
as that represented by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T21:32:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Glasgow North East (Mr Bain)—Edinburgh does not
have high unemployment. In fact, the unemployment rate in my
constituency is only 4.8%, which in a lot of people’s terms
would be very low. I thought, “I’ll look at the
Government’s great new innovation,” which is a website
called Universal Jobmatch. I do not know whether any Member present has
looked at Universal Jobmatch—I have, on several
occasions—but I put in “shop assistant, Edinburgh
area” to see what would come out the other end. If I had been
Joe, things would have looked quite hopeful at first, because there
appeared to be four pages of jobs. There were 25 on each page—I
counted—so I thought, “Well that’s 100 jobs.
That’s not bad.”</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041524000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041524000013">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T21:33:45"></hs_TimeCode>
fact, there turned out to be 76 job entries, because the last page had
only one entry, so things were not quite as healthy as I thought, but
when I looked, I saw that 57 of those 76 entries were for a firm
offering jobs taking out catalogues and trying to sell things door to
door—the archetypal job that people often have to take during a
recession. In fact, we can read all about that from the 1930s, which is
where we are again—it is not the 1980s; in fact, it is the
1930s. Most of those 57 entries were not even for jobs in
Edinburgh, and in my view they were not proper jobs. Maybe Joe should
see whether he can make the extra hours by selling whatever it is he
would have to sell.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T21:34:01"></hs_TimeCode> is absolutely
extraordinary, however, that 57 of the 76 job vacancies advertised in
the Edinburgh area—which, by the way, stretches to Fife and to
Falkirk—were what most of us would probably describe as
non-jobs. Of the others, only six were actually in the city. If Joe
were to apply for a job just outside the city, he would have to take on
board the fact that it would cost him money to get there, and that that
might negate all or part of any extra income he might earn.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T21:35:08"></hs_TimeCode>So there were
six jobs in retail in Edinburgh, a city in which, we are told,
unemployment is really not too bad and we should not worry too much
about the state of the economy. That is not a growing economy. It is
not a healthy economy. It is, however, the reality for Joe and many
others like him.</hs_Para>

also spoke yesterday to a constituent who clearly understood how
economics should work. She told me that she and her husband had already
lost £85 a month in tax credits; their income had gone down. Her
husband is a self-employed taxi driver, and she told me that because
people were pulling in their horns, spending less and having fewer
nights out, he was getting less business. His earnings were dropping.
He was out driving on Monday and Tuesday nights last week, for five
or  
<?notus-xml column=120?>six hours each night, yet he took in only £55 a night, from which
he would have to take off his costs. She reckoned that people were not
spending because they did not have sufficient income, either because
they had lost their jobs or because they were on shorter hours.

bedroom tax hits, he will be down to £2 a day, so he would have
to keep going for 15,000 years. In the Budget, the very poorest are
being squeezed hardest to give some money to the squeezed middle to
encourage them to vote Conservative, while millionaires are being given
tax breaks when the top 10% in Britain have seen their average income
go up by 11% over the last two years alone, simply through the

were a few bright spots in the Budget. There were the mortgage deposit
schemes, but according to people in the financial world, there is a
real risk that they will generate the sort of sub-prime debt and
irresponsible lending that banks are not supposed to be engaged in if
we are not to encounter a problem, as we did in 2008.

free.” People were very excited about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T21:40:51"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
the general situation is that we have no growth, as people have
mentioned. The problem is the debt to GDP ratio. Debt as a proportion
of the value of the economy was 55% in 2010, and it will be 85% in
2015. There are two ways of sorting that out: to increase
GDP—the size of the economy—as Labour did in the 11 years
from 1997 to 2008 when it went up by about 40%; and/or to attack the
debt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041524000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041524000022">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T21:41:29"></hs_TimeCode>
total focus is on attacking the debt. In 2010, when the Chancellor
announced that he was cutting half a million jobs, what happened?
People, particularly in the public service, stopped spending. The
savings rate went up, consumer demand went down, growth was flattened,
so debt as a proportion of GDP is rising, and more and more people are
doing less work. We hear about the extra million jobs, but they are
producing no overall extra output, so average productivity is
down<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T21:41:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041524000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041524000023">We
need to invest. People make a big joke about that. They say,
“You’ve got to borrow to pay off your loans,” but
there is a difference between investing in productive
capability—in skills, infrastructure and marketing and in
super-connectivity; I mentioned earlier that Swansea had put in a bid
for super-connected city status—which would help the economy to
grow, and simply spending and borrowing to pay people to do nothing and
keep them on the dole. That was the old problem for the Tories pre-1997

other countries, there is enormous investment in research and
development, particularly in emerging economies such as Brazil, China
and India. When we study the behaviour of multinational companies, we
see that they are drawn to R and D clusters, not just to
ever-decreasing levels of corporation tax. Obviously that is part of
the criteria, but reducing corporation tax from 21% to 20% and reducing
the yield by 5% does not make much sense. The money would be better
spent on super-connectivity for all our smaller cities, including
Swansea<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T21:43:06"></hs_TimeCode>. In
Swansea, there is massive investment by the European Investment Bank in
a second campus, which is creating an R and D cluster that is

bedroom tax is a cruel inefficiency. Housing benefit has doubled in the
last 10 years, but 70% of the increase was caused by private sector
rent growth. People are being put into the private sector because not
enough council and social housing is being built. In Wales, 29,000
families are affected, but there are only 400 empty
single-bedroom units of accommodation, so there is nowhere for them to
go. Two thirds of the people affected are disabled. In
Swansea, moving someone from a three-bedroom council house to a
two-bedroom private sector 
<?notus-xml column=122?>house would cost 50% more, so housing benefit will go up again. A lot of
these measures are counter-productive and destructive, but that
particular one encourages people to have more children, even if they
were not going to, to fill up the rooms. Meanwhile, the overall benefit
cap encourages families to break up so that there are two
units that can come up to the £400 threshold. The policy has not
been thought out, and we are seeing an awful return to a Dickensian
view of the worthy and unworthy poor, the shirkers and the workers, and
the strivers and the

economic indicators to which any genuinely in-touch Chancellor would
want urgently to respond? Before we consider the current economic
situation and this year’s Budget, let me take the House back
briefly to the Chancellor’s first Budget—the June 2010
so-called emergency Budget—which, according to him, was
necessary to deal decisively with the country’s record debts and
produce a credible plan to deal with the record deficit. Right hon. and
hon. Members may recall that the Chancellor used that emergency Budget
speech to predict that the UK economy would grow by 1.2% in 2010, 2.8%
in 2012, and 2.9% in 2013. He was dreaming. As a result of his failure,
we have had a double-dip recession and the economy is stagnating, with
just 0.8% growth since the 2010 spending review, compared with 5.3%
forecast at the time. He consistently

year before, while the UK’s trade deficit has widened to
£9.4 billion following a worrying 4.7% fall in exports to non-EU
countries. Indeed, over the past two and a half years, lack of
confidence created by the Chancellor’s failing plan has seen
business investment fall by £3 billion, compared with
the OBR’s forecast of a £24 billion rise. Of the G20
nations, only Italy and Saudi Arabia have experienced a sharper fall in
investment in that period. As a consequence of the Chancellor’s
economic failure, Government borrowing has risen, not fallen, with the
coalition set to borrow £245 billion more than the forecast in
autumn 2010. <I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> I am astounded that

negative watch—the very cover that the Chancellor used for his
accelerated spending cuts in 2010. What does that economic failure mean
for ordinary people up and down the country? Who is paying the price

the most mixed message of all is the coalition’s incredible
decision, announced in last year’s omnishambles of a Budget and
confirmed in this year’s Budget document, to give some of the
wealthiest people in this country an average £100,000 tax cut
this month. A Chancellor who claims that he finds tax avoidance
“morally repugnant” is determined to carry on with his
game of “Who wants to bung a millionaire?”, reducing the
50p rate of income tax because the “behavioural response”
was “larger than expected”. No doubt he will have phoned
a few friends last weekend to remind them of his good
news<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. This
means, in effect, that top earners have been so nifty at shifting their
income to minimise their tax liability that this Government, who talk
tough on tax avoidance, are rewarding them by cutting the rate. Liberal
Democrat colleagues will be telling themselves that this indefensible
decision does not matter and that everything is okay because of the
much-trumpeted increase to the personal allowance. But they have not
quite owned up to the fact that families on average will be £891
worse off in this tax year, and cuts to tax credits and benefits have
been introduced since
2010.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041524000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041524000047">Indeed,
the small rise in the personal allowance is hugely outweighed by the
cuts to tax credits and child benefit, the bedroom tax, the granny tax
and the increase 
<?notus-xml column=126?>in VAT, which the Liberal Democrats campaigned against so vociferously
before it was announced in June 2010. The straight fact is that the

she<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:01:41"></hs_TimeCode> rescued the
country from a permanent sense of decline and restored economic

the Members for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field), for
Redcar (Ian Swales)
and<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:02:08"></hs_TimeCode> for
Macclesfield. The best I can say about the contributions we heard from
the Opposition Benches is that we heard a lot of warm and fluffy talk
about motherhood and apple pie but not a single idea on how to rescue
our economy from the mess the Labour party created. This Government
inherited a shocking legacy. The country will never forget the
consequences of 13 years of Labour government: the largest deficit in
the G20; the deepest recession since the second world war; and the
world’s largest banking bail-out. We have taken action to cut
the deficit, stimulate the economy and create a fairer and more
efficient tax system. The Bill continues along that
path.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041524000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041524000055">Let
me focus first on growth and competitiveness. The Bill builds on
previous Bills by introducing a  range of measures
demonstrating the Government’s commitment to supporting growth
and enterprise. Against 
<?notus-xml column=127?>the background of external challenges, such as the continuing crisis in
the eurozone, it is vital that the UK tax system attracts investment to
this country and does everything possible to ensure that UK businesses
can compete in the global economy.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:03:44"></hs_TimeCode> Government
have already significantly reduced the tax burden on business. In 2013,
corporation tax will be 23%, significantly lower than the 28% inherited
from the previous Government.</hs_Para>

we embarked on those reforms, we have seen a number of high-profile
businesses returning to the UK or coming here for the first time,
including WPP, Lancashire, Aon, Rowan and Seadrill. But we want to go
further. The additional reductions set out in clauses 4 and 6 mean that
the corporation tax rate will reach 21% in April 2014 and just 20% in
April 2015, the lowest rate in the G20, and lower than any comparable
EU member state.</hs_Para>

competitiveness is about more than just the rate of corporation tax.
That is why the Bill also includes measures to give targeted support to
the innovative sectors that will drive growth in the 21st century.
Clause 34 delivers an above-the-line tax credit for large
companies’ R and D expenditure, with an increased rate of
support of 10%. That will provide a more visible and certain relief and
greater cash flow support to the wide range of companies
engaging in groundbreaking research in the UK.</hs_Para>

turn to fairness, which is at the heart of the Bill. The Bill helps
families with the cost of living while making sure that the best off in
our society pay their fair share. The increase in the personal
allowance in clause 2, mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for
Redcar and others, will set the value at £9,440 for April this
year, an increase of £1,335—the largest ever cash
increase. It will save a typical basic-rate taxpayer £267 in
cash terms and it is a tax cut for 24 million people. That is 
a major step towards the Government’s commitment to raise the
personal allowance to £10,000 by the end of this Parliament. My
right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in the Budget that that goal
will be reached next year, a whole year ahead of
schedule.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041524000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041524000065">Taken

Government also recognise the rising cost of fuel and the pressure that
that puts on the finances of households and businesses. That is why we
have decided to cancel the increase in fuel duty planned for September
2013. Clause 177 will freeze fuel duty at current levels, maintaining
the longest freeze in fuel duty for 20 years. Under the Government,
average pump prices are 13p per litre lower than if we had implemented
the plans that we inherited from the previous
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041524000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041524000067">When
ordinary households are experiencing real pressure on their incomes, it
is particularly important that tax reliefs are well targeted and cannot
be used without limit by those on the highest incomes to reduce tax
bills. Clause 16 legislates for a new cap on certain unlimited tax
reliefs from this April to curtail excessive use of those reliefs. The
cap will be set at £50,000 or 25% of the relevant
person’s income, whichever is the greater, ensuring that the
reliefs cannot be exploited unfairly. The cost of pensions tax relief
is rising and has doubled in a decade since 2001. This Finance Bill
therefore legislates to reduce pensions tax relief lifetime and annual
allowances to £1.25 million and £40,000 respectively to
limit the amount of relief available to the top 2% of pension
savers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:09:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041524000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0003.htm#13041524000068">Fairness
is also about making sure that everyone plays by the same rules. The
vast majority who pay their taxes will, rightly, not tolerate
non-compliant individuals and businesses not paying the tax that they
owe, and this Government agree. To that end, the Bill
includes a major package of measures to crack down on tax
avoidance by a small minority who refuse to pay their fair share.
Clauses 203 to 212 and schedule 41 legislate for the UK’s first
general anti-abuse rule, or GAAR. This is one of the most significant
changes to UK tax law. It will have a strong deterrent effect on those
concocting abusive tax avoidance schemes or considering using them, and
where they persist it will give Her Majesty’s Revenue and

schemes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:10:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Finance Bill includes measures to close 15 loopholes that have been
used to avoid tax. Nine of these provisions have immediate effect from
Budget day, and one—on tackling stamp duty avoidance—is
backdated to the previous Budget, following the Chancellor's clear
warning in 2012. This demonstrates the Government’s continuing
commitment to fast, effective and targeted action to tackle avoidance.
In addition, we are strengthening the successful disclosure of the tax
avoidance schemes regime to increase the information that promoters of
tax avoidance schemes have to provide about the users of their schemes.
Together with the GAAR, these measures will increase tax revenues by
almost £l billion by 2017-18, as well as protecting future
revenues. In addition, the Government are investing almost £1
billion in HMRC’s compliance activities in order to raise
additional revenues of £22 billion per annum by the

generosity and for the way in which you slowed down through the gears.
It is greatly appreciated. I am strangely gratified to see such a well

are many reasons why a humble, insignificant Back Bencher should raise
an item on the Adjournment. One can seek the ventilation of an issue;
one can seek the investigation of an issue. One can seek adumbration or
agitation, and possibly even instigation. In my case, it is with some
trepidation that I approach a subject that is originally to do with
celebration, but that then moves into the dark world of prognostication
and, in the case of the Minister,
implication.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000007">There
has been a quiet but dramatic and extraordinary revolution in the world
of the community pharmacist. The traditional model of the dispensing
chemist is  as outdated as the mediaeval apothecary. I urge
all  right hon. and hon. Members to visit the new world
of the community pharmacist, which will exist in their
constituencies as surely as it does in
mine.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000008">It
would be invidious to mention individuals in the context of the miracle
that is occurring in north-west London, but if I were so tempted, the
names of Nilesh Morjaria of the Church pharmacy, of Mahendra Gokani of
Mandeville road and of C.K. Nathwani of the Ravenor pharmacy would
feature strongly, as would Usha and Dilip Shah of the Alpha pharmacy in
Northolt. It was at a visit to that estimable emporium, kindly
facilitated by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in the person of the
passionate Charles Willis, once an ornament of this House, that the
full range of services now available from what we once called our
“local chemist” became
apparent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000009">The
Minister will be well aware that the core role of the
pharmacist—the dispensing of medicines—has grown from 556
million medicines in 2002 to 885 million medicines in 2011, an increase
of 56%. I will return to the current figures. The patient or the
customer will find the community pharmacist offering services such as
home delivery of medicines and medicines use reviews, which ensure that
patients gain optimal use from prescribed medicines—2.4 million
people took advantage of such a review in the last year and the
outcomes were staggering. Forty per cent. of asthma sufferers showed
better asthma management and 55% of patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease demonstrated a reduction in symptoms following a
medicines use
review.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000010">The
consequential reduction in emergency visits to accident and emergency
departments will bring a warm glow to the Minister’s heart and
to the hearts of his Treasury colleagues, as will the new medicine
service, 
<?notus-xml column=138?>which advises patients on the therapeutic use of newly prescribed
medicines. Evidence already exists that shows that 31% of those who
make use of this new medicines service adhere more fully to prescribed
medicines, minimising waste and increasing their
effectiveness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000011">Smoking
cessation is one of the supreme achievements of the community
pharmacists in my part of the world, and Usha and Dilip Shah have not
only improved quality of life by their efforts, but actually saved
lives, as theirs is one of the most successful smoking cessation
services offered. As one who had his last gasper in February 2006, I
can speak of the effectiveness of this service from a position of

Pound:</Member></B> Not for the first time, the hon. Gentleman raises
an extraordinarily interesting point. I will discuss later the issue of
the level playing field for pharmacists. Far be it from me to suggest
that he might wish to seek his own Adjournment debate on that subject
as it is one of great significance, but I do not disagree with the
points that he makes. I look to the Minister for a similar
statement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000015">The
Minister will conclude that I have certainly ventilated the approbation
and celebration I referred to earlier, but all is not well—all
is not sweetness and light in the well-lit and warm world of the
community pharmacy. I hope that the Minister and I can agree that the
community pharmacist is the third pillar of the NHS and, just as
general practice and hospital care defined the early days of the NHS
and were labelled as the two great pillars on which the new
creation stood, the changing role of the community pharmacist can come
to define a third
pillar.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000016">The
cruel tyranny of time prevents me from fully detailing this
proposition, but I refer the Minister and the House to the excellent
2013 UCL school of pharmacy lecture “From making medicines to
optimising health”, given by the chief executive of the
Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, Sue Sharpe. Dr Sharpe
identifies the intentions of the 2008 White Paper “Pharmacy in
England”, while rightly deducing that even in the short time
since then the nature of the community pharmacist has changed over and
over again. She should also be credited with allowing me to remind the
House of the marvellous quote from Auden to which she refers in her
lecture:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="1304162000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000046">“Health

the picture is one of rosy growth and rude good health. Diversification
in over the counter sales has increased the profitability of the
pharmacist, and a new form of health care and preventive medicine has
emerged almost without notice and certainly without fanfare. The NHS is
so effusively documented at every level that I am sure I could find the
evidence of my birth in the first week of the NHS in Hammersmith in
July 1948, when I was one of the first of what Aneurin Bevan identified
as “bundles for Britain’s future”—I like to
think that he looked down on me swinging in my white-painted metal
bassinet in Queen Charlotte’s hospital and identified me as a
class warrior of the future, although I would sadly disappoint him in
that area. The fact that I am still alive, however, is a credit to the
NHS. In such a system, it is extraordinary that there is a real paucity
of documentation relating to the range of services and extent of
outcomes of community pharmacy. Hopefully, this will not remain
uncorrected, but I freely admit to my concerns about the place of the
community pharmacist in the new NHS structures. I very much hope that
the Minister will allow me to share these concerns with him tonight,
and also allow me to look in gentle supplication to him for some
positive
suggestions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000018">The
Minister is all too well aware that the Health and Social Care Act 2012
empowers clinical commissioning groups, led by GPs, and health and
wellbeing boards to play the key role in shaping local health care
services. I contend that commissioning public services on
a localised basis may lead to variations in availability,
quality and outcomes. I realise that we have discussed this at length,
and I do not want to rehash the arguments that wracked the House during
the passage of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, but one way in
which this apparent deficit could be addressed is through pharmacy
representation. There is currently no pharmacy representation on health
and wellbeing boards. Such representation could be a catalyst for
constructive change in primary care. Even the pharmaceutical needs
assessments drawn up by the health and wellbeing boards may lack any
input from pharmacists.</hs_Para>

sheer complexity of the arrangements under which the new commissioning
arrangements operate can be a barrier to the provision of services. I
am indebted to Benjamin Wheatley of Boots for confirmation that
individual contracts now require pharmacy contractors to invoice either
local authorities or clinical commissioning groups via the NHS shared
business services. I have to say that my head aches when I try to
contemplate the mechanism whereby one invoices through all these
various groups and all the choices concerned. I am all in favour of
choice, but sometimes it is ridiculous. In cases such as this, we are
actually preventing good people from doing good work. The effect of

NHS outcomes framework refers directly to the quality of life for
people with long-term conditions, and this is an excellent opportunity
for the community pharmacy, in addition to other qualified health care
practitioners, to deliver a key aspect of the Government’s new
health care system in England. The pharmacist, as is so obvious when
one comes to think of it, may often be the first person to spot a
development in a patient’s condition. An early identification
can be therapeutically priceless. It is often the community pharmacist
who notes that someone has not come in for their medication or, when
they are delivering to their home, that the person does not open the
door, is looking more tired and pale, or occasionally has something
more dramatic such as a nosebleed. This early identification is
absolutely priceless, and this is where the role of the community
pharmacist has changed beyond almost all recognition. I am seriously
worried that such best practice, as recommended by Earl Howe, is
threatened by the impact of changing priorities as commissioners

funding passed to CCGs and local authorities is already being used to
commission services from community pharmacies, so that for every new
service there is a very real possibility that an existing one will be
ended. Local authorities will, quite rightly, look to address their own
priorities. I referred earlier to the additional pharmacy-led services
in England and the huge growth in recent years, but 2012 actually saw a
decrease of 5%. It is reasonable to assume that the transition period
between commissioners in 2013 and 2014 will see that decline continue.
It must be recorded that any diversion from existing services will have
an immediate effect on patients. If there is one thing we can all agree
on, it is how the community pharmacist has earned the trust of patients
and the patient community. It has been so remarkable and beneficial
that it cannot be threatened. If there is one thing that patients in
long-term care plans in particular are terrified of, it is a change in
the structure that could affect their medication and the ability of a
community pharmacist to provide for their needs.</hs_Para>

General Pharmaceutical Council is the regulator of pharmacists, and as

inhibits many pharmacists from applying to provide services under the

<?notus-xml column=141?>not know why, but they cannot register. I have tried
myself to operate the system for registering online. If someone wishes
to provide a service, they have to give their registration number, and
if they are not entitled to be allocated a number, the whole process
stops. I hope that this small but significant and far-reaching
improvement is one that, yet again, can be laid at the

with the codification of a requirement for community pharmacist
representation within NHS England and the resuscitation of the roles
previously identified in SHAs and PCTs, a new model of integrated
health care could relieve pressure on general practice, provide local
and accessible services, manage long-term conditions and deliver
healthy living advice. In my part of the world, we have a huge number
of singlehanded GP practices. They are typically elderly
men—occasionally women, but usually men—operating in
terraced houses. It is most unlikely that they can be sacked—I
am not altogether sure they should be sacked—but they need a
complementary service, because the singlehanded GP model is simply not
appropriate to the dizzying variety of illnesses and conditions that
apply particularly in the urban environment at this the
beginning of the 21st century. I would like to see a synergy
between community pharmacists and general practitioners working
together to the benefit of all patients.</hs_Para>

blanched earlier when I referred to him as a good and decent man. I
meant that sincerely. I think that everyone in the House holds the
Minister in the same esteem. He is a good and decent man, and I hope
that he will consider some, if not all, of the points I have raised

this debate is a tribute to that distinguished former chemist, the late
Baroness Thatcher. She achieved a great deal in the world of chemistry,

that the Minister is as convinced of their good will and good work as I
am and that tonight he will put his shoulder to that wheel and advance
the cause of integrated health care and the role of the community
pharmacist.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_15_PT_1/8C5D6691936D5C70B449DFBD775E9BE218B1EB63" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="15 April 2013">Monday

congratulate the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:48:27"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Ealing North (Stephen Pound) not only on securing this
debate on community pharmacies, but on entertaining us. At the end of a
long day, it has been appreciated by the gathering before me, small
though it might be.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:48:42"></hs_TimeCode>I can assure him
that I am not often found talking about domains and the outcomes
framework. He and I are at one on that subject. He talked about the
quiet revolution he has witnessed in his constituency and the several
fine pharmacies there. They do incredibly valuable work, and I can
assure him absolutely that I see a critical role 
<?notus-xml column=142?>for community pharmacies. He talked about integrated care. They can play
a central role in an integrated service for patients, particularly
those with the long-term, chronic conditions he referred to, so I am
completely at one with him on that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1304162000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000031"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:49:18"></hs_TimeCode>Today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:49:38"></hs_TimeCode>,
more NHS community pharmacies than ever offer health care treatment and
healthy lifestyle advice and support in England. As I think the hon.
Gentleman said, they dispensed 885 million prescription items last
year—up 56% from 10 years ago, with nine in every 10
items prescribed. Pharmacies are also readily accessible. Research has
shown that 99% of people can get to a pharmacy with relative ease,
especially in more deprived communities, perhaps including parts of his
constituency. Because of that, many people use their local pharmacy
team as the first port of call for all sorts of health problems, both
minor and major. Indeed, that might be the first point at which a
serious condition is identified. For that reason, pharmacies are
incredibly important. For example, many pharmacies now offer services
that help patients to get the best from their medicines or provide
support for patients with long-term conditions such as asthma who are
starting a new
medicine<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:50:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000032">However,
this goes beyond mere statistics. A graph or chart cannot represent the
relief of an elderly person who gets help with a niggling cold or
cough, the comfort that a pharmacist can provide a young mother worried
about her child’s health or the benefits that people with
diabetes or heart disease get from good lifestyle advice. This is all
because people trust the community pharmacist. That trust is a vital
commodity that should be very much valued. As the hon. Gentleman said,
community pharmacies help people to live healthier day-to-day lives. I
know he saw that for himself when he visited a pharmacy in his
constituency recently. Indeed, I visited a pharmacy in my constituency
in Sheringham recently. For a photo opportunity, I had a blood pressure
test done on my arm. It came out that I had high blood pressure, so I
was immediately referred to my GP. It happens that my blood pressure is
all right, but that kind of reminder or shock to the system—in
this case experienced by me—is of enormous value to many people,
and he was right to highlight that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1304162000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000033"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:51:45"></hs_TimeCode>The
pharmacy that the hon. Gentleman visited has, like many others, helped
thousands of people to quit smoking. He talked about his own
experience. I am not sure whether he got help from a pharmacy, but I
remember as his next-door neighbour over in Norman Shaw North that he
used to smoke like a chimney and he has now stopped. That is an
admirable achievement. Nearly three quarters of all pharmacies in
England gave out quit kits last year, many as part of the Stoptober
campaign, which was an enormous success.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1304162000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000034">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:52:41"></hs_TimeCode>
pharmacies show how they can be proactive, not reactive places,
genuinely improving people’s health and well-being on a daily
basis, so I welcome the endorsement that the hon. Gentleman gave to the
pharmacy’s history of good
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:52:31"></hs_TimeCode>. Demand
for health care will increase. An increasing population, with people
living longer and needing more treatment, means that we must harness
every available resource to meet those needs. We want to see
pharmacy’s contribution flourish in the future, very much as a
central part of local health provision.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1304162000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000035"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:52:49"></hs_TimeCode>Only
a fortnight ago, far-reaching changes to transform commissioning health
care in England came into effect. Clinicians, not managers, are now in
the driving seat. 
<?notus-xml column=143?>The NHS Commissioning Board—now NHS England—has
responsibility for commissioning all NHS primary care services,
including pharmaceutical services. We expect NHS England to involve
clinical commissioning groups where appropriate, because they know the
needs of their local populations best. To meet those needs, CCGs are
free to commission further services over and above what NHS England
commissions. If they want to, and if it is appropriate, CCGs can
commission those services from pharmacies. Local authorities now have
the powers and funding to commission public health services, such as
stopping smoking or sexual health services, and are free to commission
from pharmacies. That provides an enormous opportunity to pharmacies.
There is an increase in the public health budget this year and next. It
is important for pharmacies to get stuck in and make their case to
local authorities about the service they can provide—accessible
to all, on the high street and trusted, as we have agreed.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1304162000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000036"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:54:04"></hs_TimeCode>These
are far-reaching and necessary developments. It is therefore important
that new commissioners are fully aware of pharmacy’s potential.
That is why the pharmacy and public health forum, chaired by Professor
Richard Parish, has been working on how pharmacy can best enhance its
role in public health, with more research into pharmacy’s
contribution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000037"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:54:08"></hs_TimeCode>Our
goal is to allow the new commissioning arrangements to make people
healthier. The hon. Gentleman referred to integrated care, which I also
mentioned earlier. The Government intend to focus on trying to achieve
an integrated care model across the country, moving away from the
fragmented nature of health care delivery towards a much more
integrated model, and pharmacies can play an absolutely central role in
that approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:54:55"></hs_TimeCode>.
Pharmacy has an excellent reputation when it comes to integration. I
know that pharmacies have a track record of providing quality services
that people value, and that patients and consumers hold pharmacy in
high regard, so all commissioners should recognise the potential of
community
pharmacies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:55:13"></hs_TimeCode>. It
is also clear that the relationship should work the other way, too.
Just as commissioners support pharmacies, pharmacies should also be
ready to support commissioners by making available their professional
experience and specialist clinical expertise. Pharmacies should make
the case to commissioners as to why they should consider the role of
community pharmacies.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1304162000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000038"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:55:34"></hs_TimeCode>The
hon. Gentleman referred to community pharmacy’s concerns about
the new commissioning arrangements, and I hope that I can address some
of those concerns and reassure him. The first big concern involves the
availability of senior pharmacy expertise and pharmacy’s role in
commissioning. I want to assure the hon. Gentleman that the chief
pharmaceutical officer for England is already part of the senior
management team at NHS England. NHS England is looking at how its
regional and area teams can make use of appropriate
pharmaceutical
advice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:56:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000039">The
hon. Gentleman also pointed out that some pharmacists are concerned
that they are not represented on CCGs. We deliberately did not
prescribe set lists of other health professionals who should be on
CCGs’ governing bodies. CCGs must be free to decide that for
themselves, because it is they, not us, who know exactly 
<?notus-xml column=144?>what is suitable for their communities. If every single profession were
represented on every single board, that would make for bloated and
top-heavy organisations, which is exactly the opposite of what we want
to achieve.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:56:45"></hs_TimeCode>However, CCGs
have a duty to get advice from a broad range of health experts. CCGs
can involve pharmacy, and I would expect that involvement to be
commonplace, given the extent to which pharmacies are
involved in people’s care. I am sure that the existing
local pharmaceutical committees and the new local pharmacy networks
will be more than willing to offer advice and support to
commissioners<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:57:05"></hs_TimeCode>. I
hope that they will do so, and that they will make the case to the
commissioners that they can improve
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000040">The
second big concern involves the potential for pharmacy-led care to
stop. I understand that concern—it is natural at a time of
transition and significant change—but I do not share the
apprehension. I see a potentially greater role for pharmacies, if they
can make their case effectively. NHS England is legally required to
commission pharmaceutical services that meet health care needs. It
bases that on the assessments of pharmaceutical needs for which the
health and wellbeing boards are now
responsible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:57:46"></hs_TimeCode>. As
I said, pharmacy’s reputation is well established. Commissioners
are not going to stop effective and proven pharmacy services overnight.
I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that, as CCGs have no power under the
Health and Social Care Act 2012 to commission pharmaceutical services,
they cannot cut or decommission those services either.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1304162000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000041">Will<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:58:18"></hs_TimeCode>
some things change? Yes, of course they will. We would not have
embarked on our reforms of the NHS if there had been no need for
change. For example, local authorities have already taken over
responsibility for public health services such as smoking cessation
services. Pharmacy absolutely has its place in the new NHS. Not only
that, but in my view it must surely grow to meet the increasing needs
of our communities. The reformed commissioning environment provides new
opportunities for pharmacies. If they remain passive and do not seek to
make their case, they will suffer, but if they go out and make the case
for the central role that they can play, for their accessibility and
for the trust that the community has in them, they will be able to
thrive and prosper, particularly given the focus on a new integrated
care model. They can demonstrate how they can improve health and
improve people’s
well-being.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000042">The
third big concern is that CCGs’ commissioning decisions will be
unduly influenced by people with a vested interest in securing
contracts and cutting pharmacies out of the equation. The
Department’s view is that this is unlikely to happen. The idea
that members of CCGs will secure all the profitable and lucrative
services for themselves is a pretty negative view, and one that I do
not share, but of course we have to be
vigilant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T22:59:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000043">We
will not allow a situation to develop where profits come before patient
care or patient choice. That would be in direct contradiction to the
founding principles of the NHS, and it must not happen. We have put
robust governance arrangements in place and guidance was issued last
year to all CCGs. Registers of interests must be maintained and
available for public scrutiny. Members and employees must declare any
conflict or potential conflict in relation to a decision to be made by
the group, and there are effective sanctions if those principles are
breached. In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T23:00:11"></hs_TimeCode>
addition, the General Medical Council 
<?notus-xml column=145?>published updated guidance for doctors last month. It comes into
effect a week from today, on 22 April. It includes a section on
doctors’ financial and commercial arrangements and conflicts of
interest. The GMC has provided supplementary guidance explaining how
doctors can put those principles into
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-15T23:00:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304162000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/debtext/130415-0004.htm#1304162000044">I
conclude by thanking the hon. Gentleman once again for the opportunity
to discuss the crucial role of community pharmacies in the new health
and care system. The new arrangements will allow commissioners 
<?notus-xml column=146?>and pharmacists to work closer together, not in opposition. There will
be new opportunities for better and more flexible pharmaceutical care
arrangements that are both relevant and accessible to local people.

Government share the commission’s concern about non-compliance
with the apprentice minimum wage and we are clear that employers must
pay their staff at least the minimum wage. However, we believe that it
is important to maintain the relative position of the apprentice rate
compared to benefits and the youth rates to preserve the attractiveness
of apprenticeships for young people. The Government have concluded
therefore that a 1% increase in the apprentice rate would be
appropriate. This is in line with the recommended increases in the
youth rates; evidence in the commission’s report shows that the
majority of apprentices paid on and just above the apprentice rate are
young people. It is also the planned level of public sector pay and
benefit increases. We consider that the modest level of this increase
would not have significant adverse effects on employment or training
for apprentices. In conjunction with this, we are putting in place a
package of measures to improve compliance, including focused
communications and targeted enforcement by HM Revenue &amp;
Customs.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1304155000047" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/wmstext/130415m0001.htm#1304155000047"><I>Accommodation

primary focus of our proposals is in relation to crime, where we are
still spending over £l billion a year. We are proposing to
introduce a model of competitive tendering, initially in criminal legal
aid work only and over a longer period in civil and family services.
Our preferred approach is to introduce competition for the full range
of litigation services (except very-high-costs cases (crime)) and
magistrates court representation. For criminal advocacy, we propose to
restructure the Crown Court advocacy fee scheme in ways that should
help encourage efficient working and the prompt resolution of cases,
consistent with our overall objectives for the criminal justice system,
and to reduce the use of multiple counsel. We are also proposing to
reduce fees paid in very-high-cost cases (crime), which are the small
number of cases that attract a disproportionately high level of spend.
The overall effect on advocates will be to rebalance the fee income so
those at the top take the greatest reduction, while those earning the
lowest fees may actually see a small increase. We also propose limited

The business plans set out the agencies’ budgets, key

Department also published on the same day the first performance
specification for the strategic road network which sets out five
outcomes and underlying key performance deliverables for this network
for the period 2013-15. This meets a key recommendation made by Alan
Cook in his review of the strategic road network and outlines the
Government’s commitment to improve the future efficiency and
reliability of Highways Agency roads. This is about establishing a more
transparent and robust system for monitoring the performance of the
Highways Agency leading to a more effective strategic road network for
all road users. The Highways Agency’s latest business plan sets
out the activities which will contribute towards the delivering of this

treatment of religious minorities, in particular the imprisonment of
individuals for their beliefs, is particularly shocking. According to
the latest report of UN Special Rapporteur, 110 Baha’is are
currently detained for exercising their faith, with around a further
400 at other stages in the judicial process. The report also notes that
least 13 Protestant Christians are currently in detention centres
across Iran, and that more than 300 Christians have been arrested since
June 2010. Furthermore, as of November 2012, 12 Gonabadi Dervishes are
reportedly in custody, as well as the leader of the Yarsan religious
minority.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="1304161000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0001.htm#1304161000076"><B><Member PimsId="781" UID="1304161000852" xid="555" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0001.htm#1304161000852">Mr

Lidington:</Member></B> The House's resolution of 7 March 2012,
<I>Official Report</I>, columns 928-51, is based on a principle that
the Government shares: to defend human rights and condemn those who
abuse them. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for North East Bedfordshire
(Alistair Burt), said during the debate on 7 March 2012 that we would
look at the situation after the passage of the US Act and see if
lessons could be learned. We have now done so. We do not believe there
is evidence to suggest that the new legislation has brought any closer,
or is likely to bring any closer, the outcome that we all
want—justice for Sergei Magnitsky and his family. Worryingly,
the Russian authorities have closed the investigation into Magnitsky's
death without any results, and are trying him posthumously for fraud
which is generally only considered permissible when carried out to
exonerate a wrongfully convicted person or provide justice for family
members of victims—neither of which is applicable in this
circumstance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304161000384" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0001.htm#1304161000384">We
have long been clear that where there is credible evidence the UK

both publically and in private, that the use of chemical weapons would
be a horrific crime. We have warned President Assad's regime that the
use of these weapons would lead to a serious response from the
international community. Those who order the use of chemical weapons,
and those who use them, will be held to account. We have also made this
point to the opposition. We continue to work closely with our
international partners, including the US, to monitor developments
related to Syria's chemical weapons and welcome the UN
Secretary-General's decision to initiate an investigation into the
alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria. To prevent the proliferation
of Syria's chemical weapons we have secured EU sanctions against goods
and equipment that could be used as part of a chemical weapon programme
and Syria-specific controls within the Australia Group to prevent the
transfer of chemical weapons-related
goods.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="1304161000779" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0002.htm#1304161000779"><B><Member PimsId="2448" UID="1304161000892" xid="95" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0002.htm#1304161000892">Mr

inflicting a heavy cost on the country's population, including its
minority groups. Like others in the region, Syrians demand that their
rights to liberty, dignity and to choose freely their leaders be

groups and we continue to encourage the Syrian National Coalition to
reassure all Syrians that they are working towards a Syria which is
democratic, inclusive, representative, respectful of its ethnic and
religious minorities and which adheres to international human rights

stocks is very difficult to assess as I made clear in my answer on 25
March 2013, <I>Official Report,</I> columns 912-13W, however, we remain
extremely concerned. The Syrian regime is legally obliged under UN
Security Council resolution 1540 to keep its chemical weapons secure
and we have continued to stress the need to fulfil this obligation. As
I noted on 25 March, some expertise, as well as access to appropriate
delivery systems, is needed to handle and exploit chemical weapons. I
cannot speculate on whether al-Qaeda-related groups have such
capability, but we continue to monitor the situation very
closely.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1304161000023" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0002.htm#1304161000023">Tourism:

areas of the agency to work on the temporary migration cases backlog.
This measure, in addition to the recruitment of additional staff,
resulted in an increased level of performance across all backlog areas.
Staff were not transferred from other frontline delivery roles but from
back office roles, allowing for a short-term staffing dip in these
areas without significant performance drops. The UK Border Agency
published figures on its performance against migration service
standards on a quarterly basis as part of its commitment to
transparency.

study found that 11.0% of males within the service population had
committed an offence of interpersonal violence, compared to 8.7% of the
UK male civilian population. It is also noted that from those surveyed
20.6% of males within the service population under the age of 30 years
committed violent offences compared to 6.7% of males under the age of
30 in the general population. The paper found that while deployment to
Iraq and Afghanistan was not in itself a significant factor linked to
violent offending, there was a correlation among personnel who had
served in a combat role or who had developed post-deployment mental
health problems such as alcohol misuse, anger and post-traumatic stress
disorder. Other significant factors included pre-existing risk factors
such as younger age and pre-military offences of a similar nature. The
study's authors have recommended further evidence-based research into
the potential utility of violence-reduction interventions among those
returning from deployment in order to help detect mental health issues
and thus reduce the risk of violent
offending.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304164000875" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0003.htm#1304164000875">Ministry

announced, as the outcome of the Red Tape Challenge spotlight on

decided to delay the provisions at sections 36(1)(d), (5) and (6) and

have powers to prosecute businesses that fail to pay their workers the
correct agricultural minimum wage (AMW). However, failure to pay the

further four companies were refused a licence on grounds which included
failure to comply with AMW legislation; however, the GLA does not
publish details of businesses whose licence applications are refused.
Although these businesses have been unable to demonstrate that they
meet the GLA Licensing Standards, they are not active in the regulated
sectors at the time they apply for a new licence. Therefore, the GLA
does not consider it to be in the public interest to make this
information available on their public
registers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304167000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0003.htm#1304167000092">Businesses

antibiotics in the UK are available only on prescription by a
veterinary surgeon, who in turn is only permitted to prescribe to
animals under their care. Supply of veterinary medicinal products
without a prescription is illegal in the UK and is in breach of the

and the routine use of antibiotics to prevent disease is not regarded
as a responsible use of these medicines. However, the Government
recognises that the availability of veterinary medicines, including

European Commission’s report and recommendations on labelling
the origin of all processed meat should be accelerated and published as

insurance industry recognise the Flood Risk Report as a standard
approach for presenting the flood risk of a property, provided a
professional, suitably qualified, independent surveyor has completed
it. It can record the change in the level of risk for a property
following the installation of measures. Insurers may take into account
the information and flood protection measures when assessing the terms
they will offer for

the insurer can be provided with evidence that supports the
effectiveness of the measures that have been taken, they want to do the
best job they can in assessing the risk that a property brings to them
as insurers and they will fully take that into account. The mechanism

2012, prior to the development of the National Flood Risk Report
template, DEFRA commissioned a small survey to find out whether
recently-installed property-level flood measures had helped to reduce
insurance premiums or excesses. In the majority of cases it did not
result in lower insurance premiums and excesses, nor increase customer
choice of insurance cover, which will be useful to review this

import and export of mechanically separated meat. Mechanically
separated meat which has been produced in accordance with EU Regulation
(EC) No. 853/2004 may be exported to other member states. It is the
responsibility of the exporting member state to conduct the checks on
animal and public health and food hygiene. As the UK exports
mechanically separated meat it conducts the necessary checks for
compliance. The UK does not routinely detain imports from within the

impacts of Phytophthora ramorum on the economy. The assessment
indicated that some reduction in timber revenue can be expected due to
the reduced value of infected timber. However, increased felling
activity would compensate for this in the short term. No significant
impacts on visitor spending were anticipated while other sites, which
remained free from infection, were open to visit. The principal
impacts, in the longer term, were assessed as being on carbon
sequestration and biodiversity, and the wider social and environmental
value of larch for visitor enjoyment and

of this SSSI both upstream and downstream of the site. The work

specific offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (trafficking for
sexual exploitation) and under the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004 (for
other exploitation) which carry maximum penalties of 14
years' imprisonment. Victims of trafficking may have been subjected to
other offences such as rape, false imprisonment and assault, which
carry maximum penalties up to a life sentence. Prosecutors will
consider the range of offences depending on the facts of the case and

The overall average costs comprise the direct local establishment costs
of public and private prisons, increased by an apportionment of
relevant costs borne centrally and in the regions by NOMS (as recorded
in the addendum to the National Offender Management Service Agency
2011-12 Annual Report and Accounts). This involves some estimation.
Expenditure which is met by other Government Departments or directly by
the Youth Justice Board, such as expenditure on health and education,
is not included. Expenditure recharged to the Youth Justice Board in
respect of young people is
included.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">2.
The costs represent the total cost per prisoner at each prison where
the majority use at the end of the year was as adult prison, YOI (aged
15 to 17) or YOI (aged 15 to 21). There is no adjustment for prisons
holding prisoners of more than one
category.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">3.
A split of the YOI (aged 15 to 21) category to show unit cost
information for under-18 juveniles only within those establishments is
not available. Furthermore, there are no private YOI establishments
that house prisoners in the aged 15 to 21
category.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">4.
The public sector and private sector costs are not directly comparable
because of differences in accounting treatment and scope of
services.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">5.
Average price per place figures are also calculated by the Youth
Justice Board (YJB). These are calculated differently to the figures
above, and are based on the YJB budget allocations at the beginning of
each financial year for services in young people's secure custodial
facilities. The YJB prices include additional funding for services
specific to the juvenile population which are not included in the NOMS'
calculation of YOI costs such as advocacy services (in all under-18
YOIs); Lucy Faithfull Foundation services in a number of YOIs for young
people who sexually abuse; social worker services; and Youth Offending
Team services in private sector
YOIs.</hs_TableFooter></entry></row></tfoot></tgroup></table></TableWrapper><hs_8Question UID="1304167000069" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0004.htm#1304167000069">Prisons</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="1304167000747" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0004.htm#1304167000747"><B><Member PimsId="4776" UID="1304167003633" xid="891" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0004.htm#1304167003633">Robert

review process was introduced in April 2008, so data collected in the

completed and the number of-deaths which were assessed as preventable
in these two years may have been influenced by the issues which panels
encountered as they introduced the process of reviewing child deaths.
There may also be deaths which occurred in the year ending 31 March
2009 or early in the year ending 31 March 2010 which panels have either
reviewed in less depth or felt unable to review as little data were
available, which are not included in the tables

school meals are not compulsory and there are many reasons why a family

The fear of being stigmatised can prevent many children from taking a
free school meal. We have however made progress in addressing this: for
example, many schools now have cashless systems and other methods to
ensure that it is not obvious which pupils are receiving a free school
meal. The Department for Education's eligibility checking system, used
by local authorities, has also made it much easier and quicker to check
anonymously which families are entitled to free school meals. National

frequently with both the NUT and the NASUWT to discuss their concerns
and will continue to do so. The Secretary of State for Education and
the Minister of State for Schools have met with the NUT 13 times and
with the NASUWT 22 times since the general

the NUT and NASUWT disputes are different and cover more than one
issue, we understand the main common area of current disagreement
centres around pay. Our pay reforms are based on recommendations made
by the independent School Teachers' Review Body. These recommendations
have been reached following a set process run by the Review Body which
involves consultation with all teacher unions, head teacher unions and
employer representative bodies. NUT and NASUWT contributed to that
process but the STRB has to consider the views of all statutory
consultees. The proposed 
<?notus-xml column=145?>changes to teachers' pay will give schools more freedom to decide how
much they pay a teacher and how quickly pay progresses. We believe the
best teachers should be rewarded, and our reforms will make it easier
for schools to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304168001615" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0007.htm#1304168001615">We

part in the success of the games and we recognise how vital it is for
suppliers to be able to share their experiences when bidding for and
working on future projects. In recognition of this, all suppliers are
able to make factual statements around their involvement in the games,
as set out in the marketing protocol which LOCOG published in 2007 and
which was extended in 2010. This protocol enables all 2012 suppliers to
make factual statements relating to their work on the games—by,
for example, including references to their work in client lists and
pitch and tender
documents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304168001737" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0007.htm#1304168001737">In
addition we have established, with the British Olympic Association
(BOA) and with the agreement of the International Olympic Committee
(IOC), the Supplier Recognition Scheme which the BOA manages. This is
another first for London 2012—no such schemes have been set up
following earlier games. The purpose of the new Recognition Scheme is
to allow 2012 suppliers much greater scope to promote their involvement
in the 2012 games, over and above the existing arrangements. Suppliers
must meet the eligibility criteria of the scheme and some categories of
business are excluded to protect the rights of worldwide Olympic
sponsors whose investment makes the games possible. Excluded suppliers
can continue to make factual statements about their involvement in the
games. Suppliers wishing to undertake this activity for the first time
should seek guidance from the BOA. The Recognition Scheme was launched
on 27 January 2013 and as at 9 April, 537 licences had been approved,
118 applications had been declined and 44 were being
processed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304168001738" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0007.htm#1304168001738">For

greater scope to actively promote their involvement with the games, for
example, at trade fairs in the UK and overseas, and by describing

Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum are made, on merit, under a
fair, open and transparent process which is regulated by the
Commissioner for public appointments. Applications are considered by a
selection panel, whose function is to assess candidates impartially
against the selection criteria and to submit a report to Ministers for
their decision. Candidate applications are treated in confidence. It
would not be appropriate to consult external organisations prior to
taking a decision under this regulated
process.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1304168000055" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0007.htm#1304168000055">World

Maude:</Member></B> The Efficiency and Reform Group was founded after
the general election to deal with the waste which the previous
Administration failed to address. In its first short year of operation
2010-11 the Group helped Departments save an impressive £375
billion. Unlike the savings claimed by the previous Administration,
these savings were validated by the NAO and the Public Accounts
Committee. In its second year, thanks to the hard work of hundreds of
civil servants, Departments increased their savings to £5.5
billion. This year's figures are not yet finalised but we are on track
to save £8 billion. Our goal is to support savings of
£20 billion in the final year of this Parliament relative to the
baseline of the spending in the last year of the previous
Administration, including by addressing fraud, error and uncollected
debt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304168002334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0008.htm#1304168002334">Despite

Attorney-General:</Member></B> The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is
committed to giving individuals directly affected by our service the
opportunity to tell us whether or not we have met the standards we have
set. The CPS Feedback and Complaints policy ensures that complaints are
dealt with sensitively, fairly, and thoroughly, and that all feedback
(positive and negative) is properly considered and acted upon.
Complaints from the police, court staff, the judiciary, or staff from
any other criminal justice agency, which are made in their professional
capacity, fall outside of this policy and are dealt with in accordance
with local liaison arrangements between the relevant agency and the
CPS. The CPS record the numbers of complaints and feedback which fall
within the remit of the policy; however the numbers of complaints
received by the CPS from CJS staff are not centrally recorded and could
not be determined without incurring a disproportionate
cost.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1304168000081" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0008.htm#1304168000081">Sentencing</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="1304168002534" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0008.htm#1304168002534"><B><Member PimsId="4767" UID="1304168002882" xid="887" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0008.htm#1304168002882">Philip

Attorney-General:</Member></B> All decisions by Crown Prosecutors to
charge a criminal offence are taken in accordance with the guidance set
out by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in the Code for Crown
Prosecutors (the Code). Prosecutors must be satisfied that there is a
realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is required in
the public interest. Charges should reflect the seriousness of the
offending; provide the court with adequate sentencing powers; and
enable the case to be presented clearly and simply.</hs_Para>
