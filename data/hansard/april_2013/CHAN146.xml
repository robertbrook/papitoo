of State lives in. If she would just do us all a favour and listen for
one minute, I will offer her an explanation. First, the premium that
the east coast main line pays to the Treasury is less than that paid by
the west coast main line. Secondly, if the hon. Lady looks at
reliability over the latest four-week period, she will see that the
east coast main line is the worst of the 19 operators. Thirdly, we have
found that the operator did a reasonable job in difficult circumstances
when it had to take over the direct operation, but that it has now
reached a plateau. Fourthly, yes, there will be taxpayers’ money
involved in investing in the east coast main line, but, more
importantly, the involvement of the private sector means that we can
increase, over and above the taxpayers’ money, the money that
can be invested in enhancing and improving the service for
passengers.</hs_Para>

issues. When I visited the Scottish Parliament during the February
recess, I saw in its parliamentary bureau what is to all intents and
purposes a House business committee. When one looks at how that works,
Back Bench Members in this House already have considerably more

provision of facilities for cyclists on the parliamentary estate was
reviewed in 2012, in consultation with the all-party group on cycling
and the parliamentary bicycle users’ group. As a result, 150
additional bicycle parking spaces were provided on the estate—a
60% increase—including 60 additional covered spaces. The House

the good staff who serve us in our daily work and who do such a good

have a responsibility in relation not only to the policy of the
Departments that they scrutinise but to the Departments’
expenditure. It is fair to say, however, that there is a variable focus
among Select Committees on the extent to which they scrutinise the
expenditure of their Departments, but I hope that we can increase the
extent of that scrutiny through the Estimates process. Also, as a
member of the Public Accounts Commission, I know from the matters that
we have discussed with the National Audit Office that the NAO has
already made itself available to some Select Committees to help them
with that process, and I hope that we can encourage more of that in
future.</hs_Para>

said in my answer of 28 February that discussions with a number of
major contractors such as Royal Mail suggest that they operate
apprenticeship schemes within their larger businesses, but I do not
have an accurate number on how many of them are in the House. Most of
the procurement exercises conducted by the House administration are
subject to a legal regime imposed by the European public procurement
directives, which limit the conditions that the House can impose. The
House administration is committed to providing apprenticeships, paid
internships and encouragement for young people from all backgrounds.

appealing the High Court decision, potentially delaying the Independent

forced out of the Government serves only to reinforce how badly

November, when the Government ignored it. I repeated it, and the
Government said that they could not lose their benefit. When they were
mauled on the point in the other place, they effectively admitted that
they could. In order to get the proposal through in the face of
opposition from several former Conservative Cabinet Ministers, the
Government had to come to the House last week and agree to amend the
guidance for Department for Work and Pensions Jobcentre Plus advisers
to state explicitly that a jobseeker cannot be mandated to apply for an
employee shareholder job. They should have done that in the first

issue is the advice and guidance to potential employees, and the need

people were going to be concerned—that was obvious. If, as is
the case at the moment, the law requires that people who sign away
their fundamental rights on leaving employment receive proper legal
advice and guidance, then of course people were going to insist on
getting similar advice on entering into employment. I doubt the thought

industrial relations on a previous occasion and explained that, from a

help employee relations if, in the middle of one’s employment,
an employer suddenly says, “You know what? I think I’m
going to give you some shares, but in return I want you to give up your
fundamental rights at work.” No explanation has been given as to
why, practically, that would work. I have said that taking away
people’s employment rights, such as unfair dismissal, will
simply encourage people, when they fall out with their employers, to
bring spurious discrimination claims. This measure will inevitably lead
to that, and there has been no explanation of how that will be
addressed.</hs_Para>

There is a parallel here with the privatisations and de-mutualisations
of the 1980s and early 1990s, when consumers and
partners—shareholders, if one likes—in mutual
organisations were persuaded to give up their rights for shares, which
were then sold. A classic example is Northern Rock, which had to be
funded by the taxpayer to prevent it from being destroyed, and just
recently came the disaster affecting the old Trustee Savings Bank,
which was a mutual bank serving the country and its customers very
well. It was forced to privatise and has now turned out to be an
expensive disaster, a basket case that even the Co-op bank cannot
afford to take on. This will cost the Government money. Again, a
Conservative Government are persuading people to give up rights for
shares that will last a few weeks, and then they will have lost their
rights for
good<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T11:37:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

it is an example of ministerial
retreat.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000338" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0001.htm#13042548000338">Secondly,
the Minister has said again today that this will be voluntary and that
protections will be in place. There are more than 2.5 million
unemployed, and it is rising. People are desperate for work and will do
anything they possibly can to find a job. The pressure to take the
shares or perhaps lose the job—that informal
pressure—will ensure that this is not voluntary. It is like
putting food on a plate in front of a hungry person and saying that it
is voluntary to eat it. We will monitor this and I would welcome a
six-monthly report from Ministers on how many people take up the
option. It will not be a long report, as this proposal is almost dead
in the water already; in fact one could probably come along with a list
of the few names of those who have taken it
up.</hs_Para>

repeat that I do not accept any assurances from the
Minister. None of the assurances that we have heard
about the activities of the DWP to protect people—particularly
regarding the sanctions and targets that the DWP and jobcentre

the <I>Hansard</I> record they are written on. We will monitor the

there is a lesson for the Government in these debates, and it is this;
neither this House nor the other place will tolerate again proposals in
which people are asked to sell, effectively, their basic human rights.
I give this assurance on behalf of, I am sure, all Opposition Members,
and if there are any further such proposals, we will resist them tooth

development in this country. We feel as strongly as others will feel as

fourth railway package is a major European Union legislative proposal
involving three directives and three regulations. As Members will
appreciate, we are still considering the implications of the proposals

this afternoon is our initial
position.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000756" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548000756">The
United Kingdom has one of the most liberalised rail networks in the EU,
which is why the Government support further opening of the domestic EU
public passenger transport markets. However, we want to ensure that the
proposals that are implemented as part of the package are flexible
enough to work within the UK’s public passenger transport
structure, and are compatible with our plans for rail reform. The
Transport Committee made that point in its
report.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000757" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548000757">Evidence
garnered by the European Commission indicates that about 40% of
passenger routes in the EU are accessible to new operators. That
implies that significant market opportunities could arise both for UK
rail firms and for those in the rest of the EU if the proposals pass
into European law. There would also be potential for expansion of the
rolling stock leasing sector. The new infrastructure manager separation
provisions could give freight operators benefits as well if they
further open up 
<?notus-xml column=1036?>access in practice, reducing the chances of discriminatory behaviour in
some member states. In any event, I can assure the House that the
proposals will be the subject of consultation with
stakeholders and considerable negotiation within the European Union. We
will continue to engage with the Commission, the European Parliament
and other member states to ensure that any concerns are addressed in
the final
texts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000758" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548000758"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T12:04:54"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Jeremy Corbyn" PimsId="2717" UID="13042548002048" xid="133" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548002048"><B>Jeremy

question. His second point is also absolutely right. As he
knows—and as Labour desperately tries to forget—since
privatisation the number of passengers using our rail network has
doubled, the number of journeys on our 
<?notus-xml column=1037?>rail network has doubled, the standards have improved
noticeably—but there is
still<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T12:08:37"></hs_TimeCode> some way
to go to get even better quality and standards for
passengers—and the investment in the infrastructure to improve
the quality of the journeys has
increased<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T12:08:35"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
incredible that, although the Labour party pays lip service to a good,
efficient rail system, in 13 years of the last Labour Government there
were just 10 extra miles of electrification on the network, yet in the

extra miles of
electrification.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000769" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548000769"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sheila Gilmore" PimsId="5534" UID="13042548002059" xid="1055" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548002059">Sheila

That is especially the case for cross-border operations where a train

the Commission needs to be clearer about how the changes to the
directive will contribute to market opening. Another Commission
proposal is to change the authorisation process for trackside
signalling, which would have a significant impact in the UK. There is
not yet much experience in the UK of the authorisation of trackside
signalling by the national safety authorities. However, UK projects are

address such problems. However, at the Transport Council on 11 March,
my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State proposed that there might
be an alternative to moving powers away from national safety
authorities to the agency. We have suggested giving the market a choice
about where the authorisation is obtained from, so we propose exploring
with member states and the Commission an approach that would enable
rail undertakings to choose whether to obtain an authorisation from the
relevant national safety authority or the agency. The same principle
could be extended to give the industry  a choice about where it
needs to apply for trackside signalling authorisations. The UK is
continuing to push

Roy McNulty concluded in his report—we accept this—that
the key to delivering long-term efficiencies in the rail industry is
the alignment of incentives between track and train. Alliances or
partnerships between Network Rail and the passenger train operators are
central to our approach. Alliances are expected to maximise
efficiencies and to ensure that minority freight and open-access
operators are protected, not discriminated against. They do so by
ensuring that capacity allocation and charging decisions are undertaken
outside the alliance to avoid discrimination against smaller train
operators, including freight operators. Safety is protected by ensuring
that ultimate accountability rests with the statutory duty holder. We
believe that that is compatible with the open competition in rail
markets that the Commission wants, but we are worried that the way in
which the Commission’s proposals are formulated might prohibit
certain types of alliances, such as between Network Rail and rail
undertakings, and joint working arrangements, such as integrated

identified by the European Commission in its impact assessment will
translate to the domestic rail sector in the UK. This is because
significant parts of the Commission proposal, including the competitive

tunnel has not yet fulfilled its potential in either passenger or
freight traffic, and the proposals in the package for greater
co-operation between infrastructure managers, combined with a single
certification authority, may improve services between Britain and the
continent. It is therefore right to pursue standardisation which could
reduce costs, and it is also important that where countries

infrastructure sell-off had the opposite effect and subsequent
investment in safety was taxpayer-funded. It also claims that
privatisation itself was responsible for increasing passenger numbers,

want to pick up on a few specific concerns. There is an issue about how
the rest of Europe will respond and I am concerned about how effective
the European Union will be in implementing the package in other
countries. The Transport Committee’s evidence sessions made it
clear that it will be very difficult to apply the package to all EU
member states, because of the different sizes and structures of their
respective railway systems. Past experience shows that the proposals
are so opaque in practice that national Governments can implement them
as they wish so as to protect their own national operators. I asked
Brian Simpson, the Labour MEP who chairs the European
Parliament’s Transport and Tourism Committee, whether there was
lobbying from France and Germany to protect their national interests.
He replied: “You bet there was.” I am, therefore,
concerned about how the proposals will be implemented in
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T12:55:42"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T12:55:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000869" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548000869">The
Committee has recommended—I think this would help—that
the maximum limit for the bundling together of rail network services
should be one fifth instead of one third. On the evolution of services
in Germany, while urban and regional services are diversifying,
allowing different operators to enter the market, the entire intercity
network, with only two exceptions, is operated by Deutsche Bahn.
Therefore, a contract covering one third of the national network would
allow Deutsche Bahn a near monopoly of the intercity services, which
goes against the principle of the directive. I hope that in his
discussions with colleagues in Europe, the Minister will pursue an
upper limit of one fifth of the market, rather than one
third<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T12:56:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000870" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548000870">The
Minister has already referred to one of my domestic concerns, namely
that the package should not prohibit the alliance between Network Rail
and some of the train operating companies, particularly South West
Trains. I believe that that is an effective way forward for the
railways and I hope that the Minister will be able to get some
clarification on it and protection for those British
interests<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T12:57:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000871" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548000871">I
am also concerned about international services. For obvious reasons,
the impact on British railways has not been significant thus far, but
High Speed 2 and its connection to High Speed 1 and the tunnel will
lead to many more international services from this country. I do not
want our interests to be inhibited by problems relating to track access
or safety, which is what happened when Eurostar tried to buy Siemens
trains for the tunnel. The existing regulations are not as effective as
they could be. I hope we can get much greater clarity and certainty on
both those areas, in order to allow the development of effective
cross-border services from this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T12:58:28"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Minister has said that he is looking at 
<?notus-xml column=1050?>whether the issue can be dealt with through a European-wide arrangement
or through greater collaboration between national agencies. I do not
have a particular preference, but the overall objective should be to
give operators greater certainty so that they can plan

Our railways are enjoying an unprecedented period of growth. It is
highly debatable whether that growth is due to privatisation or the
growth in our GDP over the same period. It is worth recognising that
there has also been major expansion in Germany and France, where major
national rail operators run the rail services. It is therefore not

numbers is due to
privatisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:00:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000875" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548000875">The
Select Committee raises a number of concerns about the package, one of
which relates to the proposal to separate infrastructure management and
service operation. That thread runs through the whole package. It is
ironic that against the background of our success, the Government are
trying to bring the operators and the infrastructure holders closer
together. That is being done in a number of ways, including through the
development of partnerships between the national rail network and the
transport operators and through what is prescribed in the new rail
franchises. It is important that the European package does not prevent
the working together that this country is trying to
develop<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:01:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000876" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548000876">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:01:20"></hs_TimeCode>
is also important that that division does not apply to light rail
services, where management of the services and ownership of the network
are combined, as in the case of the docklands light railway. Those
services are extremely successful and they must not be
jeopardised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:01:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000877" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548000877">Before
the package was published, it was thought that it would require the
complete separation of infrastructure ownership and service operation,
but that is not the case. The package says that there can still be a
holding company, as there is in some other European countries, that
owns both the network and the train operation. However, it says that
there must be strict Chinese walls to separate the
two.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000878" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548000878">A
major concern of the Committee is that the regulations on how much of

intention of the package is to create a single railway market and to
reduce the barriers that are hindering the development of a single EU

creation of a monopoly in legislative terms. The effect will be to
centralise power and reduce the extraordinary necessity for
competition, on which the Minister put so much emphasis. Of course, we
all want competition. We need the kind of competition that was created,
albeit some time ago, in the mid 19th century. My family founded the
London to Brighton railway and the Leeds to Thirsk railway, among
others. In fact, my ancestor, William Cash, was chairman of the
committee of inquiry into George Hudson, the crooked MP who created the
monopoly of the railway system. There was a special inquiry into his
behaviour and he was eventually driven out. I believe that Europe is
probably moving towards the kind of monopoly that had to be unravelled
in the United

am deeply concerned about competition in relation to contracts. We
remember the Bombardier fiasco, which affected British jobs. The French
and Germans are very good at getting into our systems, but we are not
allowed into theirs. We saw what happened with Siemens and Alstom. I
have some knowledge of how that worked in practice, being a former
Member for Stafford, but we do not have time to go into the details.
The reality is that these matters affect British jobs. I remember
discussing 
<?notus-xml column=1052?>all this with Arnold Weinstock, who was so much in favour of the great
venture of Europeanising GEC. I said, “Get the message: you will
find that it doesn’t work in the way that you are
hoping.” At the end of his life, he had a word with me and said,
“You were right after all.” He had found that the system

in the UK is a laboratory experiment that was designed in the EU. It
has been an expensive failure which continental Governments would be

“British model,” as he called it, of separating track
from trains. The fourth railway package brings that outcome closer.
Separating track from train operators has been a serious mistake, and
significantly in the UK we have been making moves in the opposite

Europe are largely closed—other than the UK, only Sweden has
opened its rail markets.

would like to raise a couple of concerns. First, the Commission is
proposing to remove the existing exemption that allows the direct award
of contracts that do not exceed 10 years. I believe that the 10-year
period could be reduced, but there must still be a shorter exemption
period to allow for the occasional need to extend rail public service
contracts or combine them in a different manner. Even with our
competitive tendering arrangements, the Government used that exemption
following the cancellation of the competition for the inter-city west
coast franchises. Furthermore, temporary arrangements 
<?notus-xml column=1054?>for the east coast main line service, which has operated in the public
sector since 2009, would no longer be allowed. We need an exemption
that allows for temporary operation backed by the public
sector.</hs_Para>

second concern is the proposal to centralise powers that currently rest
with national safety authorities with the European Railway Agency, as
that seems to conflict with the subsidiarity principle. The move from a
two-certificate system to the issuing of one safety certificate makes
sense, as do proposals to standardise administrative measures across
all European Union agencies. I do not, however, see the need to shift
responsibility for issuing those safety certificates from national
safety agencies to the European Railway Agency—NSAs will be far
better able to appreciate circumstances in their own countries than the
ERA. I hope that those issues can be satisfactorily resolved, and I
support the Government’s aims as laid down in the
motion.</hs_Para>

comments—I will keep them brief as we are running out of

appallingly failed financial and economic policy, they have blamed the

have a couple of brief points that relate, believe it or not, to the
east coast. I have used the east coast main line for the past 16 years
to come to London and return to my Leeds North East constituency, and
we have seen many changes during that period. Great North Eastern
Railway operated that line as a private company extremely well, and led
the field. Unfortunately, however, its parent company went into
liquidation and the franchise was taken over by the disastrous National
Express experiment. When that failed, it had to hand the franchise back
to the Government because it could not keep up with the payments it had
promised—that is why I made my earlier intervention. I hope the
Minister will ensure that if the line is franchised, the franchisee can
afford to pay the money it promised.</hs_Para>

Directly Operated Railways has been running the east coast, it has been
a superb service and I thank its staff and management for running that
service so efficiently, excellently and profitably. We have heard time
and again this afternoon that £640 million has been returned to
the Treasury over three years, and it is estimated there will be at
least another £160 million in the current financial year.
Contrary to what the Minister said, my understanding is that Virgin
Rail has returned just £200 million net to the Treasury in 15
years. How does it make sense to say that it will be more profitable
and better for the public sector and the Treasury to return the east
coast line to private hands for private profit to be paid out to
shareholders? Will that improve the service? I would say no. It seems
ideological and defies common sense.</hs_Para>

year I believe that the Government, through Network Rail, gave
£172 million to rail operators to compensate passengers for
delayed or cancelled trains. 
<?notus-xml column=1055?>East Coast trains paid £6.6 million of that, not because it was
the worst performer but because it was the most honest. The average
paid by the other companies was just £400,000. What have they
done with that money? Why has that money not been paid back, and why
have people not been encouraged to claim in the honest and decent way
practised by East Coast?

time, RMT is saying clearly that the proposals, if they go ahead, will
compromise safety. RMT is saying that the system is fragmented and

that safety should be dealt with at national level and local level,
where there is local knowledge. Yes, interfaces in Europe should be
dealt with internationally by agreements within Europe, but safety
should rest as a national competence. In that way, we can achieve

decisions on infrastructure should be retained at national level. Of

objection is about democracy. The measure will fetter the hands of a
future Labour Government, who will be unable to renationalise the
railway network or keep some element of it in public ownership. That is
what the measure is about, and why Government Members support it. They
want to ensure that no Labour Government can at any time in future
bring rail back into public
ownership.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000915" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548000915">A
number of us prefer public ownership and have made the arguments time
and again. Public ownership is more efficient, more effective and more
cost-effective. If hon. Members disagree with that, I suggest they read
a succession of Transport Committee reports from the past few years. I
appeal to Members on both sides of the House. Whatever they think about
rail nationalisation, they should not allow Europe to fetter the hands
of a British Government on such a major issue. This is about democracy,
and about ensuring that, when we go into the next election, we have the
right to implement what is in our party manifestos. If the measure
progresses, it will fetter the hands of future Governments, and
therefore undermine British democracy when it comes to deciding the
future of our transport
system.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13042548001405" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001405">1.27

Minister can never miss an opportunity to have a go at British
Rail—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> There is no need for
him to intervene yet. He should recall a couple of things. British Rail
ran the system from 1948 until privatisation in the 1990s. During that
time, there was a great deal of electrification, innovative engineering
and scientific research. At the same time, the system was grossly
underfunded. British Rail was always denied the funds it needed for
infrastructure investment—it was always short of what it
needed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000918" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548000918">We
privatised the railway system, and now spend more on subsidising train

agree with the Minister that, for example, Virgin Trains runs a very
good service on the west coast main line. I have travelled on Virgin
trains and all the services at various times. The service is very good.
I pay tribute to those who work on the trains and run the
system—they do it very well with great difficulty. However, the
Minister should not run away with the idea that Virgin Trains or any
other company has done well because of its investment in the system.
Who paid for the west coast electrification? We did. Who is paying for
the electrification of the western region? We
are.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548000920" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548000920">The
system is that we pump public money in for private companies to cream
off very large profits. I am a strong supporter of the principle of the
railway system and what it can achieve. Railways are the thing of the
future. They are efficient and more environmentally sustainable than
road traffic. The construction of railways 
<?notus-xml column=1058?>has much less environmental impact. I understand the complaints about
the route HS2 will take and the impact it will have in various places.
I urge those who are concerned, next time they go on the west coast
main line, to look at the section of the line that runs parallel to the
M1 just south of Rugby. They should look at the land space taken up by
the railways, and the number of people and freight travelling on that
section of track, and compare it to the environmental impact of the M1,
and of the widening of the M1 or any other motorway. The argument for
railways is

document is not a short, easy read, and these are just some of the
papers associated with this subject. What it is, is a proposal for the
privatisation of the whole railway system across Europe. We do not need
that. As many colleagues have said, integration can work within the
existing framework. Yes, we need common safety standards. Yes, we need
trains running directly from Spain bringing agricultural produce to
this country, just as we need trains running directly from Russia and
many other countries. That can all be achieved. Switzerland, which is
not a member of the EU, has no problems integrating its services with
Germany, France and Italy, and I do not think that any other country

draft order makes changes to the cash ratio deposits scheme, which is
how the Bank of England funds its monetary policy and financial
stability functions, which in turn benefit sterling deposit takers.
Under the Bank of England Act 1998, banks and building societies of a
certain size are required to place a proportion of their eligible
deposits in a non-interest-bearing account in the Bank of England,
which then invests these deposits in interest-bearing
assets—specifically gilts—and the return it makes funds
its monetary policy and financial stability functions, which benefit
the whole of the banking sector, as well as the wider public.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042548001325" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001325"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:46:30"></hs_TimeCode>The
Government continue to believe that the cash ratio deposit scheme is
the right way to fund the Bank’s important policy work. The
operation of the scheme means that the Bank’s income is subject
to two drivers: first, the gilt rate, and secondly the size of deposits
eligible for the scheme, which is largely driven by the performance of
the banking sector as a whole. Over  the last five-year period,
both these drivers have been lower than expected, which has caused a
shortfall in the Bank’s funding. The Government are seeking to
address this shortfall by recalibrating the parameters of
the cash ratio deposit scheme to current economic
conditions.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:47:14"></hs_TimeCode>More<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:47:27"></hs_TimeCode>
specifically, the order increases the proportion of deposits that
eligible financial institutions are required to deposit at the Bank
from 0.11% to 0.18% and increases the total amount of deposits that
they have to hold to be eligible for the scheme from
£500 million to £600 million. Alongside the
Bank’s efficiency savings, these changes aim to ensure that its
income covers the costs of its policy functions over the next five-year
period.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042548001326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001326">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:47:53"></hs_TimeCode>
Bank is also playing its own part. It is committed to bearing down on
costs. In particular, it will seek efficiency savings by establishing a
shared corporate services model with the Prudential Regulation
Authority. The Bank’s budget for the next five-year period takes
these savings into account. The Bank also has opportunities to make
further efficiency savings. These potential savings have not yet been
incorporated into the Bank’s budget, so are likely to reduce the
Bank’s running costs even further over the next five-year
period. The Treasury will review the Bank’s progress in
achieving these savings once the shared corporate services model with
the PRA has been established. As part of the review, the Treasury will
consider whether there are implications for the Bank’s funding
requirements, and in turn for the cash ratio scheme.</hs_Para>

that, and to ensure that the Bank’s important monetary policy
and financial stability work continue to be fully funded, the
Government have consulted on the changes to the parameters of the cash
ratio scheme. It is these changes that are before us today. They are
expected to increase the Bank’s income over the
next  
<?notus-xml column=1063?>five years to ensure that it is more closely aligned to the
Bank’s
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:49:03"></hs_TimeCode>. The
amount that most institutions are required to deposit at the Bank under
the scheme is small. In December 2012, 86% of deposits were made by
just 20 institutions, with eight each contributing more than £50
million. The large majority of contributions are clearly from larger
banks and building societies. Under the new parameters, some financial
institutions will need to hold higher deposits with the Bank, but again
it will be the larger banks and building societies that are most
affected. In fact, 14 smaller institutions—mostly building
societies—will be removed from the scheme
altogether.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548001328" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001328">The
Bank of England Act 1998 sets out that the cash ratio deposit rate can
only be changed once every six months. The deadline for changing the
rate for the next six months is 3 June 2013. If the agreement is not
implemented by this date, the shortfall in the Bank of England’s
funding will continue, which will be a further detriment to the
dividend that the Bank pays to the Exchequer. The change is a sensible
one that ensures that the Bank’s important monetary and
financial stability functions are fully funded. The Bank of England is
playing its part by making efficiencies in its operating costs, and
this change ensures that banks and building societies that benefit from
the Bank’s policy functions play their part. For that reason, I
commend the measure to the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13042548001408" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001408">1.51

Leslie</B> (Nottingham East) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I am glad to have
the opportunity to debate this issue on the Floor of the House. The
last review—I believe they take place roughly every five
years—was in 2008, as part of the changes introduced by the 1998
reforms. We feel that this is a reasonable way of funding the
Bank’s policy work, and requiring clearing banks to deposit a
proportion of their sterling deposits with the Bank of England to then
allow the reinvestment of those, yielding returns of—I am
told—roughly around £130 million to pay for
administrative and research overheads, seems sensible. As those
investment returns have underperformed, what was a Bank of England
surplus in 2008 became a deficit recently, and we understand the need
to revisit this. We understand the need for the Bank of England to
cover its costs; after all, it is not as if it can manufacture money
out of thin air. Oh no—actually it can manufacture money out of
thin air, but that is another story.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042548001330" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001330">There are two
principal issues on which I would like to focus, the first of which is
that the order begs the question about the Bank of England’s
running costs generally and whether its budget is necessary and
justified. The Minister helpfully talked about some of its plans in
terms of efficiency savings. It is regrettable that the Bank’s
forecasts for economic growth have gone somewhat awry, and they have
not necessarily improved in recent years. No doubt the Bank will
account for itself on quite why things have gone wrong. Before the
financial crisis, the Monetary Policy Committee on average
underestimated growth by 0.5%; since the crisis, the Committee has
started to overestimate growth by 2%. Obviously, this difficult
situation has led to criticisms from David Blanchflower and others,
most specifically about the calibre of the forecasting
arrangements.</hs_Para>  
<?notus-xml column=1064?><hs_Para UID="13042548001331" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001331">We have also
seen problems with the Bank’s development of new approaches to
encourage lending to small businesses by the mainstream banks. That has
required several iterations, which have not necessarily been
successful. There is also the difficulties that the Bank has had in
meeting its inflation target, with the Governor having to write to the
Chancellor on nine occasions since 2010 because of the missed targets.
We know that the Bank of England will have significantly higher costs
and that the new Governor of the Bank will have a much larger
remuneration package than is currently the case.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042548001332" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001332">The order
begs a second question about the impact on the economy if the banks are
required to deposit extra sums with the Bank of England, which is why I
have a couple of specific questions that I hope the Minister will
address. What is the total of sequestered deposits at present, and what
it would be under the new 0.18 ratio? Is it roughly £3 billion
at present, going up to about £4.5 billion? If an extra billion
is sequestered by the Bank of England, what will be the impact on bank
balance sheets? I think he said that building societies were likely to
be exempt from this measure, but I would be grateful if he clarified
that. He will understand that we are concerned about the impact that
this might have on the bank levy, which is calculated on bank balance
sheet liabilities. If there are changes to balance sheet arrangements
as a result of this measure, will that have an impact on Exchequer
revenue?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548001333" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001333">Lastly,
is there any anxiety about removing flexibility from mainstream banks
that might otherwise have chosen to support lending to businesses,
which these sequestered deposits might inhibit? We understand the need
for the change, and this has been a useful opportunity to take stock,
but we also seek assurances about any impact that these changes might
have on banks and building societies and the wider
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13042548001409" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001409">1.55

Javid:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his support for the
order. He asked some good questions, which I will attempt to
answer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548001335" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001335">First,
he referred to the use of the increased revenue by the Bank of England
and to increasing costs of the Bank. There are three main points.
First, the Bank is playing its part in making efficiencies by sharing
corporate services with the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is a
demonstration that the Government expect the Bank not just to ask for
more revenue to cover its costs but to try to find better ways to
generate value for
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548001336" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001336">Secondly,
in real terms—even after this change—the budget of the
Bank of England will be around the same as what it was in 2000-01, so
it has not seen a large increase in spending when compared with many
Government Departments. The Bank is taking on new responsibilities and
its functions have changed over the last decade or so. It is trying to
accomplish all of that with a budget, through the cash deposit ratio
scheme, similar in real terms to what it was in
2000-01.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548001337" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001337">Thirdly,
as the hon. Gentleman recognised, the Bank of England’s
responsibilities have changed, especially since the financial crisis.
The Bank has had to run numerous schemes and to do a lot more work in
terms of financial stability, including new schemes such as
the  
<?notus-xml column=1065?>funding for lending scheme and others. I hope that he
recognises—I think he does—that the Bank of England needs
to cover the costs of these additional
schemes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548001338" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001338">In
terms of the deposits that are affected, we estimate—this is an
estimate from December 2012; the estimates will be updated, and I hope
the hon. Gentleman appreciates that it is not easy to have the exact
number—that about 86% of all sterling deposits in the UK are
eligible. That is made up of about 20 institutions, eight of which
contribute more than £50 million; the largest banks, naturally,
make the biggest
contribution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042548001339" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/debtext/130425-0002.htm#13042548001339">The
hon. Gentleman talked about some institutions being exempt; it was not
quite that. As we have raised the bar—the eligibility
requirement in the order—from £500 million to £600
million, some smaller deposit-making institutions will now be excluded
from the scheme. Rather than being exempt, they are, technically,
excluded from the scheme if their deposits are less than
£600 million. My understanding is that almost all of
those 14 smaller institutions are smaller local building societies,
which I think is welcome, as it reduces a cost—albeit a
small one —for smaller institutions that
support local communities.</hs_Para>

Gentleman asked whether we had done any assessment of the economic
impact. The Treasury has not done so specifically, because even once
the change is taken into account, our view is that there would be a
negligible impact as the Bank will not receive a significant increase
in revenue from these operations. As he will know, many of the banks
concerned would in any case have deposits with the Bank of England
beyond the scheme, as part of their capital reserves, so there is no
reason to think that the change would make a big difference to their
reserve management programmes or would therefore necessarily have an
impact on their lending programmes.</hs_Para>

Ellman:</Member></B> Carbon emissions from road transport have fallen
in recent years. The use of biofuels and the development of hybrid
vehicles, which use electricity generated from braking as well as
conventional fuel, have helped to deliver that decrease. However, the
economic downturn has been a more significant factor in keeping road
traffic down. Carbon emissions may well rise again when the economy
begins to recover. There is much more work to be done to make road
transport more sustainable. As 65% of emissions come from exhaust
pipes, reducing carbon emissions from fuel is essential, and there are
a number of ways to do that: lighter cars use less fuel; engine
performance can be improved to use conventional fuel more sparingly;
biofuels are becoming increasingly common; and new technologies, such
as hydrogen fuel cells, are on the horizon. In addition to hybrid
vehicles, various types of electric vehicle can be plugged into the
electricity
network.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042552000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/halltext/130425h0001.htm#13042552000012">To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:43:15"></hs_TimeCode>

most eye-catching aspect of Government policy to promote plug-in
vehicles is the plug-in car grant, which offers up to 25% off a
vehicle’s price up to a maximum of £5,000, with a similar
grant available for van buyers. Applications for the grant are
increasing, but at September 2012 only 2,629 cars eligible for the
grant had been registered—a fraction of 1% of total car
registrations. The £30 million budget for plug-in vehicles for
2011-12 was significantly underspent. It would take a leap of faith to

vehicles, has held back demand. The Department told us that it was
gathering information about how people use plug-in vehicles and how
they perceive them, which it said would help to make the case for
plug-in vehicles “even more compelling”. It also pointed
to specific initiatives to promote the vehicles, such as helping to

plug-in vehicles sold so far have been bought for fleets. Fleet
purchasers are less likely than ordinary motorists to be put off by the
up-front cost of a plug-in car, which can still be in excess of
£20,000, even when the plug-in car grant is taken into account.
The Government have certainly taken some steps to promote such cars to
fleet purchasers, but a glance at the website of the 
<?notus-xml column=377?>Office for Low Emission Vehicles shows that most of its emphasis has
been on promoting the cars to the domestic purchaser. Only relatively
affluent motorists are likely to be able to afford a plug-in car. The
Committee spoke to researchers from Coventry university, who warned of
the risk that the grants could subsidise second cars for affluent
households, noting that people who had driven plug-in cars saw them as
a “support vehicle” rather than a main
car.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042552000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/halltext/130425h0001.htm#13042552000020">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:47:26"></hs_TimeCode>

Government have said that they hope that the grant will stimulate
domestic demand for plug-in vehicles. Indeed, the IPPR sees car
manufacturing as a potential major benefit to the economy. If
manufacturers can be tempted into the market, the price of the vehicles
should fall, further encouraging demand. There are concerns that
manufacturers are not convinced that the market for plug-in vehicles
will rapidly expand. I note that the recent report from the Royal
Automobile Club Foundation for Motoring Ltd also mentions that point.
Nissan had suggested it would build 50,000 of its plug-in

reported recently that production volumes will be much lower. Will the

Government are closely involved with the provision of infrastructure
for charging plug-in vehicles. The Committee looked in some detail at
the plugged-in places scheme, which has come to an end. The scheme
encouraged the installation of charge points in eight places in the UK.
Some plugged-in places were very successful; at the time of our report,
640 charge points had been installed in London and 399 in north-east
England. In Manchester however, also a plugged-in place, no charge
points had been installed. Can the Minister explain how the plugged-in
places scheme has been evaluated and what lessons have been learnt from
the less successful

Committee identified a number of issues with charge points: first,
there is no national network; and secondly, the vast majority of charge
points installed charge over a period of several hours. Charge points
that can recharge a car in minutes are much more expensive and, as a
result, less common. It would take considerable planning and a number
of days to drive a plug-in vehicle from London to Newcastle, and that
inevitably has an impact on the
purchaser<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:50:02"></hs_TimeCode>. Each
plugged-in place developed its own payment scheme for charging cars,
further complicating long-distance travel. There are also different
types of infrastructure around the country. The quick-charge points use
a Japanese protocol, which is incompatible with German cars. The

conclusion, the Committee broadly supports the Government’s aim
of kick-starting a market for plug-in vehicles, to help to achieve
carbon reduction targets and to support a fledgling domestic industry.
In some ways, however, the actions have not been strong enough,
although I am sure that the intent is strong. For example, we have
ample numbers of slow-charge points in some parts of the country but
none in others, and there are far too few quick-charge points to
provide for plug-in vehicles to travel long distances. The Government
could take further action in that area. We have also questioned whether
it is appropriate to focus the plug-in car grant on the domestic
market, when persuading the public sector to convert its vehicles from
conventional fuel to electric would be more

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:54:51"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

the need to tackle climate change. If we have green electricity,
ultra-low emission vehicles and electric cars in particular have a
significant role to play in achieving climate change.
Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T13:55:16"></hs_TimeCode>, the
economic potential is huge. Having the new apprentices, the young men
and women who will have to learn to build the cars, service them and
keep them on the road, and maintain the infrastructure and spread it

our constituents across the

producing our own green electricity helps us deal with energy security,
which is a big issue that this country faces. Lastly, and probably the
reason that our constituents would most support, is the genuine
potential for lowering the cost of motoring. We must recognise that
owning a car and putting diesel or petrol in it is becoming a rich
woman or man’s game. I am distinctly uneasy about that because
for many people a car is a means to earn a living, take their children
to school and get to hospitals and doctors, because public transport is

look back through our economic history, there are many instances when
things have been invented and created in this country and then the
commercial exploitation has gone overseas. There is a worry that that
might happen, with other European countries and certainly with the far
east. It is quite possible that a country such as China could decide to
invest significantly in ultra-low emission vehicles, seeing it as an
economic game changer. I want the components, the vehicles and the

bit, in the longer term they will sadly go only one way, which is up.
There will come a point at which it is economically rational to decide
to buy and run an electric car, because it will be cheaper to do so,
despite the up-front investment of buying it and the cost of keeping it
on the road. When that moment comes, there will be a large change,
because hundreds of thousands and possibly millions of people will say,
“Right, for my next car I want an electric vehicle. I want
cheaper, cleaner motoring.” Above all, I want us to be ready for
that moment, and not importing foreign components and cars when it

The Minister may remember that I pursued him about that. We were due to
have some, but we had a few teething problems getting them. Since our
last debate on this subject, I have unveiled electric charging points
in Leighton Buzzard and Dunstable in my constituency. To be
honest—we must always be as honest as possible in this
place—great use has not yet been made of them. I am not
surprised about that, because there are still very few electric
vehicles on the road. There is a Nissan garage in Dunstable, which will
sell more and more Leafs, and Vauxhall is extremely strong in my area,
with a factory in neighbouring

see that there will be increased usage, and I hope that such electric

conclusion, it is good to have the Minister here, but I just want to
hold his feet to the fire, in a sense, by saying that I really think
that the issue matters for our country, constituents and economy in

economic opportunities in the past, so I urge him, after his good
start, to keep on pushing the policy very hard. It has support right at
the top of Government, as we saw in the recent Budget. The
opportunities are huge: people have spoken of a $2 trillion market, and
the United Kingdom’s share of that market really matters for the
well-being and prosperity of this country. That is why I think that the

some concerns about how we can best deliver that in the context of
electric vehicles. There is certainly a role for an electric vehicle

first obstacle to the significant extension of electric car ownership
is the high cost, as has been mentioned. Even with the generous
discount available, the capital sum involved is still large. Currently,
a like-for-like comparison between an electric car and a petrol or
diesel one is a no-brainer, unless people happen to be wealthy enough
to afford the premium. The usual trend is that a new technological
product is initially extremely expensive and then, as the technology
improves and more people take it up, the price drops. When
plasma  
<?notus-xml column=382?>screen televisions were first introduced, the cost ran into thousands of
pounds, but the price has now come right down and they are available
for most people to
buy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T14:07:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042552000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/halltext/130425h0001.htm#13042552000046">I
am not as certain as my hon. Friend that we will easily reach a tipping
point at which the cost of electric vehicles will come down and make
them a rational purchase choice for many consumers. My concerns about
why we will not get there are largely technical, but are also from the
point of view of convenience. At the moment, the range of an electric
car is about 100 miles maximum, but that can be significantly reduced
by use of the air conditioning, the radio and all the other gadgets
that we increasingly take for granted in cars. Apart from in a very
domestic market, that is a big inhibitor: people will not have the
confidence to buy such a car for regular journeys to other parts of the
country for business or holidays. Even half an hour, for an 80%
recharge, is a significant addition of time to a business journey. That
is one reason why there will be a difficulty—I am not saying

other concern relates to the domestic consumer and their confidence in
running an electric car. Not everyone can plan their daily journeys
with great confidence. We might have our regular commute from home to
work and back again, and that is within the range of the car, but then
we have to pick up kids from sports activities or do an extra shop. We
can suddenly add  to our daily journey in all sorts of ways.
Until we get to the point where the recharging of an electric car is as
convenient as going into a petrol station to fill up, in terms of time
and availability, we will not get that step change in consumer
demand.</hs_Para>

see a better future for electric cars in the fleet and hire market. My
initial thoughts on that came from our Rail 2020 Select Committee
inquiry. On a European visit, we met with Dutch state railways, which
gave us a presentation on an integrated transport system with smart
ticketing technology that involved rail, bus and increasingly hire of
electric vehicles in city centres, and it is now heavily promoting
that. We have a real opportunity in this country for the development of
electric cars. They are not cars that people will personally own, but
they could be hired on a very short-term basis for 30
minutes or an hour or for a day or a couple of days. By shifting the
responsibility for recharging from the individual driver and user to
the fleet company or hire company, we would be able to remove much of
the uncertainty, which I fear will prohibit people from purchasing the
cars themselves. It would also help in the siting of charging points.
Local authorities could work with the hire companies and whoever owns
the fleet to strategically position points so that the cars are dealt
with in an efficient way. It would also address the fear that was
mentioned by the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T14:14:20"></hs_TimeCode>

you might recall that at about this time last year, you and I attended
a conference in Copenhagen with European transport and environment

their vehicles at particular times, which defeats the whole object of

having more of the recharging done by fleet or hire companies, we would
be able to stagger the recharging of cars in a more uniform way and

suggest that the grants are being used by affluent families to buy a

recommendations of the Committee’s report, which the Government

so only if the Government get firmly behind the project.</hs_Para>

this is a bit of a “chicken

problem, up to a point. People will not buy the plug-in cars if they
are not sure that the infrastructure is there, and there is a
reluctance to provide the infrastructure unless the demand is proven to
exist. However, the Government can break that impasse. As the
Committee’s report says, the Government should not sit back and
hope that increased demand simply manifests itself. The Department for
Transport should set milestones to make sure that its plug-in vehicle
policy is effective, and it should take the lead in providing data on
the location of charge points so that the public can actually see where
they can charge their vehicles and can plan their journeys
adequately.</hs_Para>

really pleasing that Nissan is building its electric car, the Leaf, in
Sunderland, but it is disappointing that it has downgraded its
estimates of production. We need to encourage Nissan and other
companies in every way we can. Is the automobile industry putting
sufficient investment into improving the efficiency of conventional
petrol and diesel vehicles? Can we encourage it further to invest in
British industry? I would like to hear the Minister’s views on

me be quite clear that the Government is fully behind the drive towards
low-carbon vehicles, both because it is environmentally
sensible—in terms of cutting our carbon emissions—and
because it represents a significant opportunity for British industry
and British jobs to get ahead. I assure all Members that we are focused
on that drive. There is close work between the Department for
Transport, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the
Treasury. The Chair of the Select Committee rightly referred to the
measures taken in the recent Budget, which are a good example of how
Departments work together for a common purpose, and send long-term
signals that this is where we want to go in terms of our transport
objectives. As always, I will say at this point that creating growth

we have made as a Government to the roll-out of electric and low-carbon

that, if demand for electricity is properly managed with the use of
smart meters and dynamic tariffs, the grid can support a relatively
high number of plug-in vehicles without the need to build extra power
stations. In fact, electric vehicles may also provide a way to capture
and store electricity produced at night from renewable sources such as
wind power, so they could actually help the electricity mix. Clearly,

more at risk if they cannot hear particular vehicles. I am advised
that, above 20 mph or so, the tyre noise is sufficient for them to
identify that a vehicle is moving, but there is an issue with low-speed
vehicles. The European 
<?notus-xml column=391?>Union is debating whether there should be a mandatory requirement for a
noise to be added. I am not sure whether my colleagues in the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs would appreciate an
Aston Martin noise being added to a small vehicle, but there is a
decision to be taken on whether adding a noise should be mandatory or
simply voluntary. Those discussions are ongoing. There are also ongoing
international discussions on whether that should be addressed
internationally. Clearly, an international solution would generally be

that, if these electric vehicles are rolled out, they could lower the
cost of motoring, as well as making motoring cleaner environmentally.
He also asked one question that he said I had to answer, which was on
when it will be economically rational to buy an electric vehicle. I am
afraid that I do not have a date in mind, and it would be rather
foolish of me to give him a date. What I can say is that it depends on
a whole range of factors, including the oil price, the take-up of fleet
buyers and everything else, but I am quite clear that I share his view.
At some point in the not too distant future it will become more
sensible economically, apart from anything else, to purchase an

leadership is a major factor in road safety. For many, the presence of
targets under previous Governments was a sign of that leadership;
targets help to focus attention on road safety and to prioritise
resources. The current Government, however, have decided to adopt a
different approach. When the Government published their strategic
framework for road safety in May 2011, they decided against the use of
road targets. Instead, they have replaced targets with an action plan
and an outcomes framework, consisting of a number of indicators to be
measured and a set of casualty forecasts. If the forecasts turn out to
be inaccurate, the Department has indicated that it will look at the
statistical data and consider its policy options. Perhaps the Minister
will elaborate on those
options<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T14:50:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042552000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/halltext/130425h0001.htm#13042552000118">Localism,

the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green), is a key theme of
the Government’s strategic approach to road safety:
decentralising power and funding will allow local authorities to be
more flexible and innovative in tackling it. Strong leadership and a
clearer vision, however, are required from the centre to communicate
the importance of road safety to local decision makers and other
agencies. We concluded in our inquiry that, under conditions of reduced
local authority resources and a loss of skilled road safety personnel,
the Government should not sit back and assume that road safety will
remain a priority. There remains a responsibility for central
Government to do all that they can to keep local authorities, the
police, other agencies and indeed the public fully focused on
delivering significant and sustained
improvements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T14:51:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042552000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/halltext/130425h0001.htm#13042552000119">Our
inquiry found considerable variation among local authorities in their
performance on road safety. There were certainly examples of good
practice, but there were also cases of local authorities not improving
their road safety performance in recent years. The Department indicated
that it had plans to name and shame the worst performing local
authorities; we asked for further information about how that might be
achieved and the possible impact, and we were told that the Department
had commissioned a local road safety comparison site to pull together a
number of metrics that would allow members of the public to be aware of
their local highway authority’s road safety performance. The
Government believe that making that information available will help the
public, lobby groups and council officers and members to identify where
there is room for
improvement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T14:52:22"></hs_TimeCode>. On
launching the website last month, the Minister explained in a written

have, however, received a number of expressions of concern about the
efficiency of the website. I am told that it does not allow comparison
of different authorities in any meaningful way. For example,
comparisons using annual data can be misleading due to large
fluctuations in some of the information, and a considerable amount of
work would need to be done by someone looking for comparative data. In
addition, there does not appear  to be an opportunity to
compare the performance of neighbouring local authorities alongside one
another on the screen. Can the Minister tell us how much it cost the
Department to get the website up and running and 
<?notus-xml column=395?>whether he is satisfied that it will work effectively as a comparison
tool? Furthermore, how does he intend to use it to improve road safety?

will mention a number of areas of particular concern in road safety,
the first being the safety of young drivers. It is not a new area of
concern, and the Transport Committee has looked at it a number of
times; the first report of the Select Committee that I was involved
with was completed in July 2007. Today, I welcome the report by
PACTS—the parliamentary advisory committee for transport
safety—which again draws attention to this important issue.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T14:54:14"></hs_TimeCode> figures are
startling: a fifth of people killed or seriously injured on our roads
in 2011 were involved in a collision in which at least one driver was
aged between 17 and 24; 148 young drivers died and 412 people were
killed in accidents involving young drivers, accounting for 22% of all
road deaths; 4,894 people were killed or seriously injured
in reported accidents involving young car drivers, including 1,552
young car drivers themselves, 936 passengers of young car drivers and
2,406 other casualties, such as occupants of other vehicles or
pedestrians; and 27% of 17 to 19-year-old males are involved in a road
collision within the first year of passing their test. Those are
shocking statistics, and behind every statistic lies a human tragedy.
Improving the safety of young drivers must be a priority and must be
addressed
urgently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T14:55:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042552000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/halltext/130425h0001.htm#13042552000122">I
was disappointed that the Government did not accept the
Committee’s recommendation to initiate an independent review of
driver training. Instead, the Department intends a Green Paper on
improving safety and reducing risks for young drivers. Is the
Department considering measures such as a minimum learning period and
is it learning from lessons on the motorways to reduce young driver
crashes? When will the Green Paper be published and what are the
expected time scales for consultation and implementation?
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T14:59:43"></hs_TimeCode>mplementing new
policies inevitably takes time, so it would also be helpful to get an
update from the Minister on specific action by the Department to
improve the safety of young drivers and their passengers. What
proposals does he have to encourage work with young people, perhaps
before they drive, to change their attitude, which is the all-important
issue? We do not want young new drivers, young male drivers in
particular, to start driving with an attitude of bravado and without
realising that a car can be a lethal weapon. The Government are
concerned, but we need some urgency. Furthermore, are the Government
looking to support voluntary organisations such as car clubs which can
assist in this important
area?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042552000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/halltext/130425h0001.htm#13042552000123">Cyclists
are particularly vulnerable on the road: in 2011, 3,085 cyclists were
killed or seriously injured. During our inquiry, <I>The Times</I>

the Committee. One criticism made by witnesses during our inquiry was
about the lack of leadership from the Government on cycle safety. The
Department told us that it had set up a cycling stakeholder forum,
which was working on a list of ideas and actions to propose to
Ministers. How often has that forum met over the past year and, as a
result, what actions are being taken forward by the Department?

improve road layouts in particular. The Government were reacting to
concerns expressed, which is commendable, but there is a great deal
more to do. Cycle safety could be improved in a number of different
ways, including training, fitting heavy goods vehicles with sensors and
providing infrastructure. Can the Department consider how to encourage
the greater adoption of HGV sensors that might make cyclists more
visible to lorry drivers? The Department told us that it was not in a
position to support mandatory fitment of proximity sensors in HGVs and
that the mandatory introduction of any new vehicle technology would
need to be agreed at European Union level, so will the Minister update

another vehicle, and 69% of the casualties resulted from accidents at
junctions. The Department continues to promote motorcycle road safety
through its Think! campaign. The Department said in its response to our
report that a review of the motorcycle safety advertising campaign was
under way to inform the development of the new campaign plan for 2014.

Chamber for only a few moments. I want to draw attention to the
tremendous work of Dr Ruth Brinton, who was deputy principal of
Hereford sixth form college, in trying to cut the number of deaths of
young people aged 17 and 18. They are more likely to be involved in a
road traffic accident if there are more them in the car than if they
are driving alone. To that end, she put together
“E-driver”, an interactive video with questions to remind
16-year-olds in particular of their responsibilities as passengers and
as new and young drivers. It is an extremely hard-hitting film that was
put together free by the police and fire brigade. It is available to
every school and I hope—this is my purpose in speaking
today—to encourage the Minister to encourage the Department for
Education to ensure that 17-year-olds have a chance to see it. It could
be adapted to make it more relevant to different counties, but it works
extremely well in any area. It reminds young people that texting and
doing the things they do when not in a car really is very dangerous,
particularly for young drivers. I hope the Minister will use his good
offices to ensure that “E-driver” is seen by all
17-year-olds so that we cut the number of deaths of young and
vulnerable
drivers.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13042552000202" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/halltext/130425h0001.htm#13042552000202"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T15:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>3.9

want to raise three broad points. The first is one I mentioned in the
previous debate on electric vehicles. The Government need to address
the fact that electric vehicles are very quiet, which poses a
particular danger to visually impaired people. I was reassured by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T15:09:56"></hs_TimeCode>
Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Lewes
(Norman Baker), that action is being taken at European level. However,
it is important for road safety that the number of casualties does not
increase with the number of quieter vehicles.</hs_Para>

also want to focus on the two groups where there is the biggest risk of
road safety issues increasing: cyclists and young motorists. There have
been a number of debates on cycling in the House. Several technological
innovations, such as sensors on lorries, mirrors and the like, will
help, but there are two essential components to making cycling safer.
One is greater separation of cycle paths and roads, and the other is
training. Milton Keynes is a leading example of separation; we have a
completely separate cycle network. I appreciate that that would be
difficult to retrofit into more traditional towns and cities, but that
is the way forward; it is the single biggest thing we could do.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T15:11:25"></hs_TimeCode>On training, the
Government need to explore new ways of building into training for
drivers and cyclists the need to be more considerate of other road
users. Many cyclists and motorists are perfectly considerate, but too
many—an aggressive minority—believe they own the road,
and that is true on both sides. When that mentality exists, accidents
happen. I would therefore welcome the Minister’s comments on how
we are improving
training<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T15:11:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042552000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/halltext/130425h0001.htm#13042552000145">Finally,
on young motorists, a number of initiatives to reduce the risks they
face are worthy of consideration, and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-25T15:12:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs Ellman) mentioned the use of
increased technology in cars. Real- time information, a black
box recorder or whatever we call want to call it will also be an
exciting way of reducing motor insurance premiums. If a young driver

behaviour.</hs_Para>

are other proposals—I will not go through them in
detail—about restricting the times young motorists can drive and
the number of passengers under a certain age they can have in their
car, as well as having a zero alcohol limit for newly qualified
drivers. The Government should have a way of evaluating all those
options and, indeed, the type of scheme

suggestion I would put on the table. The Institute of Advanced
Motorists is an excellent organisation, but I am not certain the
training it makes available for young motorists is that widely known.
Perhaps the Government could facilitate a publicity campaign and work
with insurance companies so that drivers who had further accreditation

views, I set out the Government’s belief that Tom

am today publishing the Government’s response to that
consultation exercise, which will be available on the Gov.uk website

detailed issues which were raised in response to the consultation. My
overriding concern has been to establish a pay review body which is
able to take as wide a view of police remuneration as possible, to act
in a strategic, forward-looking manner and  not be constrained
by the inefficiencies and time delays brought about by the current
system of collective bargaining. This is in keeping with the thrust of
Tom Winsor’s recommendations. The new review body
will make recommendations on police officer remuneration up
to and including the rank of chief superintendent. The Senior Salaries
Review Body will make recommendations on chief officer
pay.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13042544000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/wmstext/130425m0001.htm#13042544000119">The

part of a wider programme of police reform which includes the
introduction of police and crime commissioners, the creation of the

constabulary. Police officers deserve to have pay and workforce
arrangements that recognise the vital role they play in fighting crime
and keeping the public safe, and enable them to deliver effectively for
the public. The Police Remuneration Review Body will help deliver this
and to provide pay and conditions that are not only fair to police
officers, but are fair to the public as
well.</hs_Para><hs_8Statement UID="13042544000024" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/wmstext/130425m0001.htm#13042544000024">Passports</hs_8Statement><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13042544000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/wmstext/130425m0001.htm#13042544000120"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs Theresa May" PimsId="1758" UID="13042544000211" xid="420" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/wmstext/130425m0001.htm#13042544000211">The

Simmonds:</Member></B> As acknowledged in a report of 10 April to the
UN Security Council by the UN Secretary-General, the UN Hybrid
operation in Darfur (UNAMID) could be more effective in carrying out
its mandate to protect civilians. Last year's United Nations review of
uniformed personnel was timely and welcome, highlighting the changing
nature of the conflict in Darfur and outlining a series of
recommendations to ensure a more effective and efficient use of
uniformed resources to better meet the mission's mandate. A review of
civilian personnel is ongoing. We are encouraging the implementation of
recommendations from both reviews and will continue to support UNAMID,
including through helping troop contributing countries to prepare
better to carry out the mission's protection of civilian mandate.
Officials have discussed the effectiveness of the mission on a number
of occasions over the past few months with the newly appointed Joint
Special Representative Mohamed Ibn Chambas. The restrictions on
movement imposed by the Government of Sudan are also a significant
challenge to the mission's ability to fulfil its mandate, an issue we
raise regularly in Security Council consultations as well as with the
Government of Sudan. The primary responsibility for protecting
civilians remains with the Government of
Sudan.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13042618000043" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/text/130425w0001.htm#13042618000043">Sudan

for the rights of different religions, but the freedom of worship for
Christians has come under pressure since the secession of South Sudan.
We have received an increased number of reports in recent months of
intimidation and threats to Christians and to church premises both from
other groups and from parts of the Sudanese security services. We are
aware of reports that the Sudanese Government will no longer grant
licenses for building new churches. We are concerned by recent
instances of non-Sudanese Christians being asked to leave the country
without justification. We have also received reports of churches being
deliberately targeted in the conflicts in Southern Kordofan and Blue
Nile states, but have not been able to verify these
reports.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042618000297" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/text/130425w0001.htm#13042618000297">Embassy

later this year. That process will determine which communications
technologies will be used. The prospective providers are proposing
multiple technologies to provide connectivity to smart meters, and
these technologies are being specifically evaluated on their ability to
provide coverage across all areas of Great Britain, including rural
locations. Regardless of the technology, the providers will be asked to

that it has sufficient information to set out this policy direction, it

Information on any such discussions is not centrally recorded and would

Hammond:</Member></B> The Government has no plans to revisit the Ports
and Harbours Act 1847 with a view to amending it. The legislation
enshrines the principle of the free movement of trade and the rights of
importers/exporters to engage in legal trade activity without prejudice
or hindrance. In common with all other EU member states, the UK is also
bound by much more recently enacted EU directives which entrench this
principle across the entire European Union. This was confirmed by two
European Court of Justice cases as well as a number of High Court cases
in the
1990s.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13042620000020" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/text/130425w0002.htm#13042620000020">Travel</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13042620000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/text/130425w0002.htm#13042620000201"><B><Member PimsId="5618" UID="13042620000254" xid="1153" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/text/130425w0002.htm#13042620000254">Priti

Hoban:</Member></B> The purpose of the amendment to the Health and
Safety at Work Act enacted by this clause is to reduce employer's
liability insurance premiums but rather to provide a consistent
approach to civil litigation across all health and safety legislation
which will be simple for both employers and employees to understand.
Employer's liability insurance is often sold as part of a package of
insurances required by business and a wide range of factors influence
the level of premiums charged, including the amount of activity
undertaken by the business and the insurer's experience of the industry
sector. Therefore it is not possible to quantify what, if any, impact
this amendment will have on premium
levels.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13042621000012" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/text/130425w0002.htm#13042621000012">Future

Varied Length sanctions: A sanction of between one week and 26 weeks is
imposed for leaving employment voluntarily without just cause, refusing
employment without good cause, or losing employment through misconduct.
The actual period in each case is at the discretion of the Adjudication
Officer who makes the
decision.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>8</Sup>
Fixed Length sanctions: A sanction of between one week and 26 weeks is

programme or carry out a Jobseeker's Direction. Payment of benefit
continues in full pending the Adjudication Officer's decision on a
sanction
question.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>9</Sup>
Entitlement Decisions: These are questions on which entitlement to JSA
depends. For example, if there is doubt around whether the Jobseeker's
agreement (JSAg) is suitable, whether they are actively looking for
work or making themselves available for work. In most cases payment of
JSA will be suspended by benefit processing until the doubt is

a daily basis is deeply concerning and I am acutely aware of the impact
this could have on economic development in Jordan. Jordanian
authorities have estimated spending close to $210 million on refugees
in 2012 and host communities are also affected through overstretched
public services, higher rents and commodity price increases.
Jordan’s trade with neighbouring countries has also suffered,
for instance with a 25% to 30% decline in agricultural trade with
Syria. We welcome the Government of Jordan’s immense generosity
in hosting the refugees and continuing to maintain an open border
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042621000686" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130425/text/130425w0003.htm#13042621000686">To

recognises the risk that improperly removed asbestos poses to tenants
and others. There are regulatory standards applied to social landlords
that require they ensure homes are free of category 1 hazards (as
determined under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System) such as
could arise from damaged asbestos, which should help reduce this risk.
While we do not have any current plans to run an awareness campaign the
Department will keep the situation under review.</hs_Para>

Javid:</Member></B> At Budget 2013, the Government announced the Help
to Buy mortgage guarantee, which will be available from January 2014.
The scheme is a temporary intervention, designed to address the sharp
decline in the availability of high loan-to-value lending in the wake
of the financial crisis. The Government published a scheme outline
alongside the Budget and will be working with industry in the coming
months to determine the details of the scheme.</hs_Para>

Government have announced various measures aimed at improving the
supply of UK housing and supporting property transactions. These
include an extension and expansion of the Government's Help to Buy
scheme, the Right to Buy scheme and the Build to Rent Fund, and the
introduction of a Mortgage Equity Guarantee aimed at high loan-to-value
mortgages. The expansion of the existing schemes is likely to have a
relatively small additional impact on transactions and residential
investment. The details and timing of the guarantee scheme have yet to
be finalised and it is therefore too early to quantify the likely
impact. Overall, however, these measures, alongside the Funding for
