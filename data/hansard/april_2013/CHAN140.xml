short—has already been committed. The money is being used to

not to rush the roll-out of any service. That is why we kept in place
the NHS Direct service in areas where rolling out the 111 service has
been slower. A lot of good work is going on in early intervention; it
focuses on giving local authorities the budget and the powers to make a
difference to local communities. The Labour party should get behind
that and do much more to support it. It is this Government who are
making a difference in early years, and I hope that the Opposition can

for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron) is absolutely right: it is
essential that the NHS is held to account for the experiences of cancer
patients and patients with other conditions, too. Accountability has
undoubtedly been weakened, however, as a result of the NHS
reorganisation that came into effect this month. Last week, the
outgoing deputy chief executive of the NHS, David Flory, said that the
loss of experience in the NHS is greater than he has ever seen and that
hospitals have been left struggling as a result. How can a service

in three patients waited more than four hours in scenes not seen since
the bad old days of the mid-1990s. What clearer symbol of the growing
crisis in A and E is there than a tent as a makeshift ward in the car

that cannot continue. Nursing jobs have been lost, ambulances are

the Government hit our A and E target. Furthermore, he still
will not tell the House about the disaster that is happening in
Labour-controlled Wales, where the A and E target has not been hit
since 2009. He still refuses to condemn what is happening there. There
is a lot of pressure on A and E, because 1 million more people are
using A and E every year, compared with just two years ago. What are
the root causes? They are poor primary care alternatives that date
directly to the disastrous GP contract negotiated by his Government,
since when more than 4 million additional people have been using A and
E every year, social care and hospital sectors that are not joined
up—Labour had 13 years to sort that out but did
nothing—and problems in recruitment that have been made a great
deal worse by his disastrous decision to implement the working time

good point, and I pay tribute to him for raising this issue frequently.
We will not have properly integrated, joined-up health and care
services unless we crack the issue of data sharing. There need to be
protections for people so that they can prevent their data from being
shared if they do not want that, but by the same merit we have to make
sure that there is better availability. For example, delayed discharges
from hospitals, which are causing pressure on A and Es, would be
directly helped if we cracked this. That is why we have called for a

existing employees by creating a new unfair dismissal right and by

that guidance to decision makers in job centres would make it clear
that an individual should not be mandated if there were good reasons
for refusing an employee shareholder offer. However, the other place

specified the type of company that is most likely
to take up this new status, but obviously younger companies at the
beginning of their lives will be able to use this status at a time when
they might not be able to pay their staff more than competitor
companies, or those already established in the marketplace. They will
therefore have an extra edge to offer to those individuals whom they

Of course there will be circumstances where an employee shareholder

that it is not the Government’s intention that employee
shareholders are left with shares that they can sell back to the
company only at prices that are unfair or where the buy-back

safeguard employee shareholders in the unlikely event 
<?notus-xml column=177?>that employers behave unscrupulously. By including these protections we

this announcement of further explicit protection for jobseeker’s

gives young companies in particular a new option that they can use to
attract high-calibre individuals to help grow their business. It is
important that we give companies that choice, but it is also important
that we give people this opportunity to share in the growth potential
of the company they work for. The clause should be part of the

Deben and Lord King. The reason for this unusual state of affairs is
simple. Notwithstanding the admittedly notable concession that the

that is why there is strong cross-party opposition. Lord Forsyth put it

Twickenham (Vince Cable), who I note is not here today, is going along
with this. The Business Secretary engaged in some considerable media in
respect of the Beecroft proposals, and said how outrageous they would
be. I am, of course, aware that the Minister perhaps has a different
view. As Lord Forsyth said, at least Beecroft did not take away
entitlement to redundancy payments. This is worse than Beecroft because
it

are a number of reasons why we support the Lords amendment. They were
all mentioned in the other place and we wholeheartedly agree with them.
First, this is supposed to be a “growth” Bill. No
evidence whatever appears to have been adduced by the Government to
show how this measure would boost growth. The attitude of businesses,
at its most generous, is divided; at its worst, it is overwhelmingly
opposed to the measure. In the latest published survey of 700 companies
by Barclays Corporate, which was published this week, the proposal
appears to find favour with just 25% of respondents. In the
Government’s own consultation, only five businesses out of the
200 responses received showed any interest in taking up the
scheme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T13:03:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

connect employee ownership, for which there is widespread support in
all parts of the House, with giving up rights to not be unfairly
dismissed, redundancy pay, flexible working and time off for training?
No coherent answer has been provided by the Government during the
Bill’s passage through this House or the House of
Lords. In fact, as the Conservative Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft, said,
their proposal simply risks giving employee ownership a bad name. After
all, if businesses with employee shareholders are looking to carry out
a redundancy programme, who are they likely to let go
first<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T13:04:40"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041638000269" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0001.htm#13041638000269"><Member ContinuationText="Nick de Bois" PimsId="5682" UID="13041638004867" xid="1091" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0001.htm#13041638004867"><B>Nick

never enjoy full use by 100% of companies. We should focus on the small

the proposal could do immense damage to workplace relations and to the
standing of business more generally. I say that from a common sense
point of view and as an employment lawyer. What on earth are employees
to think if suddenly, out of nowhere, their employer says, “Will
you give up all your fundamental rights in this workplace if I give you
some shares?” What signal will that send to the employee?

and this applies more generally to the Government’s moves to
destroy the unfair dismissal regime, removing people’s rights to
claim unfair dismissal, or a redundancy payment for which compensation
is capped, will simply increase the likelihood of employers facing
spurious discrimination claims brought against them, for which
compensation is unlimited. That was a point made by Baroness Brinton in
the other

an employee is to be offered this special type of employment status, it
is important that they should be able to access proper advice on it,
particularly in this climate when jobs are few and far between. That
point was made by the noble and learned Lord Pannick, who proposed the
amendment. The Government have refused to accept that statutory rights
should be lost only if the agreement is in writing and the person
concerned has received proper independent legal advice on its

agreements.</hs_Para>

many are unquoted. How will the value of shares be

Exchequer £l billion by the end of the forecast

I wanted to give them in order to make them part of the company. I did
not have the advantage of what is being offered today, but neither did

in a business. It is not something that employers do. They give shares
up only in return for value, and they get that value from people or by
selling them. It is perfectly reasonable to assume that employers will
look for value from what they give up. As he will know with his
background, however, we also have to bear it in mind that by
transferring shares, employers also transfer rights—in contrast
to what he said about employment rights—under the Companies Act
2006, which was introduced by the last Government, which enhanced the
rights of minority shareholders, such as on matters of prejudice.
Employees can even form quasi-partnerships through small minority
shareholding. Employers do not lightly give up shares, and when they
do, they actually give rights to

and of recognising that in some cases, if they have come from

fault of their own, and I will take no lectures from anyone about how

four simple, brief points. The
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T13:29:36"></hs_TimeCode>first is about
share ownership. I tabled amendments when the Bill was debated in this
House to try to extend share ownership without connecting that with the
loss of rights. It is noticeable that the Government opposed those
amendments. As people look to reconstruct the economy and learn the
lessons from what has happened in this economic crisis, there is a
genuine willingness to look at greater involvement by the work force in
the management of companies. Part of that is about extending share
ownership to workers. That is a development that we have welcomed in
both Houses. The problem is that linking the two things in this way
will not act as an incentive for companies to recruit the best; in
fact, it will act as a deterrent. If someone faces the choice of going
to a company that offers them share ownership without the loss of
rights, they will go to that company. If they have the opportunity of
going to a company where they will have to sell some of their rights,
that will obviously act as a
deterrent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T13:21:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

McDonnell:</Member></B> That leads on to my second point—I do
not want to delay the House. This measure opens up the process of
recruitment, retention and promotion to potential victimisation and
abuse. Despite the formal protections that the Government assure us
will be put in place, the reality is that informal pressures will be
put 
<?notus-xml column=183?>on those who wish to be recruited, retained or promoted and these will
override the formal protections. Those who have represented people at
tribunals and elsewhere will know that it is extremely difficult to
prove victimisation and bullying in the work force. Those informal
pressures will eventually undermine the credibility of the scheme. My
fear is that they will also undermine the credibility of employee share
ownership schemes overall.</hs_Para>

I look forward to reading the draft regulations and guidance on
protections for jobseeker’s allowance. However, ministerial
statements on JSA protections in recent months, as recorded in
<I>Hansard</I>, have proved not to be worth the paper they are written
on. I refer to assurance after assurance we were given that there were
no targets for sanctions in individual jobcentres, when we now have
concrete evidence that that is the case. Ministerial assurances on the
operation of JSA have so far not proved to be effective. I believe
that, at the end of the day, they will prove not to be effective in
this case either, because the same informal pressures will be put on
jobcentre workers to meet targets for sanctions overall.</hs_Para>

this measure sets an extremely dangerous precedent. The idea of selling
rights could creep into other areas of policy making. For example, will
landlords in future be able to offer reduced rents for reductions in
security of tenure? Will consumer rights be sold for a reduction in the
price of particular goods? That is much more significant than the
scheme being proposed in this debate. The idea that rights can be sold

Lazarowicz:</Member></B> I, too, would like to say a few words about
this proposal of shares for rights. Of the various types of employment
legislation that have come before this House over the
years—these provisions are basically employment
legislation—there can scarcely have been any with as few
friends, on either side of industry. I welcome the fact that the House
of Lords did its revising job well and removed the offending clause. I
am only sorry that the coalition parties, Conservative and Lib Dem,
have chosen to bring it back today, instead of withdrawing quietly and
gracefully.</hs_Para>

that this provision has so few friends, I suspect that very few
employers will want to make use of it. That is because employers who
want to extend employee share ownership, of which I am a great
supporter—the year after I entered this House I introduced a
private Member’s Bill to promote it—will not want to do
so in ways that force their employees to give up important rights at
work. The type of employer who wants to work with their employees is
not likely to be one who at the same time wants to alienate them by
taking away their rights, which is what this measure would force such
employers to do if they made use of it. Of course, it is hard to see
any employees volunteering to adopt such an arrangement either.

take the point that was made earlier about businesses that want to
start up and take on more workers making use of the scheme, but the
problem is that, although a new business could behave with the best
will in the world in involving its workers in a collective enterprise,
it will be when things go wrong and people fall out that those workers
will need the protection that is enjoyed by the workers of this
country. That is why we should be loth to throw that protection

the Government cannot support Lords amendment 7, which seeks to use the

accept the basis on which he does so. Equally, however, there is no
doubt a great deal set out in the consultation. I very much hope that
the consultation contains some constructive proposals on how we might
make an article 4 system work more effectively in practice. I
understand his point, but the details are particularly indicative and
speculative in these cases because, in general, the Government have
rightly taken a policy of not seeking to intervene in local authority
applications for article 4 directions, which is a genuinely localist
stance. We have in fact made the position more localist by requiring
only notification of the article 4 direction, rather than approval by
the Secretary of State—a general move back towards localism,
which the previous Government never did. That is why I think that,
rather than thinking about the indicative costs, we should look at
finding a constructive means whereby local authorities have the
confidence to use article 4 directions, knowing that they will work and
will not create a disproportionate
burden<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T14:37:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041638000973" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0002.htm#13041638000973"><B><Member ContinuationText="Bob Blackman" PimsId="5580" UID="13041638005500" xid="1094" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0002.htm#13041638005500">Bob

been made. The Government’s impact assessment estimates costs of
between £5 million 
<?notus-xml column=204?>and £100 million, which shows the lack of clarity in their
thinking. The impact assessment made no estimate of the social and
environmental impacts. Reference has been made to the 90% of proposals
that currently gain planning permission, but of those some are changed
because of representations on the consultation arrangements that are
made as part of the planning consideration. We should be concerned not
only about the 10% that are turned down but would be accepted under
permitted development rights, but those that are never submitted for
planning permission because they are so awful that people know they
would be turned down if they were submitted.</hs_Para>

no national significance. The Planning Minister has accepted that it

amendment 7? The Secretary of State has argued for the use of article 4
instead. Article 4 is time consuming, cumbersome, subject to challenge
and potentially costly. It is really meant to be used as an exception
rather than as a general rule. The Secretary of State must clarify
whether article 4 will achieve the same effect for local authorities as
amendment 7, and, if not, what is the difference between them. If the

carbuncles; I think that we could end up with a lot of small warts on
properties. My constituency of High Peak is a hilly area. A small
extension to a property next door but one on a steep hill can have an
overbearing effect on the neighbours. To do this without planning
permission would be wrong for my constituency and wrong in general. The
Lords amendment would give this power to local councils. I do not know
what my local council would do with it, although I have a good idea; it
may go with it or it may not. The amendment is very sensible. It would
devolve the power to our local authorities—our locally elected

follow this approach. That is why I will support the Lords amendment

we had the high hedges legislation, whereby anything over 2 metres was
considered to be un-neighbourly, and now we are hearing proposals for
something that is 4 metres high by 8 metres. This will
potentially be extremely divisive in communities. I really feel that
the Secretary of State could have offered us a little more today,

Deputy Speaker. Given what the House has just decided, I seek your

other place to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board. They did that
after the Bill had completed its passage in this House, which means
that right hon. and hon. Members have not been able to utter a single
word about those proposals. Given the programme motion just decided and
the limited time for debate, it seems unlikely that the House will have
an opportunity to debate the board’s abolition, and we may not
be able to vote on the specific proposals relating to the AWB without
compromising other parts of the Bill with which we might
agree.</hs_Para>

House should remember that the commission will still have the
responsibility and duty to promote understanding of equality and
diversity; to encourage good practice in relation to equality and
diversity; to promote equality of opportunity; to promote awareness and
understanding of rights under the Equality Acts; to enforce the
Equality Acts; to work towards the elimination of unlawful
discrimination and harassment; to promote the understanding of the
importance of human rights; to encourage good practice in relation to
human rights; to promote awareness, understanding and protection of
human rights; and to encourage public authorities to comply with

that the problem is entirely contained within Hindu and Sikh

makes. It is a complex issue, as the previous Government also
recognised. There is not one voice from the communities about the right
way to tackle this issue, or whether legislation is the best solution
to the problems that have been identified. That is why, when the
Equality Act 2010 was passed, the previous Government took a power to
enable them to introduce caste as a characteristic protected against
discrimination through secondary legislation. But the communities are
very concerned about the possibility of increasing stigma by using
legislation to try to deal with this

Swinson:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. We
have spoken before about this issue, because it affects many of his
constituents. It does him great credit that he speaks out for them and
what they would like to see happen. In terms of the evidence of whether
legislation is required at this point, we are not yet convinced that it
is the right way forward. Some discrimination cases can already be
brought under employment law. Some cases of the operation of prejudice
would fall outside discrimination law, but might be able to be brought
under other forms of law, such as constructive dismissal legislation.
The NIESR report contained a range of cases, many of which do not
actually fall within the scope of discrimination law, such as prejudice
within society outside of the workplace or the sale of goods and
services. Therefore the number of cases that would be potentially
covered is quite small. A range of groups has expressed significant
concerns about legislation on this issue, including many Sikh and Hindu
groups, some of which represent low castes, such as Gujarati Arya
Kshatriya Mahasabha UK, the Sikh Council UK, the National Council of
Hindu Temples UK, the Rita Trust, the Hindu Forum of Britain, Vishwa
Hindu Parishad UK, the National Hindu Students Forum UK and Hindu
Swayamsevak Sangh UK. All those organisations have expressed their
concern about legislating, and we need to listen to their

Swinson:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention
and the work he has done on this issue over many years. I reiterate
some of the concerns that we have heard from those groups. For example,
GAKM UK, an organisation that represents a community officially
recognised as low caste in India, fears that by enacting this
provision, Parliament could undo all the work done by communities over
the past 20 years to try to remove the differentiation by caste in all
aspects of life. I am not saying that these are not important issues or
that ultimately it would not be helpful to enact the provision, I am
saying that we need to proceed with great caution, because the
communities affected have significant differences of view. That is why
we want to ensure that the EHRC makes a further assessment of the views
and evidence on this issue, on which it will report back later this
year. The Government have already said, through the work and the
statement of the Under-Secretary of State for Women and Equalities, my
hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Mrs Grant), and
through discussions in the other place, that if the assessment shows

I was saying, the reason for caution on the part of the Government
relates to a lack of evidence. The NIESR report is clear about the lack
of evidence. It states that there is no clear evidence on the extent of
caste discrimination and whether it is changing in the UK. Further
evidence would therefore certainly be helpful in assisting the
Government’s decision making. In addition to what the EHRC is
doing, the Government intend to conduct a full consultation and publish
a report on its outcome. If the evidence shows clearly that legislation
is the right way forward, then, as I have said, powers already exist in

necessarily in every case, which is why this discussion has arisen. She

Swinson:</Member></B> The right hon. Gentleman raises a good point, but
there is also a good answer. The Government are proposing an amendment
in lieu of Lords amendment 40, which, as he said, subjects letting and
management agents to the Estate Agents Act 1979. The amendment made to
the Bill at present would not properly achieve the effect of requiring
redress. It would impose undue regulatory burdens by making such
provision much broader. The requirements of the 1979 Act are rightly
onerous, because purchasing a house is something that people might do
only once or twice in their lifetimes and it involves a huge sum of
money. There is therefore a strong case for significant levels of
regulation, which is not made in quite the same way for letting agents,
where redress is the most important
element.</hs_Para>

have finished answering his intervention, he may have another bite of
the cherry. The Government’s other concern about Lords amendment
40 is that it does not work with the devolution settlement, because the
1979 Act is a piece of UK-wide legislation, whereas housing and letting
issues are devolved to the devolved Administrations. The amendment
would therefore cause a significant difficulty with them. I presume

righting the situation by making amendments to ensure that there is a

amendment 40, to which the Government have tabled their own amendment,
relates to estate agents. It represents a welcome U-turn by the
Government, who have backed Labour’s proposals to give greater
protection to tenants and landlords by forcing letting agents to join a
scheme to deal with complaints. It is a victory for tenants and
landlords who rely on agents to rent, or care for, their property in a
market described as the wild west by the industry itself.</hs_Para>

country, many of which are held by people who are old, frail and on
fixed incomes. My hon. Friend the Minister may be right to say that the
majority of managing agents behave well. In the past, however, many of
them, and especially those who were associated with the freeholder,

38. As my hon. Friend the shadow Minister said, this proposal goes much
further than the one made by Professor Löfstedt in his review of
health and safety law. Professor Löfstedt referred to ending
civil liability, but only in relation to strict liability, whereas
these proposals will impact on the vast majority of employer liability
cases, where breaches of statutory duty allegations are usually more
important than negligence. In every case, the injured worker will have
to prove that the employer knew, or ought to have known, that a machine
was unsafe, equipment was faulty, or there had been previous
accidents—something known to the employer but unlikely to be
known by the
employee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T16:28:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041638002266" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0003.htm#13041638002266">It
is worth noting that over 90% of health and safety regulation
enforcement is through the civil courts. There are some 78,000 claims
for compensation following accidents at work every year, but only 1,000
criminal prosecutions under health and safety, so if this proposal
proceeds we will be singularly relying on the Health and Safety
Executive to do a better job than it is doing now—and what is
the likelihood of that, given the resources that are attributed to that
organisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T16:28:59"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

Osborne:</Member></B> I am in favour of the Lords amendments on the
general duty in the Equality Act 2006. I am extremely disappointed with
the view the Government have taken. They are seeking to repeal the
general duty because they believe it serves no useful purpose and is
superfluous to requirements, but that flies in the face of the views of
equality and human rights experts; the EHRC, albeit latterly; service
users and other stakeholders; and the Government’s analysis of
the public consultation, which shows that the majority of respondents
were opposed to repeal by a ratio of 6:1, and that they were concerned
about losing the guiding principles and values set out in the general
duty. If the Government believe that section 3 is so insignificant, why
are they using valuable parliamentary time on it? That is particularly
puzzling because the measure had all-party support during the passage
of the
Act.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041638002304" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0003.htm#13041638002304">Section
3 mandates the EHRC to act with a view to encouraging and supporting
the development of the various aspects of equality and human rights.
The Government believe that it raises unrealistic expectations of what
the EHRC can do. That view lacks not only ambition but principles. The
values we enshrine in legislation send a message about the society to

Bob Hepple has said that the Government are wrong to say that section 3

a helpful guide to the Act in the absence of a purpose clause, which
the previous Government declined to insert in the Equality 
<?notus-xml column=241?>Act 2010. I sat on that Bill Committee, and remember the Lib Dems
arguing for a purpose clause. However, the purpose clause was less
important than it might have been because of the general duty set out
in the 2006 Act. Sir Bob believes that the repeal of section 3 will
leave equality law rudderless. I look forward to the Minister informing

and human rights are inextricably linked. The point of the Equality

integrated and effective
manner.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041638002308" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0003.htm#13041638002308">The
Joint Committee on Human Rights, in its sixteenth report, unanimously
welcomed section 3, saying that it would serve in practice as a
unifying factor in performance of the commission’s duties under
sections 8 to 11, which the Minister outlined. I have already raised in
previous debates the danger of jeopardising the EHCR’s UN A
status accreditation, following the cuts of 76% of its budget and 62%
of its staff since its inception. This repeal would be another nail in
the coffin, and we know that the public sector equality duty is also
under review. What does that say about the coalition’s
commitment to equality? It is constantly chipping away at the most
progressive and advanced legislation and policy, while undermining the
ECHR in its infancy, when it was far too early to judge its
effectiveness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041638002309" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0003.htm#13041638002309">In

Erdington (Jack Dromey) would still be fighting his corner and trying

enough to understand that where there are issues of inequality and
injustice we need to address them. There have been cases of people
working below someone of a different caste, and believing that that
they should not take them seriously. In the health service, there have
been care providers who were looking after people of a lower caste but
felt that they should not be doing that. We need to provide protection

Hindu communities, Sikh communities, Muslim communities, Christian

the view that if there is discrimination on any basis, it is wrong.
While education may help people to get away from their discriminatory
practices, it does not offer protection for the victims of that

something.</hs_Para>

discrimination is not new. In south Asia, it is a massive issue,
despite it being illegal within the terms of the Indian constitution
written by Dr Ambedkar, and despite the many statements on the issue by
Mahatma Gandhi. In this country, we have passed race relations
legislation over many years. The arguments being used today—that
there is not enough evidence, more needs to be gathered and there has
to be consultation—are exactly the same arguments used against
the first race relations law in this country: that we cannot legislate
away prejudice and discrimination. No, we cannot. However, we can offer

history of the immediate issue is that an amendment to the Equality
Bill, which came before the House in 2010, was agreed. Two amendments
were tabled. One amendment, tabled by Rob Marris, the former MP for
Wolverhampton South West, was in the form of the Lords amendment, but,
unfortunately, was not accepted. Instead, the Government accepted an
amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington
(John McDonnell), which stated that research should be undertaken. That
research has been done. The requirement—it was not an option,
but a requirement—placed on the Secretary of State was to
introduce legislation if the research report showed that there was
discrimination. The research shows clearly that there is discrimination
on the basis of caste. I am therefore very disappointed with the
Minister’s response and hope that she will think again. We can
vote in favour of the Lords amendment today. That would change the law
and be the end of the immediate debate. Caste discrimination would be
illegal in the UK if we were to do that today. I very much hope we

are many organisations and people who say that we want more discussion
and debate. We should, however, simply say that we think discrimination
on any basis in our society is wrong. I am the chair of the trustees of
the Dalit Solidarity Network and I have met many people who are victims
of caste discrimination. On the square today were many people who had
been through the most appalling situations—because they married
into the upper-lower caste, got a job where their manager was a
different caste or went for a promotion and did not get it. All kinds
of things come out when these debates take place. I urge the House, if
we think that discrimination is wrong, to legislate to say that it is
wrong, and, if we want to outlaw it, to do it
today.</hs_Para>

abolition of the EHRC: cuts in its budget and staffing; the reduction

said, I moved an amendment to the Equality Act 2010. To be frank, it
was not what we wanted. I supported the Rob Marris proposal to outlaw
caste discrimination, but the two Front-Bench teams were anxious about
outlawing it, so we worked cross-party. Liberal Democrat, Conservative
and Labour Members sought a compromise agreement and we got it through
the House. It was simple: if the 
<?notus-xml column=244?>Government were not convinced then that there was caste discrimination,
they would undertake research, and the commitment was given—a
cross-party promise—that if there was any evidence of
discrimination, legislation would be
forthcoming.</hs_Para>

has now been brought forward. It is not numerous, but, as hon. Members
have said, if one person is discriminated against, we should ensure
that it does not happen. So there might not be the quantum, but there
is the qualitative evidence demonstrating that discrimination is taking
place. I say to the hon. Member for Reading West (Alok Sharma) that
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:01:48"></hs_TimeCode> have had cases
in my constituency of appalling levels of discrimination, but people
are terrified of coming forward, because, without protection in place,

is about the fulfilment of a commitment, given on a cross-party basis,
to legislate, if the evidence is there, to outlaw the discrimination. I
am asking for that commitment to be upheld. My understanding of the
position of the Labour Front-Bench team is straightforward. They
support the outlawing of caste discrimination, which is why they
support the Lords amendment. Detailed regulations would need to be
introduced, as is always the case with anti-discrimination legislation,
so I accept that further discussions would be needed, but let us
establish the principle today.</hs_Para>

after centuries, we are still talking about the fact that there is a

people who have lived or come from there, it is in them, which is why,
when India gained independence from Britain, it had to pass a
law—it is in the constitution—saying that nobody can
discriminate against another individual in employment, service delivery
or, above all, social life. Why did India have to do that if educating
people or persuading them to change their habits and practices was such

would like to make one other point. We are not talking about something
that is anti-Hindu, anti-Sikh or anti-Jainist or against any other
high-class, high-caste community. This is not against them; it is
introducing equality, so that where any individual or group feels that
they are being discriminated against, they will have the legal remedy
that we are introducing today.</hs_Para>

have heard suggestions about placing the value of education over the

discrimination. Of course education 
<?notus-xml column=246?>is key to changing attitudes and behaviour, but it is also necessary to
reduce discrimination in the long term. Legislation is necessary to
ensure that any victim of discrimination is protected, and to provide
legal redress against discrimination. Adding “caste”
alongside “race” in section 9 of the Equality Act 2010
will reaffirm our commitment to fight prejudice of any kind and to
protect any individual who feels discriminated against. I can only hope
that, as a testimony to the strong unity that I have witnessed in the
Hindu and Sikh communities, the amendment will never have to be used in

U-turn on lettings. He failed, however, to point out his own
party’s U-turn on that issue. The proposals in the Government
amendment for a redress scheme bear a striking similarity to an
amendment that was tabled under the previous Government by

the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk) and supported by the
Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. It would have introduced a
redress scheme, but the Labour Government voted against it. That is why
we are bringing forward the amendment today. It is a much more sensible
provision than the one that was tabled in the other place, and it will
give redress to consumers who are unfortunate enough to be the victims
of letting and management agents who are not acting as they
should.</hs_Para>

George</B> (St Ives) (LD):</Member> On a point of order, Mr Deputy
Speaker. I seek your guidance. An earlier point of order was made on
the vote we hoped to have on the abolition of the Agricultural Wages
Board—Lords amendment 41 and subsequent measures. A large number
of hon. Members wish to ensure that this House, even though it has
debated the matter under the Public Bodies Act 2011, expresses its
view, rather than the decision being made in another place. The
House—the democratic House—should have an opportunity in
the Chamber to debate and make a decision on the abolition
of the AWB. What opportunities do Members of the House have to express
a view on that measure, rather than expressing a view on it when it is
conglomerated with other
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T18:08:46"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041655000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0003.htm#13041655000010"><Member ContinuationText="Huw Irranca-Davies" PimsId="1124" UID="13041655000747" xid="662" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0003.htm#13041655000747"><B>Huw
Irranca-Davies</B> (Ogmore) (Lab):</Member> Further to that point of
order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do not intend to delay the House, but I
sympathise with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T18:08:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for St Ives (Andrew George), who feels strongly about the matter. I
have sought advice from the Clerks, but I am not clear. I might be
mistaken, but I understand that, should the Secretary of State or his
representative on the Treasury Bench choose to raise the matter even in
objection to Lords amendments, they would give the House an opportunity
to express its view on the matter once and for all. It is annoying that
we have no opportunity to debate the abolition of the AWB, but to have
no opportunity even to vote on it is a double indignity. Can you advise
the House on that, Mr Deputy
Speaker?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041655000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0003.htm#13041655000011"><Member ContinuationText="Jacob Rees-Mogg" PimsId="5628" UID="13041655000748" xid="1186" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0003.htm#13041655000748"><B>Jacob
Rees-Mogg</B> (North East Somerset) (Con):</Member> Further to that
point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. This group of amendments also
includes the first statutory regulation of the press since the late
17th century. For the House of Commons to be unable to vote
specifically on such a major constitutional issue seems to me to deny
our constituents their right to maintain freedom of speech in the
country at large, and I hope that you will find some
procedure—and the Clerks, in their wisdom, will find some
precedent from the early days of Parliament—so that we may vote
on this motion.</hs_Para>

Deputy Speaker (Mr Nigel Evans):</Member></B> I thank the hon. Members
for the point of order, but if you do not know of a precedent, Mr
Rees-Mogg, it is probably not worth knowing. I am a servant of the
House and I am directed by Standing Order No. 83F(6) to put a single
question on all remaining Lords amendments once those to which a
Minister has indicated an intention to disagree have been disposed of.
Hon. Members may of course vote against that question, which will be to
agree to several Lords amendments, including those to which they have
drawn attention this evening.</hs_Para>

Grant:</Member></B> I am delighted that the Defamation Bill has
returned to this House for us to consider the amendments made in the
other place. Lords amendments 1, 15 and 16 constitute a
partial enactment in statute of several recommendations made by Lord
Justice Leveson in his report on the culture, practices and ethics of
the press. In particular, they create a press recognition body and
require the creation of an arbitration service within recognised
self-regulators for defamation and related civil claims. However, the
requirements set out in these amendments for the press recognition body
do not specify fully or clearly Lord Justice Leveson’s
requirements for the
self-regulator<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T18:15:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

the amendments were tabled at a time when cross-party talks were well
under way to identify an agreed response to Leveson’s
recommendations, including careful efforts to develop a set of workable
criteria for the self-regulatory body. The amendments before us
pre-empted the outcome of those talks. As the House will be aware, on
18 March cross-party talks were resolved successfully and a draft royal
charter was agreed as a vehicle by which the recognition body should be
set up. Detailed criteria by which self-regulators would be assessed
were also agreed, and provisions to enact Lord Justice Leveson’s
recommendations on incentives in costs and exemplary damages have
subsequently 
<?notus-xml column=267?>been included in the Crime and Courts Bill. Further, a “no
change” clause has been included in the Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Bill as a safeguard against political intervention
with the royal charter.</hs_Para>

with amendment 16, which introduces a requirement for an independent
regulatory body to provide an arbitration service. I should like to
reassure my hon. Friend and this House that the recognition criteria
contained within the agreed draft royal charter include just that. To
retain amendment 16 in the Bill, alongside the provisions within the
royal charter, risks creating duplication and uncertainty around these
requirements. The package of measures identified to enact Lord Justice
Leveson’s recommendations have cross-party support. As Lord

separate but related issues are whether there should be any
restrictions on the rights of bodies corporate and other non-natural
persons to bring an action in defamation and whether any non-natural
person, which is performing a public function, should be prevented
altogether from bringing a claim in relation to a statement concerning
that function. In relation to the first issue, the amendment would mean
that in order to bring a claim, a non-natural person would first have
to obtain permission of the court. The court would be required to
strike out any such application, unless the claimant could show that
the publication of the statement complained of had caused, or was
likely to cause, substantial financial
loss<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T18:19:42"></hs_TimeCode>. We believe
that a permission stage for this purpose would create unnecessary

the claimant was required to show substantial financial loss in order

have asked the civil procedure rules committee to consider rule changes
to support a new early resolution procedure under which either party
could apply at the outset of 
<?notus-xml column=268?>proceedings for the court to decide certain key issues, including
whether the serious harm test is satisfied. The addition of a
permission stage would therefore add little or nothing, because any
case where the existence of serious harm was disputed could have that

and equality of arms that he is obviously concerned about. It is one of
many measures and although I fully accept that the chilling effect is
an issue, we also have to recognise that companies must have the right

request for an early resolution procedure, but the serious harm test

now turn to the second element of the Lords amendment. In the case of
Derbyshire county council <I>v</I>. Times Newspapers, the House of
Lords held that local authorities and government bodies were already
prevented from bringing actions for defamation. The amendments seek to
extend that principle and prevent claims by any non-natural person
performing a public function.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T18:29:05"></hs_TimeCode> do not
consider that appropriate, as it would remove completely the right of a
wide range of businesses and other organisations to protect their
reputation. Although the provision focuses on criticisms in connection
with the exercise of public functions, that criticism could of course

proportionate approach. We consider it much better to allow the courts
to develop the Derbyshire principle, as they consider appropriate and
necessary in the light of individual cases. The removal of the
amendment will not affect the Derbyshire principle, which will continue
under the common law as it does now. I hope that the House will

amendments that I ask the House to support. Amendments 3 to 7 relate to
the defence of publication on a matter of public interest. Hon. Members
will recall that, before the Bill left this House for the other place,
my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary and I gave a commitment that
the Government would look again at clause 4. As a result of 
<?notus-xml column=271?>those considerations, we tabled amendments in the other place to recast
the defence in a number of respects. Amendment 3 would replace the
requirement for the defendant to show that he had acted responsibly in
publishing the statement complained of with a requirement to show that
he reasonably believed that publishing the statement complained of was
in the public interest. Considering whether the defendant has
demonstrated his reasonable belief will involve a subjective
element—namely, what the defendant believed at the
time—and the objective element involving the question of whether
that belief was reasonable for the defendant to

whether the defendant had reasonably decided that publication was in
the public interest. That point was debated in the other place, and I
believe that the concern underlying his amendment might be that the
current wording, “reasonably believed”, could make the
test too subjective and result in arguments about the
defendant’s motive. I can give him a clear reassurance that we
do not consider these amendments to be justified. The

This responds to concerns raised in the other place that situations
could arise in which a website operator had acted
maliciously—for example, by inciting the poster to make the
posting, or by otherwise colluding with him. Although we believe that

Khan</B>:</Member> At the last general election, all three main parties
were committed to reform our defamation laws. The Bill before us is a
step forward in modernising our outdated defamation legislation. I
shall shortly explain that it is not perfect—I believe that the
House must decide on a number of crucial issues today—but it
will lead to a much-needed updating of the
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T18:37:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041655000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0003.htm#13041655000076">I
begin by thanking colleagues in the other place, including Lord Browne
of Ladyton and Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town, for championing
improvements to the Bill, many of which are before us today, and Lord
McNally for his handling of the Bill in the other place. A number of
the points addressed in the amendments were raised by Labour in the
House of Commons and in Committee in the Lords. We welcome the fact
that the Government have taken them on board. I hope the House will
endorse the improvements made to the provisions on public interest
defence, the operators of websites and the electronic publication of
peer-reviewed academic and science journals. All those will contribute
to improving our defamation

from pursuing defamation actions against individuals; it merely
introduces an initial hurdle before that stage is reached. A court must
be satisfied that the likelihood of substantial financial harm has been
proved before the action can proceed. That last point is important, as
it relates to the size of the company and thus takes into account the
particular challenges facing smaller

sympathetic to the point he is making, and I certainly agree that the
case of Dr Singh exemplifies the wrong that we seek to redress. It is
simply a matter of the tactics that we use to achieve the result that
we want. The Minister has expressed her willingness to consider tabling
another amendment, and it seems to me that, in procedural terms, the
only way in which we can do that is by ensuring that the Commons
disagrees with the Lords so that negotiation can take place in the

Khan:</Member></B> I am terribly sorry, but the Minister did not say
that. She alluded to the civil procedure rules and to the Civil Justice
Council, but she did not say that she would go away and table an
amendment in lieu of the previously amended clause 2. If she had agreed
to table, next week, a new amendment containing subsections
(1), (2), (3), but not (4)—for the reasons that she
articulated—that would be an argument in the right hon.

uncontroversial. Human beings can get damages for hurt to their
feelings; companies cannot. One cannot libel a company by accusing it,
for example, of adultery, whereas one can so libel an individual. There
are plenty of obvious and not very surprising differences between the
law relating to individuals and the law relating to companies, but

reputations, which should be susceptible to

doctors said that tobacco is very bad for people’s health and
asbestos is very bad for people’s lungs. That was not the
general view. It was an insight, and the companies involved in selling
tobacco and selling asbestos could have sued for loss. That should have

would not go to the lengths they do to protect and burnish their

a value which the law should protect, and it is not an adequate answer
that the corporation can itself seek to answer the defamatory statement
through press releases or public statements, as protestations of
innocence by the impugned party necessarily carry less weight with the

why should one have to accept that a publication, if truly damaging to
a corporation’s commercial reputation, will result in provable
financial loss, since the more prompt and public a company’s
issuing of proceedings, and the more diligent its pursuit of a claim,
the less the chance that financial loss will actually accrue? It may be
argued against me that all these matters will be dealt with in the
permission hearing, but when is the permission hearing to take place?
Will the corporation have to wait right until the end of the limitation
period? Will it have to wait for weeks and weeks while the next set of
accounts comes out, so that it can work out whether financial loss has
occurred as a consequence of the libel? There might be any number of

big corporations wanting to bully and intimidate the little people, as
McDonalds did years ago, simply because they can. The Culture, Media

almost flagrant abuse of our libel laws by a large corporation:
Tesco’s libel action against <I>The Guardian</I>—some

tax that it said it was not avoiding. <I>The Guardian</I>, as any

and ensured that it used all the procedures of the law, as set down the

not

reason Tesco turned everything down, stalled for time and racked up the
costs was not just because it could, but because it, like so many
corporations, wanted to chill. It wanted to take the newspaper and its
journalists out of the game. It wanted to send a message. <I>The
Guardian</I>—it could have been any newspaper—faced a
bill of up to £5 million if the case went all the way to the
House of Lords, or now to the Supreme Court, because the issue in libel
is cost, not damages, so it settled for a nominal sum. The costs were
massive.</hs_Para>

Members may be surprised to see the return of a Bill to which we bade
such a fond farewell not very long ago. It returns to the House for two
reasons. First, we had such an enjoyable time during its passage
through the Commons that we could not resist one further go, but
secondly—and by far the most important reason—we tabled
this amendment in the other place in response to a recommendation from
the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in its sixteenth
report of the Session.</hs_Para>

Members will recall from our discussions, the adjudicator must consult
on her guidance. This will allow her to make a recommendation to the
Secretary of State about the maximum level of the fine or the basis for
determining that amount. The Secretary of State will then need to lay
an order before Parliament setting this maximum level or the method for
determining it. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
has recommended that such an order be subject to an affirmative
resolution rather than the negative procedure provided for in the Bill
when it left the Commons.</hs_Para>

already safeguards around the use of the power. It can be exercised
only after a recommendation from the independent adjudicator, based on
her consultation, and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee recognised that this would usefully serve to inform the
exercise of the power by the Secretary of State. However, the Committee
advised that as the upper limit of the penalty is
not on the face of the Bill, the power to fix those limits should be
subject to a significant level of parliamentary scrutiny.
This is in line with its recommendations in other cases in which the
maximum penalty is not stated on the face of the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041658000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041658000014">We
think that the Committee’s comments are reasonable and we are
happy to heed the voice of Parliament on this issue. Our amendment
provides only that the order will be subject to the affirmative
resolution procedure, ensuring that Parliament will be able to
scrutinise and positively approve the order. I trust that this
increased level of scrutiny will be to the satisfaction of
hon. Members, and I urge them to support this minor
amendment to what I think we all agree is an excellent
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041658000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041658000015"><Member ContinuationText="Ian Murray" PimsId="5730" UID="13041658000155" xid="1056" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041658000155"><B>Ian
Murray</B> (Edinburgh South) (Lab):</Member> It is strange that an hour
has been allocated for this debate when it is obvious that it will take
only a few moments. Given that the Agricultural Wages Board has been
abolished by the unelected House of Lords and this House was not able
to have a debate on that, the timetable today is a bit
disappointing.</hs_Para>

I have often said in Delegated Legislation Committees in the past few
weeks that I agree with the Minister, and this is another demonstration
of the fact 
<?notus-xml column=290?>that when the Government do the right thing, we will agree with them. In

returning to the introduction of this Bill. It was a fairly ordinary
Bill to start with, but it was strengthened substantially in the other
place with the addition that trade associations and third parties could
seek redress from the adjudicator. Importantly, on Second Reading in
this House, we had a robust debate on whether fines should be included
in the Bill. We disagreed on that point, and the Minister vehemently
and robustly defended their omission. We are delighted that provisions
on fines were added in Committee, which made the Bill all the
better.</hs_Para>

we are considering is significant because it shows the power of this
House. The Select Committee has had a pre-appointment hearing for the
adjudicator, and we congratulate her on her appointment. She will be a
very good adjudicator and we look forward to her getting stuck into
some of the important work that has to be done on this issue. We have
also had a lot of cross-party consensus on the Bill on the Floor of the
House and in Committee. It is a testament to the power of the Select
Committees and the Committee system—not to mention the other
place—that we started with a fairly weak Bill, but it will leave
this House today much stronger.</hs_Para>

include the hon. Member for St Ives (Andrew George) who is in his

do not disagree with the Lords and will be agreeing with the Minister
in this particular case, but I will just make this point. We had
arguments in Committee about ensuring that the Select Committee on
Business, Innovation and Skills and the Select Committee on
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in particular had time to look at
these issues, and the Minister defended robustly the other Committees
of this House. Now that provisions on fines are in the Bill, and the
Secretary of State will be putting forward an order to determine their
amount, it is right that that statutory instrument should be before the
House for affirmative resolution. We can then debate it to ensure that
it is in the interests not just of the suppliers covered by the
groceries code adjudicator, but businesses and supermarkets
too<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T19:35:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

James Paice</B> (South East Cambridgeshire) (Con):</Member> I will make
a brief contribution because, like the Minister, I am happy to support
the Lords amendment. I just wanted to make the point that, in
considering the fines structure and the levels at which they will need
to be set, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister and the Secretary of
State will consider the magnitude of the businesses involved. A fine
that to most people would seem substantial of perhaps a few thousand
pounds, would be totally insignificant—a few minutes’
trading—to a major supermarket.</hs_Para>

do not pretend to have the answers. This is a subject on which I have
wrestled in my own mind and discussed with the adjudicator, because it
will be extremely difficult. That is one reason I was always a bit
dubious about the  
<?notus-xml column=291?>need for fines—the reputational issue will be far more valuable.
It is clear to me that if a fine is to be levied, it will have to be at
a level that is likely to lead to the behavioural change of the
relevant supermarket that all of us who support the Bill desire to see.
That means it will be very significant. I am sure that if my hon.
Friend the Minister comes forward with figures, there will be
accusations that they are completely disproportionate to the issues.
The proportion, however, is to do not just with the issue, but with the
scale of the business and the behavioural change we want to
see—clearly, that is not going to happen unless the business has
been in serious breach of the code.</hs_Para>

am grateful for the opportunity to make the point to my hon. Friend,
and to hon. Members in all parts of the House, that when the statutory
instrument comes back to the House we will have to consider this wider
issue. It is not simply a penalty for a small offence, but something we
need to ensure is a genuine penalty for breach of the code and a
deterrent. It will therefore have to be of a very large magnitude

Member for South East Cambridgeshire is that the order, when it is
brought forward, is couched in a manner that has the impact we all
want. Whether fines will be a set figure or a proportion of turnover
was debated at some length in Committee. A proportion of turnover for
Tesco as opposed to, say, Waitrose, is significant. Certainly, in other
areas of competition law this appears to be the case. I urge my hon.
Friend the Minister to look at a proportion of turnover as an

the Government on accepting the need to provide for fines in the Bill.

for Edinburgh South (Ian Murray). I sat through the previous debate on
the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill and made a point of order
about how we had not had an opportunity to debate the abolition of the
Agricultural Wages Board. The groceries code adjudicator is being put
in place to address some of the pressures on primary producers. It is a
great pity, however, that we were not given the acres of time we have
now—to debate this relatively minor issue—in order to
debate an issue that will have a significant impact on the future of
agriculture and agricultural workers in this country. The risk that
this might become a race to the bottom or that the Gangmasters
Licensing Authority might be the only body able effectively to regulate
and protect workers in the agricultural sector is one that the House
ought not to take. I hope that the House will reflect on the fact that
the undemocratic House has introduced a measure without the democratic
Chamber having an opportunity to debate it. We must ensure that such a
thing never happens again. There has been no debate or vote in this
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T19:41:33"></hs_TimeCode> on an
issue of great significance.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for South East Cambridgeshire, who said we have to
consider a level of fine that is commensurate with the size of the
company committing the felony. We have to be clear about that. It will
matter, because this is not only about naming and shaming. If the
public see that a large fine has been imposed on a large supermarket in
this country, they will start to realise what kind of bad practices
have been carried out. Many of our producers, farmers and growers have
suffered so much abuse over the years, especially when it comes to
perishable goods, whereby supermarkets and others have suddenly decided
that they have enough strawberries or whatever and will not buy those
crops, or they find some other reason not to buy them. Those crops then
have to be destroyed, at a loss to the farmer or grower. That is an
abuse by supermarkets and others of their power. We therefore very much
welcome the Bill and look forward to seeing what level of fine will be
imposed on the companies that abuse their powers.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=293?>fining lots of companies. We want to see bad practice ruled out and good
practice put in its place. I am hopeful that that is exactly what the
Bill will do. I therefore very much welcome the Lords amendment, but I

for Justice in response to a judgment in the European Court of Human
Rights. That judgment required the Government to bring forward
legislative proposals on prisoner voting for Parliament to consider.
The Justice Secretary published the draft Voting Eligibility
(Prisoners) Bill and proposed that a Joint Committee of both Houses be
appointed to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny. In this motion today,
the Government are seeking the establishment of a Joint Committee to
consider that draft

Justice Secretary made it clear in November that although Ministers
might have strong personal views on this matter, the Government are
under an international law obligation to implement the Court’s
judgment. Equally, however, the Justice Secretary was clear that
Parliament is sovereign, a fact recognised explicitly by the Human
Rights Act 1998, and the current law passed by Parliament will remain

Government believe that it is right that Parliament should be given the
opportunity fully to consider the difficult and contentious issue of
prisoner voting. That is why we brought forward draft legislative
proposals for pre-legislative scrutiny. We consider that to be the most

strong views that exist across both
Houses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T19:50:53"></hs_TimeCode>. It will

question<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T19:51:07"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Lords started the process of establishing a Joint Committee of both

hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope) and
others subsequently tabled an amendment, which has necessitated the
debate we are having today. I 
<?notus-xml column=295?>understand the purpose behind the amendment. Following the
implementation of the Wright report, we now elect the Chairs of most
Select Committees, and the membership of those Committees is determined
by elections within the political parties. It might therefore be argued
that it would be in the spirit of the Wright report for the membership
of pre-legislative Committees similarly to be elected by the House and
by the parties, rather than being determined by the Government and
through the usual
channels<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T19:51:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041658000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041658000046">However,
there are strong arguments of principle and of practicality against
such a move. As a matter of principle, joint pre-legislative Committees
need to be carefully balanced to ensure that they properly reflect all
shades of interest and opinion across both Houses of Parliament. To
ensure that scrutiny is rigorous, that means including critics of the
legislation as well as its supporters. With the best will in the world,
a process of election is unlikely to achieve that balance. If a
majority of the House has a prior view on a particular piece of
legislation, that view is likely to be reflected in the composition of

the Commons membership of Joint Committees were determined by election,
that would leave the House of Lords to seek to achieve the necessary

a practical level, I believe that it would be counter-productive to
elect Members to serve on Committees undertaking pre-legislative
scrutiny. There is usually an imperative to establish a Joint Committee
as quickly as possible after the publication of a draft Bill to enable
the Committee to complete its work in time for the Bill proper to be
introduced in Parliament later in the Session, or by a specified date.
A process of elections conducted by the parties would be bound to delay
the establishment of Joint Committees, giving the Committees less time
to complete their work or prejudicing the Bill’s
timetable.</hs_Para>

would point out to Members that the membership of the Joint Committee
is not imposed by Government or by the usual channels. Members have an
opportunity to table amendments to the motion put down, as demonstrated
today, and if they wish to, to suggest alternative names to serve on
the Committee. The whole House then has an opportunity to vote on the
membership. Such is the character of this evening’s debate that
I would say that I am not aware of any objection in practice to the
proposed membership of the Joint Committee.</hs_Para>

I should emphasise that to endorse the principle behind the amendment

should do so only after a full investigation of the all the potential
consequences, both intended and unintended. That would include proper
consultation with the parties affected, including the Liaison and
Procedure Committees both in this House and in the other place. Members
will recall that the Wright report made a wide range of recommendations
designed to improve Parliament’s scrutiny role, but I note that
it did not recommend the change suggested in the

first thing to say is that the draft Voting Eligibility (Prisoners)
Bill is a highly contentious piece of legislation. The Bill will offer
the choice of three options for Parliament to consider on prisoner
voting: a blanket ban on all prisoners having the vote; entitling
prisoners serving four years or less to the vote; or entitling
prisoners serving six months or less to the vote. It is crucial that
legislation as contentious as this be given extensive pre-legislative
scrutiny. We on the Opposition side thus support the establishment of a
Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament to scrutinise for a period
of six months the proposals in this
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041658000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041658000058">I
believe that the decision to pursue the scrutiny of the draft
legislation by the means of a Joint Committee of both Houses is
perfectly reasonable given the nature of the Bill under consideration,
and given the fact that it contains different options on prisoner
voting for Parliament to consider. Since 2010, 10 Joint Committees of
both Houses have been set up to scrutinise draft Bills. These
Committees have tended to be used to scrutinise the most complex pieces
of legislation, including on the detention of terror suspects and the
reform of the House of Lords. They have also been deployed where
Government policy is still to be formed in detail or where cross-party
agreement is felt to be crucial to the success of the proposals. Labour
Members welcome the establishment of a Joint Committee to scrutinise
this particular draft Bill, which I suspect falls into all of those
categories at once and has probably managed to create some entirely new
ones of its
own<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

it is also right in this instance that the membership of this Joint
Committee should be decided in the usual way via the Committee of
Selection. It is important that the Joint Committee be filled by
Members of both Houses and of both parties who possess the necessary
skills and expertise to scrutinise the Bill fully. While I acknowledge
that some in this House believe that everything that emanates from the
Whips Office of any party is somehow hopelessly tainted, I have to say
that I do not share this analysis. I do not think that the usual
channels are inherently tainted; in fact, they often work extremely
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041658000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041658000060">I
make that observation as someone who in my years in this House has both
served in the Whips Office and voted against the Whip—not at the
same time, I hasten to add! I have also been elected as vice-chair of
the parliamentary committee for the Labour party and on the Labour
party’s national executive committee against the wishes of this
supposedly “all-powerful” Whips Office—so they do
not always get their way. It follows that I do not believe that it is
necessarily always virtuous if the House bypasses the Whips Office.
Deciding to bypass the Whips Office simply because one wishes to bypass
the Whips Office is not an argument for changing the way we do things
in this instance.</hs_Para>

Whatever they do or do not do is going to be looked at by politicians

these three alternative proposals in a draft Bill; we then left it to
the House of Commons, in its wisdom, to decide who should serve on a
Joint Committee; and that Joint Committee took evidence and examined it
and reached various conclusions”, the Government would be under
no obligation to accept those conclusions. If a Joint Committee,

<?notus-xml column=300?>ensure that the decision on the membership of the Committee is made by

the judges in the European Court of Human Rights on this issue. If the

that he had nothing to do with who was on the Committee, that the usual
channels were not involved, that the Government left it to the Members
of the House of Commons to choose their own Committee members and that

part in the Division. Either deliberately or by accident, the
Government abstained; it was predominantly Back-Bench Members who took
part. That is noteworthy, because it removed more than 100

relatively representative of the views of the House as a whole. Even if

is that of the six Members who have been put forward through the
Committee of Selection’s convoluted procedure—it is
certainly not transparent—only two took part in the Division on
10 February 2011. One voted in favour of the status quo and not giving
prisoners the right to vote and the other, who was acting as

changing the status

do not know what the views of the other four were, and that is where
there is a problem. If the Government wanted balance on the Committee,
that may not occur because the other four are all in favour of the
argument or—I know not—are all against, in which case the
Committee certainly would not be representative of the views of this
House. Either way, there is a problem with the proposal before us.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T20:25:32"></hs_TimeCode> it were
indeed the Government’s view that there should be balance, then
perhaps the logic of that argument would be for the six members of the
Committee to have been drawn exclusively from those who showed an
interest on that occasion back on 10 February 2011, and equally from
those who voted for the motion and those who voted against it. Clearly,
however, that is not what has happened.</hs_Para>

motion before the House proposes two principal changes to the business
of the House tomorrow. The first part of the motion provides for the
House to sit at 2.30 pm, with the moment of interruption at 10 pm. This
is instead of the usual starting time of 11.30 am with the moment of
interruption at 7 pm.</hs_Para>

is not without precedent for the House to change its sitting times to
deal with specific, and tragic, circumstances. Indeed, right hon. and
hon. Members may remember that the House was rightly recalled to pay
tributes to the Her Majesty the Queen Mother following her death in
2002, but then also delayed returning from recess to accommodate the
funeral
arrangements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T20:28:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041658000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041658000108">The change in
sitting times will allow Members from across the House who wish to pay
their respects at the funeral of Baroness Thatcher to do so. The effect
of an objection to this motion would be to deny colleagues, friends and
others who wish to pay their respects that opportunity. There can be no
justification for this. This is a debate about the sitting hours for
tomorrow, and it should not be abused by those seeking now to debate
the legacy of Baroness Thatcher. There was an opportunity to do that in
the debate last Wednesday, and I remind the House that 77 right hon.
and hon. Members contributed to that debate.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041658000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041658000109">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T20:29:02"></hs_TimeCode>
thank Her Majesty’s official Opposition for the way in which
they have worked across the House to provide proper respect for the
longest serving Prime Minister of the last century. The Leader of the
Opposition, the acting shadow Deputy Leader of the House and other
Labour Members paid generous tributes in that debate, not necessarily
endorsing or agreeing with the policies of Baroness Thatcher but, I
thought, very generously paying proper respect.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T20:29:31"></hs_TimeCode> like spirit,
the proposal to change the sitting hours tomorrow, and to defer
questions on that day until next week, has been taken after
consultation with Her Majesty’s official Opposition, and I am
grateful for the
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T20:29:46"></hs_TimeCode> that
they have
taken.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041658000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041658000110">The
second effect of the motion is to suspend the operation of the oral
questions rota for the day. This, too, is being done following
consultation with, and the agreement of, the official Opposition.
Should the motion be approved by the House, the consequence for Members

<?notus-xml column=305?>is that the ballots that have already taken place will be rolled over
until next week, and the Table Office has helpfully contacted affected
Members to explain this to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T20:30:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041658000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041658000111">It
is quite proper, in the circumstances, for the House to defer questions
by one week. The Prime Minister takes his responsibilities to this
House very seriously, as evidenced by the extent to which he not only
responds to questions but makes statements to the House. I am sure that
the vast majority of the House will understand what is being proposed
and why. It is simply a matter of decency and respect that, in
returning from the funeral service and receptions tomorrow, Members
should not immediately enter into the character of business customary
at Wednesday’s
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T20:30:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041658000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041658000112">As
a consequence of the House agreeing to meet at 2.30 pm, paragraphs (3)
and (4) of the motion provide for Westminster Hall also to meet at 2.30
pm, which is an obvious and common-sense addition to the first two
parts of the
motion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T20:31:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041658000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041658000113">I
do not intend to detain the House any further. This is a simple motion,

Angela Eagle</B> (Wallasey) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to follow
the Leader of the House, who knows that, many times over the past year,
we have expressed the view that the Prime Minister seeks to dodge Prime
Minister’s questions. We do not yet know when Prorogation will
take place, but that may be another occasion when we will not sit on a
Wednesday. Could the Leader of the House tell us when Prorogation will
be? I pointed out recently that, following the Budget and given when we
adjourned for the recess, four weeks will have passed between the
Budget being delivered and the Prime Minister dealing with its
aftermath in this House. I have argued consistently that the way this
House’s business is arranged rather excludes Wednesdays and the
accountability that Prime Minister’s questions brings to
bear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T20:32:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041658000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041658000115">I
do not believe, however, that the reasons for changing
tomorrow’s sitting hours mean that we can accuse the Prime
Minister of dodging Prime Minister’s questions. A former Prime
Minister who led this country for 11 years has, sadly, passed away and
I think it is right that the business of this House should pause and
the din of the Chamber should quieten, so that hon. and right hon.
Members, many of whom were personal friends of hers, are able to attend
her funeral and reflect upon it subsequently without having to come
back to what is often the bear pit of adversarial politics in this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T20:33:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041658000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041658000116">That
does not mean that I agree with a single policy that that distinguished
Prime Minister brought to this House or the country, and it would be
wrong of me to say that I did, but that does not preclude me from
having the appropriate amount of respect for her memory, funeral and
loved ones. The official Opposition absolutely understand why tomorrow
must be different in these very special
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T20:34:01"></hs_TimeCode>.
That will not preclude me from checking how many Wednesdays are
included in the parliamentary calendar in future, but we absolutely
understand why this particular Wednesday cannot be a normal
one.</hs_Para>

entirely inappropriate to have a funeral in the morning and for
Parliament to come back immediately into a confrontation at the highest

not exist in relation to Mrs Thatcher. No matter how oft people from
the Front Benches fawn upon her, pour honeyed words upon her or

the Opposition parties in particular, are making a profound misjudgment

politics. This week has been a very long time. We were told at the
beginning of the week that it was disrespectful to speak of someone so
recently dead. I was told on the BBC yesterday that I should hold my
peace until Thursday. How much national mourning, without consensus and
without justification, are we supposed to observe?</hs_Para>

is no national consensus around the deceased, and there was no
justification for muffling Big Ben because that puts the deceased on a

not an irony? As Ken Loach, the great film director, put it, surely we
should have put the funeral out to tender to the private sector, and
invited companies to sponsor it. Surely that is what Mrs Thatcher would
have wanted at

backdrop to this motion is clear, and it has been one thing after
another. As Mr Macmillan said, it is not one damn thing, it is one damn
thing after another. It is the state mourning that was effectively
declared by the state broadcaster. It is the decision that the
Government made—it is speculated that your office, Mr Speaker,
was not wild about the idea—to recall Parliament at vast public
expense. Members of Parliament were offered up to £3,700 to fly
back from their holidays to attend what was, in effect, a state eulogy
for a party political figure, and then to fly back at public expense to
their holidays. I hope that IPSA will release the details of who
claimed and what they claimed. That was a grotesque and totally
unnecessary decision. Monday was the day on which Parliament returned,
and Monday was the day on which people could have paid tribute and made
the points that they wished to make. That was the second problem. The
state mourning was the first, and the unnecessary and fantastically
expensive recall of Parliament was the
second.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041661000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041661000032">The

point is that beatification and canonisation is something that can
happen only when there is a consensus. There is no such consensus about
the former Prime Minister, yet people are acting, the state is acting.
The state broadcaster and now the parliamentary authorities are asking
us to accept things that are too close to royal. Mrs Thatcher famously
had a slightly fraught relationship with the palace, and I can
understand why. Mrs Thatcher might to many Government Members have been
great, but she was not great to up to 60% of the electorate when she
was alive, and, according to the polls, more than 50% of the people now
being polled are against her—strongly against her and feel that
she did bad things here and abroad. It brings into discredit this kind
of funeral, this kind of state occasion, if it is awarded when many
people in the country feel it is unjustified, and feel that it is being
rammed down their throats for partisan and ideological reasons, for
which they are being asked to pay.</hs_Para>

you, Mr Speaker, I caution the establishment of which I suspect you are

has been too much of this. It is too expensive, too elaborate, too
regal, and many people in the country are unhappy about it. And to
compound it all by effectively cancelling a vital part of British

“Hurray!”] Gentlemen—[<SmallCaps>Hon.

although the misbehaviour is coming exclusively from gentlemen, as I
think they are called, on the Government Benches, my point is this.
This funeral did not have to be organised so that it would clash with
Prime Minister’s Question Time. It could have been held today or
on Thursday. The state was vitally involved in the organisation of this
funeral—we know that, because we are paying for it—and it
was the state that organised the clash with Prime Minister’s
Question Time, so why should the 
<?notus-xml column=312?>House of Commons be asked to accept the abrogation of its proper role
tomorrow, given that the Government are responsible for the
clash<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T21:01:18"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041661000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0004.htm#13041661000048">It
is too late now to change the time of the funeral, but it is not too
late for the House to refuse to abandon its responsibilities at Prime
Minister’s questions. If the House divides on this at the end of
the evening, as I hope it will, I hope that a decent number of Members
of Parliament will reflect the feelings, if not of their own
constituents, then of the tens of millions of constituents of many of
us on the Opposition Benches—and of some Government Members
too—who feel that the adoration of the Maggie has gone far
enough.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_16_PT_1/50BA12CE79BCA6796F772E1D8107284504F14973" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 April 2013">Tuesday

Dennis Skinner</B> (Bolsover) (Lab):</Member> It is almost like history
repeating itself. In the mid ’70s, I came down on the train and
my Whip told me that there would be a few tributes to Anthony Eden and
that then the House would finish for the day. I thought,
“Surely, that’s not fair. We’re actually packing
up because Anthony Eden, who was living in the Caribbean, has died. So
the tributes will be paid and then the House will finish for the rest
of the day.” I had an argument with the Labour Whip, and then I
went in for the tributes. I had not been here very long and I am not so
sure I thought at the time it would be a good idea for me to say
anything, because, as sure as night followed day, a lot of people were
going to pay these tributes to Anthony Eden, who some of them had never
even seen. So it is not as if this has not happened before.</hs_Para>

had been a miner for 20-odd years, I said that when I worked down the
pit and somebody died, four people took him out on a trolley along the
rails, and they were allowed to go home and the rest of the pit
continued to work, because people like us had managed to secure a tiny
agreement with the National Coal Board to get £250 for the
miner’s widow. On that basis, the rest of us went to work. What
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T21:03:57"></hs_TimeCode> am trying to
convey is that the people who concern me now are the people out there
having to suffer austerity, the benefit cuts and the increasing costs
of their own funeral. They are just like the people who concerned me
back in the days of 1975—the miners I had left behind in order
to speak for them in Parliament.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T21:04:23"></hs_TimeCode>I remember all

they did to Mrs Thatcher, because I remember that night and the
following day, when she stood at that Dispatch Box. She had not had a
night’s sleep and she was making her final speech in Parliament.
Why was she making the final speech in Parliament? It was not because
the Labour MPs had put a knife in her back. There is no question about
that: a succession of Tory MPs had gone to her in the night and said,
“I don’t think you should run again for the second
ballot.” That is the truth of it. So, whatever I am saying here
today does not compare with the fact that a woman who had 
<?notus-xml column=314?>won three elections in a row then suffered the indignity of being kicked
out like a dog in the night by her own Members of Parliament. That is

undoubtedly about getting rid of the bedroom tax. I also want to tell
the Prime Minister that it would not be a bad idea to do something
about agency workers. There is all this talk about immigration, but the
real problem in our society is the fact that a majority of the foreign
people who come to this country are now being dictated to by agencies,
and it is time we got rid of them. They are undercutting the indigenous
workers. I worked with Poles in 1948, down the pit. Why were there no
rows? Why did nobody get worked up about the displaced
persons—the Poles and the Ukrainians? Because they were in the
union with us, and they were paid the same wages. And there
wasn’t an agency in sight. So that is another question that we

I am saying is that it is important to remember that the people out
there know where Thatcher stood. They have not forgotten it. I am
talking about those communities where shipbuilding was destroyed in the
early ’80s and where the steel industry at Corby and various
other places was smashed when Thatcher brought in MacGregor, then
brought him back, paying a £1.5 million transfer fee
to Lazard’s bank for him to shut, it were said, about 20 or 30
pits. What happened in practice? We had 150 pits at the end of 1985 pit
strike, and by the time Thatcher went, there were only 30 left. That is
why people out there are angry, and why they demand of us—at
least a few of us—to speak the truth on their behalf. That is
why I am all in favour of Question Time because I have a list of
questions I would like to ask the Prime Minister every single
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T21:16:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041661000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0005.htm#13041661000075">Thank
you, Mr Speaker, for giving me the chance to talk about this issue. It
is not about personalities; it is all about class. We must never forget
that. We should remember where we come from. I remember my own
family—with nine kids, who did not have two ha’pennies to
rub together—and that is still embedded in my soul. That is why
I speak as I do. I do not want to change; I never will. That will not
get my hands on the Dispatch Box, but that is not a luxury that it has
ever bothered me to get. It is important to remember that these words
of mine do not come out of my mouth because of envy or greed, but
because I believe that we have to look after those people who do not
have two ha’pennies to rub together. That should be what
motivates us every day of the week, including at Prime
Minister’s Question Time. When the Labour party understands that
as we do here today, it will be better for it. Thank you, Mr

Flynn</B> (Newport West) (Lab):</Member> It is a daunting prospect to
follow two speeches that do great credit to this Chamber. I look
forward to the next election when the voters in many lucky
constituencies will have the chance of putting right the major defect
in this House. We are elected here to represent how the country looks:
at the moment there are more women here, but not enough of them; there
are more ethnic minorities here, but not enough of them—and
there is a terrible shortage of octogenarians. The people of Bolsover
and Newport West will have a chance to correct that in
future.</hs_Para>

point will be brief, but it is one of great importance. It is not just
the pantomime of Prime Minister’s questions 
<?notus-xml column=316?>that will be absent tomorrow; also absent will be the valuable recent
tradition of announcing the names of the fallen in Iraq and
Afghanistan. I am afraid that the Government have form on that. On two
occasions, the announcement was changed from Prime Minister’s
Question Time—the moment of the week of maximum attendance by
Members and maximum attention by the press and public—once to a
Monday and once to a Tuesday. It was only because of an outcry by Back
Benchers that it was restored to its proper place.</hs_Para>

are other indications that the Government wish not to publish the names
of the fallen, by which I mean the practice of reading out the
names—it has been done—of the 179 fallen in Iraq and of
the fallen in Afghanistan. It is now part of our orders in the House
that that is not permitted. Why? Lance Corporal Jamie Webb died on 26
March, and was repatriated to this country on 4 April. Did anyone see
any publicity about that? Did anyone realise that the event had taken
place?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041661000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0005.htm#13041661000079">I went down
to Brize Norton to inspect the facilities for the repatriation of our
fallen soldiers. I was grateful to the Prime Minister for writing to me
after last Wednesday’s debate in the House, because Brize Norton
is in his constituency. Those facilities were very sensitively
conceived, and one can think of hardly any improvement that could be
made. There is provision for counselling, and rooms have been allocated
for the coffins to be laid out with the appropriate religious regalia.
Also—this is very touching—because many of the fallen
were the fathers, or perhaps in some cases the mothers, of young
children, a room has been fitted out with Peppa Pig toys for the
children who turn up.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041661000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0005.htm#13041661000080">However, I
believe that, sadly, an attempt has been made to hide the event at
Brize Norton. A special entrance has been constructed so that the main
entrance, and the attention that it might receive, can be avoided. When
the procession went through the attractive town of Wootton Bassett, it
was a touching sight. Passers-by would stop and bow their heads in
respect and reverence. Now, however, rather than going through the main
town, the procession skirts the local village and goes on to the main
road, where no one can show respect.</hs_Para>

great shame that there was no prime ministerial announcement of the
death of Lance Corporal Webb. That meant that the country could not pay
tribute to the 441st of our soldiers to die in Afghanistan. We hear
today that we went into Helmand province in 2006 in order to reduce the
growth of drug activity there. At that time only two soldiers had died
in combat. Now 441 have died, and the growth of drug activity is at
record level. I think it absolutely right for us to meet and to bring
that part of Prime Minister’s Question Time back into
being.</hs_Para>

congratulate my hon. Friends on their speeches. I agree with much of
what they said. It would have been possible for the funeral to take
place on a different day, and for Prime Minister’s Question Time
to take place here. It is a great shame that although there was a minor
announcement of that recent death, we have not paid that soldier the
full respect that he so richly
deserves.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13041661000428" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0005.htm#13041661000428">9.22

have the opportunity through an Adjournment debate to raise further the
case of Sergei Magnitsky. I am grateful to hon. Members and my hon.
Friends for joining me to support a case of continuing concern that
involves not only the reputation of Russia but by necessity the
response that we as a nation make to this scandal. I am very grateful

should remind the House that Sergei Magnitsky was a Russian lawyer
whose incarceration and death at the hands of the Russian authorities
remains a standing reproach to that regime. He met his fate for raising
the alarm about a $230 million fraud committed against the Russian
state by its own officials. Mr Magnitsky would have been 41 on 8 April,
not a dissimilar age to me. I am a fellow lawyer. I was able to
practise without fear or favour. He was not.</hs_Para>

over a year ago, the House debated the issue and took that opportunity
to call for the Government to take action to target those individuals
who are implicated in Mr Magnitsky’s death, and to take action
in the form of visa and capital restrictions. A number of us called
upon the Government to follow in the footsteps of, among others, the
United States Senate by passing legislation to enact visa
bans.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041661000372" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0005.htm#13041661000372">What
has happened since then? In Russia things have gone from bad to worse.
In March this year the Russian authorities closed the investigation
into Mr Magnitsky’s death, having found that no crime had been
committed, despite the findings of two independent domestic
commissions. The Russian authorities also announced that they found no
evidence of a link between Mr Magnitsky’s arrest and
death in custody and his testimonies implicating Government officials
in the theft of moneys from the Russian Treasury. Last month the
Russian authorities finally launched a posthumous trial against Mr
Magnitsky, the first in Russian history. That is not only an offence to
natural justice but something truly out of the theatre of the
absurd<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T21:40:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041661000373" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0005.htm#13041661000373"><Member ContinuationText="Sir Peter Bottomley" PimsId="4087" UID="13041661000745" xid="58" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0005.htm#13041661000745"><B>Sir

was saying that Mr Magnitsky’s trial is truly out of the theatre
of the absurd. In fact, it is redolent of the ninth century, when a

Formosus was already dead when he was tried for his crimes. We have
moved on 1,100 years, but Russia seems to be going backwards.</hs_Para>

referred to the Act of both Houses of Congress, so it is clear that the
United States has gone down the legislative route and is taking action.
That is something I urge the UK Government to consider very seriously.
There are two ways of doing that: either passing legislation or using
existing powers to deny visas to those who are implicated. I will
return to that point

am also heartened that many legislators in the French, Swedish and

have done, to debate and condemn the scandal emerging from this
disturbing case. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for North East
Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt), offered some reassurance in the debate
last year that the UK Government have expressed many times to the
Russian Government their serious concerns about the situation, and I
accept that the Government take human rights issues very seriously when
considering our relations with
Russia.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041661000383" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0005.htm#13041661000383">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T21:49:44"></hs_TimeCode>
also note that the Government said that they felt it best to wait to
see how other countries such as the United States reacted and responded
before we made any final decisions. Well, action has now been taken:

understand the diplomatic complexities that we face in poking a stick
into a hornets’ nest, and I know how important our emerging
trade relationship with Russia is. Russia has an important role to
play, whether it is to do with the balance of our economy in Europe,
with regional security, or with wider global security. None the less,
it is simply not tenable for us to turn a blind eye to this situation.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T21:47:46"></hs_TimeCode> accept that
approaching it in a heavy-handed manner would perhaps be inappropriate,

At present his death is still being investigated by the Surrey police,

asked whether the Government would take into consideration the list of
280 people allegedly involved in the Magnitsky case that Congressman
Jim McGovern submitted to the state department. As apparent from my
earlier remarks, the Home Office would not consider documents provided
speculatively in the absence of an actual visa application from an
individual. Having said that, when a visa application is made, it is
considered on its merits, and all circumstances and information
available to us at that time are taken into account. When credible
evidence exists that a person has been involved in human rights abuses,
they should not expect to be allowed entry to the UK.</hs_Para>

believe that introducing asset freezes along the lines that the United
States has introduced them would contribute to the objective we seek.
Asset freezes would also need to meet legal tests. When assets are
frozen by the UK or another democracy, they can find that such
decisions are challenged in the courts. There are ongoing cases in
which even UN and EU asset freezes against individuals are being
challenged through the courts. There would have to be credible evidence

Friend the Prime Minister’s commitment to bringing down energy
bills, Ofgem—the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets—is
introducing a package of measures to reduce bills, improve consumer
advice and improve regulation, but, however welcome those changes are,
their scope extends only as far as the limits of the mains gas grid.
Beyond the flicker of the grid lie millions of households that are at
risk of being left in darkness as energy reforms come into force. Those
households, unable to access gas from the grid, rely on alternative
energy sources, including heating oil, liquefied petroleum gas,
electricity and solid fuels. If we are serious about helping people who

Millions of people rely on off-grid energy.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T09:32:17"></hs_TimeCode> a Cornish MP,
raised in the duchy, I have always been aware that, for many local
households, energy is not simply a matter of flicking a switch for a
piped supply. It involves an expensive process of sourcing, purchasing
and securing delivery of a private supply of heating oil or LPG or,
nowadays, of finding a renewable source of energy. However, it was only
on entering Parliament and joining the all-party group on off-gas grid,
so ably led by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T09:32:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

in urban areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T09:33:17"></hs_TimeCode>.
The households reliant on off-gas grid energy do not represent a
marginal group—an exception to be brushed over—but
instead comprise millions of families and individuals living in cities,

comprehensive study of the sector was published last month by the

off-grid energy customers, consumer groups and the Department of Energy

thing is particularly clear: off-grid households pay more for energy.
Work undertaken by the heating bill comparator Sutherland Tables
reveals that a typical three-bedroom house, costing an average of
£975 a year to heat on mains gas, would cost more than
£1,570 to heat with heating oil and a staggering £2,170
to heat with bulk LPG. Overall, off-grid households pay 60% to 120%
more for energy than households connected to the mains gas

schemes, such as the carbon emissions reduction target, have
incentivised energy suppliers to provide energy-efficiency improvements

different energy suppliers—the system of a point for each

easy-to-improve households. As many off-grid properties were far from
easy to improve, having solid, hard-to-insulate walls and being
situated in isolated locations, they were accorded a low priority. As a
result, many off-grid households missed

all-party group’s report shows that a considerable number of
off-grid gas energy consumers believe that the high prices that they

I have been aware of those concerns for some time, and following the

concerns and for asking the OFT to instigate just such an inquiry.
However, while the OFT concluded that the off-grid market was working
well and gave most off-grid customers a choice of suppliers, the

the OFT analysed the number of suppliers in a given area by postcode.
That approach throws up a number of issues. It has been argued that
analysis by postcode district is not sufficiently detailed to give an
accurate assessment of the number of functioning suppliers for any one
address in that district, as postcode districts can cover many square
miles and thousands of households. In particular, sparsely populated
rural areas, which are most likely to be off-grid, by definition cover
a larger expanse. The average rural postcode for England and Wales
comprises 55 square miles, compared with 14 square miles for
urban areas. That large rural postcode size means that, although a
postcode could be served by five different suppliers, each supplier
could feasibly serve only one district within it—a district
large enough to support one whole company, but that comprises only a
small proportion of the postcode area. Consumers living in that
district would therefore have a very limited choice of

is worth noting that over the past four years, the cost of heating an

and £750 respectively, while gas has increased by only
£400, so not only are off-grid homes more expensive to heat but
the costs have risen much more sharply than for homes on the gas grid.
In short, it costs almost double to heat a home with LPG than a home
with access to the mains gas grid. It is also important to note that
the main use of LPG and home fuel oil is for heating, so although these
homes generally have electricity they still face greater
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041619000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041619000047">The
traditional response of Government to the problem has been to call for

of my constituent, it might be that the quoted cost was high because
they were the first person in their small area who wanted to connect.

Those who are on the gas

however, is not the case for those who are off the gas grid. They face
the difficulty of having to pay for their LPG or home fuel oil up front

Many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T09:55:50"></hs_TimeCode> find it
difficult to make the payment at that point, and may well not fill up

up many of the roads because they were blocked with snow. I had
constituents who had no gas over that Christmas. The problem is

noting that once someone is in the system they do not have to apply in
subsequent years. Clause 1 simply seeks to vary the regulations by
bringing forward the qualifying date for those off the gas grid from
late September to late July. Clause 2 seeks to bring forward the
payment date to no later than 30 September to allow them to take
advantage of buying a complete tank of gas before

seems to me that the real problem—it is not unique to this

tells Ministers that such changes are too difficult and too expensive,
neither of which bears scrutiny. I have already suggested that, if the
Government have real problems with an earlier date, we might keep the
September date and simply allow payment to off-gas grid consumers at an
earlier date from the second year. That would get round many of the
problems, none of which seems to me to be

but was consistently told by his advisers that it would be too
difficult or expensive, so he simply went on television and announced
its introduction, and the Department suddenly found a way to do it.
Perhaps it is time for similar ministerial militancy from the Minister
to tackle the problem. To encourage him, I have tabled a new clause to
the Energy Bill that would insert the main provisions of my Bill, and I
ask all Members who are interested in the issue to sign it. Let us have
another go at the Minister before our constituents have to suffer
another winter of massively increasing fuel prices and an inability to

want to raise several issues, on the first of which some progress has
been made. My predecessor, Richard Livsey, pressed the Office of Fair
Trading to conduct an inquiry into the supply of LPG for many years,
but I was the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire when that 
<?notus-xml column=10?>inquiry was completed and a report made. It gave customers greater
flexibility in being able to compare prices from various suppliers.
Until then, they had to change the bulk tank when they changed
suppliers, and the complexity and expense of doing so meant that
changing suppliers was very
difficult<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T10:03:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041619000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041619000062">There
have been incredibly good examples of communities coming together to
form purchaser groups that can negotiate more strongly with suppliers.
Certainly, the little community of Llanspyddid in my constituency has
achieved that, although again—we have heard this message from
hon. Members—the tariffs proposed by suppliers were so
complicated that it was difficult for consumers to come to a conclusion
and they needed help to evaluate suppliers’ proposals. That is
nevertheless a good example of how the consumer can be more powerful in
the market, given the right
conditions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T10:04:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041619000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041619000063">I
say to the Minister that those people need support to get groups
together. A document has been produced on good practice for consumer
groups in the energy market, but the Department of Energy and Climate
Change could certainly do more to ensure that LPG consumers know that
they can have competitive tenders from different suppliers. I often
talk to LPG consumers who still do not understand what can be done, and
there should certainly be a public information campaign to enable
people to benefit more from
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041619000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041619000064"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sarah Newton" PimsId="5613" UID="13041619000166" xid="1158" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041619000166">Sarah

amount of work has certainly been done, with some financial help from
the Government, to set up such bio co-operatives. They have been
successful, but there are limits to their success, because of
fundamental issues in the market. If there are only one or two
suppliers, people can get a discount, but it will be about 10%, and we
have heard about the huge disparity between on-grid and off-grid. Such
help is welcome and a step in the right direction—of course, 10%

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T10:06:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Angus—that although off-grid energy consumers often live in
very isolated properties, sometimes their communities have never been
connected to the gas mains for some reason or another. Certainly in my

deliveries of free coal to miners or their widows seem to have been
left off the mains

it—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T10:07:01"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) will correct me if I am
wrong—the number of people off-grid in Northern Ireland is much
higher than in the rest of the country. Yet, work is going on there to

I have tried to inquire about getting communities such as Llangynidr
and Abercraf on  to the mains supply, the cost—as the
hon. Member  for Angus said—was so enormous that taking
that forward was impossible. There is not just the cost of the 
<?notus-xml column=11?>infrastructure, but people have to be made to commit to taking mains
gas, which is a question not only of putting in a connection, but often
of having appliances changed for mains gas. In the old mining
communities in my constituency, some people are particularly vulnerable
and certainly do not have the spare cash to make that type of
investment in their
properties<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T10:08:23"></hs_TimeCode>. I
believe that the Government should have some system for making mains

lack of gas connectivity has been raised by my constituents in the
rural parts of East Cleveland, especially those living in outlying
houses or small ex-farm buildings in and around communities such as
Charltons, Margrove Park and Moorsholm. Although I recognise that there
are large urban off-grid populations, the lack of mains gas supply is
particularly problematic in rural areas. The 2009 English housing
survey found that 36% of households in rural England are not covered by
the gas grid, compared with 8% of urban
households<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T10:12:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

has many causes, but the additional costs of energy and fuel faced by
rural households are almost certainly a major factor. Fuel poverty is a
major issue throughout the country, but it is all the more acute in
small settlements in rural areas. Indeed, in 2010, some 24.1% of
households in villages, hamlets and isolated dwellings were fuel poor,
compared with the then national average of
16.4<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T10:12:26"></hs_TimeCode>%, and that
figure has increased again, as we have heard in the statistics quoted

high fuel poverty in such communities can be at least partially
explained through the lack of gas connectivity. The cost of heating oil
is approximately twice that of heating a home by gas, so it is little
wonder, though still appalling, that on average, in 2009, the cost to a
rural household in ensuring an adequate standard of warmth was
£346 more than for an urban
household<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T10:12:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041619000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041619000075">Furthermore,
a household with oil central heating is almost twice as likely to be
fuel poor as one with gas central heating. With such a clear
relationship between gas connectivity and fuel poverty, there are
significant benefits in trying to increase connectivity. Where that is
not practical, the Government should be working to ensure that
alternative fuels are as affordable as possible to off-gas grid

first glance, that on and off-grid gas should be covered by the same

Rural households rely on oil and LPG more heavily to heat their homes,
so we clearly have an unfairness and imbalance in supply not just in
Northern Ireland, but across the whole United Kingdom—Scotland
and Wales and elsewhere. We are probably all aware that some 10% of
costs in the home go towards heating. In December 2012, prices were 14%

the past year, I have been contacted by many pensioners, because they
are the people in the greatest need and who have the greatest

fill their oil tanks. Some petrol stations say that buying a five
gallon drum is cheaper, but it is not; it is dearer. Pensioners in my
constituency, in both rural and urban areas, say that the only way that
they can address their heating problems is by wearing extra clothes. It
would be interesting to find out how many people have died as a result
of the cold this winter. I think that the numbers will be quite
horrific, but I do not have definite evidence. None the less, I am

provide gas everywhere, but we have to try to provide it in lots of
places. I would like gas to be provided in some areas of my

like to see it provided in Ballynahinch; Saintfield in Ballygowan; and
in the villages of the Ards peninsula, such as Donaghadee, Millisle,
Ballywalter, Greyabbey and Portavogie. Those are areas where gas should
be made available, and it is quite possible to do so. There are small
groups in all those rural areas that could justify the expense
involved, and that process could be replicated in other parts of the
United Kingdom.</hs_Para>

will not restate many of the statistics that have already been
presented this morning, but I will make just a few points. Four million
UK households are off the mains gas grid and they use a range of other
fuels to heat their homes, including heating oil; gas, as we have
heard; mains electricity; and microgeneration. However, they also use
solid fuel—coal and wood—and that is a particular issue
in constituencies that were previously coal mining areas. Also, there
are some rural non-coal-mining areas in my constituency; the point
about non-mining areas has already been noted by

know that the cost of using heating oil is substantially higher than
the cost of using mains gas—about half as much again as the cost
of using mains gas—and the cost of using LPG is about twice as
great. However, in my area there is limited opportunity for consumers
to switch their fuel source, an issue referred to

the Member for Angus (Mr Weir). I have heard over a number of years
that there are continuing suspicions of what are, in effect, local
monopolies, with large companies presenting themselves locally with
local names, 
<?notus-xml column=15?>for example. I do not know if that continues to be a problem, but it
certainly has been in the past. There is, therefore, also a difficulty
in substituting one supplier for
another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T10:22:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041619000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041619000094">Reference
has already been made to the difficulty of adopting some of the
solutions that have been recommended by the Government, such as getting
better insulation. In my constituency, houses typically are of rubble

percentage of such houses in some parts of rural parts of Wales is much
higher. From my experience of living on the Llyn peninsula, which is
isolated from the mains in some areas, I know that the percentage is
very much higher, which has a specific consequence for those

not get up there. I made inquiries about whether the gas supply was
part of emergency planning, and clearly it was not in any real sense,

I came across a case last Friday. A gentleman came to see me who was on

precise about the amount of money he gets—down to the penny,
almost—because people on very low incomes have to be. Out of his
£72.40, he was considering buying two bottles of LPG, which he
thought would cost him around £40. Spending that £40 was
going to destroy his finances for that particular week, but he was
confident that he could manage, because he had been managing in this
way for years. I went through his finances with him very briefly and I
asked him in passing, “I don’t think you have allowed
there for the cost of a TV or a TV licence,” and he said,

of communities in the constituency of the hon. Member for Strangford

Northern Ireland 80% of households are off the grid, largely because
natural gas was introduced there only relatively recently. Although
there is a different regulatory and market set up in Northern Ireland,
we should pay attention to the efforts to get households on to the gas

which is urban and suburban, but has a number of former coal
communities that have not been on the grid for exactly those reasons,

in Scotland, where 21% of households are off-grid, and in Wales, where

three years. For those who are off-grid, that problem is even worse.

Members mentioned the House of Commons Library figure on the typical
cost for households using oil for heating and hot water in a typical
three-bedroom house, which at the beginning of the year was just under
£1,700, compared to about £1,250 for gas. The difference
of £450 a year would be difficult to deal with at any time and

of the price of heating oil in particular causes off-grid households
huge problems. Hon. Members mentioned the winter of 2010-11, when the
price of heating oil increased by 55%. High prices coupled with extreme
volatility have resulted in many off-grid households being pushed into
fuel poverty. According to Consumer Focus, in Scotland, 59% of those
using solid fuel and 56% of those using LPG and bottled gas live in
fuel poverty, compared with 24% of those using mains gas. The 24%
figure is far too high while 59% is very high and should be a matter of
concern.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041619000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041619000122">Measures

regulator for off-grid operations and Ofgem’s remit essentially
extends only to the on-grid market. The role of the OFT and the

they can keep warm during the colder winter months, because they know
they will receive significant help with their bills. In particular, the
Department for Work and Pensions provides winter fuel payments of
£200 for households with someone who has reached women’s
state pension age and is under 80, and £300 for households with
someone aged 80 or over. In addition, we have permanently increased the
cold weather payment from £8.50 a week to £25 a

satisfactory heating regime. Last year, Professor John Hills of the
London School of Economics published the first report of his review
into fuel poverty in England, which the Government commissioned to take
a fresh look at the issue. He highlighted serious flaws in the way in
which fuel poverty is measured, with the current 10% definition
painting a misleading picture of trends. Unless we can properly

a result, we made a commitment to develop a revised definition of fuel
poverty, and we have consulted on proposals that will allow for a more
accurate measurement of the problem. Under the revised definition, a
household will be considered to be in fuel poverty if its income is
below the poverty line and its energy costs are higher than typical for
that household type. Based on our new understanding of the problem, we
promised we would look again at all our policies to ensure they

want now to discuss the potential for extending the gas grid. As to
options for off-gas grid consumers who want to be connected to the

and that is a matter for the local gas distribution network. However,
for vulnerable consumers, Ofgem operates the fuel-poor network
extension scheme, whereby the large gas distribution networks are
incentivised through price control arrangements to extend the grid to
vulnerable households, recognising that that will reduce their costs.
During the next price control period, which will run from April 2013 to
2021, network owners are committed to connecting an additional 80,000
homes in fuel poverty to the gas distribution network. That is in
addition to normal customer requests for gas connections, which are
expected to exceed 440,000 over the same period. Therefore, overall,
there are projected to be more than 500,000 new customers on the gas
distribution network. The promotion and operation of those schemes is a
matter for the regulator and the network owners, but I shall watch

is promoting alternative low-carbon options for off-grid consumers
through renewable heat premium payments, which can help to reduce costs

the ability to bring down fuel bills for those using heating oil and
LPG, though they will not be suitable for all off-grid homes. The
renewable heat incentive is a financial support mechanism to encourage
the installation of renewable heating technologies to meet our
renewable

grid, but targeted specifically at the off-gas grid sector through the
setting of tariff levels. Tariffs would be set to compensate households
for the difference in lifetime costs, including up-front, running,
barrier and financing costs, between the renewable technology and
currently used conventional heating technology, for the median cost
off-gas grid installation. On 26 March, we announced an extension to

have provided the renewable heat premium payment scheme, which provides
grants towards the cost of installing renewable heat technologies in
domestic properties off the gas grid, and for solar installations on or
off the grid. The first phase of that scheme ran from August 2011 to
March 2012. More than 5,000 installations were delivered to off-gas
grid households. A second phase ran from April 2012 to March 2013; it
consisted of another household scheme and a social landlords
competition, plus a community scheme for community groups to test the
benefits of community level action, such as securing bulk buying
discounts through facilitating the installation of renewable heating

11,000 installations, of which approximately 9,000 are currently off

I want to deal with further regulation of the off-gas grid market. I
have heard arguments in favour of more regulation. We must decide
whether more regulation is necessary in this area; if it were decided
that Ofgem should become the regulator, primary legislation would be
required, with a transfer of knowledge of the market from the OFT.
Ofgem already has powers to apply the Competition Act 1998 concurrently
with the OFT, and 
<?notus-xml column=24?>to investigate and enforce decisions to deal with anti-competitive
practices in its designated sector. Its remit is to regulate the
monopoly companies that run the electricity and gas networks. There is
no natural or structural monopoly for supply and distribution in
heating oil or LPG, so regulation by Ofgem seems less appropriate in
this sector than it is in others. The supply of heating oil or LPG is
not covered by the natural gas and electricity regulatory regime,
because the relevant gas and electricity legislation principally
addressed the issues of setting up a regulatory regime to ensure that
the natural monopolies of the gas pipe network and the electricity
transmission and distribution systems were not exploited. Ofgem ensures
appropriate regulation of gas and electricity supply, which are
licensed activities for reasons that include the need to balance the
systems and the relationship with the natural monopoly networks.

nutritional benefits that children receive from free school meals, the
problem is that free school meals are used as a predominant marker for
educational attainment. The well known attainment gap at GCSE level is
between those who receive free school meals and those who do
not—36% of pupils in receipt of free school meals achieved five
or more A* to C grades at GCSE, compared with 63% of all other pupils.

low wages of just above £16,000—those receiving working
tax credits—and there are those for whom the stigma of claiming
free school meals is still enough to deter them from doing so, although

to my advice surgery to tell me that they will not take up offers of
employment because doing so would cost them their free school meals, as
they would be in low-paid employment and in receipt of working tax
credit. It does not seem right that, when the Government are doing
everything that they possibly can to incentivise work, hard-working
parents in need of help from the state to boost their terribly low

working tax credit. Barnardo’s has calculated that, for a
workless single parent with two children, the cash value 
<?notus-xml column=27?>of their entitlement to free school meals is worth 5% of their income.

represent the extent of rural poverty in areas with traditionally low

just the immediate family

in areas with high rates of low-paid employment will receive lower

is pushing to the brink the capacity of schools to support
disadvantaged children. Surely, distributing pupil premium on that
basis is widening the attainment gap between rich and poor. The
distribution is certainly widening the funding gap because, if areas
such as Devon are getting less pupil premium than the national average
when, as the second-poorest county in the country, it would be expected
to receive far more than the national average, a bad problem is being
made worse, which is a terrible pity when the objectives of the pupil
premium are so laudable and so widely
supported.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041620000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041620000040">The
linkage of the pupil premium to free schools meals presents other
problems. I have mentioned the residual, underlying problems of having
some of the lowest school funding per child in the country. Every pupil
in Devon receives £480 less each year for their education than
the national average. In 2012-13, that has meant an annual
loss in the county of some £49 million. I am not
pretending for one moment that that is unique to Devon, and I am
grateful to the F40 school funding group, which comprises some of the
40 lowest funded local authorities, for its work in raising awareness
of these issues in political circles and specifically with Ministers.
However, when small rural schools with a high proportion of children
from low income, rural families are not receiving the pupil premium on
the scale that they could reasonably have expected, the consequences
are felt even more
keenly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041620000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041620000041">What
the pupil premium is spent on is also an important consideration
because it has the potential to exacerbate the flaws inherent in its
link with free school meals. Schools are rightly given a pretty free
rein in how they spend the pupil premium allocation, but if they choose
to spend it on individual tuition or personalised support, the gulf
between children from poor working families and their contemporaries
continues to widen even
further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041620000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041620000042">A
report by the Association of School and College Leaders published early
this year also highlighted that the pupil premium in its current form
represents an all-or-nothing approach to additional funding. The report
expressed concern about low income families being ineligible for free
school meals and called for greater  
<?notus-xml column=28?>sophistication in the pupil premium policy. No one doubts the clear
benefits of the extra support that the pupil premium offers, but it is
wrong for a significant number of children to lose out, while their
families struggle to stay afloat
financially.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041620000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041620000043">What
is the solution? Help may be at hand. The introduction of universal
credit means that eligibility for free school meals must be revised.
The criteria used to define who receives them will no longer exist and
the system will have to change. We do not know whether or how free
school meals eligibility will be determined with universal credit, but
I hope that Ministers will seize this opportunity to improve both the
entitlement to free school meals and distribution of the pupil premium.
The Children’s Society estimates that if all families receiving
universal credit were entitled to free school meals, registrations
would increase to around 2.7 million with about 900,000 more children
being eligible for the pupil premium than at present. In this financial
year, each pupil premium payment is £900, and spreading 
the same money among more children would dilute the payment, but surely
the rationale should be to extend the benefits of extra support to the
maximum number of children who need it.</hs_Para>

Children’s Society has also calculated that, based on the
2014-15 allocation of some £2.45 billion, a rate of £918
for each child receiving the payment could be maintained, and would
still be a little higher than this year’s figure. I understand
why the Government are keen to see the headline rate of pupil premium
rising, but there is no point ramping it up if many children who should
receive that help miss out on it. Linking the pupil premium to
universal credit would provide a more accurate picture of deprivation,
so ensuring the inclusion of low income families and reflecting income
relative to household need. That would offer greater sophistication and
a more holistic view of family
circumstances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041620000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041620000045">The
flaws of basing the pupil premium on free school meals have not toppled
out by accident, and many of us saw them coming in advance. When all
three political parties started talking about the pupil premium or
something akin to it back in 2008, I immediately received a telephone
call from Devon county council saying, “For goodness sake, flag
up to your colleagues that basing the pupil premium on free school
meals will be a complete disaster and it will miss its target.”
We are rightly proud that we have introduced the pupil premium, but we
must take the opportunity of universal credit  to adjust to
whom it is
targeted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041620000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041620000046">I
hope that I have outlined today the case for change in the distribution
of pupil premium. Using free school meals to target the payment
excludes some of the children most in need of help. Some 1,400 children
in my constituency alone, and many more throughout the country, should
not suffer the consequences of this clumsy and inaccurate measure to
define poverty. Schools with limited resources in some of the
worst-funded areas should not be left to cope with the needs of
deprived children who do not happen to meet the eligibility criteria.
If left to continue in its current form, it will continue to mask
inequalities and worsen the attainment gap. I appeal to my hon. Friend
the Minister to find the best way to envelope free school meals into
universal credit and to ensure fairer and more effective distribution
of pupil premium to all who need

nub of the debate is the right eligibility for the pupil
premium<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T11:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is consensus in the Chamber that it is an unalloyed good policy, and I
think there would also be consensus if a member of the Labour party
were present. There is a good reason for that. The school meals service
extends back to the mid-19th century, and was introduced by charities
to ensure that disadvantaged children had the opportunity to eat at
least one good meal a day. Since then, provision has been broadened to
paid-for and Government-funded meals, but the aim remains of ensuring
that families who struggle to afford to pay for school meals are helped
to do so, not least because healthy meals and good nourishment make it
easier for children to concentrate, and help them to be better behaved
and more able to
learn.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041621000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041621000003">The
key question of how to support free school meals and, through that, how
to support and decide on allocations for the pupil premium is critical.
The debate comes at a good time, as universal credit is introduced in
pilot areas this month and will shortly be in full force. Eligibility
for free school meals and therefore the pupil premium is a live issue
and the Government have not yet announced exactly how that eligibility
will match up, so it is a good time to have this
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041621000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041621000004">We
know that income matters, but the measure of poverty is important. The
relative poverty measures that my hon. Friend the Member for North
Devon mentioned do not in isolation provide an accurate picture of the
experience of poverty in the UK. It is important when talking about
eligibility not to compare raw poverty figures with eligibility because
every measure of poverty is imperfect. Poverty based on relative
poverty—40% of median income—is only one way of measuring
it. For example, the latest figures show that 300,000 children moved
out of poverty, in large part due to a drop in incomes at the top, not
least because of taxation policy. The question of which poverty
measures impact on the ground is therefore critical. An important
consideration is that such measures need to be attuned enough so that
financial allocations can be based on them. As a result, receipt of
welfare of benefits has been seen as a more reliable basis for
identifying disadvantage, not least because it can be proven easily by
parents. Over the years, the list of qualifying benefits for free
school meals has increased to ensure that the children who most need
free school meals are entitled to them.

the reforms to education under this Government. We wish to close the
attainment gap by improving the quality of education through a range of

throughout the country. We in this Chamber agree on that central driver
and on the many reforms that are taking place in order to achieve it.

the past couple of years has gone not only to broaden the eligibility,

concerned, such as those working in the local authority, for that
extremely good rate; in Devon, we have identified only about 300

universal credit includes low-income working families, which is not
currently the case in consideration of free school meals, because those
on working tax credit are excluded, although they will be included in
universal credit. In order to make work pay, universal credit will
ensure that reduction by withdrawal of benefits is done in a way that
does not stop work paying. The case of free school meals, put so
powerfully by my hon. Friend, matters because we have to look at the
marginal withdrawal rate of all state benefits, and the free school
meal is a benefit in kind. We will take that important consideration

directly to other Ministers as well, including the Minister for

pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Dobbin, and to
raise a matter of great concern in schools, colleges and universities
throughout the country. I thank my hon. Friends who have provided so
much support for this debate. Some are here today, but others could not
make it. I initiated this debate on the proposed changes to AS and
A-levels following a letter that I received from the chairman of
Hounslow secondary head teachers and signed by all secondary head
teachers in my constituency. They are baffled and concerned about the
proposed changes announced earlier this
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041622000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041622000005">I
am sure we all want the very best education for the young people of
Britain and the highest levels of participation and attainment possible
for each child. However, I am greatly concerned that the proposals
announced by the Government in January will be a regressive step, with
participation and attainment going backwards. Under the proposals,
A-levels will be linear and taken over two years, with students sitting
exams at the end of the course. AS-levels will apparently remain, but
will be redesigned as a stand-alone qualifications, with a slightly
confused proposal that they could be delivered over one year or two.
AS-levels will not contribute to A-level
grades.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041622000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041622000006">Head

present format, the one year course leading to a more challenging A2
course enables schools to raise standards. A-level students are more
seriously motivated in year 12 when they know that they are going to be
externally examined at the end of the year. In our view we are going to
lose that motivation from students if we have to return to internal

are a success story. According to the Joint

was talking about education reasons. We have seen increased uptake, and
anecdotal evidence suggests that a contribution to the increase in
A-levels being attained has been made by AS-levels being a stepping
stone. Those who choose not to go on to A-levels have an
option to leave at the end of the first year with an advanced
qualification. It has arguably also increased the uptake of subjects
such as maths, which are perceived to be tougher, because of the option
to try a subject and see how it
develops.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041622000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041622000013">There
is a strong argument for social mobility in keeping the current system.
Divorcing AS-levels from A-levels is not only a poor education policy,

to apply to a more highly selective university, helping to widen
participation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041622000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041622000014">The

reason why we cannot have, and indeed do have, tougher modules and
synoptic assessment at the end of A-levels—at the end of

already done. If that opportunity is taken away, we will deprive the
student of choice and bind young people to decisions that they may feel
were wrong. That will leave them with the option of completing work

and too fast with his reforms, and I would again urge caution about
trying to reinvent the educational wheel. Do the Government intend to
turn their back on fair admissions and widening participation? Do they
want people from communities such as mine to get the same opportunities
for higher 
<?notus-xml column=40?>education, or do they really want to revert to higher education for
those from public schools and the most affluent communities, where
young people get a much better start in life than they do in inner city
wards such as those in my constituency? I am sure that that is not
true, but the Secretary of State must realise that just as he got
things badly wrong with his planned reform of GCSEs. He has gone down
the wrong road with A-levels. He has failed to listen to what the
professional world is saying to him, and it is time for another of his

Education. We recently carried out a quite detailed inquiry into what
happened with the changes to GCSE English in 2012. I shall not go into

our young people no favours when we refuse to listen to the voices of
warning. Those voices were crying out to us long before the changes in
2012; we simply did not listen. Because they were not what politicians
wanted to hear, they were ignored. We therefore reached the awful
situation in which hundreds of thousands of young people did exactly
what they were told they needed to do to get the qualifications that
were so important to them, but failed to gain what was promised to

change and reform in the education system—I endorse that view.
We need constant reform and change, not least because, whatever we put
in place, teachers are very clever and will find a way to game it. The
Department must  
<?notus-xml column=41?>constantly move, change and reform. However, we very
often hear the Secretary of State telling us that he believes in the
changes. He talks about his belief, and no one can deny that he has
conviction; but such important changes should be based not on belief
but on evidence, and, so far, whether in the debate or in any of the

the remarks of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T15:25:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North West Durham (Pat Glass), the issue in question is
how we provide a framework to support schools and colleges to get the
best for our young people. Everyone would sign up to that aim; the
dispute is about how. I want to focus on the Government’s
intention to divorce AS-levels from A-levels. Having worked in post-16
education for 30 years, I fear that that would be a very retrograde
step and would do lasting damage to the education of students in key
stage 5. I am not surprised that, as my hon. Friend said,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T15:25:52"></hs_TimeCode>
Government’s extensive consultation showed that 77% of
consultees were against going down that route. The people who were
consulted know what they are talking about. Their responses were driven
by experience and evidence, rather than dogma and
belief<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T15:26:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041635000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041635000003">If
the divorce goes ahead, we are likely to return to the worst aspects of
A-levels prior to 2000: a much narrower curriculum, where a significant
number of students committed to a two-year programme, but came away
with nothing. That was a scandal. Since 2000, there has been much
progress in the right direction. That does not mean, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T15:26:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
said, that there is no need for continued change and reform; it means
that it needs to happen in a framework of stability if we are to get
the best for our young people from what those who work in education can

people are very fluid in their choices. One of the traditional features
of our post-16 education compared with that of some of our most
successful global competitors is its narrowness. Asking a young person
to focus on just three subjects at A-level means they must specialise
early and jettison areas of interest.</hs_Para>

Dakin:</Member></B> It is difficult for us to understand how young
people are at 16, and how much they are exploring their way in the
world. That is a good thing, and one of the things that we should do is
to provide a framework that helps them to make the right choices.
Sometimes, allowing them a little more choice and
flexibility—25% more subjects post-16—enables them to
choose differently according to their experience. At 17, they are much
more mature than at 16. People mature at different rates,
too. I am not surprised by the story about someone taking A-level
English as the fourth choice—English in 
<?notus-xml column=42?>that example could be replaced by any
subject—and at the end of the period of post-16 study going on
to study it, or a subject that it significantly underpins, at
university, or indeed going into employment related to it. That is not
unusual in my experience of working day in, day out, for 30-odd years,
with 16 to 19-year-olds. It has been a familiar story since
2000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T15:29:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_ParaIndent UID="13041635000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041635000111">Before
2000, people did not have that flexibility and choice. The curriculum
was far less able to get the best out of young people. The dramatic
change brought about by Curriculum 2000 allowed youngsters to continue
with a broader programme and delay the final specialisation until the
end of year 12. That meant that those advising students could encourage
them to take more risks—to stick with physics as well as music
alongside their maths and geography, keeping their options open longer,
or encouraging them to do a modern foreign language for another year.
What students would chose to focus on at the end of year 12 was often
different from what they might have focused on at the end of year 11.
People who have not worked with 16 to 18-year-olds, as I have for many
years, might be surprised at how much young people mature in their
first year of post-16 education, and how much their focus can change
after they have been informed by another year’s study and
another year’s consideration of what they intend to do
next.</hs_ParaIndent><hs_Para UID="13041635000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041635000007">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T15:30:17"></hs_TimeCode>

hon. Friend the Member for North West Durham has indicated, and the AS

understanding of the Government’s current plans—and they
are fluid, rather like a young person’s—is that although
they will allow the content of the AS to be within the A-level
initially, they intend, once the change is embedded, that A-levels and
AS-levels will have distinct content, as they did pre-2000. If that is
the case, it will be uneconomical for AS-levels to be taught and they
will wither on the vine, because it will no longer be possible to
co-teach them in the same class as A-levels. That is significant,
because the pre-2000 history of AS-levels shows they never really got
much
traction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T15:31:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041635000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0001.htm#13041635000009">The
removal of AS as a stepping-stone qualification will almost certainly
reduce the uptake of subjects that are regarded as relatively harder at
A-level than at GCSE, and I suspect that there will be an impact on
languages and mathematics in particular. Without validation at the
stepping stone point, less confident students are likely to be
discouraged from embarking on the A-level. With validation, there is
less risk to the individual, who can always bank an AS at the end of
one year and focus on their other three subjects at
A-level<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T15:32:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041635000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041635000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Damian Hinds" PimsId="5583" UID="13041635000131" xid="1059" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041635000131">Damian

Dakin:</Member></B> For a start, when we are dealing with young people,
we are dealing with a collection of individual choices. In my
experience, as someone who has spent  a lot of time advising
young people and encouraging them to make choices, if they are focusing
on three subjects, languages are often vulnerable to not being tried.
What turns out to be someone’s fourth subject—the one
they drop down to AS—might not have been their fourth subject
when they picked it. We can play around with statistics, but what is
important is the impact on the young person at the point of choice,
when they decide on their post-16 programme. Being able to do four
AS-levels and then either take all four through to full A-levels or to
bank one, increases the flexibility of choice, minimises risk and
encourages people to take subjects that would be beneficial to
them—mathematics<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T15:33:51"></hs_TimeCode>,

lies the real risk. My fear is that we have series  of
changes—and divorcing the AS from the A-level is a significant
one—that will increase student failure and make the UK less
ready to compete globally. We will rue the day if the Government do not
think carefully and consider the evidence that is presented to them.

UK has drawn attention to the importance of AS-level grades as criteria
in the admissions process, and stated that that is particularly
important for the most selective institutions and for courses with a
large proportion of applicants with very similar predicted A-level
grades, which is a practical reason for AS-levels to remain. It has
concerns about the impact on widening participation, both because
without AS-level grades an increased emphasis on more subjective
measures is likely—such as predicted grades and school
references that might disadvantage some applicant groups—and
because AS-level grades can boost confidence in candidates from low
participation backgrounds. I have certainly seen the impact of grades
boosting confidence and aspiration at the end of the first year, so I
think that Universities UK is on to something. It also thinks that the
removal of AS-levels as a stepping stone towards full A-levels may
result in students being less likely to take risks with subjects that
are perceived to be hard. It lists sciences, in addition to languages
and maths, which I have already mentioned, so it is on the same

Cambridge has been the university that has most used AS-levels to bring
about widening access. It can show that it has widened access as a
result of them in the past 10 years. If he wants to challenge the
admissions tutors on the claim that they have successfully widened
access through the use of AS-levels, he is free to do so. They are
absolutely clear about it and say that if AS-levels disappear,
university entry will become less fair. The Minister must answer that
point. So far, Ministers have failed to answer it, or to explain why
they are persisting with the policy.</hs_Para>

AS-levels from A-levels. Like the EBacc certificates, no one supports
the move. The Government quite rightly abandoned their proposals on the

multiple re-sitting of those papers, so a student might sit some papers

re-sit them in June and again the following year, while sitting and
then re-sitting their A2 papers. In 2010, 74% of maths A-level students

examinations taking place at the end of the two-year course. Linear
A-levels will free up time for teachers to focus on what teachers do
best, which is providing high-quality teaching, developing their

those who may have had less support at school and home to develop
independent study skills. A two-year course will allow all students
progressively to develop the skills they need to be successful at
university and to demonstrate their abilities through exams at the end
of two years. We will also do more to target high-achieving sixth

earlier on, which is the critical stage for delivering the social
mobility that the hon. Lady and I want, it should be perfectly possible
for universities to make such judgments without a loss from the removal
of the AS-level. Some universities may have to adjust how they handle
admissions. A-levels, however, are not simply mechanisms to help
universities to sort students. The most important priority is to
develop A-levels that secure the best possible educational outcomes for
young people. Earlier, the shadow Minister said that A-levels are not
simply to be structured around the needs of university access. They
form a far wider purpose than
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T16:22:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041635000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041635000107">It
will continue to be as important as ever that students from all
backgrounds have the information they need to make the right choices
about higher education based on teachers’ assessments of their

must be high quality, and they must change over time to keep up with
world standards. Universities, the bodies that once set up examination
boards themselves, are not as core a part of the process of
qualification development as they once were. A good way for A-levels to
keep up with the challenges of the global marketplace in qualifications
is to respond to what universities are looking for. Independent

believe that losing touch with universities has meant that A-levels
have not always been a suitable preparation for those embarking on
degrees in some subjects. Indeed, many private schools offer different 
<?notus-xml column=57?>courses, such as sixth-term examination papers and the Cambridge pre-U,
for those purposes. A-level reform is vital to ensure that all
students, whether in the state sector or the private sector, have the
best possible skills and knowledge to enable them to compete
effectively.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T16:24:32"></hs_TimeCode> is why the
Government are giving universities a greater role in the development of
A-levels. Awarding organisations will work with universities to
determine the content of the new A-levels, and we are delighted that
the Russell Group will be part of that. We also welcome contributions
from other universities, as a number of hon. Members have indicated. We
expect that the first new A-levels will be developed for teaching to
begin in September 2015, with the first exams to be sat in 2017. Each

to other nations, most notably Egypt and Syria. Although we are all
aware of the wider security and humanitarian crisis in Syria, there is
a very real, but less publicly acknowledged threat to Christians.
Jihadists have reportedly infiltrated the rebel movement, and tens of
thousands of Christians have fled as a result. As one of the
Governments involved in both Iraq and Syria, the UK Government must
recognise that exodus and work with others in the international

will take the form of a “squeeze”, with pressure being
applied, while in others it is in the form of “smash”,
with recourse to violence. However, either kind represents a denial of

pressure, where there is no physical violence, but pressure is applied
to prevent Christians from being able to freely express their beliefs,
has increasingly become the main form of abuse. It is much harder to

pressure from within the family, with divorce and death threats common

protects the freedom collectively to express faith without

often used as part of a divide and conquer strategy. However, since
that regime ended, there has been a resurgence of more radical Islamist

are the largest religious minority in Egypt, but other minority faith
groups such as Baha’is and Jews, as well as Muslim minorities

communities face bureaucratic hurdles when trying to build churches;
there is no mechanism to allow citizens to change their religion to
anything other than Islam; and representation of Christians in state
institutions and Government bodies is negligible, and, at the highest
levels, absent. Since the uprising and the subsequent political and
social unrest, Christians have increasingly witnessed the violation of
their freedoms and face intensified threats to their peace and
security. These incidents include the burning and attacking of
churches, the kidnapping of Christian girls, and attacks on peaceful
marches, resulting in the loss of innocent

one of the most significant incidents, 28 peaceful demonstrators at
Maspero were killed in October 2011. Most recently, the Coptic Orthodox
patriarchate and the main Christian cathedral in Cairo were attacked by
mobs and, disturbingly, the police were seen to do little, if anything,
either to stop the violence or to bring those responsible to justice.
That incident is disturbing, not only because it is indicative of the
rise in violent attacks on Christians, but because it demonstrates the
continuing lack of will shown by the authorities to deliver fair and
equal treatment under the law, not only to Egypt’s Christians,
but to other minority faith groups. If the main cathedral can be
attacked with apparent impunity, it prompts the question: what Church
or individual is safe?</hs_Para>

I would like briefly to reference the 2012 edition of the annual human

affirmation of the right to freedom of belief, including the right to
share, change and teach others about one’s faith. I also think
that the restatement by the Foreign Secretary that such rights are not
merely western constructs but are universal is important and bears

is concern, however, that the sections on Somalia and Yemen make no
mention of religious freedom, implying that this is not a major human
rights concern in those countries, yet in both there is considerable
evidence of the persecution of Christians and, in particular, of
converts to Christianity. Similarly, the entries on religious freedom
for Sudan and Eritrea appear to be weak. Perhaps the Minister will be
able to reflect on those matters in his

closing, the right to have a faith and to practise that faith, both in
private and in community with others, and to change one’s faith
and not be disadvantaged or endangered for reason of one’s
beliefs, are basic and fundamental human rights that should apply
universally. These are also rights that, although established in
international law, remain under threat at national or local level.
Where religious freedom is diminished, it is often accompanied by a
generally unfavourable approach to the protection of other human rights
and a lack of adherence to the rule of law and equal access to justice
for all citizens, with wider implications for society.</hs_Para>

300,000 Christians in Syria. Will the Minister consider contacting the
UN refugee agency to put forward our case that those Christians are not
receiving the aid that they should receive through the UN or the Red
Cross because they are Christians? They want to be neutral in the
Syrian conflict and are persecuted as a

Sturdy</B> (York Outer) (Con):</Member> It is a privilege,  Mr
Dobbin, to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon for what I
think is the first time. It is also a privilege to debate the important
issue of nursery funding. As all parents, grandparents, foster carers
and indeed anyone involved with young children know, child care funding
has been a contentious issue for some years. Indeed, over the past few
years, the price of child care has risen by more than twice the rate of
inflation, despite average earnings falling back to 2003
levels.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000003">As
ever, a quick glance at the relevant evidence illustrates the sheer
scale of the problems faced by our nurseries, not only in my patch in
York, but throughout the country. More than 600,000 children use the
15,000 nurseries in the UK, 80% of which are in the private,
voluntary and independent sector, employing more than
200,000 people. However, occupancy in nurseries has fallen to 71% as
parents continue to struggle to pay their child care costs.
That in turn leaves nurseries struggling to survive as local
businesses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000004">One
of the main reasons for the continuing rise in child care costs is
nursery providers having to cross-subsidise the Government’s
free entitlement funding. They do so by increasing the fees they charge
to families outside the free hours and to those not eligible for
funding. The Government are the biggest procurer of nursery places, but
they are, alas, among the worst culprits when it comes to paying for
the places they procure. The National Day Nurseries Association is a
charity that represents children’s day nurseries throughout the
UK, and recently announced that 84% of nurseries claim that the funding
they receive does not cover their operational costs. That is worrying.
In fact, the average shortfall for free entitlement hours is around
£547 per child per year, which is a substantial amount in
total.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000005">It
is important to highlight the fact that local nurseries are also local
businesses and, like every other business, they need sufficient cash
flow at all times to keep going. It is already apparent that the status
quo represents a serious problem and is extremely unfair not only for
nurseries that are struggling to cover the cost of the so-called free
entitlement, but for families who are being forced to pay increased
child care prices to subsidise the Government’s free
places.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000006">Before
I go further, I am sure that all hon. Members in the Chamber agree that
child care is extremely important and offers families, especially
women, the opportunity to resume their career after having children, a
choice that is welcomed by some and, unfortunately, a necessity for
many. Quality child care can make a significant difference to
children’s development, instilling many important qualities such
as communication among their peers, independence away from their
parents, and learning to interact
positively.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000007">Sadly
however, much of the debate about child care provision focuses on cost,
which has had an increasingly negative impact on parents, with many
believing that child care is simply too expensive, ruling out the
option of returning to work or building a career.
Since<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:00:24"></hs_TimeCode>
my election to Parliament in 2010, I have had the privilege
of visiting a number of local nurseries in my constituency, such as, to
name a few, Little Green Rascals near Elvington, 
<?notus-xml column=68?>Sunshine Day nursery in Huntington and Tiddlywinks in Osbaldwick. I must
also mention an excellent visit to Polly Anna’s nursery in
Haxby. Having met, on several occasions, the owner of Polly
Anna’s, and having talked at length with the owners of the other
three excellent nurseries that I mentioned, it is absolutely clear to
me that the tremendous work that is carried out across York’s
nurseries—I assume that that is exactly the same across the
country—is increasingly under threat as a direct result of
funding issues.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041640000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000008"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:00:30"></hs_TimeCode>The
shortfall in funding is due, first, to the free entitlement funding
provided by the Government. Free entitlement consists of 15 hours a
week for 38 weeks of the year and is funded through the dedicated
schools grant, with an estimated total spend of £1.9 million a
year. However, there is great disparity across the country in how much
is spent on child care by individual local authorities, and therein
lies a big part of the problem.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:02:03"></hs_TimeCode> National
Audit Office found that free entitlement varied from £2.78 to
£5.18 an hour, with the national average placed at £3.95
by each local authority. My constituency receives only £3.38 an
hour from the City of York council. I have had many discussions with
the council about that figure, but sadly, to no
avail.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:01:24"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041640000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000009">With<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:02:03"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:01:40"></hs_TimeCode>
regards to the extension of free entitlement to disadvantaged
two-year-olds, the Department for Education announced an average
funding rate of £5.09 an hour to try and counteract the
disparity, but that has unfortunately only led local authorities that
were funding more to immediately reduce their rates in an apparent race
to the bottom.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:02:03"></hs_TimeCode> appreciate
that local authorities need to be held directly accountable for their
decisions, but I would be grateful for the Minister’s views on
local authorities that seek to spend the bare minimum on nursery
funding. The sad truth of the matter is that many child care providers
receive low levels of funding for every child under the
Government’s free entitlement scheme, which results in nurseries
running at a loss. Therefore, they have to increase the price of child
care outside the free entitlement hours and of child care for those to
whom the free entitlement is not applicable to make up for the
shortfall. They cannot charge at the moment for any top-up on those 15
free hours to bring it back to break-even levels.</hs_Para>

Under-Secretary of State for Education, my hon. Friend the hon. Member
for South West Norfolk (Elizabeth Truss), who has responsibility for
child care, released her report “More great childcare” on
29 January. The report sets out her plan of action on how the
Government will achieve their vision of an exceptional child care
market that consistently delivers high-quality early years
education—a noble ambition. However, although the report has
produced some good ideas on child care funding, it is mainly concerned
with reducing bureaucracy, rather than tackling hard financial
problems. Changing the staff-to-child ratio is another welcome
proposal, and those steps will ultimately result in a more efficient
and more respected early years sector. However, I believe that the
proposals could go further.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041640000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000011"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:03:19"></hs_TimeCode>Considering
that staff costs, on average, are at least 70% of the running costs of
nurseries, there is real concern that any savings that could be made
through the staff-to-child ratio will go towards increasing staff pay
and training. To my mind, that is completely 
<?notus-xml column=69?>understandable and the right thing to do. Nurseries must invest in their
staff; by doing so, they are investing in their businesses, because the
nursery staff are their business. However, that does not solve the
problem of child care costs. Currently, only one in three nurseries
break even, which is a serious problem that is likely to get
worse.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:04:03"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

laying the blame for such a situation at the door of the coalition
Government would be short-sighted. In the past 12 years, the value of
free entitlement per hour has increased by approximately 33%, while at
the same time, minimum wages have increased by at least double that.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:04:17"></hs_TimeCode>With an industry
that has such high staff costs, that lack of funding has been keenly
felt, so it is my hope that today’s debate will conclude with
the Minister proceeding to urge the Government to review their current
funding sooner rather than
later<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:04:22"></hs_TimeCode>. In an
ideal world, that would enable nurseries to stop increasing the price
of child care for those outside the free 15 hours and also
to children not eligible for the entitlement.</hs_Para>

however, that the Government cannot afford to tackle every issue and
reduce the vast deficit simultaneously. I understand the financial
situation, the struggles of the Government, and the difficult decisions
that they must make. Nevertheless, I strongly believe that ignoring the
problem will only result in the price of child care increasing further.
It could even be argued that the status quo will adversely affect the
wider economy over the longer term. After all, although the Government
provide significant public funding in recognition of the value of child
care, complicated and inefficient funding mechanisms are often used
that result in much of the funding not reaching the providers, and
therefore, families are unaware of their entitlement.</hs_Para>

top of that, occupancy in nurseries has fallen to 71%, as parents can
no longer afford to keep their children in early years education for
long periods of time. If local authorities fail to cough up adequate
funding from central Government, there is a real danger that nurseries
will continue to suffer from under-occupancy, leading to closures and
creating local unemployment. In the two years leading up to September
2011, official figures highlight the fact that more than 700 nurseries
have closed. I fear that the Treasury will lose out over the long term
if it fails to work with the Minister’s Department to rectify
the funding deficit now.</hs_Para>

have discussed the idea of more funding for free entitlement places.
However, I have also touched on the possibility of altering the
allocation of such funding, which could involve, at little extra cost,
the removal of local authorities as the middlemen in the funding
entitlement. That is an important point to bear in mind, because
nurseries up and down the country understand that the Government cannot
just throw money at the sector. We are living in hard economic times.
However, as I have previously stated, I believe that the cost of doing
nothing will be far greater.</hs_Para>

still several problems, however, when it comes to distributing the free
entitlement to the
providers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:07:25"></hs_TimeCode>. For
instance, a lot of fraud and error still exists in the tax credit
system, with £265 million being lost from the child care element
of working tax credit. Many nurseries are also not informed if parents
are in receipt of the child care element of working tax credit, which
means that levels of parental debt are increasing, as the designated
funding is not passed on. One nursery in my constituency has told me
that its level of bad debt has gone up ninefold this year, and sadly
for many, that is unsustainable. Consequently, direct funding to the
provider could solve a number of problems, and I would be interested in
the Minister’s views on that.</hs_Para>

the purpose of today’s debate was to raise the issue of nursery
funding with the Minister and hopefully manage to strike a chord.
However, I will finish by asking whether the Minister or his colleague
will meet me and some local nursery representatives from York to
discuss the issue that they face directly. It is important that the
Department hears directly from the nurseries that are so affected at
the moment—as I say, the purpose of such a meeting would be to
discuss the problems surrounding nursery funding. I hope that through
this speech I have managed to convince the Minister to review the
existing funding system and arrangements from the perspective of the
nurseries, in relation to child care and the long-term sustainability
of our nurseries, not only in York, but across the
country.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_16_PT_1/5D85E5783D2FFD60123D64C0BAA65D9296EB8602" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="16 April 2013">Tuesday

As my hon. Friend the Member for York Outer mentioned, the Government
published that document
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:11:55"></hs_TimeCode> January. It
sets out an ambitious vision for child care and early education to
ensure that we provide the best start for young children and help those
parents who want to go into employment to have the child care that they
need in a flexible and affordable
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:12:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000024">The
vision is to create a dynamic and thriving child care sector in which
the emphasis is firmly on quality and which draws upon international
evidence of what works best. “More great childcare” is
clear that, to achieve that vision, we need a child care profession
that attracts the best possible staff to work in it and to lead it.
Those people should have a passion for what they do, but, importantly,
they must also be highly trained and highly qualified, which has not
always been the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:12:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000025">We
need to give providers the flexibility that they need to deliver the
best for children and, by doing so, create more affordable,
better-quality early education and care, which will help children and
ensure that parents can feel confident about returning to work.
Alongside that, we are working with Ofsted, as my hon. Friend will
know, to create a system of regulation and inspection that has high
expectations of quality and that ensures that the quality improvements
that the Government aspire to are delivered on the
ground<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:13:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000026">We

of early learning on children, not least those from disadvantaged
backgrounds, for whom early intervention is particularly important. We
need to improve the effectiveness of those who work every day with
young children to build a stronger, more professional work force,

great childcare” also explained how the Government propose to
reform funding for early education. The high-level objectives are
clear: simplification, greater transparency and ensuring that as much
funding as possible reaches the front line. The responsibility for
distributing early education funding rests, of course, with local
authorities, which should know their local child care markets. Most
visibly for nurseries, that role means setting hourly rates through the
early years single funding
formula<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:14:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000028">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:14:28"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend also highlighted a weakness in the early education funding
system—the lack of transparency. Some providers have concerns
that local authorities do not always pass on enough of the funding that
they receive from Government, but, by extension, they find the funding
system hard to understand. In too many 
<?notus-xml column=72?>cases, they do not know what funding decisions local authorities
reach—I am talking about many of the people
in their areas. Given how providers are affected by those decisions,
that cannot be right, so the Government are changing it through the
reforms that we have
announced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000029">Working<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:15:05"></hs_TimeCode>
with a number of provider groups, the Department now publishes
financial benchmarking data annually. Those data show simply and
clearly the funding decisions taken by local authorities across the
country. Importantly, too, the data enable providers to compare
decisions across local areas. A system of effective local decision
making relies on active local accountability, and we are giving
providers the information that they need to exercise that
accountability. However, we want to go further, and the recent
two-year-olds early education funding allocation shows how that might
be
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:15:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000030">As

Laws:</Member></B> The Government are expanding early education to
two-year-olds, particularly focusing on lower-income households. That
starts with the most disadvantaged 20% of two-year-olds—about
130,000 children—in September this year. From September 2014, it
will be extended to 40% of children—260,000 in total. That
ambition is matched by significant new investment. National funding to
support the initiative will reach £760 million in 2014-15. The
Government also allocated £100 million of capital funding to
local authorities in November last year to support delivery of the new
entitlement. That real opportunity for providers will inject a great
deal more money into the child care
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000034">Funding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:25:03"></hs_TimeCode>
for two-year-olds is not encumbered by the complexities and historical
problems that affect schools more widely and early years funding. The
new two-year-olds entitlement has enabled the Government to put into
practice their ambitions for transparency and simplicity in early
education funding. In November last year, the Government allocated the
first £525 million to local authorities for two-year-olds early
education in 2013-14. For the first time, the Department was able to
publish details of how much every local authority is allocated. It
could point to an average national hourly rate that underpinned the
allocations. That hourly rate should translate into attractive rates
for providers locally. The national average rate of £5.09 per
hour compares favourably with the £4.13 that the Daycare Trust
found in its 2012 child care costs survey, which providers are charging
parents per hour. In fact, £5.09 still compares favourably to
the £4.26 per hour in its recently published 2013
survey.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000035">I

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:26:10"></hs_TimeCode>say that there
was evidence that some local authorities might not be funding properly
at the full rate. The Government were clear that they wanted local
authorities to pass on the new two-year-olds funding in full at the
hourly rate. The Department does not recognise the problem of local
authorities not passing on the rate in full, but we
will  
<?notus-xml column=73?>collect data on the hourly rates and publish them as soon as possible,
and the point that he made today will reinforce that. It will enable
providers and others to see exactly what rates local authorities are
funding at and to challenge local authorities where there is a
discrepancy between the rates that we are funding at nationally and the
rates on the ground. If he has any further evidence on that from his
area, we would be delighted to see it.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend explained with great clarity the concern of many nurseries
that local authorities hold back too much of the funding allocated by
Government. In 2012-13, the latest year for which we have data, local
authorities retained centrally £160 million out of total
dedicated schools grant spending of £2.1 billion. That masked
great variations, however, with many retaining little or nothing. Let
me be clear: some central spending by local authorities is important
in, and indeed critical to, delivering the Government’s vision
of early education transforming the life chances of many children.
Central spending is often used to purchase, for example, specialist
help for providers working with children with special educational needs
or other additional educational needs to help them to access early
education. Such spending is frequently welcomed by providers and must
continue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000037">Equally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:09:59"></hs_TimeCode>,
in the current economic climate, we must ensure that every penny is
being used effectively. For 2013-14, we introduced, for the first time,
the requirement that local authorities must secure schools forum
approval for centrally retained early years spending. That gives power
back to local providers, but we want to go
further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000038">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:25:03"></hs_TimeCode>
my hon. Friend knows, the Government are consulting on reforming the
local authority role in free early education. In that consultation, the
Government 
<?notus-xml column=74?>propose two reforms to how local authorities retain funding. First, we
propose a new definition specifying what authorities can and cannot
retain funding for. In “More great childcare”, the
Government were clear that the role of local authorities in early
education should be refocused on tackling disadvantage to ensure that
all children can experience high-quality early education.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:29:06"></hs_TimeCode> other areas,
the local authority role should be more limited. For example, the
Government want Ofsted to be the sole arbiter of quality in early
years, rather than replicating the job that local authorities have done
in the
past.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000039">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:29:15"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:09:59"></hs_TimeCode>,
we are seeking views on percentage limits on how much of their early
years budget authorities may retain for those purposes. We will take
into account fully the views of providers responding to the
consultation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-16T17:29:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041640000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/halltext/130416h0002.htm#13041640000040">The
Government also want a simple and clear funding offer, so that
nurseries know and understand the funding that they receive and
bureaucracy is kept to an absolute minimum. We are consulting on
proposals to simplify and rationalise the early years single funding
formula. From that, I am confident that we will put in place changes to
introduce a simpler and less burdensome system of funding. I have
already touched on the complexities and historical problems of early
education funding for three and four-year-olds. The changes will
resolve those problems.

also therefore incorrectly reported the percentage of nappies processed

error was due to the figures being calculated using an incorrect

correct estimated average weight of 230 grams per used nappy, the
average number of nappies processed at Knowaste was 25.7
million between 11 September 2011 and 31 March 2012. Using this same

loans from 2% to 3% per month, supporting credit unions to achieve
financial sustainability and reach a wider range of customers. The
consultation period is now complete and HM Treasury is considering the

give careful consideration to the planning merits of the case, having
regard to existing Local Plan policies, national planning policy and
other material considerations. The Inspector will visit the site to
familiarise themselves with the location and its surroundings. They
will weigh all the arguments and evidence presented by the parties very
carefully, consider the likely effect of the proposed development on
the surrounding area, and take into account the views of the local
planning authority and local residents before reaching a decision to
allow or dismiss an appeal. While Planning Inspectors may decide to
uphold appeals, this does not mean that they have disregarded the views
of the local authority or local residents—rather that they have
attributed different weight to the issues in coming to their
decision.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Writtens" ColStart="175"><?date 2013-04-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_16_PT_1/18BE2B38E6F732B89BC1B85AA557DB9DDA663A99" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="15 April 2013">Monday

where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but
unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed.

(Electrical safety—Dwellings), which was amended on 6 April,
calls for all electrical installation work in homes to follow the rules
in the British Standard BS 7671 (the IET Wiring Regulations). However,

of certification, which may provide a greater incentive for DIYers to
have their work properly inspected and
tested.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13041657000006" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0009.htm#13041657000006">Empty

sanctions. However, we continue to collect management information to
support the consistent application of the rules across the Jobcentre

conditionality that all jobseeker's allowance claimants are subject to.

Hoban:</Member></B> Where benefit entitlement terminates or a benefit
award is reduced because of a failure to attend an appointment, the
appeals process is as follows. The decision notification tells the
claimant that they can appeal against the decision. If the claimant
wishes to appeal, then he must write to the Department for Work and
Pensions identifying the decision he is appealing against and giving
his reason(s) for disagreeing with it; he has one month, extendable in
certain circumstances by 12, to make this
appeal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041657000759" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0010.htm#13041657000759">A
decision maker will first consider whether the reason given provides
grounds for changing (that is, revising) the decision; if not the
appeal will be processed. This involves the Department providing a
written response—an explanation of the reasons for the
decision—to Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service,
who administer appeal hearings, and the claimant (and their
representative, should they have one). The claimant is then given the
option of an oral or paper hearing. The decision of the tribunal can be
further appealed to the Upper Tribunal on a point of
law.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13041657000056" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130415/text/130415w0010.htm#13041657000056">Social

classification of each educational establishment can change from cycle
to cycle, which can affect year-on-year comparisons. A large number of
grammar schools have converted to academies since 2010. While these
schools have retained their selective admissions arrangements they are
no longer classified as grammar schools in this data. Therefore, while
the figures show the number of applicants from grammar schools has
fallen over the past two years, this is largely as a result of the
classification
change.</hs_Para><TableWrapper Columns="1" Size="8"><table tabstyle="headft"><tgroup cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="22*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="16*"></colspec><colspec colname="3" colwidth="16*"></colspec><colspec colname="4" colwidth="16*"></colspec><colspec colname="5" colwidth="16*"></colspec><colspec colname="6" colwidth="16*"></colspec><thead><row><entry nameend="6" namest="1" rowsep="1"><hs_TableTitle Justify="centre"><I>UK

identified opportunities for greater efficiency from relocating
facilities rather than investing in the infrastructure at Ashchurch.

the size of the company, which determines the tax rate to be applied,

profits between the lower and upper limits, to enable a smooth

Baker:</Member></B> The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) was
introduced in 2008 as a scheme to reduce carbon emissions and promote
the supply of sustainable biofuels. The volume of biofuel supplied in
the UK has increased from 1,284 million litres in its first year
(2008/09) to 1,635 million litres in obligation year 4
(2011/12).</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304171000669" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/text/130416w0001.htm#1304171000669">Amendments
to the RTFO in December 2011 ensured that only biofuels meeting
mandatory sustainability criteria are eligible for Renewable Transport
Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) and provided extra support to waste-derived
biofuels through the award of two RTFCs per litre of waste-derived
biofuel. This recognises that waste-derived biofuel feedstocks tend to
have both higher greenhouse gas savings and less risk of indirect
effects. Since December 2011 data reported to the RTFO Administrator
suggests that more than 85% of biodiesel made from UK feedstock has
been produced from waste and eligible for double
certificates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304171000670" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/text/130416w0001.htm#1304171000670">Later

Grant:</Member></B> Blacklisting of individuals is likely to represent
a breach in the use of their personal data under the Data Protection
Act 1998 (DPA). The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is the
independent regulatory body responsible for enforcing the DPA in the
UK. In 2008, the ICO began an investigation into the Consulting
Association which uncovered a blacklist of construction workers used by
construction companies. In 2009, the company and the blacklist were
closed down and Ian Kerr, the founder of the list, was fined
£5,000 for failing to notify as a data controller under the DPA.
The ICO also issued enforcement notices against companies proven to
have used and supplied information to the list demanding that they stop
the practice. Since April 2010, the ICO has had the power to issue a
Civil Monetary Penalty (CMP) of up to £500,000 for serious
breaches of the data protection principles in the DPA. Details of CMPs
issued by the ICO can be found on its website at the following

would be inappropriate for the Government to comment on the ICO's
handling of any particular case. That said, I understand that the ICO
found no evidence whatsoever that any blacklists existed in other
industries, or that the number of individuals blacklisted went 
<?notus-xml column=317?>beyond those in the files secured. However, any evidence of blacklisting
since the original investigation should be supplied to the ICO so that
they can decide whether there are grounds for an investigation.
Additionally, any individual can check whether they may have been on
the Consulting Association blacklist by contacting the ICO's fast track
service helpline on 0303 123 1113 between 9 am and 5 pm, Monday to

Soubry:</Member></B> The majority of cardiac arrests,
possibly, as many as 80%, happen outside hospital and occur in the
home. Therefore, to improve survival rates, more people need to be
trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The Cardiovascular
Disease outcomes strategy published earlier this month highlighted this
and the need for the wider availability of defibrillators. The NHS
Commissioning Board will work with the Resuscitation Council, the
British Heart Foundation and others to promote mapping/registration of
defibrillators and to consider ways of increasing the numbers trained
in both CPR and use of defibrillators.</hs_Para>

creatinine (to assess kidney function) and cholesterol, eye
examinations, foot examinations and assessment of smoking status. It is

competent authority for food safety and has a statutory function under
the Food Standards Art 1999 to protect public health and consumers'
other interests in relation to food and drink. The majority of food law
enforcement is delegated to local authorities throughout the United
Kingdom who carry out checks of all food businesses in their area to
ensure compliance with food safety/traceability and labelling
requirements. Local authority food sampling responsibilities are set
out in the statutory Food Law Code of Practice (separate parallel Codes
of Practice exist for each of the four UK countries), as part of which
they are required to develop an annual sampling programme for their
area and provide the resources necessary to carry it
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304174000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/text/130416w0002.htm#1304174000215">The

Insult to Injury”, published in 2009 by the National
Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCPOD), made a
number of recommendations to improve the clinical care of people with
acute kidney injury (AKI). In response to the report; the Department
asked the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to

<?notus-xml column=342?>quality of the clinical data that is being submitted through the Mental
Health Minimum Data Set, as well as the costing of the new currencies
before a national tariff can be considered. NHS England and Monitor are

how quickly to move to a national tariff for mental health

Premium was introduced in April 2011. Pupil Premium funding is provided
to schools which have on roll pupils known to be eligible for free
school meals (the Deprivation Premium); children in care who have been
continuously looked after for at least six months (the Looked After
Child Premium); and children whose parents are serving in the armed
forces (the Service Child
Premium).</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304174001037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/text/130416w0003.htm#1304174001037">In
the financial year 2011-12, 3,340 pupils attending schools in Kingston
upon Hull North constituency area were eligible for the Deprivation
Premium or Service Child Premium, attracting £1.623 million. It
is not possible to identify, at constituency level, the number of
pupils eligible for the Looked After Child Premium or the number of
pupils eligible for the Deprivation Premium in Alternative Provision

financial year 2012-13, eligibility for the Pupil Premium was extended
to include those eligible for FSM at any point in the last six years.
This had the effect of increasing the number of pupils in Kingston upon
Hull North constituency eligible for the Deprivation Premium or Service
Child Premium to 4,680, attracting £2.906
million.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304174001039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/text/130416w0003.htm#1304174001039">In

billion to £1.875 billion per year. This will enable the level
of funding for the Deprivation and Looked After Child Premium to
increase to £900 per pupil and the Service Child Premium to
increase to £300 per pupil. Final allocations for 2013-14 are
not yet available. Illustrative Pupil Premium allocations using January
2012 pupil numbers show that Kingston upon Hull North constituency will
receive approximately £4.196 million of Pupil Premium funding in

absence (December 2012) show 4.5 average working days lost (AWDL) per
staff year, down from 8.7 AWDL in December 2009. Notional costs of
absence in 2012 amounted to circa £1.9 million, equalling
approximately 1.4% of the Department's total paybill costs. The
Department's level of sickness absence is significantly lower than
civil service averages (7.6 AWDL per staff year), and a private sector
average of 5.7 days per person according to the CIPD and 5.9 days per
person according to the CBI. Figures for AWDL in the last five years

Minister's policy responsibilities, or when a Lords question falls
within a Commons Minister's responsibilities. It may also happen when a
