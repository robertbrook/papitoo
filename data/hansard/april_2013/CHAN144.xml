countries on these matters can be ponderous and slow, but when it is
successful, it is of enormous importance. Those are the downside and
the upside of circumstances in which competence lies with the European
Union. When it works, it works well. The free trade agreement with
South Korea eliminated nearly 97% of tariffs, and some British
businesses are now enjoying a huge increase in exports to South Korea
as a result. We want to see the same thing happen on an even greater

is important, particularly as many of our allies, such as Japan, the

embassy is important and the small staff there do a great job. We were

the oil now flowing between and through South Sudan and Sudan creates
the opportunity for economic stability, development and growth in the
southern part of Sudan, so the Government of South Sudan will have to
have additional capacity to deal with the income that will, I hope,
flow into the South Sudanese exchequer. Support is provided by the

whatever country, Sri Lanka will be in the spotlight. The progress that

us and make our calculations upon it. We have expressed concern about
incidents of torture. Our asylum processes take account of the
possibility that some people, but not all, could be subject to torture.
Cases are dealt with on an individual basis. Part of the overall
picture of human rights concerns in Sri Lanka is that the Government
appear to be determined to address the issue, but the evidence remains

chemical weapons and any involvement

the UK. I mentioned earlier that it has paraded, but not yet tested, a
12,000 km-range missile. Looking decades ahead, as we do with these

a country, we have a long and proud history of providing support and
sanctuary to those who arrive on our shores fleeing persecution and
war. I believe, however, that we are now in danger of falling short of
the standards that our reputation leads people to expect. Last year, I
chaired a cross-party inquiry into the experiences of children and
young people in the asylum system. The panel received evidence in
writing and in person from about 200 individuals and organisations:
from local authorities, from academics, from those working on the front
line with asylum seekers, and from the young people and their families
themselves. What we heard about the hardship that they endure really
shocked the panel.</hs_Para>

is a popular myth that asylum seekers enjoy undeserved riches, gaining
access to high-class housing and easy finance that their indigenous
neighbours could only dream about. It is just that, however: a myth. In
fact, families told us stories of unimaginable difficulty, loneliness
and poverty, of going without meals to pay for their children’s
clothes, of poor housing and of victimisation. Contrary to the popular
cliché, benefits for those in the asylum system have caused
people to fall way below the poverty line in recent years, with some
surviving on as little as £5 a day.</hs_Para>

problem with the current system is that decisions about whether to
uprate the levels of benefit known as section 95 and section 4 support
are effectively a matter for the Home Secretary alone. Representations
from other Government Departments about the impact on children’s
welfare can be, and often are, ignored. There is no
requirement for the Home Secretary to come to the House regularly to
report on or explain her decisions. As a consequence, no
decision was made in the last financial year on whether to uprate
section 4 and section 95 levels, leaving them effectively
frozen since April 2011. The House rightly expects to have a say on
setting the support levels for mainstream benefits, and the same should
apply in these cases.</hs_Para>

is a problem not just for the present Government. Successive
Governments have let the levels drift, fearful of headlines relating to
what is actually a tiny number of people and, in the context of
budgetary pressures, a tiny amount of money. Levels for section 95
support were originally pegged by the Labour Government at 90% of
income support levels, before being reduced to 70% after deductions for
utility bills paid for in provided accommodation.</hs_Para>

but not all, benefits for children continue to be pegged at a
favourable level in relation to income support levels. Levels for 16
and 17-year-olds, for example, are arbitrarily reduced. No account is
taken of the disability of any children who might arrive with complex
needs. In any case, the downward drift in the value of adult benefits
means that families as a whole are often trying to manage on benefit
levels of as little as 60% or 65% of income support levels, in spite of
all the data showing that 70% is the bare minimum to avoid absolute
poverty, and in spite of the fact that many families arrive on our
shores with little more than the clothes on their backs.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T12:43:43"></hs_TimeCode>life is tough on
section 95 support, life on section 4 support entails devastating
hardship. Section 4 support is provided to those whose asylum claims do
not meet the strict requirements for refugee status but who might not
be able to go home, when the Government recognise that that is the
case. The levels are significantly lower than the section 95 levels.
This is well illustrated by the way in which we support families who
have a new baby. Someone on income support would be eligible for a
£500 maternity grant. Someone on section 95 support would be
eligible to receive £300, but someone on section 4 support would
receive just £250. Everyone knows, however, that the costs of
having a baby are the same, regardless of which level of asylum support
someone is eligible for.</hs_Para>

section 4 support is paid not in cash but on a card, and it is that
card that causes much of the hardship. The rules on where the card can
be used are highly restrictive, meaning families may have to travel
some distance to be able to shop. It cannot be spent on public
transport, which exacerbates the difficulties, particularly for those
who need appointments with doctors or solicitors. Our inquiry heard of
one case where a woman whose maternity grant, which I mentioned a
minute ago, did not arrive. Without any money to travel, she was forced
to leave hospital and walk home in the snow with her newborn baby in
her arms. I think everyone here would accept that that is simply an
unacceptable state of affairs.</hs_Para>

very little money can be transferred on this card from one week to the

uniforms—a larger-priced item for which families need to save up

families say, too, that this card is downright unreliable. It is often
turned down at checkouts and, most painfully of all, the card
immediately identifies the holder of it as an asylum seeker, frequently
resulting in abuse and stigmatisation. During our inquiry, we heard

it puzzling that the honeyed words from the Secretary of State last

happens now. Secondly, the planning department will have to notify
neighbours, just as happens now. If there are objections, the planning
authority will 
<?notus-xml column=773?>take the decision whether to grant planning permission, just as happens
now. The only change is that in the absence of objections from the
directly adjoining properties, the development will automatically go
ahead, notwithstanding any objections from other affected neighbours,

the absence of the £172 planning

have a couple of questions for the Minister, which I hope he will
answer if he has time to sum up, on how neighbours might be affected by
the proposals. First, by limiting the possibility of objecting to an
extension to those who share the immediate boundary with the property
in question, the Government are taking rights away from other
neighbours whose amenity or light may be affected. Remember that we are
talking about extensions 26 feet long and 13 feet high, Mr
Speaker—about the size of the Speaker’s Chair. Why are
the Government not even giving those affected in that way the right to
express a view that may be considered material by the planning
committee? Secondly, what about neighbours who are away when an
application is put in, and who come back 21 days later to discover that
work has already started on a structure that will seriously affect
their amenity and enjoyment of their back garden? Does the Minister not
think that unfair?</hs_Para>

Minister’s concessions on jobseeker’s allowance claimants
not being forced to take up the shares for rights proposals were

the Minister just avoided, from my hon. Friend the shadow Business

take up employee shareholder status. That is a critical point about
whether it is voluntary. With the employment market as depressed as it
is, why would an employee want to turn this down? People are desperate
to get back into work. That is why the proposal cannot be seen as
voluntary. Why would an employer not just say that this has to be
accepted or the job offer will be withdrawn? Perhaps the job will be
offered to a number of candidates, and the candidate who accepts the
shares for rights proposal will ultimately get
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042381000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0001.htm#13042381000036"><Member ContinuationText="Nick de Bois" PimsId="5682" UID="13042381000837" xid="1091" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0001.htm#13042381000837"><B>Nick

there is the new Tory tax bombshell. We all remember that phrase
because the Liberal Democrats used it at the last general election to
describe the proposed increase in VAT, before voting with their
Conservative colleagues to increase it to 20%. In the
Budget—this is another concession—the Chancellor
announced that the first £2,000 of shares will be PAYE and
national insurance-free, but what about values above that? We could
have a situation in which new employee shareholders give up their
employment rights in return for valueless shares that incur PAYE and
national insurance at the point of issue. That would mean that an
employee on the basic rate of PAYE and national insurance would have to
pay several hundred pounds on the issue of the shares in their first
pay. It could cost the employee money.</hs_Para>

are the Government trying to achieve in that measure? Is it that
employees will give up their right to protection against unfair
dismissal so that they can be given some shares that their employer
will tell them are worth a certain value, but they have no idea whether
that is right? When they get the shares, will they have to pay tax and
national insurance on them if their value is more than £2,000?
Then, at the end, employers, if they decide to sack them, can take the
shares back at a valuation that might be less. It does not seem to be a
scheme that will set the nation alight with people wishing to
participate in
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042381000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0001.htm#13042381000061">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T13:31:31"></hs_TimeCode>

ideologically driven Government are all about. They have no economic
strategy, no plan other than austerity and unemployment, and the
Minister thinks that the holy grail of economic growth is to make it
easier to fire rather than hire. It smacks of a Chancellor who is out
of ideas and out of touch. I urge the Minister and Government Members

Main:</Member></B> I wish to speak to amendment 7B. I am delighted that
the concerns about neighbour notification and the involvement of local
people in decision making have been listened to. That was crucial for
many Members of this House. However, I would still like to tease out
answers on some of my concerns about amendment
7B.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042381000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0001.htm#13042381000063"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T13:32:20"></hs_TimeCode>St
Albans, according to the Department for Communities and Local
Government’s own figures, handles twice the number of planning
applications as a normal planning authority. We are surrounded by green
belt, thankfully, 
<?notus-xml column=780?>but are under direct pressure from many developments, including domestic
developments. The fees collected do not cover the planning applications
already being made, so we run a subsidy to the planning operations of
St Albans district council.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042381000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0001.htm#13042381000064">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T13:32:45"></hs_TimeCode>
suggest that the fees for applications are quite modest. They form a
very small part of a whole development. For example, they do not
include architect fees, which can be substantial, or any of the other
land searches that might be needed, for instance when tree protection
orders are in place on a site. I do not believe that the fees are what
deter people from making applications for a housing development,
perhaps for a growing family.
What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T13:32:45"></hs_TimeCode> I am
concerned about is that we will now have what I call
“planning-lite.”</hs_Para>

original amendment in the Lords, which was defeated there, suggested
not involving planning officers, neighbour notification or any other
work for the council whatsoever. The new amendment, which I welcome as
an improvement on the old one, would bring the planning system into the
permitted development rights decision-making process and, as a result,
mean direct costs for many councils, particularly those, such as mine,
that have a significant number of planning applications. I cannot see
the savings. I would love to see some sort of spreadsheet showing how
that cannot be a burden on the council, as it means taking those
applications, because they are above the original permitted development
rights figures, out of the current planning system, in which a fee is
paid for examination and registration for neighbour notifications and
perhaps even a site visit, and moving them so that the officer still
does the same work but does not get any of the fee. I urge the Minister
to monitor that situation, because in a heavily utilised planning
department, such as the one in St Albans, I believe that this will have
a negative impact on the
council<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T13:34:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042381000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0001.htm#13042381000066">I
am also concerned that we are effectively introducing a third planning
system and that there might be pressure on neighbours not to object or
to trigger the process. I can envisage developers going around and
reassuring neighbours that a development will not be a problem, and the
neighbours might feel reassured, but is money to be put into
enforcement if the neighbours, when they see the edifice going up, are
unhappy because what was described to them is not what is being
delivered on their doorstep?</hs_Para>

Main:</Member></B> I do share that concern. Obviously, the detail is
still very light. For example, will the plans be available on websites?
Since councillors do not seem to be involved in the system, someone
could potentially go 
<?notus-xml column=781?>around and advise someone who is not as savvy as hon. Members are on the
implications of a structure for them in order to form an objection.
There is a very active civic society in St Albans that takes a keen
interest in planning. I am disappointed that no one other than an
immediate neighbour can form an objection. The people who run the
Watercress Wildlife Association in St Albans, for example, take a keen
interest in the water run-off from further uphill. Will we have a
domino effect of several applications on large permitted development
rights that eventually start creating soggy gardens further
downhill?</hs_Para>

know that that is all detail and that this is a short debate, and I do
not wish to tire the House, but my main concern, if we are to move to
the new “planning-lite”, is that we seem to have given
additional responsibilities to councils but no additional resources. I
urge the Minister to listen to the words of councils, which already
feel that they subsidise the planning system. We also do not know
whether there will be non-determination periods. I have no idea whether
the permitted development right period of determination would be
similar. What council would prioritise a determination that has no fees
associated with it over a determination that has a determination period
and a fee associated with it? Will we have two categories of decision
making? That all needs to be teased out, and I look forward to the
Minister giving guidelines that ensure that councils are consistent in
their approach to those decisions and that it is not simply a question
of whether someone happens to have a vocal neighbour who is savvy
enough to interpret plans and make objections in the interests of the
whole community rather than just in
self-interest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T13:37:37"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T13:37:39"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T13:37:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042381000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0002.htm#13042381000071"><B><Member ContinuationText="Annette Brooke" PimsId="2316" UID="13042381000854" xid="69" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0002.htm#13042381000854">Annette

money going to local planning authorities when they clearly have duties

which those people who cannot afford extensions end up subsidising
those who can, which seems unfair. We are talking not only about

bullied into accepting this status. I have made it clear that guidance
will be available and our amendments improve that by making sure that
there will be a statement of written particulars. There will also be a

I have made clear in the course of our debates, the Government want a
strong and effective Equality and Human Rights Commission. As part of
that and to focus the EHRC on its core functions, we proposed the
repeal of its power under section 3 of the Equality Act
2006, which is known more commonly as the general duty. However, in
light of the clear views expressed in the other place, the Government
have reconsidered our position and will not insist on our disagreement
to Lords amendment 35. That will allow the general duty to remain in
the 2006 Act. Although it is accepted by all that the duty has a

impose a duty on the Government to exercise the power in the Equality

understanding of the 
<?notus-xml column=790?>relevant issues would benefit from some form of consultation to ensure
that all the pertinent considerations are identified and, where
possible, taken into account. Converting the order-making power in the
2010 Act into a duty will ensure that the Government legislate to
incorporate caste protection into discrimination law. It will also give
us an opportunity to undertake consideration, possibly through
consultation, on whether any other factors, such as the need for
specific caste-related exceptions, need to be introduced at the same
time that caste is given legal protection. One example that has been
raised is that we would not want monitoring forms to demand that people
say which caste they are from, because we want to see such a
characteristic gone from society and do not want to perpetuate it.
Ensuring that there is proper guidance, and that we legislate
sensitively, is therefore important. We will all welcome the
opportunity of a little time to ensure that it is got right. That will

that I and my colleagues have always held such views. Indeed, our party

legislation the general equality duty governing the Equality and Human

does not understand that in coalition Governments one party can hold a
continuing obligation or view that is not necessarily persuasive to the
Government as a whole. The two parties in the coalition clearly started
from a different position, and it has taken until today and the clearly

amendment changes the word “may” to “must”

of State “may” make caste discrimination illegal, and
that will be changed to say that they “must” lay
regulations to make an order. That will require secondary legislation,

about repeal, the amendments make it clear that the Minister
“may by order” repeal or otherwise amend section 9(5) of
the Equality Act 2010. Repeal would therefore happen by order, through
the normal parliamentary processes, using the affirmative resolution
procedure, so both Houses would have their say. That would happen only
after a Minister had ordered a review and published a report. That
would be the process by which repeal would happen. I hope that he

facilitate parading and deal with some of the issues, that would be a
matter for discussion and change, but until such a time, the
commission’s decisions are the law of the land, and as such they
need to be adhered to. I understand his point—people often make
it to me—but at the moment its decisions are the law of the
land. It determines the routes and some of the conditions for parading,
and we need to adhere to them. If we need an alternative, people must
come forward with proposals, but until then, the commission makes the
decisions. I know he agrees that it is crucial that the police do not
make those decisions. If the current situation is unacceptable and
people feel the need for change, it is incumbent on everyone to
consider what that change would

remember a debate in which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T14:58:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

had asked the then Secretary of State to facilitate talks and bring
everyone together to see how a comprehensive and inclusive process
might work. People get cynical about having more talks, but
given the absence of agreement and consensus, and the fact that there
are differing views about what should be done, the very
least we can do is to bring people together, even if—I will be
honest with the hon. Member for North Down (Lady

is no guarantee that that will succeed. To start to talk about
that—to ask how we deal with it, whether elements of
Eames-Bradley could have worked, whether other elements could work and
what a comprehensive process means, and to include all representatives
in Northern Ireland in that process—is to start saying what we
can do to address the issue. That is the role that the UK Government

the hon. Gentleman said, the bedrock of the progress that has been made
in Northern Ireland is provided by the agreement signed on 10 April, 15
years ago. Whether we call it the Belfast agreement or the Good Friday
agreement, there can be no doubt that it has transformed life in
Northern Ireland, alongside its successor agreements, made at St
Andrews in 2006 and Hillsborough in 2010. None of those agreements
would have happened without the Downing Street declaration, made 20
years ago by John Major and Albert Reynolds, which started the peace
process in
earnest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:02:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042381000698" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0002.htm#13042381000698">I
agree that we in this House must never, ever take the peace settlement
for granted. It will always be important to keep reminding ourselves of
the many ways in which the agreements have improved life for people in
Northern Ireland and transformed it as a place to live. For example,
the agreements secured the constitutional position of Northern Ireland
on the basis of consent, meaning that it will never cease to be a part
of the United Kingdom unless a majority decides otherwise. That is
something that we warmly welcome as a Government who support the Union
and believe that all parts of our United Kingdom are stronger together,
weaker apart. The agreements also mean that the territorial claim to
sovereignty in articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution has now
gone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:03:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042381000699" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0002.htm#13042381000699">After
years of direct rule from Westminster, we now have an inclusive,

identities of all parts of the community are fully protected, whether
they choose to define themselves as British, Irish or both. There are

Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and relations between the

an attack is highly likely. There are still terrorist groups that
continue to defy the will of the overwhelming majority of people, north
and south, who voted for Northern Ireland’s future to be
determined by democracy and consent. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:07:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Gedling said, the terrorists are small in number and have very
little popular support, but they have capability and lethal intent, as

Black last

too, would like to thank the brave men and women of the Northern
Ireland Prison Service and the Police Service of Northern Ireland for
all the work they do to keep the whole community safe from harm. The
PSNI is relentless in its efforts to stop terrorist attacks and put
those responsible for them behind bars where they belong. Just one of a
number of recent PSNI successes was the interception of a van carrying
four mortar bombs bound for Londonderry. If it had got through, it
could have led to an horrific attack. The levels of co-operation
between the PSNI and the Garda Siochana are unprecedented. That
co-operation is saving lives. I thank the Irish Government for making
it possible.</hs_Para>

our part, on coming to power we endorsed an additional £45
million for the PSNI, to help to address the terrorist threat in
Northern Ireland. Our 2010 national security strategy made tackling
terrorism in Northern Ireland a tier one priority, progress on which is
regularly discussed at the very highest levels of Government. In 2011,
in response to a request from the Chief Constable, we provided an
additional £200 million to tackle the terrorist threat. The
shadow Secretary of State asked how the funding would be phased over
the years. I think I can provide him with some reassurance on that. As
a significant proportion of the funding was capital spend designed to
provide much-needed equipment—not least the refresh of the PSNI
Land Rover fleet—more will 
<?notus-xml column=806?>inevitably get spent towards the beginning of the period than at the
end. From my regular discussions with the Chief Constable, I have no

hon. Member for Gedling rightly emphasised the crucial importance of
the rule of law, now that we are back into another marching season. So
far, the events have gone off well and largely peacefully, which is
welcome, but it is always important to reiterate from the Dispatch
Box—and indeed from both sides of the House—that Parades
Commission decisions must be complied with. There are real dangers for
Northern Ireland in any recurrence of the disorder that has too often
marred the marching seasons in years past. Such disorder damages

happen. Should the local parties reach consensus on a way to devolve
decisions on parading to a new institution or body, the UK Government
would of course consider the matter carefully. As the right hon.

parts of Northern Ireland society. As I go round Northern Ireland, I
see many excellent examples of initiatives designed to bring people
together, such as the Jethro centre in Lurgan, Forthspring in West
Belfast, and Intercomm in North Belfast. As the flags-related disorder
demonstrated, however, more needs to be done to build mutual
understanding and mutual trust across sectarian

the hon. Member for Gedling will appreciate, this is no easy issue. His
party’s Government tried to resolve it, but were unable to do
so, because they could not build enough support for the legislation
that they were considering. It is important to accept that the UK
Government do not own the past, and that progress cannot be made solely
at their behest. Progress requires the building of consensus between
different sides and different parties in Northern Ireland. We are
certainly willing to play our part in efforts to deal with these
matters, as was demonstrated by the Prime Minister’s response to
the Bloody Sunday report and the de Silva review, but we do not believe

domestic rates and in helping lending to small businesses, and in
backing the work of Invest Northern Ireland, there is no doubt, and it
is the consensus among the political parties in Northern Ireland, and
among business and industry, that what is needed is a game changer. If
we are to alleviate high unemployment and reduce dependency on the
public sector, something like the devolution of corporation tax is
needed to make that happen. Of course, it is important that we retain
our 100% regional aid status as far as Europe is

welcome the fact that the review of public administration will reduce
the number of councils, streamlining local government. We on the DUP
Benches support the reduction in the size of the Assembly, support the
reduction in the size of Government and support the idea of introducing
an Opposition to the Assembly set-up, but there are other parties in
the Assembly that, to varying degrees, do not lend support to that. I

issues forward. They cannot be left in abeyance. It is absolutely
critical. I know that in the constituency that I represent, North
Belfast, there are many people who, when they consider the impact of
welfare reforms, or the economy, or the reductions in the public

been open for a year, and I have had the pleasure of visiting it twice.
What a wonderful visit it makes for. The G8 is coming to Northern
Ireland. To accommodate all the visitors who have been mentioned,
Northern Ireland has some of the best hotels in the world, which
perhaps is not recognised or remembered. As well as meeting the people
of Northern Ireland, one of the great pleasures of visiting the

have the honour of chairing the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, and
one of the ways that we think will cement the relative peace that has
been attained in Northern Ireland is to try to help the economy and
move it to better times. As has been mentioned, the economy throughout
the United Kingdom is difficult. It is difficult throughout Europe. It
is difficult in various parts of the world. For the record, I for one
believe that the Government are on the right track in trying to put the
economy right. We are not in a mess because we did not spend enough
money, but because the previous Government spent too much money. We
cannot get 
<?notus-xml column=817?>away from that. The Government are right to try to rebalance the economy

specific reference to Northern Ireland, there are one or two issues
that we should discuss here today that have been touched upon. I have
just complimented the Government, but I will make a mild criticism now.
I do not think that it is right to delay the decision on devolving
responsibility for setting corporation tax until after the Scottish
referendum.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:49:59"></hs_TimeCode> I
see no relevance at all. In fact, I think that people in Scotland would
be somewhat encouraged to vote to remain in the Union if we could
demonstrate that there is flexibility to do different things in
different parts of the United Kingdom.</hs_Para>

Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom that shares a land
border with another country, and the circumstances there are different.
I certainly congratulate the Government on their reduction in the rate
of corporation tax and look forward to the downward trend continuing to
20%, but we must remember that the level of corporation tax in the
Republic of Ireland is still only 12.5%. If we want to know the
importance of that rate to the Republic of Ireland, we need only look
back to the financial difficulties it had a couple of years ago, when
this Parliament tried to help. Even with all its difficulties, and
despite pressure from the European Union, it stuck to that rate and
would not budge, because it knew that it was the best thing it had for
attracting inward investment. The Government need to speed up their
decision on whether to devolve the rate of corporation tax to the
Assembly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:51:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042381000776" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0002.htm#13042381000776">On
air passenger duty, great progress has been made. I hope that the
Select Committee was influential—I think that it was—in
enabling the rate for long-haul flights from Northern Ireland to be
reduced and giving the Assembly responsibility for it. However, a large
number of flights to and from Northern Ireland are short-haul, and we
feel that more work needs to be done in that regard, because the
relatively high percentage of tax for short-haul fares is a
disincentive. I know that that applies across the United Kingdom, but
Northern Ireland is different, as the only realistic way to travel
between to and from Great Britain is by air, so much more thought needs
to be put into
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:52:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042381000777" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0002.htm#13042381000777">The
third matter I want to mention in relation to the Northern Ireland
economy is laundering and smuggling. Historically, a lot of money has
been lost in taxation through laundering and smuggling, particularly of
fuel and tobacco. The Select Committee looked at that in great detail
and was horrified by a number of things: first, how much money is lost;
and secondly, how few custodial sentences are given to criminals who
abuse the system to such an extent. It is not a victimless crime,
because it is taking money away from hospitals, schools and police
forces and from the taxpayers who contribute the money in the first
place. The Committee was also concerned about the small progress made
on developing technology that would greatly reduce, although not
entirely prevent, the amount of fuel that can be smuggled and
counterfeited in Northern Ireland. I urge the Government to continue
their work and increase the intensity of their talks with Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to move towards a better system
for eradicating what is a very serious and costly
crime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:53:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042381000778" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0002.htm#13042381000778">I

am always pleased to note the widespread support across the House for
peace, progress and prosperity in Northern Ireland. The 15th

agreement laid the foundation for a sea change in relationships between
our two countries. It not only began to fundamentally change
relationships between Ireland and Britain, but laid the foundations for
the peace process and the Good Friday or Belfast agreement that
followed in 1998, which in turn raised opportunities for further

process vigorously backed by the two Governments. It is with regret
that I say that although the current Government have done many good
things for the economy, too little progress has been made in helping to
improve our economy, with unemployment currently at record levels. As
others have pointed out, we needed that reduction in corporation tax to
give us the rocket boost—for want of a better
description—to get us moving economically. The level of youth
unemployment in particular is a desperate cause for concern and cannot
be isolated from the ongoing social
unrest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:03:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042381000795" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0002.htm#13042381000795">I
do not doubt the Government’s stated commitment to rebalancing
the economy, but the current economic path laid out for us will not
take Northern Ireland to economic stability. We need investment in our
economy and we need to create the economic confidence to build growth
and develop the private sector. This Government’s attachment to
austerity is unlikely to do that for us. On an island of fewer than 6
million people—we have fewer than 2 million in Northern Ireland
and fewer than 4 million in the Irish
Republic—economic and cross-border partnership is essential. In
that context, we need an enduring commitment to serious north-south
partnerships and projects such as the Narrow Water bridge and the A5,
both of which will open up significant economic opportunities for
Northern Ireland. The SDLP will continue to make a positive case for
that kind of north-south
partnership.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042381000796" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0002.htm#13042381000796">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:05:09"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:09:40"></hs_TimeCode>

I am personally marred by my experience of serving in Northern Ireland
in the ’90s. My life was spent in uniform, stopping cars and
asking for identity documents. I lived on fortified border checkpoints,
in the Strabane and Omagh areas, that would now be more associated with
Helmand province. It is pleasing that that world no longer exists and
that things have moved

recall two striking events. On one occasion, I went into a newsagents

me because she would get a brick through her window if she was seen
doing so. On another occasion, I bumped into a friend from university
in Strabane while he was coming out of WH Smith. We had not seen each
other for a while and he wanted to give me a hug, but he realised that
he could not because I was in full uniform. He was a citizen of the
area and I was doing my job in uniform, and I thought how mad that
dichotomy was within the UK. I am pleased to learn of the advances that

is a huge irony here. All of us travel abroad occasionally. Wherever we
are in the world, if we want to have a good drink, make some new

different it was when I served in Northern Ireland. I would go away for
two or three months on leave, go to Irish bars and then return back to

Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds) said that there had been
questions over whether the Assembly would continue to exist. It is

Titanic Belfast, not least because there is a synergy with my

the other museum that recognises what happened with the Titanic. I
believe that the Belfast project cost something like £100
million and about 290,000 visitors a year were expected, but it is now
exceeding 800,000 visitors a year. That is a fantastic indication of

that more needs to be done, and we must not be complacent about the
situation in Northern Ireland. There remains a minority who seek to fan
the flames of violence, turn the clock back and undo all the
good work. Last year there were about 60 shooting incidents and 30 bomb
attacks, along with half a dozen or so paramilitary-style attacks
including punishment shootings performed on both sides of the sectarian
divide. Of course, compared with more than a decade ago when there were
more than 600 shooting and bombing incidents annually, progress has
absolutely been made, but that shows that the threat level has to

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:13:38"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Belfast North is right that we should not take that progress
for granted, and nor should we treat it lightly or endanger it.
However, while that progress has been delivered at least partially at
political level, I do not believe that the reconciliation that was
hoped for has been delivered.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:13:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Belfast South captured something of my personal frustration about
that. We have a rigidly consociational model of democracy in Northern
Ireland, which was chosen as a means of managing our divisions, but in
many ways it has fixed those divisions and given them a permanence that
I believe is unhelpful. It has almost incentivised division, and we
need to consider that carefully in how we make progress with the
Assembly and its
structures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:14:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042382000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0003.htm#13042382000028">Even
politically, where the Assembly has delivered, it has created stability
but not necessarily dynamism, agility or flexibility. We all hoped that
devolution would bring those things. Our people are patient but
frustrated that progress has been slow, even on issues of policy that
at first glance appear non-contentious. There is built-in inertia in
the system, and reform to make it more nimble would be hugely helpful
to us all. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:14:44"></hs_TimeCode>Such
disaffection with the performance of devolution is a risk to something
that I value as a committed devolutionist. The Assembly faces a
challenge of making itself valuable for more than merely managing
political stalemate and division, and for actually delivering results.
That is where the focus needs to be.</hs_Para>

of us who lived through the troubles will welcome and value at personal
level the current peace. A whole generation of young people, however,
have not had that experience, and perhaps place less emphasis on the
importance of where we are now versus where we used to be. Those
without direct, lived experience listen to the history of the troubles,
and narratives constructed around that history can endanger it by
glamorising or justifying it in terms that allow people who feel they
have no stake in current society to think that a return to violence is
a way to claim a place in the future. We must deal with such issues in

could say many things but I want to reflect briefly on six points that
we must consider if we are to realise the potential not only of the

of those

forward—and all are crucial if we are to make
progress.</hs_Para>

past is the best place to start, because we must agree a framework to
deal with it. Dealing with the past properly, whether in terms of
victims, or of commemorations and memorialisation, is hugely important.
Lack of a comprehensive approach allows some to peddle partial and
skewed narratives that perpetuate misunderstanding and compound hurt,
which brings huge attendant risk. All parties to the
agreement—both Governments as well as Northern Ireland
parties—must address the matter, and I renew my call to the
Secretary of State to look at initiating the all-party talks for which
we have previously called.</hs_Para>

current process with the Historical Enquiries Team and the series of
inquiries—albeit of individual significance—risk
producing retrospective narratives that do not correlate with the
reality we lived through. I agree with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:16:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) who said that we need paramilitaries to engage
in an honest discussion. If the full truth is to be told, it cannot

legacy issue is that of parades. Parades and demonstrations are
sensitive and require careful management in a divided society. The
right to parade and to free assembly are important and must be
protected, but they must be balanced and managed against the right to
live free of harassment and intimidation. Current law and legal
processes must be respected and supported by all elected
representatives. If people have issues with the Parades Commission, the
onus is on them to find an agreed alternative process to deal with
those issues. That has not been possible to date, but in the interim we
must support the rule of law.</hs_Para>

third issue is flags and emblems—a sensitive issue as I think we
all recognise, perhaps more today than ever. There are two distinct
issues of policy. One concerns the proper display of national flags and
symbols of Government, for example on civic and Government buildings,
and the other is the use and abuse of flags on street furniture around
the Province to create a chill factor in Northern Ireland that is
deeply unwelcome and unhelpful. On the first issue, it is currently a
zero-sum game. Flags fly in a number of Unionist-controlled councils
all the time, but not at all in nationalist-controlled councils. Such a
policy fails to recognise that flags are constitutional symbols, and
not just tribal banners. I believe that the review of public
administration going through the Assembly provides the opportunity to
resolve this matter once and for all, rather than forming 11 new
councils that will fight the battle one at a time. We should take that
opportunity to develop a solution acceptable to everyone.</hs_Para>

on public property also need to be addressed. That is illegal under the
Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993, and in those terms should not be
permitted. If a parent-teacher association sticks a flag or notice on a
lamppost it will be fined, but if someone puts on a balaclava or a mask
and puts a flag on a lamppost, they will not be fined. There must be
some kind of regular approach to dealing with such things. We have
suggested regulation rather than an outright ban to give space to those
who wish to demonstrate and display emblems and symbols. However, they
should do so with consultation 
<?notus-xml column=825?>and assurances in place, and the time of such displays should be limited
so that no area becomes permanently marked-out

me move on to the forward-looking issues. First, and most important, is
the economy. If we want a prosperous, stable and peaceful future for
Northern Ireland, we must deal with sectarianism, because it puts off
three key groups on which our economy will depend: indigenous
entrepreneurs, who will go elsewhere; inward investors, who will take

impact not only of unrest but of ongoing sectarianism on small and
medium-sized indigenous local businesses is profound. In the past three
to four weeks, I have dealt with businesses in my constituency that
have had to wrestle with sectarian workplace disputes and with
relocation, because sectarian symbols have dissuaded workers from going
to their workplace. Protection rackets run by paramilitary
organisations have impacted on businesses, as has the outworking of
civil disturbances. Those additional challenges faced by businesses in
Northern Ireland are not faced by our competitors. We already have a
higher cost base, although I welcome what the Government are doing to
reduce it. We are competing on a world stage, and we need to resolve
those impediments. That must be done by parties on these Benches, with

because they are more sectarian, but because the expression is more

corporation tax, we would perform even better—I could not let
that go unsaid, and I am sure other hon. Members agree with me. As the

we should bear in mind that the G8 and other high-profile events that
help us to promote and build our brand can be undermined instantly if
scenes of bomb alerts or civil unrest are broadcast around the world.
Inward investment is infected by instability. No one seeking to locate
a business in my community comes to talk to me about parades or flags
or the past, but they ask, “Is it safe? Is it stable?”

same is true of tourism. The Northern Ireland share of tourism is much
lower than that in the Republic of Ireland. The entire differential
cannot be accounted for by the weather—in Northern Ireland, by
“weather”, we generally mean “rain”.
Product has been invested in, for which huge credit is to be given to
the Northern Ireland Executive and others. Derry city of culture is a
fantastic showcase for the quality and diversity of our artistic and
cultural offer. In my constituency, we have Titanic Belfast, a
celebration of our maritime heritage. It is a world-class tourist
centre that is well visited—it

Things such as the Connswater Community Greenway in East Belfast

second future issue is education. We have massive issues with
education. We have some excellent schools, which we should celebrate,
but we have a long, under-achieving tail. We need to address that
educational disadvantage, because it can breed long-term disengagement
and disaffection in communities. People believe not only that they are
not getting a fair share in education, but that they are impeded in
influencing the community around them. We must consider how we educate
our young people—we educate them separately, and the people who
teach them are also separated. Only 7% of young people are in
integrated settings, but 79% of parents say that that would be their
choice. We need to consider how we build on that for future

there is the issue of shared spaces and shared housing. We need to
change the language, away from people simply saying that people choose

we will set out to prove that that is the case; or to an
acknowledgement that the threat is there and real, that separation is
safer, and that we will tackle the forces that are posing a threat,
whether they are paramilitaries or others. Shared spaces do not have to
be neutral, but they do have to be managed. We have to put effort into
ensuring that they are available for the people of Northern Ireland. It
is not easy to achieve. My colleague David Ford has worked with groups
on issues relating to interfaces, and reducing and opening barriers. We

Hoey</B> (Vauxhall) (Lab):</Member> I welcome the debate and thank the
shadow Secretary of State for ensuring that it took place. Looking back
20 years, I am absolutely delighted by how my party’s policy on
Northern Ireland has changed radically. When I was first elected, one
was almost shouted down if one said anything that in any way vaguely
implied that one might not want a united Ireland. Our policy used to be
that we would persuade people that a united Ireland was their best
future. That changed under the previous Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and
from then things improved. We got the Belfast agreement and, as
everyone has said, things have changed so much in Northern Ireland
that, as someone who was born and brought up there and still goes back
regularly, I cannot help but see the differences and changes, which are
mostly for the best.</hs_Para>

pay tribute to the Prime Minister. “Risk” is the wrong
word to use, but he certainly took a big leap by agreeing to have the
G8 in Northern Ireland. We do not host the G8 summit that often, so to
hold it in a part of the United Kingdom where a lot of people across
the world will be saying, “How on earth are we going to go to
Northern Ireland?” was a fantastic thing for him to do. I think
it will be a wonderful experience for all of those people. It may not
be such a wonderful experience for any of our colleagues going in and
out of Belfast international airport on 16 and 17 June, as I think
there will be a lot of security, but there is security at all G8
summits. I think we have to remind people that it will be no different
from the security at any G8 anywhere in the world. I welcome the
decision to hold the summit in Northern Ireland very
much<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:28:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042382000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0003.htm#13042382000050">There

the streets of Belfast demanding that the flag be taken down from
Belfast city hall. We know that this was a Sinn Fein agenda—it

that chance by people who perhaps thought that they were working in the

people.</hs_Para>

am concerned about the Historic Enquiries Team, and hope that the
Minister will say something about it. There are real issues that we
need to explore: the length of time some of the things are taking and
perhaps the way it is being run now. We need to have a detailed look at
how that organisation is working. I hope that the Minister will come
back to that.</hs_Para>

deal today with a crucial, but non-devolved, matter. Northern Ireland
has a fantastic heritage of sport, sporting opportunities and sporting
people famous 
<?notus-xml column=828?>all over the world. I need not remind anybody that we have the best
golfers in the world or of people such as Mary Peters who have done
extremely well at the Olympics over the years. These people have made
Northern Ireland known to those involved in sport all over the world.
We have some very good young people, yet we are faced with an issue
that people do not like to talk about, because they think, “Oh,
sport’s not political, so let’s not make it
political”. But it is a real issue. In many sports, it is
difficult for a young person from a particular community in Northern
Ireland who wants to be part of a British team and of the UK ever to
compete for a British team, unless they move to England, Wales or
Scotland.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042382000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0003.htm#13042382000054">Boxing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:34:22"></hs_TimeCode>
is one example. There are some boxing clubs—probably not
many—where young boxers have no desire to box under the
tricolour, but they have to because boxing is organised on an
all-Ireland basis. The international boxing community recognises
all-Ireland boxing, so if someone wants to box for a British team, they
have to join a club in England, Scotland or Wales. The Belfast
agreement was supposed to ensure parity and enable people to choose
whether they felt more Irish or more British, yet in sport it is very
much one way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:31:19"></hs_TimeCode>.
Swimming is another example. Swimming clubs in Northern Ireland cannot
affiliate to the Amateur Swimming Association, even though its general
secretary would love to have them. They are not allowed to because they
have to affiliate to the Irish swimming association, which does not
want clubs affiliated to British swimming.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042382000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0003.htm#13042382000055">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:34:22"></hs_TimeCode>
is the same in tennis. A washing machine powder advert once ran a
special offer giving people special help in tennis, but Northern
Ireland was excluded because it was not seen as part of the British
set-up. I will not repeat the story of the Olympics, but a number of
colleagues are concerned that before the next Olympics we find a way of
not referring to “Team GB”. It ignores Northern Ireland.
There were people from Northern Ireland in the British team in several
sports. I am not saying that because I consider Northern Ireland to be
a part of the United Kingdom, everyone there must be in a British team,
but the House has to ensure that the rights and opportunities of young
people who feel British are recognised.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042382000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0003.htm#13042382000056"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:32:46"></hs_TimeCode>When
I was sports Minister, I tried to do something about this matter, but
it was even more difficult then because we did not have the agreements.
Now we have them, however, there is no reason for the Minister, the
Secretary of State or Northern Ireland politicians not to say,
“This is wrong.” Every youngster must have the right to
choose. Boxing, swimming and tennis clubs should be able to affiliate
to British boxing, as well as to Irish boxing, if that is what they
want. They might not all want to, but they must have that right.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:34:22"></hs_TimeCode> constituents
buy their lottery tickets hoping to help a British team in the
Olympics. Some of that money quite rightly helps to fund the Sports
Council for Northern Ireland, because it has a team in the Commonwealth
games, but some of those youngsters also compete for Ireland against
British teams. So we have this ridiculous situation where my
constituents are paying for people to have extra training and support
to help them win a gold medal instead of a British person.</hs_Para>

find it upsetting that when people who feel strongly in Northern
Ireland raise this matter they are accused almost of being sectarian.
It is not sectarian for someone 
<?notus-xml column=829?>to want to be able to compete for the country that is their nationality.
Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, and if someone feels
British and they live in Northern Ireland, they should be allowed to do
that. I hope that the Minister will refer to that and not just ignore
it, as many other Ministers have over the
years.</hs_Para>

Ireland, but also adding my concern that, although it is easy to talk
about the bad old days and the good days now, it does not take an awful
lot to go back to some of the things that happened in the bad old days.
We have seen some of those and hon. Members have outlined some of the
terrible things that have happened. Devolution now applies to many
areas, but we in this Parliament should remember that the Select
Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs, of which I am a member and which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:35:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

things in Northern Ireland. We cannot just say, “It’s all
finished; it’s all better.” Northern Ireland is an
integral part of the United Kingdom. Members in this House need to
remember that and not be fobbed off by the idea that everything in the

not.</hs_Para>

have been positive developments. Let me turn briefly to the employment
situation in Northern Ireland, which is largely pinned to that in the
rest of the United Kingdom, so we are sitting at about 8.5%
unemployment. That is slightly higher than the rest of the UK, but it
is 
<?notus-xml column=830?>certainly not as high as in the Republic of Ireland, at almost 15%, or
the eurozone in general, at 12%, so there is a clear benefit to
continuing with the economic link, which shows that we are stronger
together than apart. Jobs have been created in the last term of the
Assembly; in fact, 10,244 have been created in the life of the
Assembly. That is pretty incredible for Northern Ireland, given the
disadvantages and problems, which we are well aware of. Indeed,
£500 million of investment from overseas has been secured, and
although Northern Ireland represents 2% of the UK population, 7% of all
foreign direct investment comes to Northern Ireland. Those statistics

from Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland he moved to Port

transporter below. It was in Middlesbrough that he met my grandmother.
I thus feel a real sense of pride to speak in today’s debate as

shedding 5,000 jobs in the last two years, Northern Ireland’s
construction industry needs that help. We would give a one-year

tourism economy. Northern Ireland has a fantastic record of bringing in

the Government—let down by failed policy after failed policy.
The young people I meet are ambitious for themselves and their

relative peace and some measure of political stability in the first,

the UK Government who, having held out the prospect, reneged on the
question of devolving corporation tax-varying powers to the Northern

Northern Ireland Members would welcome an update on that potential
economic dividend. Despite some local criticism, our Executive
Ministers have put a lot of effort into visiting major, current and
emerging economic powers in order to win jobs and investment for
Northern Ireland, and they have done so against the challenge of
worldwide economic recession, so if I had to apportion responsibility
for the Northern Ireland economy failing to meet the expectations of
our people, I would not start by blaming the Northern Ireland

his Ministers were walking around with letters of resignation in their
pockets, and we had other parties saying, “Jump out of the
Executive now and we’ll jump out with you.” Of course
there was instability, but it was not the result of inherent

particularly welcome what the shadow Secretary of State said about
there still being a need to address the past. I have quoted before the
Russian proverb that says, “To dwell in the past is to lose an
eye, but to forget the past is to lose both eyes.” We need to
address the past properly. I point out to the shadow Secretary of State
that if the previous Government had managed to get away with passing
the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill, which he tried whipping through
in Committee and in this Chamber, we would be in no position to deal
with the past. All sorts of people would have gone to the secret
tribunal and got their indemnity certificates, so the only people who
might have faced any question about past would be the relatives of
victims who dared speculate that somebody had received such an
indemnity or about the crime for which they had received it, because
the Bill provided that that was who would go to jail. It would be
journalists reporting or speculating on that or victims saying it who
would go to jail. It was a horrendous Bill. Thankfully, we created a
situation in which Sinn Fein was forced to withdraw its support from
what we dubbed the Hain-Adams Bill and it was subsequently dropped.
That at least created the space in which we can address the past, and
that is what we must do. We, as parties, must stop patronising victims
on the one hand and ghettoising them on the other. We have to face up
to the past fully, and not just for the victims, but for future
generations.</hs_Para>

there will be issues about the naming of properties and sites in their

for dealing with those and setting mature and responsible standards,

Combating that requires political leadership. The Good Friday agreement

on the agreement’s remaining negative provisions. I drafted some

motion is to allow the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards to
continue its work in the new Session of Parliament, and to give it time
to publish its final report on standards and culture in the banking
sector. The Commission was established in July last year following the
LIBOR rate-setting revelations, and it had a dual remit. First, it was
to report on the lessons to be learned about corporate governance,
transparency, conflicts of interest and their implications for
regulation and Government policy. Secondly, it was given the role of
looking more broadly at standards and culture in the UK banking sector,
taking into account regulatory and competitions investigations into the
LIBOR rate-setting

Commission reported on the first part of its remit on 21 December last
year in its report on banking standards. It has subsequently published
three further reports on structural reform of the banking sector,
proprietary trading, and the failure of HBOS. Its final report is now
awaited, and I understand that it is hoping to report early in the new
Session. That would allow its conclusions to be taken into account in
the House’s scrutiny of the Financial Services (Banking Reform)

Parliament, Joint Committees cease to exist at the end of the Session

motion makes clear that the Commission will cease to exist when it
produces its main report. Of course it is important to ensure that
change in the banking sector is carried through, both through the
Government’s commitment to introduce any necessary amendments to
legislation arising out of the Commission’s work, and through
appropriate parliamentary scrutiny of progress in the banking sector
and its regulation after the Commission ceases.

can be no doubt that the Banking Commission’s inquiry into

Commission should not be measured by whether it generates headlines or
compels one or two of the banking executives who caused the financial
crash to apologise. It has made—and I am sure it will continue
to make—a thoughtful and important contribution to the debate

clear, however, that that is not the reason for the sensible request

Commission has worked tirelessly in recent months, and has met on many
occasions a week in order to make progress. We see the short extension

goes to reinforcing the concept and the process by which the finances
of the House are dealt with on a coherent basis by Members of the

financial impact will be. It therefore seems entirely reasonable that
the House should know about such financial impacts. Previously, there
has perhaps been an expectation that extra costs could always be

effect of the Standing Order would be to require the accounting officer

mentioned earlier, would be a proposal to establish a Select Committee.
The Standing Order would also require a memorandum to be provided in
respect of an amendment to a motion, if it would have a similar
financial impact. As less notice might be given of an amendment, the
absence of a memorandum would not necessarily prevent it from being
debated, but the Speaker might take that factor into account in his
selection of amendments.

The House will have seen yesterday that the Procedure 
<?notus-xml column=851?>Committee published a commendable report on the debating of e-petitions.
It has estimated that the cost of making Westminster Hall available on
Monday between 4.30 pm and 7.30 pm for the debating of
e-petitions that get 100,000 signatures would be between £11,000
and £100,000, depending on the number of e-petitions. Given that
the lowest estimate would fall below the £50,000 threshold, will
he clarify whether he intends all such motions brought before the House
to come with cost
estimates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:51:47"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

to the administration budget. As the Finance and
Services Committee recognised in its report, that is not a
creditable way for the finances of a major public body to be run. The
proposed Standing Order will not prevent the
House either from debating the motions it wants to debate or from
making the decisions it wants to make, but it will ensure that

the financial consequences of those decisions.

am not in a position to do that now. Secondly, he has rightly pointed
out that there are other matters relating to the work of the Procedure

Davies</B> (Montgomeryshire) (Con):</Member> A few weeks ago, an
unusually late and heavy snowfall, accompanied by extensive drifting in
the uplands of Wales and other areas of Britain, hit the farming
industry and visited disastrous consequences on sheep farmers in all
those hill areas. There were dramatic, heartbreaking reports in the
media of farmers digging sheep out from under 10-foot drifts of
snow—many of the sheep were obviously near death—and the
despair of knowing that hundreds more sheep were dying under the
snow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:56:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

the snow has gone. It was a lovely sunny morning as I walked over
Westminster bridge today. The images of despair have disappeared from
our screens. As the world continues on its way, those images have
inevitably disappeared from the minds of most of the British people,
but they have not disappeared from my mind, probably because I was an
upland sheep farmer for most of my
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:56:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042382000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0003.htm#13042382000205"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Elfyn Llwyd" PimsId="1541" UID="13042382000359" xid="366" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0003.htm#13042382000359"><B>Mr

although today I will try to avoid dealing with some of the
consequential commercial issues relating to the current position. What
I want to address—I will come to this—is what I see as
the disconnect between hill sheep farming today and what the wider
general population thinks. If I can, I will keep away altogether from
what might be deemed to be political issues, where there might be
divisions of views.</hs_Para>

impact of the recent snowfall on the sheep-farming uplands remains,
despite the snow having gone. It has not gone away with the snow. Today
it is not about digging out sheep from under snowdrifts; it is more
about collecting and disposing of the dead bodies of sheep and planning
how to put businesses back together. I am probably one of few
MPs—I might not be the only one—who has been out digging
sheep out from under 10-foot snowdrifts. I particularly remember 1963,
when the United Kingdom experienced far more snow and far colder
conditions, and for much longer than this year. I was a teenager
working on the family farm when the drifting snow buried hundreds of
our sheep as they sheltered near walls and hedges. My father and I
spent days searching under the snow for them. It was heartbreaking
work. Most heartbreaking of all was having to stop at nightfall,
knowing that there were still hundreds of sheep asphyxiating beneath
our
feet.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042382000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0003.htm#13042382000208">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:04:29"></hs_TimeCode>
was particularly devastating about the recent snowfall was that it was
so late in the year. In 1963, the snow fell on Boxing day and lasted
until early March, but this year it fell at the end of March, which is
the 
<?notus-xml column=854?>traditional lambing season in the
uplands<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:59:09"></hs_TimeCode>. As the
right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Mr Llwyd) has pointed out,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:59:19"></hs_TimeCode>the sheep sector
was already facing what the Prince’s Trust called a
“perfect storm” of negative influences in March. I shall
not go into all the details, but the upland sheep farmers were already
facing severe problems, and the impact of what has happened has been
devastating<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:59:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042382000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0003.htm#13042382000209">I
want to make it clear why I have sought today’s debate.
Initially, I had not intended to make any public comment. Agriculture
in my constituency is devolved to the National Assembly for Wales.
Naturally, I was in conversation with friends and members of the
farming unions about what had happened, and at first I was heartened by
the fact that the Welsh Government Minister had arranged to come to
Montgomeryshire to meet local farmers and union leaders. However, when
farmers contacted me after the meeting, I was horrified by the
Minister’s approach, which had been totally unsympathetic and
dismissive. Everyone was deeply upset by that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042382000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0003.htm#13042382000210">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:00:20"></hs_TimeCode>
felt that that was unacceptable, and I discussed the matter with the
Assembly Member colleague in Montgomeryshire, Russell George. Together,
we set about seeking to change the tone of the debate. I posted my
thoughts on my blog, “A View from Rural Wales”, which had
quite an impact, and resolved to seek a debate in this House as soon as
Parliament returned from the Easter recess.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:00:43"></hs_TimeCode> Assembly
colleague raised an urgent question in the Welsh
Assembly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:00:40"></hs_TimeCode>. For
whatever reason, the Welsh Government Minister responded with a far
more sympathetic approach, and made a realistic and positive statement.
I congratulate him on that. The Minister of State, Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for
Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath)
also<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:00:57"></hs_TimeCode> published a
statement here last Thursday, and again it was realistic and positive.
So the terms of the debate have changed to some extent. It is clear to
me that both Parliaments, in Cardiff Bay and in Westminster, now
recognise the scale of the disaster that has struck upland sheep
farmers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:01:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042382000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0003.htm#13042382000211">I
should also make it clear that I am not calling for more compensation
or more subsidy for sheep farmers. Some might wish to do that, but I do
not want to do so today. There will be other debates about agricultural
support, and in particular about how British agriculture can remain
competitive with the subsidised agricultural systems across the
European Union. There might be an occasion for a debate in Wales about
the controversial issue of hill farming subsidies, but I do not want to
deal with those matters now.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:01:50"></hs_TimeCode>My aim today is
to address what seems to be a growing disconnect between the business

two of the statements, but I have not looked at what has happened in

<?notus-xml column=855?>I know that there are differences, however, and it is inevitable that
they will be pointed out. At one stage, I thought that I might do that
today, but I specifically decided against it because it would
inevitably have led to the kind of debate that I did not

a great deal of confrontation. Instead, I want to highlight the issue

want to say something about the sort of things that happened when the
snow fell and re-formed itself into huge drifts. Yesterday, in a sort
of surgery, I talked to union leaders and upland farmers at Welshpool
livestock market. I spoke to one farmer who had just sent 72 dead sheep
away in a lorry. He had also picked up another 72 dead sheep
and they were awaiting collection. That illustrates the scale of what
is happening. To make a terrible situation worse, he will have to pay
several thousand pounds to have them taken away. That is not an

Sunday night, I switched the television on and watched the excellent
Adam Henson covering the scale of the deaths on
“Countryfile”. I caught the latter part of the debate.
There was a large pile of carcases in the corner of the yard, but it
was noticeable that the image was blurred to accommodate the
sensitivity of the viewers. It was felt that they should not have to
see all those dead sheep piled up like that. However, the vision of
piles of dead sheep is not blurred for the owners of the dead sheep.
For them, it is all too real. If people are to understand the impact,
they need to know what is

important one, in view of the breeding that has gone into them. I know
from my experience when I was actively sheep farming that one
particular line in the flock could be hugely valued. Along that

is such a wide-ranging debate and I could have picked a thousand
different aspects to discuss, but I want briefly to cover two further
aspects and I ask the Minister to help me on one point of clarity.
First, there is the emotional impact of what has happened. Working with
livestock is not the same as working in other forms of industry.
Animals are living creatures and farmers, in a funny sort of way, get
to know them as individuals. My flock comprised about 1,000 sheep, but
there were lots of individuals among them whom I got to know. It is not

Northern Ireland that was badly affected by the snow. Many upland
farmers in the Mournes and in Slieve Croob were affected. I travelled
through tunnels of snow to visit those farmers, and on one particular
farm, I saw about 29 ewes and lambs lying under a tarpaulin. When that
was pulled back, I could see that they were all dead. I also noticed
collapsed livestock sheds. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, because
of the bond between the farmer and his sheep, we need a particular

Bewcastle valleys in my constituency, there have been two years of
horror with poached soil, fluke and the snow coming at the end of that.
If we are to retain the fabric of small farms, which I think we would

backs to the wind and walk, and they found themselves trapped against
walls or obstacles or under drifts. But what compounded that was that
our sheep flocks, sadly, are not in good condition—because of
the weather, because of events over many months now, because of the

The answers will not be the same in every part of the United Kingdom,
and the proportional scale of difficulties will be different. We must
listen to what each other are doing and hopefully come towards the
right solution, but also listen to what the farmers themselves in the
constituent parts of the United Kingdom are telling us. Certainly that
is what I wanted to do with regard to England. I cannot speak for what
happened in Northern Ireland and say whether it was the right solution,
and similarly for Wales. I can see what has been done, but it seemed to

dispose of a carcass on-farm. However, a specific derogation in those
regulations that the UK has authorised and continues to authorise
allows for the on-farm disposal of carcasses if the conditions are too
difficult to get them to a collection vehicle. That applies in a number
of circumstances. I reminded local authorities, who can prosecute if
they believe that there has been an infringement of those regulations,
that they have the capacity to take into account the individual
circumstances under the derogation, and that they should apply maximum
flexibility in the affected areas. I am very happy that they were able
to do that. I understand that precisely that provision was also used in
Wales in order to provide for the local authorities there. The local
authorities had the power to do so; we simply reminded them that they
had that power, because it was important.</hs_Para>

Cumbria was that on some high fell farms there was no way that an
animal could be buried on that sort of terrain. I can perfectly well
understand the strength of feeling against pyres being built and
operated on the farms, but in a way it surprised me by its intensity.
It is clear that farmers did not want to be reminded of very difficult
times not so long ago, when the countryside was littered with funeral
pyres of dead animals. They did not want that—they wanted those
dead animals off the farm. That very much influenced my view of what we

We have a further difficulty in the United Kingdom: the rebate

However, I emphasise that many individual farmers will face a huge bill
to replace their lost animals. We have to make that point to people who
do not understand this matter. There is not only the cost of recovering
and looking after rescued animals, including the extra feed costs, but
the loss of a significant part this year’s lamb crop. Because of
the loss of hefted ewes, a number of the surviving lambs will also have
to be retained. There is therefore a cumulative effect on
farmers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:46:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042382000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/debtext/130423-0004.htm#13042382000287">It

you know Mr Hollobone, official figures this month show that many
A and E departments are failing to meet their
target of dealing with 95% of patients within four hours. The NHS in
England has missed targets for major A and Es for
29 weeks and missed the target for all A and Es
for the past 12 weeks. The failure to meet targets on so called
“trolley waits” happened despite the Government’s
reducing the target figure from the previous target of 98%. In the past
six months, more than 530,000 patients have waited more than four hours
at A and E departments—a rise of almost
30% since last year. England’s A and Es
are struggling. One in three patients now waits four hours or more for
emergency treatment in the worst affected
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000010">About<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:33:38"></hs_TimeCode>
14 million patients a year are seen in major A
and E units. A Department of Health spokesman has said that
the NHS is experiencing an extra 1 million patients in A
and E compared with two years ago. Research by the
King’s Fund shows that A and E attendance
was up by 353,457 patients in the first three 
<?notus-xml column=234?>quarters of 2012-13 compared with the same period in 2009-10.
Unfortunately, the Government also propose to close or downgrade 34
more A and E departments across the country in
the coming months. Most trusts are reducing the number of beds as part
of their quality, innovation, productivity and prevention plans.
Pressure on A and E is felt at both ends of the
system. A lack  of free beds on wards means that staff cannot
admit patients and, with A and E full, paramedics
cannot hand over
patients.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000011">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:35:32"></hs_TimeCode>
resulting strain in A and E departments was
nowhere more obvious than outside Norfolk and Norwich university

service was forced to erect a major incident tent outside the hospital
to treat patients and relieve pressure on the A
and E department. Reports say that there were queues of up
to 15 ambulances waiting with patients. One patient was made to wait
more than five hours under the West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS

continue to make severe cuts to front-line staff, with many operating
below recommended staffing levels. The Care Quality Commission has
warned that one in 10 hospitals is failing to meet the standard on
adequate staffing levels. Worryingly, a recent CQC report found that
patients report not only longer waiting times, but a reduction in the
quality of care in A and E. Thirty-three per
cent. of respondents said that they waited more than half an hour
before they were first seen by a doctor or nurse—up from 24% in
2004 and 29% in 2008. One in 10 respondents said that they could not
attract the attention of staff, nearly a fifth felt that staff were not
doing “everything they could” to control their pain, and
59% were not told how long they would have to wait for an examination.
Compared with previous years, fewer patients had conversations with
staff about their condition and fewer felt appropriately informed.
Senior<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:36:50"></hs_TimeCode> doctors
now say that lives are being put at risk, because people are unable to
get through to the new 111 number, which replaced NHS
Direct. Many argue that it is difficult to access and mistrusted by
patients, which has led to an increase in emergency call-outs and trips
to A and E. Desperately ill patients are left

is in an unusual situation. We have two district general hospitals
within eight miles of each other, one in each of the almost twin cities
of Gloucester and Cheltenham. Some years ago, the hospitals came under
the management of a single NHS foundation trust, and there is an almost
inescapable business rationale for the trust management always to try
to centralise services in one hospital or the other. Some services,
including oncology and cardiology, have been centralised in Cheltenham,
but with emergency services there has been a slight drift towards
Gloucester, starting with neonatal intensive care and then trauma. That
might 
<?notus-xml column=237?>make business sense to the trust, but it poses a problem because they
are services that people clearly want to get to in a hurry. They are a
bit like maternity services, in that people value having them within
their town and do not want to have to try to find them in a hurry in an
unfamiliar
setting.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000026">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:50:05"></hs_TimeCode>
current situation in Cheltenham reflects exactly the national picture
that the right hon. Lady described, and we have heard from the
King’s Fund that in the final three months of 2012 232,000
people nationwide waited more than four hours in A
and E, a 38% increase on the previous quarter. Some of that
is clearly a seasonal increase, reflecting winter issues, but it has
certainly been the case in Gloucestershire, where the situation has
been rather unequal, with waiting times significantly and regularly
higher in Gloucester than in Cheltenham. People are, therefore,
concerned about the further centralisation of services in Gloucester,
because they fear that the capacity of the emergency department there
to cope with the increase will be even
worse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000027">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:50:05"></hs_TimeCode>
situation has been explained in a number of ways. There can be a
seasonal explanation—there is always a winter upturn, and we
have had a series of bugs and infections, including the winter vomiting
virus. Those are known factors, which vary from year to year. There is,
however, a new factor in the mix, which is the 111 out-of-hours
service. I have anecdotal evidence from local GPs that far more
referrals into hospitals and A and E departments
are occurring as a result of the introduction of the 111 service. The
GPs think that they ran a rather good out-of-hours service before,
under a different NHS trust, and the new service is clearly causing
problems if their accounts are to be
believed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000028">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:50:05"></hs_TimeCode>
must gather reliable data, but the evidence that I have from doctors is
that they are getting fewer requests to call patients back, through the
111 service, and that a number of individuals have been referred
unnecessarily to A and E, partly because the
initial triage is done by people who are not really medically
qualified. They have a stock set of questions and the approach is not
very sensitive, so it seems that the safest thing for the operators to
say is, “The best thing is to go to A and
E.” If that is responsible for part of the upsurge in cases, it
is adding to our existing
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000029">The
other problem in Cheltenham and Gloucester is the shortage of, and the
difficulty of recruiting, emergency consultants and registrars. The
guidelines are that there are supposed to be
10<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:50:15"></hs_TimeCode> doctors in
each emergency department, which would mean 20 for Cheltenham and
Gloucester. Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has told me
that it has managed to fill only 11 of those posts. That is true: I
have had independent corroboration from people working in the human
resources department of the hospital, who have occasionally advertised
for emergency posts and had no applicants. There is clearly a
significant problem that they say is part of the national picture of a
shortage of trained emergency doctors available to be recruited to
emergency departments, which is adding to management pressures and the
difficulty of managing the flow of patients into A
and E
departments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:51:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000030">That
raises some other questions. Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation
Trust is, as the name suggests, a foundation trust. It has the freedom
to advertise higher salaries, to apply a “hard to
recruit” bonus and 
<?notus-xml column=238?>to try harder to attract more consultants and registrars to its
emergency department. As far as I can see, it does not appear to be
doing so at the moment. It may be that that does not make such good
sense in business terms. Emergency is a relatively expensive function
for a trust compared with others, such as orthopaedics, which appears
to generate income for the trust. It would be worrying if such business
considerations were interfering with a trust’s ability to take
management decisions that might attract more consultants and registrars
into an emergency
department<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:52:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000031">I
want the Minister to address, first, the national issue of the shortage
of emergency doctors, which is forcing difficult decisions on trust
managements and, secondly, what she thinks trust managements’
best response might be. For instance, would it be better for them to
wait for the outcome of the Keogh review into emergency services,
rather than to take pre-emptive decisions now to take such actions as
downgrading emergency services at Cheltenham general
hospital?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000032">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:50:16"></hs_TimeCode>
suggestion is not that that hospital will be closed outright, but
simply that it will be downgraded so that bluelight referrals at night

That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:53:01"></hs_TimeCode> seems like
a small and not drastic change, but there have been a whole series of
changes—to trauma, neonatal intensive care, children’s
services and maternity—and each small change by the trust seems
to justify another change. In itself, that is worrying, because who
knows what will follow this decision. Will all bluelight referrals be
diverted to Gloucester? In a few years’ time, will Cheltenham
end up with simply a minor injuries unit for a town of 120,000 people,
given that we instinctively know that had the management arrangements
been different and two different hospital trusts were in existence,
they would be fighting to keep the services

timing of the consultation is very unfortunate, coming at just the
moment of the changes to the NHS organisational structure. Perhaps I am
a little cynical, but I cannot help thinking that the trust’s
timing may not be entirely accidental. The primary care trust, which
fought strongly to keep services at both Cheltenham and Gloucester
reasonably level—it tried to serve both populations and keep a
degree of equity between them—has been wound up and handed over
to a clinical commissioning group that has failed to attract a single
doctor from Cheltenham to serve on its board, so that a town 
of 120,000 people has no local voice on the main commissioning body. At
the precise moment that it started—new and relatively
experienced compared with the old PCT—the trust has chosen to
launch changes to one of the services that is most controversial and
most valued by local people, which is a very unfortunate coincidence of
timing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:54:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000034">I
want us to hear, if we can, the Minister’s real plan for the
future of emergency services, and to see whether there is any long-term
vision about how local MPs and people can put a case to their trusts
for the preservation of local emergency departments wherever possible.
We need to deliver care to people as close as possible to their homes,
and not drift into a situation of its being more and more centralised
in particular locations, which may enable trust managements to have a
rational case for attracting more sub-specialisms and doctors to their
department, but leave a town the size of Cheltenham, with 120,000
people, with a much worse service.</hs_Para>

Cheltenham, the wait is 38 minutes, according to the trust’s
website. At Gloucester Royal hospital, it is 68 minutes—already
more than an hour—at a time when demand
should actually be very low. Those emergency departments are struggling
to cope, and it seems to me that the waiting times are symptoms of a
rather deeper and more difficult problem that we have to
tackle.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_23_PT_1/440A22C7EE3178A3F841C9CB388D5CE256671628" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="23 April 2013">Tuesday

want to explain that, as the Minister will know, Trafford general
hospital—it has its own accident and emergency department, but
since last year has been part of the larger Central Manchester
University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust—is subject to NHS
Greater Manchester’s recommendation that the accident and
emergency unit should initially be downgraded to an urgent care centre
and, in due course, to a minor injuries unit. The Secretary of State
requested advice on that and other reconfiguration changes at Trafford
from the Independent Reconfiguration Panel, which I know he has
received and is now considering. I am grateful that the
Minister’s colleague,

Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Central
Suffolk and North Ipswich (Dr Poulter), has agreed to meet me and my
parliamentary neighbours to discuss that situation which, as I am sure
she appreciates, is causing great local
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:58:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000040">The
first issue that I want to highlight is that it is
important—certainly for elected Members, but also for the wider
public—that there is absolute transparency of data and
information about what is going on in our A and
Es. A couple of weeks ago I tabled a parliamentary question asking
about waiting times at all Greater Manchester accident and emergency
units, because constituents have been coming to me with anecdotal
evidence of delays and problems, such as those described by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:58:32"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Cynon Valley, 
<?notus-xml column=240?>and I wanted to assess the evidence before taking the matter further. I
asked for information at the level of not only the NHS foundation
trust, but every individual unit, because I am obviously particularly
concerned about my local A and E, which falls
within a larger foundation
trust.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000041">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:58:57"></hs_TimeCode>
was surprised to receive a written answer last Tuesday that told me
that the information was not available at individual unit level. Of
course, that is nonsense. I contacted Central Manchester University
Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which said that it could of course give
me the information for Trafford, and it duly did. It absolutely does
not build confidence in my mind or that of the public if we do not
receive clear written answers from Ministers. I was glad that I could
raise that issue in health questions last
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T09:59:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000042">My
first question to the Minister is: what can she do to ensure that there
is absolute transparency of data available to elected representatives
and the public at large about what is going on in our areas? I am sure
that she would agree that it is unhelpful for speculation and anecdote
to inform what the public think is going on, when data are available
and might present a different picture.</hs_Para>

matter I want to raise is related to waiting times. Obviously, there is
a definition around the four-hour waiting time target, but
patients’ experience is about not just when they arrive at
accident and emergency and when they are passed on to wherever they are
going next, but an end-to-end process, which starts from the minute
they pick up the phone. They feel that the whole experience can be very
protracted. They have to phone, wait for an ambulance or a paramedic to
come, potentially wait in the car park to get into the hospital, wait
in A and E to be triaged—they are often
triaged quite quickly—and then wait around to see more medical
experts. Then there is further waiting around before some clinical
disposal ultimately
results<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:00:36"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is a sense that the totality of the end-to-end process is becoming very
protracted, and that is certainly causing public concern. I invite the
Minister to comment on the context in which people are waiting and
being seen within A and E units and what thoughts
the Government have on addressing the end-to-end patient experience,
because that is what matters to my
constituents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:01:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000044">Thirdly,
the changes that are being proposed at Trafford, and at the hospitals
in the constituencies of other hon. Members, are part of a much broader
range of changes both in Greater Manchester and in the NHS as a whole.
In the context of the proposed changes for Trafford,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:01:14"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Paul Goggins) has
repeatedly asked what the impact will be on the neighbouring hospital
at Wythenshawe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:03:20"></hs_TimeCode>,
and we are equally concerned about what will be going on at
A and E units at Manchester Royal infirmary and
Salford Royal. It is clear to us that it is not possible to remove
capacity at one unit if there is insufficient capacity at the
neighbouring units to mop up the work. My right hon. Friend believes
that Wythenshawe is not in a position to take on significant additional
numbers of A and E admissions without substantial
extra investment. The purpose of my written question to Ministers about
NHS trusts around Greater Manchester was to try to get a picture of
what is going on across the whole city region. Clearly, capacity on the
wider geographic basis is
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:02:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

important that we have provision in the community either to ensure that
people can be discharged quickly or to prevent them having to go to
A and E in the first place. That is at the heart
of the integrated care model to which we are all signed up in Trafford
and in which we believe very powerfully. However, the fact of the
matter is that services are being taken out before the community
provision appears to have been put in, and that cart-before-the-horse
approach does nothing to reassure local
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:02:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000046">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:02:33"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Cheltenham mentioned the problems that have arisen
following the launch of the 111 number, which had to be withdrawn in
Greater Manchester only a few hours after its launch because it simply
could not cope. I have no doubt that one consequence of the changes to
the out-of-hours service is that more people are likely to go to their
A and E. Equally, if that local A
and E in due course sees its hours curtailed or is
downgraded, there will be a knock-on impact on GPs, because they will
have more people presenting at their surgeries with emergency
conditions. As things stand, while that might be a good place for
people to go in theory, GPs do not have the capacity to see those
additional patients. Again, that is a failure of planning about which
people are
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:03:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000047">We
are also worried about the ambulance service in the north-west, which
has undergone some significant changes of late. There is also the
matter of the interface with mental health. Many people who present at
our A and E have both a physical and a mental
health problem. It might be that the mental health problem is the
underlying issue that is more crucial to resolve because it is probably
part of the driver of the physical condition.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042355000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000048"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:03:57"></hs_TimeCode>There
is a great deal of contextual challenge that is contributing to
people’s concern about the ability of accident and emergency
units, including the one at Trafford, to cope. It is clear to me that
without that context being properly resolved and without the guarantees
that all that other provision is properly in place, it is simply not
possible to start to withdraw services that people rely on because they
have nowhere else to go. There are also further broader contextual
changes that are causing us concern right now.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:04:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cheltenham mentioned the Keogh review. In Greater Manchester we
have the Healthier Together review, which, I am afraid to say, is still
opaque both to elected Members and to local people in terms of what it
might propose. Undoubtedly, it will have a significant impact on the
map of hospital, A and E and wider provision
across Greater Manchester. Again, people feel that they are being asked
to sign up to a decision about Trafford’s accident and emergency
unit without understanding what the context and provision across the
whole of Greater Manchester might look like in two or three
years’ time.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042355000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000049">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:05:10"></hs_TimeCode>
public are concerned, sceptical and worried. If Trafford general
hospital’s A and E is downgraded, they are
unsure where they will go with a particular condition in the future.
They do not know whether to travel to Trafford or to go to another
location, because Trafford might not be open or capable of dealing with
their problem. It is not that people are unwilling to travel to other
units when they understand that that is the right unit for them to go
to. In Greater Manchester, we have done a good job in persuading people
of the importance 
<?notus-xml column=242?>of going to Salford Royal if they have had a stroke, and of the
importance of the major trauma centres around the city, but there needs
to be clarity about what is on offer, where it is on offer, when it is
on offer and why they can feel confident, if the service is not being
provided locally, that that is in their best interests. They feel that
a local A and E is important to them. There is a
long conversation to be had with the public, which, I venture to
suggest to Ministers, nobody has tried to embark on as

it is grossly unfair for the trusts to have to balance what cannot be
balanced. Our Health Minister in Northern Ireland is doing a good job

explained to him the complaints that were made, and, in fairness, he
and his staff responded by putting in place a number of measures:
better allocation of staff when it comes to A and
E units; access to services centrally, which is sometimes required
rather than people having to go across town to another hospital to get
the service they need; and a more accountable and fluent monitoring
response at A and E units.

improvements are good news. However, as the restriction on moneys

taken place. I am particularly concerned about that issue. It is
closely monitored in the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly,

Health, Social Services and Public Safety receiving quarterly reports.
The Minister and I came into political life at the same time. We live
in different parts of the country, but we are good friends and we
communicate regularly on these issues. However, there is too much
pressure on the A and E departments for them to
be able to handle their case load, and I know that the Royal College of
Nursing, among other professional bodies, has expressed concern that
there is not enough cover, but once again this comes back to the
age-old issue of money and how the resources can be better
spent.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:13:11"></hs_TimeCode>my
opinion—and I believe that of many people—that the trusts
are doing as well as possible, but it is clear that the efficiencies

targets that have been set, and above all to ensure that patients

decisions that are made here. For that reason, I again implore the
Government to reconsider the efficiency targets that have been set.

and yet—as hon. Members know—we equally find
that hospitals in some of the outer parts of London are, frankly,
either being sold off or seeing their services hugely downgraded, such

the Member for Stretford and Urmston. She talked about the problems she
had experienced in extracting clear and concise information from the
Department of Health about waiting times in Manchester hospitals. I,
too, have asked several questions recently, not about waiting times but
about the provision of health services at hospitals in London. I have
simply been told that the Department does not hold that sort of
information and it has been recommended that I make freedom of
information requests. That is all well and good, but the public want to
be reassured that Ministers at the heart of Government understand what
is happening in hospitals out there and that they have an appreciation
of the wider picture so that they can develop their vision of hospital
services, whether they are A and E services or
maternity services, but I am not sure that we feel reassured when we
get such parliamentary answers that that is the case.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:16:38"></hs_TimeCode>two specific
points about Lewisham hospital. Hon. Members will know that, in
January, the Secretary of State for Health announced that Lewisham
hospital would have a smaller A and E department,
and that it would lose its maternity services. That was as a result of
the trust special administration process that took place in the South
London Healthcare NHS Trust, which was in huge financial difficulties.
The hospitals in Woolwich, Bromley and Sidcup had a very significant
operating deficit, and as a result of that we were told that the
hospital down the road in Lewisham would have its services decimated.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:17:23"></hs_TimeCode>The full
A and E department at Lewisham hospital will
close; all blue-light ambulances will go past Lewisham hospital to
other hospitals; all medical emergencies will not be able to be treated
at Lewisham hospital; and yet the Secretary of State still calls it a
“smaller” A and E
department.</hs_Para>

might think that, on the basis of taking capacity out of the system at
Lewisham hospital and—I should say—having to invest
£37 million in other hospitals to deal with the displacement of
people from Lewisham’s A and E department,
everything is operating smoothly and well in south-east London. That is
not the case. One in 10 people is waiting longer than four hours at
hospitals that used to be part of the South London Healthcare NHS
Trust, and now in Lewisham, one in 10 people is waiting longer than
four hours to be treated. That was not the case in Lewisham a year ago;
in March 2012, 97% of people were being treated at Lewisham hospital
within four hours. So there is huge pressure upon A
and E departments in south-east London.</hs_Para>

I asked Lewisham hospital for information about the number of times
that ambulances had been diverted to it from other hospitals. Lewisham
hospital told me that, since December 2012—in the last four
months—there have been 25 separate occasions when ambulances
have been diverted to Lewisham. On 10 of those occasions, ambulances
were diverted from the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Woolwich, and on 11
other occasions ambulances were diverted from the Princess Royal
university hospital in Bromley. Those are the very hospitals that are
meant to be picking up the people who will no longer be able to go to
Lewisham hospital when our full A and E
department goes. I seek a guarantee from the Minister that no changes
will be made at Lewisham hospital until these diverts from other
hospitals have stopped, and that no changes will 
<?notus-xml column=246?>be made until we see that, at the other hospitals I have mentioned, they
are dealing with patients within a four-hour window.</hs_Para>

should like to make two general points about some issues that have
already been touched on. There is a fundamental problem with
people’s understanding of where they should go for the best
possible treatment. The Government have asked Sir Bruce Keogh to
conduct a review of emergency care, which is much needed and timely. I
would rather the Government waited for the outcome of that review
before they took decisions about hospitals such as
Lewisham.</hs_ParaIndent><hs_Para UID="13042355000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000069">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:29:37"></hs_TimeCode>
the moment, when people are ill, they have no idea where they should
go. They are faced with a plethora of places. Should they go to their
general practitioner, a walk-in centre, a minor injuries unit or an
urgent care centre, or A and E? It is confusing
for people. If there was better information about where people can get
the most appropriate treatment, potentially people who do not need to
be in A and E would not go
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:20:38"></hs_TimeCode>. I do not
criticise people for going to A and E, because
they know that they will get treatment there and will be dealt
with—hopefully—quickly. We cannot expect them to
understand all the intricacies of what is available elsewhere. That
fundamental problem needs to be
addressed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:21:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042355000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042355000070">The

this. On 21 February, the president of the College of Emergency

at her local hospital. Several times when she turned up there, she did
not really need to be there. She was a poorly, lonely old lady. If we
are to address the number of people who present at A

ways of caring for people well and with dignity, especially towards the

impartial observer might think the coalition Government had inherited a
health service on the brink of collapse. The truth is that the
Government inherited an NHS that had been transformed from what the
previous Labour Government inherited after 18 years of Conservative
Government and under-investment. My area was one of many, perhaps
including Kettering, that were beneficiaries of considerable
investment. There were 100 new hospitals; actual spend on the NHS
increased from £30 billion to more than £100 billion; and
much of the aged NHS infrastructure was replaced. My area and many
others saw the construction of new walk-in centres, primary care
centres and a new generation of modern community hospitals. GP opening
hours were also extended. We have had the benefit of more doctors and
nurses than ever before. We also had NHS

better treatment closer to their communities. That was reflected in
public satisfaction with the NHS, which went from the lowest ever
recorded levels in the 1990s under the previous Conservative
Administration, to the highest ever recorded levels by the time Labour
left office. However, since the coalition Government took office, we

Horwood:</Member></B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the
reorganisation of the NHS. That time and effort would have been better
spent trying to work out how to deliver health care more
cost-effectively. But does not he rather undermine his case when
pretending that there has been a cut to the NHS budget, when an
objective analysis of the actual billions spent on the NHS clearly
shows that it has gone up? The difference between a cut and an
efficiency saving is that an efficiency saving is returned to the NHS

spent 40 sittings in Committee trying to resist what is now the Health

introduces. That includes those that are about to be implemented under
section 75, on the introduction of competition, which will fragment the

Members have quoted the King’s Fund and patient surveys, and the

acute trusts in England with an A and E unit,
missed the target in the last three months of 2012. I am not sure
whether Kettering was one of them, but those figures should be cause
for concern for everybody, including Ministers and the Prime Minister.
That is double the number of trusts that missed the target in the same

figures from the Department of Health and found that more than 1,000
patients have waited longer than the target time, including 536 in
County Durham and Darlington. Compared with 12 months ago, the number
of patients waiting more than four hours has increased by 200% in
County Durham and Darlington. South Tees and York have also seen
increases in excess of 200%, compared with the previous year. However,
at the Newcastle foundation trusts, the percentage increase is a

those figures are quite dreadful.</hs_Para>

measures. The fragmentation of the service is certainly contributing to
the problem. There is also the issue of people not having access to
their GP within 48 hours. Like many Members, I have, unfortunately, had
experience of close family members and constituents being left with
little alternative but to

M. Morris:</Member></B> That is certainly a factor, and I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that issue. Part of the solution is a more visionary
approach and a care model that integrates NHS services with social care
in a seamless service. We need to end the fragmentation and to have
full co-operation. We do not want people—particularly elderly
patients—to be discharged from hospital, only for their cases
not to be followed up by social care or primary health care services.
That is a key challenge facing the Government. I will leave it at
that.</hs_Para>

me, the Royal College of Nursing, the College of Emergency Medicine and
the Care Quality Commission will be appalled that the key performance
indicators for the NHS, such as A and E waiting
times, are getting steadily worse. In the past six months, 582,811
people waited more than four hours in major A and
E units, compared with 420,921 for the same period in the previous
year. That is an increase of 161,890 people. That is not silly: it is a
question of people’s lives. Those figures relate to people in
need who did not get treatment in the time when they needed it. They
represent more than 500,000 extra waiting hours in one year. People
will find it hard to stomach the fact that there are now about 5,000
fewer nurses than there were in 2010, at  a time when, as hon.
Members on both sides of the House have mentioned, demand in our
A and E units is increasing.</hs_Para>

way to get the figure down—it has been touched on already in the
debate—would be to offer services for people with non-emergency
ailments, so that they do not feel the need to travel to an
A and E department. However, instead of NHS
Direct being used as a tool for easing pressure on A
and E departments, the roll-out of NHS 111 has turned into a
trade marked Government shambles. Patients calling the new 111 service
wait hours for advice. One patient waited 11 hours and 29
minutes for a call back. No wonder they feel that they have to go to
A and E, when they cannot trust a telephone
service with such an inadequate response
rate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042356000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042356000052"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T10:45:21"></hs_TimeCode>Accident
and emergency departments are a litmus test, or a barometer, for the
performance of the NHS as a whole. If people are waiting in
A and E, it means that there are too few beds or
too few staff to cope with demand. That is just a fact of health
service planning. If there are too few beds, it is because community
services 
<?notus-xml column=253?>are being cut and patients who should be at home are kept in hospital.
That reverberates back through the entire system. If patients who could
be at home are in hospital, beds are occupied. If beds are occupied,
A and E staff cannot admit patients. If
A and Es are full, paramedics cannot hand over
patients. If patients are queuing in the back of ambulances, those
ambulances cannot respond to a potentially serious call-out. One
failure leads to another. Each compounds the other. That is what is so
serious about the debate. It is not just about the patient sitting in
A and E for hours on end; the statistics I have
highlighted show much more than that—the experiences of patients
throughout the entire system.</hs_Para>

in the current problems of emergency departments: the difficulty in

A and E can reflect one person in a bed on a ward
and another waiting at home for an ambulance. I hope the Minister will
acknowledge and accept that, and explain what the Government plan to
do. It is essential that they explicitly acknowledge the problems faced
by accident and emergency in England. Constant denials do them no
credit. They must acknowledge the scale of the problem before any
solutions can be introduced.</hs_Para>

NHS in England is completely different from the NHS in Wales. I expect
the Government will be tempted to compare the two, but I want to
address the issue head on. The reality is that Welsh Ministers are
dealing with a £2.1 billion real-terms cut to their budgets.
Yet, despite that, they have still managed to protect NHS services.
There are now more GPs working in Wales than in 2010, and the number of
nurses, midwives and health visitors has remained consistent. That is
in stark contrast to England, where nurse numbers are falling. I am
sure that hon. Members who have heard such tired comparisons over and
over would be interested to know that there are differences in the way
A and E waiting times are measured in the two
countries, and in how frequently performance is measured.</hs_Para>

want to point out that it is misleading to try to make a direct
comparison. However, it is fair to say that all parts of the UK are

key difference is that in Wales, Labour are doing something about it,
whereas in

problems that others and I have outlined today are well known to many,
but they are still sadly neglected by the Government. Despite its
imperfections and its many real challenges, the NHS remains one of the
best models of national health care in the world. It is filled with
dedicated professionals who believe passionately in the aims and values
of the service, but it is clear that an expensive, unwanted and unloved
reorganisation, combined with Government-induced staff shortages, are
causing and have caused deterioration in performance. That is unfair on
health care professionals, and, far more importantly, it is unfair on
patients. I look forward to the Minister explaining in detail how her
Government intend to get a grip and bring all A

Fovargue</B> (Makerfield) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Mr Hollobone. I am pleased to have secured
this debate on the under-occupancy penalty and its effects in my
borough of Wigan. The importance of the policy has been demonstrated
not just by the number of constituents who have raised the issue but by
the unprecedented comments by the very non-political chief executive of
Wigan and Leigh housing trust, who in a recent article for the <I>Wigan
Evening Post</I> slated the policy and its effect on the trust and its
tenants, calling it “a wicked policy” that will not save
any money on the housing benefit bill but will bring misery and
hardship, forcing thousands of people in Wigan to pay up from already
overstretched incomes or move to smaller properties, which are already
in short supply in the
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042356000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042356000081">The
stock of one and two-bedroom properties in Wigan stands at 12,266, of
which 1,496 became vacant in 2011-12. Demand for those properties
before the implementation of the bedroom tax was 3,177. There are
10,110 three-bedroom properties, of which 553 became vacant, but only
353 applications were made for those vacancies. As can be seen,
families are not tightly packed into overcrowded dwellings waiting for
selfish people with acres of vacant space to move and release a home.
In fact, contrary to Government rhetoric, the reverse is
true.</hs_Para>

many times from the Minister and others that this is about fairness,
and that people in the private rented sector claiming local housing
allowance are not allowed a spare room. I challenge that. I have worked
on an LHA pilot and I am familiar with the rules. I recently tabled a
parliamentary question asking how many people were under-occupying
while claiming local housing allowance. The answer was, as I knew, that
local housing allowance is based on the characteristics of the
household and is not affected by the number of bedrooms in the property
occupied. Two-bedroom properties in Wigan are readily available at the
local housing allowance rate of £80.77 per couple. One-bedroom
properties are much scarcer, so people in the private rented sector can
have a spare bedroom without paying for the
privilege.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042356000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042356000083">The
potential for social housing tenants to move to the private sector
discredits another purported reason for introducing the policy: saving
money. According to Government figures, £2.9 million could be
saved annually in Wigan if nobody moved and everybody paid the penalty
or if everyone downsized within the social rented sector. However, the
harsh reality of the housing market in Wigan is that the shortfall of
one and two-bedroom properties in the social rented sector is causing
people to shift to the private sector, which could result in an
additional housing benefit cost of £229,000 in
2014-15.</hs_Para>

April, 38 of the 4,200 households affected have terminated their
tenancies. Each household that moves to the private rented sector
increases the housing benefit bill by £700 to £1,200 a
year. The move from one sector to the other is likely to go only one
way. Of the 1,100 people on the waiting list from the private rented 
<?notus-xml column=259?>sector, 80% require one or two bedrooms, which, we already know and I

need for a spare room. They are people like my constituents Mr and Mrs

virtually housebound, enjoys fishing with a friend who takes him. It is
his only hobby, but the current penalty of £14.60 a week for his
“spare” bedroom means that he now cannot afford the

She feels that it is designed to evict her from her home. She cannot
afford the £20.75 that she must pay weekly. Before April, her
rent was covered in full by housing benefit. She is a full-time carer
for an elderly relative and her parents, and her income is minimal. She
is just about getting by on what she has at the moment. She does not
have any personal transport—she cannot drive—so her

memories and life are bound up with it. Time and money have been
invested to make it safe and secure; the family have created a memorial
garden in the back to the memory of her son, because thieves stole the
memorials from his grave. As a result of his death, she suffers
constantly from anxiety, stress and depression but, despite that,
manages to fulfil her caring responsibilities. The under-occupation
charge has exacerbated her problems with the worry of losing her home
and of wondering where she will be forced to live or whether she can
look after her auntie and parents. Her children have grown up and left

alone.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042356000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042356000093">Wigan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T11:14:10"></hs_TimeCode>

move away from their network of support—friends,

low wage, from their schools, from the area they grew up in and from

Wigan and most of the north of England, this policy will not deliver
the predicted savings or decrease overcrowding, but it will have a
detrimental impact on other areas covered by the public purse. It will

leading to increased rent arrears,

thousands of people. We have all heard horrendous and heart-wrenching

am under no illusion about the strength of feeling of many about the
removal of the spare room subsidy, but we are not introducing the
change lightly. A number of important principles lie behind the reform,
and it is only right to describe the main ones, because they provide
the context for the changes, which of course have a financial
imperative and other compelling reasons. Furthermore, no one has
offered a serious alternative to achieve the savings of £500
million a year, especially since housing benefit doubled in cash terms

McVey:</Member></B> That example is taken completely out of context;
one measure is about a business and ensuring that it remains, as well
as about how people spend their money, but the measure we are
discussing is about one set of finances that doubled in cash terms
under the hon. Lady’s Government to £23 billion and about
what we should do about it. We cannot pick and mix and move the
finances around; we have to get housing benefit under control, and I
will say how we are doing that, although I do not underestimate in any
way the complexity and difficulty of doing so. She said clearly that
this is about people, and I fully understand that it is about people,
which is why we have to get things right, not only for now but for
future generations—their children and their children’s
children—so it is always about people and getting the system
right. Another reason for the reform is that it will result in the
effective use of housing stock over time, because we also have to look
at the people in overcrowded accommodation, and in Wigan alone more
than 3,500 families are on the housing waiting
list.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042357000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042357000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Yvonne Fovargue" PimsId="5720" UID="13042357000028" xid="1122" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042357000028">Yvonne

but from different angles and not only for those renting from private
landlords or those in the social rented sector. It is about fairness
between all those different people who are living under different

them in the social rented sector and 8,500 in the private rented
sector, so 31% of people are already under the rules that we are
introducing. May I clarify with the hon. Lady that today she is asking
not only to oppose the measures that are progressing but to repeal the
previous Government’s measures, brought in gradually from 2008?

applied to the social rented sector are exactly the same. If a private
landlord is charging below the median market 30<Sup>th</Sup>

associations want to regroup or make a change from a three-bedroom to a

shaking her head, so Labour would not reverse that and we seem to be
having a fake argument today; the Opposition are opposing for the sake

announcements concerning foster carers and parents of armed forces
personnel when they are away from home on operational duty, and on what
the discretionary fund could be used for. We have talked about disabled
children who cannot share a room with a sibling and who are exempt, as
are pensioners. Various people will be exempt and there will be
significant discretionary payments, which will be constantly monitored

overcrowded. We want that not just for 2013. We looked at what has
happened over the last 10 years when payment costs doubled, and we want
what is right now and what will be right in the future. It invariably

people on the waiting list for properties. In Wigan, 80% of those in
private rented accommodation and on the waiting list are waiting for
one and two-bedroom properties, but there is an over-supply of
three-bedroom properties. She also talked about people moving to the
private rented sector, where rents are higher. For every person who is
displaced there will be a cost, and the policy is likely to lose money
for Wigan because of the over-supply of three-bedroom properties and
the under-supply of one and two-bedroom properties. Families are not

people were in three-bedroom properties when they should have been in
two-bedroom properties, why did they not do something about that work?
They are beginning to do it now, which is why there are so many spare
rooms. That work should have been done, but it was not. No attention
was paid to needs, what should have been built, and changing family
demographics. It is right that housing associations could have
reallocated housing by changing three-bedroom houses to two-bedroom
houses. All those offers were on the table and are still on the table.

few moments, I will say what we are doing. Our imperative is to sort
out our housing stock, to put people who need houses into the bedrooms
that exist. For the first time ever, we are ensuring that Britain is
building. Under the previous Labour Government, where most of the
problem comes from, there was a near collapse in the building of social
housing, which fell to an all-time record low. In every which way of
the argument, there was a pinch effect from lack of building, wrong
allocation of resources, massive overspending, and not caring about
those on waiting lists and those in overcrowded housing. We must deal
with that in its entirety, but there are differences in different
regions. I understand that, and the Government understand that, and
that is why we will constantly monitor what we are doing. There has
been a trebling of the discretionary fund, and Wigan is entitled to its
fair share of that. We need to work in partnership with best practices

in the past, the TA has become the repository for weapons and equipment
no longer used by the Regular Army. Selection may be neither as
rigorous nor as well funded as that of regular soldiers. Members of the
TA obviously do not have the same amount of time to sharpen or maintain
their military skills, as they normally hold down full-time jobs as
well. TA or reserve service is an add-on to their lives and it is one

serving on the front line is a subject that has interested me for some
time. In 2007, I wrote and presented a television programme on the
TA’s involvement 
<?notus-xml column=266?>in Iraq. In doing so, I interviewed a number of TA and reservist
soldiers on the job at the coalition air base near Basra. I was
surprised to find that about 14% of the personnel in the British forces
there were TA or reservists. In truth, I was very impressed by the TA
soldiers and reservists I found there. They were clearly professional
and up to the job. In my time in Northern Ireland and Bosnia, I, too,
had excellent TA soldiers under my command. They did very well. Today,
I gather that routinely about 10% of any force that the UK deploys will
be made up of TA and reservists. Since 2003, more than 28,000 TA
soldiers and reservists have been deployed on operations. That is a
tremendous record of service, which is a great credit to the TA and
reservists.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042392000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042392000012"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T14:34:08"></hs_TimeCode>The

better equipped, and better trained than the current TA. They are also
expected to take on a broader range of roles to meet the changing
security challenges that the UK will face in future. However, all that
has to be managed with very little change in man training

accept that the Government will maintain that we are in a totally new
ball game, but over recent years, the TA has consistently shrunk. In
1997, the 4th (Volunteer) Battalion the King’s Own Royal Border
Regiment went on its annual two-week camp with more than 400
soldiers. Last year, its successor battalion, the 4th Battalion the
Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, which is, in fact, an amalgamation
of three 1997 volunteer battalions—from the King’s
Regiment and the Queen’s Lancashire Regiment, as well as the
Kings Own Royal Border Regiment—went on its annual camp with
just 250 soldiers. That is worrying.</hs_Para>

strength of the TA this month apparently stands at 19,000 and its total
strength is 26,640. I presume that the figure of 19,000 must be based
on TA soldiers who have passed stage two of their training and have
picked up their bounty for doing their full annual 
<?notus-xml column=267?>commitment. However, to be honest, I do not believe that 19,000 TA
soldiers are readily available for operational deployment if

2007, when I researched the programme about TA soldiers deployed in
Iraq, my investigations suggested that, from a total TA strength of in
excess of 30,000 then, only about 7,000 to 8,000 were prepared to
deploy, could be released from their jobs, or indeed, were medically
fit enough to fight. A considerable number of TA officers and soldiers
seemed to be classified sick or, at least, lacked the required FE
medical category—FE meaning “fit for
everywhere<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T14:39:20"></hs_TimeCode>”.
Therefore, I am cagey about believing that the current TA really has
19,000 soldiers ready to fight. I bet that the figure is
much lower, and if that is the case, the idea that we will have
30,000 deployable Army reservists by 2018 stretches
belief.</hs_ParaIndent><hs_ParaIndent UID="13042392000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0001.htm#13042392000226">According<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T14:40:16"></hs_TimeCode>
to Defence Analytical Services and Advice, in the nine months between 1
April 2012 and 1 January this year, the TA actually reduced by 600
trained soldiers. That is hardly a good omen as we start the drive to
recruit 30,000 deployable and trained soldiers. I suspect that
considerably less than 50% of the current 19,000 trained TA
personnel could actually do the business. Even the Defence Secretary,
when questioned by the Defence Committee, suggested that that figure
was considerably lower—as I recall, about 14,000.

need to fish for them in a pool in excess of 80,000. He says that he
repeatedly made this point when serving and had sent a letter stressing
this requirement to the Chief of the General Staff last July. If I am
right, getting 30,000 trained and deployable soldiers by 2018 may be
something of a pipe dream, and, if so, this will have a dramatic impact

try to ensure that Army Reserve units deploy complete, but getting a
large number of people released from their normal jobs simultaneously
and with agreement from the individuals, families and employers would
be very difficult. Undoubtedly, it would require an incredible amount
of staff work and effort, unless, of course, the nation is fighting for
its life, as it was from 1939 to 1945. So I am intrigued to see how the

local TA centres go, I think there is far less chance that Army Reserve
soldiers will travel long distances from home 
<?notus-xml column=268?>for training, presumably in Regular Army bases. Not having their parent
unit close to their families is hardly an Army Reserve recruiting
incentive. On that point, local TA centres will often be the only
evidence available to local people that we actually have an Army, as

defences. Ministers have told me that they are confident we will reach
that target of 30,000 available Army Reservists by 2018. I truly hope
they are right, but I remain to be convinced. I am also a little

is a serious need to address reservists’ and their
families’ support requirements, which are different from those
of regulars. Findings by the King’s Centre for Military Health
Research indicate that, after operations, reservists are at greater
risk of suffering mental health-related problems than regular soldiers.
A 10-year study on the health and well-being of UK Gulf war veterans
concluded that reservists were twice as likely to have mental health
problems as their regular counterparts. The reasons behind this
increased risk are not fully known, but the issue may in part be
because of the differences between support networks for regulars and
reservists. Unlike their colleagues in the regular forces, reservists
do not have an extended period of time 
<?notus-xml column=269?>surrounded by their peers when they return home from duty. They often
swiftly revert to their civilian job, without the opportunity to share
experiences with others who have served alongside them. Support

only six months in a three-year period and it is clear that relatively
senior military personnel still do not have a grasp on how that can be
delivered. Why would somebody join the Regular Army, wanting to become
a professional soldier, if they are to be told after their training,
“Congratulations, you are off to the adaptable force, where you
will get your kit for only six months in three years and you will
effectively be doing something useful for only six months in three

Throughout history, the reserves have risen to the challenges that they
have been set. I appreciate the concerns of regular soldiers and
regiments that the Regular Army has to contract, but the British Army
has contracted and expanded over the years in accordance with perceived
threats. To listen to some hon. Members, one would think that no
regiment in the British Army had hitherto been disbanded. My
grandfather served as a regular in the Highland Light Infantry and my
great grandfather served as a regular in the Gordon Highlanders, and
both regiments were disbanded many years ago. The reserves have managed
to fulfil full-time regular roles with great efficiency. My hon. Friend
the Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart) made it clear that when he was
interviewing soldiers in Iraq, he could not distinguish between
full-time regular soldiers and the reservists, because the reservists
demonstrated all the professional skills of a regular
soldier.</hs_Para>

railway unit that is made up almost entirely of Network Rail employees.
Its intention is to keep a railhead open from ports to theatres of war.
It was used in Kosovo, and its guys are very committed. When I was
recently in Kosovo, the Kosovan Government said that they would be very
willing to have them go there to continue their training, if the

non-commissioned officers of the 4th Mechanised Brigade who said the
same thing—that reserves are often as good as or in

their enthusiasm and their determination to prove themselves alongside

shall draw on a recent example from my previous unit. I know a new
recruit who signed up enthusiastically last August, but the process and
the administration have taken such a long time that he has only just
been able to join the unit and begin his basic training. An
eight-month-plus delay before a new recruit can even begin basic
training is a major obstacle to the kind of recruitment drive the
Government need and hope for. It is no surprise that TA numbers are
falling when that is a recruit’s first experience of the
reserves. If that is the best we can do, I fail to see how we will ever

can improve the capability and effectiveness of our reserve forces,
including issues such as kit, training days and manpower and, in the

reservists, particularly and importantly among employers. Although I am

employees serving in the reserves, small and medium-sized enterprises,
with work forces of only a dozen or so, might find it more difficult to
allow staff to leave for a tour of duty or extended training, or to go

“Future Reserves 2020” review could be a great
opportunity for the future of our armed forces. Fostering a
“whole force” mentality and a closer relationship between
regulars and reservists could help to eliminate some of the obstacles
that frequently make life difficult for reservists. The indisputable
fact is that reservists currently operate on 35 man-training days a
year—a number which it is planned to increase to only 40
days —compared with 223 working days for a soldier in
the regulars. The “Future Reserves 2020” review states
the desire to deploy reservists as sub-units, or even perhaps full
units, while recognising that it is impossible to train sub-units to
the standard required within the 12-month mobilisation window as things
stand. Significantly increasing the number of man-training days
required would place a huge demand on reservists and their civilian
employers, and I am not convinced that an extra five days alone will be
enough to progress from our current situation to one in which we can
mobilise sub-units trained to the necessary standard. As such, it seems
that far greater investment is needed in training infrastructure if we
are to accommodate greater numbers of reservists and train them to a
higher level than we currently

large number of reservists, as well as radically to restructure the
reserve forces as a whole, will mean that the savings made will be
significantly less than expected. It is imperative to ensure that we

any capability gap left by the reduction in the size of the regulars.
We cannot afford to be left with an under-strength military because the

was elected to Parliament on a mandate to increase the size of the
Army, yet the country now faces the reality of a force of only 82,000
soldiers. That is the smallest it will have been since before the
Napoleonic wars, despite us all having seen how stretched we have been
in recent years in conflicts such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Much tribute has been paid recently to the performance of our troops in
the Falklands conflict and the leadership of Baroness Thatcher, but the
sad truth is that we could not mount that type of operation on such a

I was a young platoon commander in Berlin in 1984, we were told not to
worry, because the quality of our troops and our kit would see us
through. We knew very well that we could hold out only for so long,
because quantity has a quality all of its own, as the German forces on

mention that because I see similarly flawed thinking in the
Government’s plans for 30,000 reservists somehow to plug the gap
left by the loss of 20,000 regular troops. Let us be clear: this plan
is designed to save money. It is not what the MOD would have wanted to
do, as the CGS confirmed to the Defence Committee. The focus seems to
be on the bottom line. The plan might work on paper, but a number of us
severely doubt whether it will work on the
ground<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:12:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042392000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0002.htm#13042392000068">I
have three main concerns. First, could this be a false economy? The
Green Paper admitted that it costs more to train reservists than
regular soldiers, a fact confirmed by the Secretary of State during
Defence questions. When we add in other factors, such as
force-generation figures and the additional costs of matching a TA
soldier’s civilian salary, there is a big question mark over how
much this will all cost. To date, the Government have been coy about
costings. We are promised a White Paper, but it has been too long in
the coming. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:12:48"></hs_TimeCode>As
several colleagues have said, none of that would matter were it not for
the fact that five regular infantry battalions will be disbanded over
the next 18 months; indeed, 20,000 regular troops have been given their
marching orders. Pursuing such a policy before we are sure that the
reservist plan will work is foolhardy and a high-risk
strategy.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042392000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0002.htm#13042392000069"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:13:15"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly,
I have concerns about whether 30,000 reservists could plug the
capability gap. In my day—in the 1980s—TA reservists,
gallant though they were, were essentially expected to ship out to
Germany and wait for the 
<?notus-xml column=276?>Warsaw pact forces to come to them. Today, reservists are expected to
have a much broader range of roles, but they are still expected to
achieve that higher skill base with about 35 to 40 days’
training. We live in a world where challenging, asymmetrical warfare
will become the
norm<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:14:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042392000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0002.htm#13042392000070">My
third concern is about boots on the ground. I doubt whether 30,000
reservists can plug the gap. The Government make great play of the fact
that they have had many expressions of support from prospective
employers, but expressions of support and boots on the ground are often
two very different things. The latest MOD figures I have—they
are fresh out of the MOD, and the Minister is welcome to challenge them
if he so wishes—show that the establishment strength of the TA
infantry is about 6,700 soldiers, but only 2,800 of them are actually
eligible for mobilisation. That suggests an effective rate of about
40%. The MOD’s own figures—as I say, the Minister is
welcome to challenge them if he  so wishes—suggest that,
in terms of plugging the gap left by 20,000 regulars, the
Government’s estimate of 30,000 reservists is way off beam. A
minimum of 50,000 reservists is more the ballpark
figure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:15:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042392000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/halltext/130423h0002.htm#13042392000071">We
then need to look at further factors, which could throw even the figure
of 50,000 into doubt. MOD figures confirm that the TA is losing
infantry soldiers. Furthermore, as a number of colleagues have pointed
out, the current economic climate means that small and medium-sized
enterprises, in particular, will struggle to allow key employees to
leave employment with them for extended periods without being
compensated by the MOD. I am not convinced that that costing has been
factored in.</hs_Para>

those three reasons—value for money, the capability deficit and
boots on the ground—several of us have severe reservations about
the Government’s plans. Meanwhile, however, those plans are
having distorting effects on the ground. Excellent infantry battalions
are being lost, and the 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers is a
case in point. It is one of the most experienced battalions in the
British Army, having served in all the major conflicts during the past
15 years, including Kosovo and Bosnia. It remains one of the best
recruited. By the MOD’s own admission, it was not one of the
original five infantry battalions to be disbanded; instead, more poorly
recruited battalions were meant to go. However, through interference,
intervention or whatever we want to call it, it was decided to save a
poorly recruited battalion north of the border. The MOD then had to go
hunting for a battalion south of the border, and, for some reason, fell

larger battalions. However, that distortion means the Government are
spending millions of pounds unnecessarily supporting understrength

economical to keep well-recruited battalion families together than to
spend millions of pounds trying to bring understrength battalions up to
strength. Such a policy simply suggests we are reinforcing

these plans are fundamentally flawed. Parliament has not been made
aware of the costings to justify their execution, despite the fact that
five regular infantry battalions have already been given their marching

see whether the plans work first, before losing 20,000 regular

am concerned that those changes will mean the midlands losing half its

yeomanry regiments in the Territorial Army. The people of Dudley make
an enormous contribution to A Squadron. They recently
recruited  47 new trainees, and another 60 leads are currently
being processed. That is exactly the sort of contribution that the
Minister would want communities such as mine to make, so that the
Territorials can expand. Two dozen from the regiment are currently
serving the country overseas. That is an enormous contribution, and the
people of Dudley are very committed to the TA.</hs_Para>

If we are to produce the volunteer ethos, soldiers need to be commanded
by people who are used to dealing with employers, understand how to
market training to soldiers with competing demands and, above all, have
the moral plus that comes from being able to look a soldier in the eye,
when he is under serious pressure from his employer, and say,
“I’ve been there too”, not someone who can take
Mondays off. To do that, we must provide more support for Territorial
Army commanding officers, so that people with busy civilian jobs can

of the extra reserves, and they will of course be top notch, will they
be enough to fulfil all the roles, commitments and responsibilities

here, or not doing here, with other countries. I always think that it
is a great danger to compare the United Kingdom and what we are trying
to do with our armed services with another country, such as America,

from where the next crisis will come, and we do not know the nature of

not a substitute for, regular forces. If trained-up former regulars
constitute our reserve, we will have a better chance to get them to the
sort of standards that we need very quickly than when we are dealing
with civilian-only reserves. Nevertheless, there is potential in both
cohorts. I am concerned that the strategic context is being skewed by
budgetary constraints. The truth of the matter is that we are having

Secretary of State for Defence has set out his ambitious plans for the
future of our reserves, shifting a greater emphasis on to them by
doubling their numbers to 30,000 by 2020. The reserves have played an
important role in our forces. In recent times, they have served in the
Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. I believe that 29 reservists have

Friend the Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr Murphy) made it clear that
we support an enhanced role for our reserve forces. They make a very
useful contribution, particularly in specialist roles, and we agree

expansion of our reserve forces will succeed only if the Government
work with employers. We must consider carefully the particular
challenges that members of the reserve forces face in employment, and
the Government are not dealing with the matter correctly. We have
already heard that the recruitment target is being missed, and it seems
that the MOD will have to increase recruitment by about 66% this year
even to stand a chance of meeting its targets.</hs_Para>

survey from the Federation of Small Businesses set out some of the
challenges. It found that six in 10 businesses would not consider
granting reservists additional leave for training, so if the Minister
wants the plan to become a reality, he might have to consider passing
further legislation. The survey also showed that one in three
businesses said that nothing would encourage them to employ a
reservist, while 39% of those who had employed a reservist, or would
consider having one in their company, said that the proposed reforms
would have a negative impact on their businesses. A staggering 89% said
that they had not heard of the MOD’s employer awareness events,

proposals were announced in November, the Secretary of State spoke
about a kitemark to recognise employers that encourage and support
their employees to participate in the reserves. In principle, that is a
good idea, so we hope the Minister will be able to update us on when
the scheme will be in place. We also think that it could be extended to
companies that have a good record on employing military spouses and
veterans, because clearly more work needs to be done in that area.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:48:30"></hs_TimeCode>Membership of

the Government have cut numbers in the regular forces so dramatically,
the system has to work. The enhanced role for reservists must be
matched with improved training. We have heard a lot about an integrated
concept between reserves and regulars over the past few months. That
should not be limited to operations; it must also be extended to
preparation. If we are asking our forces to serve together on
operations, they must train together as well.</hs_Para>

have shown that reservists are much more likely than others to suffer
from poor mental health, especially if they have been on active duty,

reservists are less likely to have a military support network, they do
not receive the same decompression as the regulars and there is the
problem that reservists do not gain access to specialised MOD health
care in civilian life.

am sure that the Government are serious about meeting their target, so
they will want to take heed of the Royal British Legion and Combat
Stress, which have come together to highlight the problems of mental
health care among reservists. Post-deployment care needs to improve,
and we have to ensure that employers have a better understanding of the
issues that reservists can face when they return from serving. Access
to MOD health care needs to be considered much more
carefully.</hs_Para>

should not forget about the families of reservists, although the recent

30,000 is well within historic norms. In 1997, the Territorial Army was
over 50,000 strong; it was reduced to around 40,000 by 2000; by 2009,
it was down to just 26,000; and we now reckon that we have about 19,000
trained reserves. That shows that the current initiative to increase
its trained strength from the current level of around
19,000 to 30,000 is perfectly
achievable. Indeed, to look at it in parochial terms, this increase
would require rather fewer than 20 individuals per parliamentary
constituency to join up and to train in the Territorial
Army.</hs_Para>

I have said, we need a change in the mindset regarding reserves, and a
change in the attitude towards them. I absolutely believe that this
policy is the right thing to do. It is not that we are keen to reduce
the regular Army, but it is ridiculous to have a trained reserve of
19,000 for a country of our size; that is a ridiculously small number.
We can do better than that—using reserves has huge social
benefits—and we shall do better than that. Rather than admire
the problems that we faced on inheriting an overblown defence budget in

the points raised by my hon. Friend, sharia
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:09:50"></hs_TimeCode> is the code
of personal religious law governing the conduct of Muslims. Those
principles can extend to all aspects of people’s lives. There
are a number of sharia councils in England and Wales that help Muslim
communities resolve civil and family disputes by making recommendations
by which they hope that the parties will abide, but
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:10:40"></hs_TimeCode> make it
absolutely clear that they are not part of the court system in this
country and have no means of enforcing their decisions. If any of their
decisions or recommendations are illegal or contrary to public
policy—including equality policies such as the Equality Act
2010—or national law, national law will prevail all the time,
every time. That is no different from any other council or tribunal,

is proud of its tradition of religious tolerance. The Government do not
prevent individuals from seeking to regulate their lives through
religious beliefs or cultural traditions. Provided that an activity

use of religious councils or other extra-legal bodies to deal with
civil disputes is well established and non-contentious. Communities
have the option to use religious authorities to adjudicate disputes and
to agree to abide by their decisions on a voluntary basis, but such
decisions are subject to national law and are not legally enforceable.
Any member of any community should know that they have the right to
refer to an English court at any point, especially in the event that

Friend makes the point more ably than I can that much of the great work
to reduce health inequalities is not about whether there is an urgent
care centre or an accident and emergency centre within 500 yards or
5 miles of where someone lives. Work on public health is
critical, and that is why I am so proud that this Government have
increased the amount of money available to local authorities, which now
have responsibility for delivering public health. They had that
historically and we have returned that power to local level. That is
important in the delivery of improvements in public health. This
Government’s view is that local authorities, as in the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency, know their communities better than
Whitehall does. In the delivery of key and important work on public
health, it is right and proper that local authorities have that
responsibility. They, too, have a statutory duty to deliver on health
inequalities. That runs through all their work of looking after the
public’s health, but, most importantly, addresses those very
factors that cause the sort health inequalities of which we are all
conscious. For example, there is a clear demographic link between
smoking and diabetes.</hs_Para>

local hospital and looking at a whole new way of
delivering a better pathway not just of care, but of early diagnosis

Rotherham has taken a totally joined-up approach. GPs are working with

point, however, is that we know that if we look at diabetes, many other
boxes are ticked in improving the lot and the health of our population.
Certain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:56:00"></hs_TimeCode> parts of
our population, in particular, have suffered from health inequalities,
and my hon. Friend makes a very good point about some of our

of type 2 diabetes, as there is in the Afro-Caribbean population.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:52:03"></hs_TimeCode> we look at
diabetes prevention, earlier treatment and diagnosis, and then proper
treatment and good outcomes, other boxes are ticked—for example,
obesity and being overweight, and all the other things that often flow
from diabetes, such as the link with cardiovascular disease and so on.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:52:30"></hs_TimeCode>My hon. Friend

Government have established a comprehensive measurement system designed
to measure not only overall improvement, but, in particular,
inequalities. The NHS outcomes framework—I know that these words
do not trip off the tongue and that they may be lost on the majority of
completely normal people, but they are important documents—forms
the basis for measuring progress on delivering improved results for
patients and reducing health inequalities. The NHS England business
plan commits to assessing health inequalities across a range of
dimensions in the NHS outcomes framework, and those important documents
guide our clinicians, the commissioners, and everybody involved in
ensuring that we live longer, healthier, and happier lives. That
exercise may reveal important health inequalities that have not
previously been evident.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:56:15"></hs_TimeCode> public
health outcomes framework includes an overarching aim to reduce
differences in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy between
communities, through greater improvements in more disadvantaged

indicators, including breakdowns by key equality and inequality

needed.</hs_Para>

am looking forward to the time when we begin to publish, by local
authority, the outcomes in each local authority on such things as the
stopping of smoking, and the work that is done on the abuse of alcohol.
Invariably, we gather that information, but when we start to publish it
and put it in the public domain, Members of Parliament, local
councillors and members of the public will all have access to it, and
they will be able to see how their local authority is performing. We
will not try and trick anybody and we will not be unfair, but we will
ask people to compare like with like. We make it clear to local
authorities that they do not all start from a level playing field,
because many of them, unfortunately, are inheriting public health
policies that were not some of the best. Therefore, we will recognise
that—it is one of the legacies left over from the previous
Administration. However, because people, GPs, and everybody involved in
the delivery of health, including councillors and Members of
Parliament, will have public access to such information, I have no
doubt that that will begin to drive a real desire to reduce health
inequalities.</hs_Para>

There is always good, healthy competition between professionals. We

think it is, Dr McCrea, you can bet your bottom dollar that
it will be wrong, but I know that in the past we have published the
outcomes of particular procedures and surgery, and that it has improved
the outcomes to everybody’s benefit when there has been a bit of
healthy competition between professionals. That is what we intend to do

the heart of our overall strategy is our commitment to support people
in building up a better income for their retirement. At the moment
every time a person moves job there is a significant risk that they
will leave behind a small pension pot, which may never get consolidated
to achieve a decent retirement income. Automatic transfers will help
people consolidate their savings so they get a clearer view of how
these savings build up over their working lifetime and help to ensure
they do not miss out on valuable retirement income. By 2050, we
estimate that our proposals would halve the number of dormant pots
created by automatic
enrolment.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13042371000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/wmstext/130423m0001.htm#13042371000056">Our

committee noted that the potential impact of HPV vaccination on
non-cervical cancers would make the current HPV immunisation programme
even more cost effective. However, it would remain the case that, given
the expected effects of immunisation on HPV transmission and the
indirect protection of boys that accrues from high levels of coverage
of HPV vaccination in girls, vaccination of boys in addition to girls
was unlikely to be cost effective. Evidence for indirect protection
would continue to be evaluated by the ongoing HPV surveillance
programme at the HPA. However, there may be little indirect protection
of MSM from the current immunisation programme. Therefore, the impact
and cost effectiveness of vaccination strategies for MSM with the offer
of vaccination through general practice and/or at genitourinary
medicine clinics needs to be assessed. Data on the prevalence of HPV
infections in MSM by age, and in the settings where vaccination could
be offered to MSM, are needed to determine the potential effectiveness
and cost effectiveness of HPV vaccination of MSM. The vaccines are less
effective against those with vaccine type HPV infection(s) at the time
of vaccination. Additionally it would be important to understand better
the rates of HPV-related disease in MSM and the influence of HPV on HIV
infection. JCVI asked the HPA to undertake modelling work to assess the
impact and cost effectiveness of HPV immunisation of MSM acknowledging
that it may take some time to acquire the data needed and that
additional modelling resources may be
required.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13042383000988" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/text/130422w0007.htm#13042383000988">The

decide which drug is clinically most appropriate for the treatment for
opioid dependence following careful assessment of, and discussion with
each client. It expected that these decisions should be in line with
clinical guidance. The National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence guidelines recommended the use of both methadone and

the need for clinicians, to make sure that each patient is aware of all
the risks associated with this treatment, both to themselves and to

CQC Remuneration Committee dependant upon organisational and individual
performance. For all other employees CQC applies the principles in the
annual pay remit to determine if a payment could be paid. In
determining whether a payment is actually made the CQC Remuneration
Committee agrees the approach, based on the individual Performance
Development Review ratings. This approach is then negotiated with the
trade
unions.</hs_Para></entry></row><row><entry colsep="0" rowsep="0"><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13042383001109" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/text/130422w0008.htm#13042383001109">NHS

CQC complaints procedure has two stages. Stage 1 of the procedure is
intended to be resolved locally and is the responsibility of line
management within each CQC directorate. In the event of dissatisfaction
with a stage 1 response, complainants can request a stage 2 review by
the specialist CQC corporate complaints team. The corporate complaints
team will only consider a complaint at stage 2 after it has been
through stage 1. If the complainant remains dissatisfied after stage 2,
they can raise their concerns with the parliamentary and health service
ombudsman. To date, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman has

United Kingdom. The Human Tissue Act (2004) provides that before organs
are removed for transplantation, appropriate consent must be obtained.
This legislation applies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Similar legislation is in place in Scotland and is set out in the Human
Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006. The European Union Organ Donation
Directive, which came into force in the UK on 27 August 2012, also
requires valid consent to unpaid and altruistic donation. It
is a requirement that all organ removal and organ
transplantation is reported and recorded, and all transplant centres

someone based on their disability, race, religion, gender-identity or

presented in Table 1 are for deaths registered rather than deaths that
occurred in each calendar year. In England and Wales all suicides are
certified by a coroner following an inquest. The death cannot be
registered until the inquest is completed, which can take many months
or even years. ONS is not notified that a death has occurred until it
is registered, unless the coroner adjourns an inquest while awaiting
prosecution in a higher court. The latest statistical bulletin showed
that the median registration delay for suicides was 158 days in England
and Wales in
2011.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13042399001379" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/text/130423w0002.htm#13042399001379">In
Scotland a death must be registered within eight days. The Procurator
Fiscal has a duty to investigate all sudden, suspicious, accidental,
unexpected or unexplained deaths and any death occurring in
circumstances that give rise to serious public concern, and a Fatal
Accident Inquiry may follow. If the results of toxicological tests or a
post mortem are not yet known, the cause of death can be given as
“unascertained, pending investigations”, and the actual
cause of death will be entered at a later date. Therefore National
Records of Scotland (NRS) receive notification of suicides more quickly
than ONS. In-2011 the average registration delay for suicides in
Scotland was just seven days, although the death may not have been
registered as a suicide
initially.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13042399001380" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/text/130423w0002.htm#13042399001380">Figures

Innovation Fund to the 100 designated local authorities and it is up to
them how to distribute the money in their areas. In October 2012

Francois:</Member></B> The Armed Forces Act 2006 permits women officers
and warrant officers to sit as lay members of the court martial on the
same basis as men. For a particular court martial, the individual
members are chosen on an essentially random basis by the court
administration officer for the court martial. Under rule 35 of the
Armed Forces, Court Martial Rules, 2009, either party to proceedings,
the defence or the prosecution, may object to any lay member of the
court on any reasonable ground. These provisions broadly reflect those
which apply to juries in the civilian Crown court and Ministry of
Defence policy is to maintain that consistency. Accordingly, I do not
currently propose to reconsider our
provisions.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="130423107000020" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/text/130423w0002.htm#130423107000020">Armed

not hold full level 3 qualifications are enrolled on an apprenticeship
scheme unless their trade training attracts higher level
qualifications. The qualifications available range from
intermediate-level apprenticeships to degrees, depending on the trade
specialisation of the individual. In addition, serving members of the

For the purpose of allocating a company to England, Northern Ireland,
Scotland or Wales, the postcode of the company's registered office has
been used. This may not relate to where all of a company's activity
takes place. It will also not reflect all companies that carry on
activities in those countries. Figures in 'Not known' category relate
to companies based in the UK but where it is not possible to link their
address to a specific country using the postcode information

For the purpose of this analysis, HMRC define the terms as follows: a.
CT liabilities are considered to be accrued in the financial year of
the end date of the company's accounting period. b. Small Profits Rate:
Since April 2010, the lower rate of corporation tax has been called the
Small Profits Rate (SPR) rather than Small Companies' Rate (SCR). This
makes clear that it is the size of the profits, rather than the size of
the company, which determines the tax rate to be applied. c. Marginal
Relief: This can be claimed by companies with taxable profits between
the lower and upper limits, to enable a smooth transition between the
small profits rate and the main rate of CT. d. Main Rate: The rate of
corporation tax paid by companies with profits above the lower limit.
Companies with profits between the lower and upper limit are taxed at
main rate but can usually claim Marginal
Relief.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">3.

responsible for producing independent economic and fiscal forecasts. In
September 2010, the OBR published a working paper, ‘Assessment
of the Effect of Oil Price Fluctuations on the Public Finances’.
This analysis by the OBR suggests that a 20% increase in the price of
oil reduces actual output by approximately 0.2% compared to a baseline
scenario. In their March 2012 Economic and fiscal outlook, the OBR
estimated that an immediate $50 shock to the oil price would lead to
GDP growth in 2012-13 falling from their central forecast of 1.0% to
0.3%.</hs_Para>

from small, local provision through to regional and national schemes.

accordance with EU pesticides legislation and neonicotinoid insecticide
products authorised for use in the UK meet the current standards set by
the regulatory system. Legal restrictions are in place to limit the
exposure of bees to these products. A code of practice is in place for
professional pesticide users, such as farmers, on how and when
pesticides are used so as to minimise the impact on bees. All pesticide
users must comply with all the conditions of a product's authorisation.
These will include application rates and timings and where appropriate
specific risk mitigation measures on product labels to protect
bees.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130423107000626" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/text/130423w0002.htm#130423107000626">While
laboratory studies show that bees may be significantly affected by
neonicotinoids, field data on honey bees indicates that the level of
exposure in real life does not lead to these harmful effects. There has
been an absence of field data on other bee species and DEFRA,
therefore, commissioned field trials on bumble bees. The report of
these field trials was published on the DEFRA website with our
assessment of the key evidence and is now available online at

assessment of the overall evidence concludes that it is not possible to
rule out rare effects of neonicotinoids on bees in the field. However,
the evidence indicates that effects on bees do not occur under normal
circumstances. Consequently, it supports the view that the risk to bee
populations from neonicotinoids, as they are currently used, is
low.</hs_Para>

can be made against the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). These include
costs orders under section 19 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985,
where an order may be made that one party pay the costs of the other
party to criminal proceedings. Such an order may be made when the court
is satisfied that the costs in question have been incurred by party A
as a result of “an unnecessary or improper act of omission by or
on behalf of” party
B.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130423107000688" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/text/130423w0002.htm#130423107000688">Costs
can also be ordered under section 19A of the same Act where an order
may be made against a legal representative that s/he pay “wasted
costs”. Wasted costs are costs incurred as a result of improper,
unreasonable or negligent act or omission on the part of any
representative or the employee of any
representative.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130423107000689" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/text/130423w0002.htm#130423107000689">Furthermore,

Vaizey:</Member></B> It is not the Government's intention that the
current version of the 'relevant publisher' definition should catch
individual bloggers who are acting in the course of a business and who
occasionally invite a guest to blog in their place. If a blog is not
acting in the course of business it is not caught in any case. However,
in order to put this issue beyond doubt, the Government has tabled
amendments to the Crime and Courts Bill on 18 April in order to exempt
small scale blog sites where they may otherwise be caught by the
definition of ‘relevant publisher’. This provides that if
you are a multi-authored blog, and you are a microbusiness, defined as
an organisation with less than 10 members of staff and that has an
annual turnover of no more than £2 million, you are not
defined as a ‘relevant publisher’. The Government
amendments to the definition of a ‘relevant publisher’,
as provided for in the Crime and Courts Bill, was debated in the House
of Commons on 22 April.</hs_Para>

the Department regularly publishes official statistics on employment

being trained in assessing health conditions that fluctuate. The

what their health professionals should consider when assessing
claimants who have a health condition that fluctuates, and what they
should record in their assessment report, including the frequency and
duration of fluctuations. We are confident that this will allow health

otherwise than on bail. This includes extending looked after child

the Equality Act, local authorities have a duty not to discriminate
when carrying out their own education functions—such as

local authority within their own home must be approved as a foster

a fostering service may approve a person of any sex as a foster carer,
they must obtain an enhanced disclosure check with respect to that

schools actively to teach subjects that are not part of the existing
statutory curriculum. As part of the current review of the national

subjects at key stages 3 and 4 will continue to be statutory in future.
We are, however, slimming down the national curriculum by prescribing
much shorter programmes of study for subjects beyond primary English,
mathematics and science. The aim is to create more freedom for schools
to design their own wider curricula which best meet the needs of their
students. It is, therefore, open to schools to teach economics or

Poulter:</Member></B> The following table sets out the number of
families enrolled on the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) programme by
site between April 2007 (when the programme began in England) and 31
March 2013. The relevant local authority area is also
included.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130423107001953" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/text/130423w0005.htm#130423107001953">FNP
sites are not always coterminous with local authority areas, as some
sites offer services to part of or more than one local authority area.
FNP sites are made up of one family nurse supervisor and up to eight
family nurses delivering a maximum of 200 FNP places at any one
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130423107001954" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130423/text/130423w0005.htm#130423107001954">The
numbers of families enrolled by site vary according to the number of
places they have available and when the programme started in that area.
New FNP sites build up their caseloads over a 12-month period, and some
sites will be at the very early stages of recruitment. The FNP
programme lasts for approximately two and half years, from early
pregnancy until the child is two years old. At this point a new client
can be recruited to the place.</hs_Para>
