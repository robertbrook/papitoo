more than 3,500 IPP prisoners have passed their tariff date and are
waiting to come before the Parole Board. Does he accept that, at the
current rate of release on licence, which is running at about 400 a
year, it will be nearly nine years before the backlog is cleared? If
so, is there not an overwhelming case for the Lord Chancellor to
exercise the powers he was given under Section 128 of the 2012 Act to

figure on the release of IPP prisoners is roughly correct; I do not
think it is until Thursday that we release the full figures, but his
estimate is not far out. That compares with 300 releases in 2011, 97 in
2010 and 53 in 2009. I hope he will acknowledge that the abolition of
IPPs in LASPO and the greater flexibility that we are now employing in
trying to manage the IPP sentences are going in the right direction. I
acknowledge that it is a slow process. I will take back to my right
honourable friend the Lord Chancellor the noble and learned
Lord’s point about the power that was given in the LASPO Act,

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I think the key word is
“risk”. The fact that these prisoners were given IPP
sentences indicates that it must have been in the mind of the judge
imposing the sentence that they posed a significant risk to society
that had to be dealt with before they could be considered for release.
That was the intention behind IPPs and that must remain uppermost in
our minds when deciding the future of these prisoners. However, we are
bringing in accredited courses, which may help to make the point that
they are available for these prisoners. Other interventions such as
work, education and employment may also provide evidence of reduced
risk. NOMS is investing in interventions that have the most beneficial
impact in reducing risk, and priority for those programmes is given to
IPP

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, within the constraints that we are
having to operate in we are trying to introduce new courses. I fully
accept that one of the reasons we abolished IPP is that it contained
that Catch-22 whereby you had to fulfil certain courses, which may not
be available, to qualify for release. I believe that NOMS is doing its
best to bring in new systems and that there is greater flexibility in
qualifying for release. However, I go back to the point that we are
dealing with men who were sent to prison because the judge who
sentenced them judged that they posed a serious

have a managed programme to help them prepare for release. That should
be part of sentence planning. But, again, I freely acknowledge that in
some cases prisoners have been moved for other reasons and then find
that they cannot complete the relevant courses. We are trying as best
we can to iron out of the system what the noble Lord referred to as a
Catch-22 situation so that prisoners can qualify, but to leave 
<?notus-xml column=1347?>with the Parole Board the overriding assessment of whether they are

the judgment applies, but cases are being taken. It may be of interest
to hear that two of the three prisoners involved in that case are now
back in prison due to breaching their terms. We are being very careful
to make sure that the system is flexible enough and effective enough to
allow prisoners to earn—that is the reality of it—their
release. However, we have to consider this issue in the context of
prisoners who were given this sentence, when it existed, because they
posed a threat to the community. It is for the Parole Board to assess
whether they are fit for

changes to the judicial review procedure which the Government intend to

included the president of the Queen’s Bench Division, the Master
of the Rolls, the vice-president of the Court of Appeal, the Civil

As I said earlier, in the case of such appeals the judge is there to
decide if an extension is required to the time period. The noble Lord

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> First, I agree totally with the noble
Lord. The point of judicial review is to hold the Executive and public
bodies to account, and that is a principle to which the Government are
utterly committed. I have referred already to the issue of time
extension. If an extension of time is required, the judge can grant it.
It is important to highlight three key points around these changes. The
reduction in time limits on planning and procurement, the introduction
of fees and the dismissal of decisions that are totally without merit
were all referred to the judiciary and, indeed, carried their support.
Matters were raised in the consultation which the judiciary felt were
not right to take forward; the Government have listened and are not
doing

Bach:</Member></B> My Lords, linked to the issue of judicial review is
the idea of a residence test, which is presently being consulted on. If
put into effect, that residence test would mean that someone here
lawfully but who had not been here for 12 months or more would not be
entitled to legal aid in civil actions, presumably including judicial
review, however overwhelming their case might be. Does the Minister
agree that such a proposal goes against the traditions and principles

is right to say that our justice system is one of the best in the
world, demonstrated even in cases such as that of Abu Qatada. Here is a
man who does not believe in our democracy, who does not believe in the
freedoms our country stands for, and who takes a noble faith, hijacks
it and then presents it in his own erroneous way. Even then, our
justice system stands up for him. That is British justice at its best
and those rights are protected within judicial
review<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T14:52:50"></hs_TimeCode>. The

always when British citizens travel overseas and find themselves in
these distressing circumstances that expectations are at their highest.
Some 56 million people from this country travel overseas, but only tens
of thousands require consular assistance, and within those the number
of very serious cases is around 60. It is important that we are quite
open about what help we can provide and what support we can give. That
usually takes the form of providing information about the local police
and legal services, while sometimes we will attend first
appointments with a list of local lawyers and victim support services.
We work with local NGOs to provide support for families on the ground,
but we have to be honest about what we are obliged to provide and what
it is that we can provide. We have to be clear and transparent about
that when providing information about travelling

play any role in the decision to suspend children’s
heart surgery at Leeds. By agreement, this was a local decision taken
by the trust, in agreement with Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England’s
medical director, and the Care Quality Commission. The Government
strongly believe that it was the right thing to do. It is absolutely
right that the NHS should act quickly and decisively if there is any

concern that I know he shares for those who have been affected by the
decision. We all wish to see the safest surgery possible for our
children. The Minister quite rightly understands that specialist
doctors and experts, not politicians, should be responsible for asking
and answering questions of safety. In the particular circumstances of

Eaton:</Member></B> My question is coming. The experts in Leeds have
been causing understandable concern because of their partiality and
apparent vested interest. In Bristol and Birmingham, children’s
heart units have recently had mortality alerts and 14 NHS trusts are
under investigation. Will the Minister explain why surgery has not been
suspended at any of those trusts? Will he also explain why NHS England
has chosen to spend resources appealing the decision of the High Court
judge, who called the Safe and Sustainable review of children’s
heart units flawed, when the decision for the Independent
Reconfiguration Panel and the Secretary of State is
imminent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:00:35"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000043"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13042379000252" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000252">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend raises quite a large
number of points. I simply say to her that in regard to Leeds, which is
the matter on which I have 
<?notus-xml column=1353?>been briefed, the decision to suspend surgery was taken because concerns
had been raised from a variety of sources about the safety of surgery
at the unit. Mortality data were supplied to the National Institute for
Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with significant flaws, and until
those flaws had been rectified, it was impossible to be sure that the
trust was operating within acceptable mortality thresholds. Those
mortality concerns have, I understand, been resolved, which is why
low-risk children’s cardiac surgery has been resumed at the
hospital. However, NHS England’s appeal on the Safe and
Sustainable review—which, I emphasise, is quite separate from
the events of late March and early April—has to be a matter for
NHS England. The review of children’s heart services was an NHS
review, independent of government, and if NHS England wants to appeal
the decision and thinks that there are good grounds for doing so, that
is a matter for
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:01:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that the people most affected by this are the children and many of the
families who do not understand and cannot comprehend what is going on
at the moment across these services? I declare an interest as the
patron and trustee of Little Hearts Matter, which deals with hundreds
of children who have half a heart and therefore all have surgery across
the country. The Government may not have a direct interest in dealing
with this matter but what are they going to do to make sure that the

it will be safe for their

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, children’s heart surgery has been
the subject of concern for more than 15 years. Clinical experts and
parent groups have repeatedly called for change, and there is an
overwhelming feeling in the NHS that the time for change is long
overdue. The review that has taken place was about making sure that
children’s heart services are as good as they possibly can be,
and that has to be the message to the parents involved. It is of course
an extremely complex issue but it is generally accepted that
concentrating surgical expertise will deliver better outcomes for the
children concerned. In view of the legal proceedings, it is very
difficult for me to go any further than that at the

Sustainable review was an NHS review. The Government and

Scotland, Denmark and Finland, and is larger than Norway and Ireland?

to the Public Service Pensions Bill, on which there remains one
outstanding issue. The other place has invoked parliamentary privilege

will explain in a moment the reasons why the Government cannot simply
agree to give these workforces a normal pension age of 60. First, I put
on record that I recognise the arguments that have been made here and
elsewhere. I have met members of these workforces to discuss their
position, and there is no question that they deliver an extremely
important service, often in demanding and dangerous circumstances.
However, sympathy for these individuals should not lead to our
oversimplifying the issue that we are discussing. The debate today is
over just one design element of their pensions, which in turn forms
just one element of their overall remuneration and employment
package.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000061">We
have heard the argument that these individuals are identical to their
local authority counterparts. But these workforces are subject
to separate working practices, terms and conditions and, specifically,
pensions entitlements. These workers receive different pay, pay a much
lower level of contributions, have access to a compensation
scheme, unlike their local authority counterparts, and receive
different allowances—for example, when they work
abroad.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000062">We
must recognise that the proposal to reduce the retirement age involves
substantial changes in their terms and conditions. Those changes to
date have not been subject to thorough consideration or the proper
process. That is why we should not attempt to conduct detailed
discussions here about what the changes may look like. This is not just
about normal pension age; there is much more to be explored, and there
are several interrelating factors that must continue to be discussed
between the parties. It is right that those discussions take place
outside the legislative process, and we do not have to resolve this in
the Bill. My colleague, the Economic Secretary, said yesterday in the
other place that further primary legislation is not necessary in order
to do so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000063">The
Ministry of Defence has already committed to discussing this issue
further. This is the right approach. As we have these discussions, we
cannot shy away from discussions about the costs. Reducing the normal
pension age of those workforces to age 60 could create extra
expenditure for the Exchequer of up to £10 million in every year
that the scheme operates. That is why these two amendments are subject
to the Commons financial privilege. These costs would have to be picked
up by somebody—either the taxpayer, possibly at the cost of
front-line MoD services, or extra contributions from the members of
these workforces. The current situation is that dialogue is already
under way between the DFRS, the MDP and the MoD. The MoD has written to
the representatives of the members of these forces and offered to
discuss how a normal pension age of 65 might be maintained when the new
schemes come into force. The first step has, therefore, already been
taken, and we will keep up the momentum in the coming weeks and
months.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000064">I
realise that there is some concern about how long these negotiations
might take, which was reflected  in the Commons yesterday.
While I do not wish to tie the hands of either the unions or my
colleagues at the 
<?notus-xml column=1357?>Ministry of Defence, I should think that working towards agreement over
the next 12 months is an achievable goal. We are definitely not seeking
to kick this issue into the long grass. Colleagues in the other place
also wanted assurance that if—I stress that this is very much an
“if”, not a “when”—the MoD decided
that a reduction in its current NPA was appropriate, the Bill would be
flexible enough to allow this. I can reassure the House that this is
indeed the case. This Bill is framework legislation. This is usually
the case in the public service pension arena and, as such, a number of
things are possible within the framework of the Bill that do not
require amendments to primary legislation. I am, therefore, happy to
repeat that if the Government decided that it would be appropriate for
some or all of these workforces to be able to access an unreduced
pension before normal pension age, there are ways that this change can
be delivered using only secondary legislation.</hs_para>

amendment would effectively require a review of the effect of this Bill

would require the Government to have regard to impacts on the health

requirement; and early retirement statistics in these forces. I have
already stated that the Ministry of Defence is engaging with these
forces to look at their pension ages in the new schemes. These are
exactly the kinds of factors which they would look at in doing so. As
we had already intended to look at this issue again with these
workforces, I am happy to accept this amendment from the Opposition,
and the Government will support it. I hope that seeing this provision
on the face of the Bill will give the forces and Members opposite the
reassurance they need that the review will indeed be carried
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000066">As is
normal practice, a few elements of wording will need to be ironed out.
The Government will look to make these changes in the other place when
the Bill returns there. Allow me to reassure the House that any changes

properly. However, the Government can today accept the substance of the

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I beg to move the manuscript amendment
on the Marshalled List. We were told last night—that is to say,
at the last minute—that the Government intended to assert
financial privilege over our attempt to achieve fairness for the
members of the Defence Fire and Rescue Service and the Ministry of
Defence Police. We have learnt that the Government know they have lost
the argument when they assert financial privilege. However, it is worth
examining what this financial privilege is being asserted over. The
noble Lord quoted the possible cost to the Government as £10
million. We had the opportunity to take actuarial advice overnight and
the figure is a maximum of £2 million. So the
Government are asserting financial privilege over the magnificent sum
of £2 million per year and are using that argument to prevent
the debate on your Lordships’ amendments, which would have
achieved fairness for Ministry of Defence firefighters and police by
equalising their retirement age with those of other police and fire
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000069">The
amendment I have tabled requires a review of the impact of these
measures on the Defence Fire and Rescue Service and Ministry of Defence
Police. We want to know the impact on the health and well-being of
these members, particularly because there is substantial evidence that
the vast majority of members of the fire service and police are
required to retire before the age of 60, because they can no longer
meet the Ministry of Defence statements of requirements for these
personnel. In effect, they are stood down for health reasons already.
What is striking is that the Government have not taken the cost of
people retiring early through ill health into account in their
calculations of the overall impact. Indeed, the cost calculations are
simplistic in the extreme.</hs_para>

are particularly concerned about is whether early retirement due to
inability to meet exacting standards is taken into account in
considering the settled retirement age. The noble Lord again raised
this issue of fixing the retirement age of this group of workers at 65
and not letting it creep up in future years, as anticipated in the
Bill. I hope that the Government will dismiss these thoughts from their
mind and instead concentrate on achieving fairness. I refer the noble
Lord to the speech made by my noble

noble Lords may remember, my noble friend also pointed out that if he
had known about this anomaly when he produced his report on public

am grateful to the Government for accepting our amendment and our
request for a review of the circumstances of MoD firefighters and

questions for me. For example, have the Government sought the views of

of these services actually think about the Government’s proposal
not to equalise the retirement age of their men and women to the
retirement age of other police and firefighters?</hs_para>

times in the past two years have MoD firefighters and police accessed

Harris of Richmond:</Member></B> My Lords, I had not necessarily
intended to participate in this debate, knowing that the noble Lord,
Lord Eatwell, had put down an amendment which I wholeheartedly approve
and agree to. I am very pleased that the Government have decided to
accept it, especially after all the work that was done in trying to
persuade them about the Ministry of Defence fire service and the
Ministry of Defence police. I emphasise this point because it is
tantamount to having made them accept that this really must be looked
at again, and I think it was the work that was done in Committee in
this House that made this happen. Like the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, I
was surprised to find that financial privilege had been put 
<?notus-xml column=1360?>forward as the reason not to accept something a little stronger. So I
can assure my noble friend the Minister that during the
year that this amendment will be looked at, mulled
over and digested, we will be looking very carefully to see the

very graciously recognised not only the justice of the case that we on
this side of the House, and the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, put in
Committee, but that it is pretty absurd for the Government simply to
claim financial privilege to resist an amendment that manifestly will
bring justice and equity to an extremely special group of workers,

Newby:</Member></B> My Lord, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
Eatwell, and other noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. I would
just like to deal with the issue of financial privilege, because there
is a widespread misunderstanding of how financial privilege works.
Privilege is not determined by the Government. Privilege is determined
by the Speaker in advance of debate. In this case, the classification
of your Lordships’ amendment as being subject to the Commons
financial privilege has been known for a month. Once an amendment has
been classified by the Speaker as being subject to financial privilege,
obviously the Commons considers whether to agree or disagree with each
Lords amendment. If it disagrees, it must offer a reason. The only
reason it can give is privilege. The Clerk of the Commons explains this
as
follows:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13042379000184" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000184">“If
an amendment infringes privilege, that is the only reason that will be
given. This is because giving another reason suggests either that the
Commons haven't noticed the financial implications, or that they are
somehow not attaching importance to their financial
primacy”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13042379000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000080">I
strongly recommend that all noble Lords who seek enlightenment on this
matter look up the <I>Hansard</I> of 14 February last year, when the
Leader of the House 
<?notus-xml column=1361?>gave a little tutorial on financial privilege before your Lordships
discussed a number of issues relating to a Bill. There is a
long-established pattern of financial privilege that has in essence
been unchanged for several centuries, and it is not for the Government

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I fully accept that it is for the
Speaker to designate financial privilege, but the debate last year to
which the noble Lord referred related to expenditure of several hundred
million pounds of the welfare budget. During that debate, several
Members referred to the fact that there must be a threshold beyond
which a Lords amendment was considered an issue of financial privilege.
The only point I am making is that the Commons, or whoever jogs the
Speaker’s elbow in these matters, needs to take into account the
issue that a relatively small amount of financial expenditure and
alteration in either direction should not be taken as an issue for
claiming financial
privilege<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:31:14"></hs_TimeCode>. I do
not want to labour the issue, but there would be a danger of the two

take this opportunity to address an issue that I know is of concern to
the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, on how provisions are being taken forward
to provide access to justice and cost protection for those of limited
means. It may be helpful to provide the House with an update on the
action we are taking. As noble Lords are aware, we asked the Civil
Justice Council to report on the issue of cost protection by the end of
March. It has done so, and recommended that the regime of qualified
one-way cost shifting, or QOCS, should be adapted to defamation and
privacy cases. A number of adaptations are necessary, given the rather
different nature and variety of defamation and privacy proceedings
compared with personal injury claims. We are now considering the CJC
report, and as your Lordships will appreciate this is quite a complex
area. While the report does not represent a blueprint of the new rules
to be applied, it does set out the issues that need to be addressed,
and makes recommendations on how to address
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000141" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000141">It will
be for the Civil Procedure Rules Committee to make the rules on costs
protection in due course, once the Government have set out the way
forward. My officials will work with the Committee on this. I am
conscious that the CJC has not consulted on this issue, and I believe
that we need to consult before we finalise the proposals. Our aim is
therefore to work with the Rules Committee in drafting appropriate
rules, perhaps with alternatives, on which we can consult more widely
over the

noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, indicated that they

often refer to Fox’s Libel Act. I hope that when this Bill
becomes law it will be referred to as 
<?notus-xml column=1365?>Lord McNally’s Libel Act, because he above all has had the energy
to drive it forward. He said at one stage that he would not allow the
Bill to be overwhelmed by what he called the tsunami of Leveson. The
reason why I strongly support Motion A is because it provides a way of
avoiding being overwhelmed by the tsunami of Leveson. It removes what I
consider to be unnecessary hostage-taking in some amendments to the
Defamation Bill. It has now been freed in the Commons, and therefore I

whether there should be restrictions on the right of bodies corporate

Amendment 2 in the other place, the Government made it clear that
although we were opposed to that amendment, we recognised the strength
of feeling that exists on the issue of whether there should be a
specific provision in the Bill requiring non-natural persons trading

further. This amendment reflects the outcome of those
considerations.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13042379000152" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000152">As
I have explained at earlier stages of the Bill, we amended what was
initially a “substantial harm” requirement to one of
“serious harm” in order to raise the bar for bringing a
defamation claim. The amendment therefore refers to
“serious” financial loss to reflect that aim, and now
links explicitly to the serious harm test. The use of the phrase
“serious financial loss” makes it absolutely clear that
the financial loss required to meet the serious harm test must itself
be serious. By contrast, the reference in Lords Amendment 2 to
“substantial financial loss” could inadvertently have had
the effect of weakening what has to be shown to satisfy the
test.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000153" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000153">Secondly,

a much clearer and simpler definition than that used in Amendment 2.
These are the bodies that this House has expressed concern about, so we
have phrased  the amendment specifically and directly to meet
those concerns. A vaguer formulation such as that in Amendment 2 would
have risked inadvertently catching other bodies, such as charities,
which are not the subject of concern. I believe that this effective and

Government are unable to accept Motions B1, B2 and B3. In relation to
Motion B1, as noble Lords are aware, in the case of Derbyshire County
Council v Times Newspapers, the House of Lords held that local
authorities and central governmental bodies are already prevented from
bringing actions for defamation. Motion B1 would add Amendment 2C,
which seeks to extend that principle and put an absolute bar on any
non-natural person performing a public function from bringing a claim
in relation to a statement concerning that function. This would remove
completely the right of a wide range of businesses and other
organisations to protect their reputation. We consider that to deprive
them of this right would be excessive and disproportionate. Although
the amendment focuses on criticisms in connection with the exercise of
a public function, that criticism could have a wider impact on the
reputation of the business more generally. It is important to recognise
that unjustified and defamatory allegations can cause considerable
damage which affects all those connected to a business, including
shareholders and employees.</hs_para>

inhibited from criticising bodies exercising public functions. These

view is that it is much better to maintain the present common law
position as set out in the Derbyshire case and to allow the courts to
develop that principle as they consider appropriate and necessary in
the light of individual cases. For the avoidance of any possible doubt,
I make absolutely clear that the absence of this amendment from the
Bill will have no effect on the existing Derbyshire principle, which
prevents local authorities and governmental bodies bringing an action.
That principle will continue to apply under the common law as it does
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000157">To
reassure my noble friend Lord Lester, who I know has concerns on this
point, the Derbyshire principle was established before the passage of
the Human Rights Act, and the issue of whether it would extend to a
body falling within the definition of a public authority under Section
6 of that Act is not one that has yet been tested before the courts. It
is therefore not possible to predict the view that the courts would
take were this issue to be raised. However, I can make it absolutely
clear that there is nothing to prevent the courts developing the
principle if they consider it appropriate to do so in light of changes
that continue to take place in the way services of a public nature are
provided.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000158" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000158">I
turn now to Motion B2. This would add Amendment 2D to
introduce a requirement that, in order to bring a claim, a body that
trades for profit would first have to obtain the permission of the
court. Permission would be granted only if the prospective claimant
could show that the publication of the statement complained of had
caused or was likely to cause the claimant serious financial loss. As
we have said throughout our debates, we believe that a permission stage
for this purpose is wholly undesirable as it would create unnecessary
duplication and additional costs for both parties. If the claimant were
required to show serious financial loss in order to get permission to
bring a claim, this would effectively mean that the court would be
deciding at that point whether the serious harm test was satisfied.
This is not a matter well suited to a permission stage. It would mean
that the defendant would in many cases want to be involved and would
need to submit evidence in order to challenge the claimant’s
position. In these circumstances, an oral hearing would almost
certainly be required. In cases where the claim then proceeded, this
would cause unnecessary additional costs for both parties. There would
also be a need to provide an appeal mechanism, which could potentially
add further to those
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000159">As I
have said before, we do not consider that there is any need for a
permission stage. The amendment we have tabled today will make
perfectly clear what the serious harm test means for bodies trading for
profit. The Civil Procedure Rules already allow the defendant to apply
at any point after the claim is served for it to 
<?notus-xml column=1368?>be struck out. When the Bill is implemented, the defendant will continue
to be able to do this at a very early stage on the basis that it does
not satisfy the serious harm test. The addition of a permission stage
would therefore add little or nothing as any case where the existence
of serious harm was disputed could have that issue resolved at a very
early stage in any
event.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000160" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000160">Under
the proposals which we are discussing with the Civil Procedure Rule
Committee, either party will also be able to apply for an early ruling
on other key aspects of the claim, such as the meaning of the words
complained of and whether they were statements of fact or opinion. An
additional permission stage on serious harm would mean that two sets of
applications and hearings could often be needed where otherwise one
would be sufficient.</hs_para>

that key issues can be resolved at as early a stage as possible, we
will also introduce measures to give cost protection to parties with
limited means to enable them to bring or defend a claim against an
opponent with substantially greater resources. As I have explained, we
are currently considering very carefully the recommendations of the
Civil Justice Council that were recently submitted to the Secretary of
State so that we can ensure that measures are put in place which
provide effective protection in all cases involving an inequality of
arms. It is our firm view that building in an extra procedural layer
through a permission stage would simply add to the costs and delay
involved for no appreciable benefit.</hs_para>

the issue raised by my noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill in his
Motion B3. This relates to a concern that the general powers given to
local authorities in Section 1 of the Localism Act 2011 may have
overturned the Derbyshire principle in relation to local authorities.
This point was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Browne of Ladyton,

that if a case were to be brought on the basis that Section 1 of the
Localism Act had overturned the bar on local authorities suing in
defamation, the courts would still find that local authorities cannot
bring an action. We consider that the public policy grounds on which
the Derbyshire judgment was reached—namely, that it would be
contrary to the public interest for organs of government to be able to
sue in defamation and that it would be an undesirable fetter on freedom
of speech—remain compelling and that these have been bolstered
by the Human Rights Act, which was enacted after
Derbyshire.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000164" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000164">As
I explained in Committee, in the very unlikely event that a court were
to hold otherwise, the situation could be promptly remedied without any
need for primary legislation by way of a statutory instrument under
Section 5(3) of the Localism Act. This allows the Secretary of State to
prevent local authorities using Section 1 powers to do anything
specific in the order. In this case, an order could be made preventing
any action being brought in defamation. I hope that putting these
matters clearly on the record will provide the reassurance that my

seeking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042379000165" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042379000165">To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:52:19"></hs_TimeCode>

start with an extraordinarily warm welcome for government Amendment 2B.
There is absolutely no doubt that, late conversion though it may have
been by the Government to the arguments of our Benches and of this
House, it is a most important and welcome clause. It owes much to the
persuasive charms—or energy, in the words of the noble Lord,
Lord Lester—of the noble Lord, Lord McNally. The McNally Bill
will do us
fine.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042386000005">However,
there are still some outstanding issues, not least the one of cost, to
which the Minister has just referred. Despite his efforts, and indeed
the CJC report on this which was published only last week, we have of
course not received the sort of assurance that we had hoped to receive
by the time this Bill was enacted, of having agreement on costs. There
was clearly a lot of disagreement within the working group, and there
is no clear answer in the report as to how, in the absence of CFAs
following LASPO, most people will be able to either start or defend a
defamation claim. Without resolution on this, the risk of substantial
costs remains, which more or less makes either the taking or the
defending of an action open only to the super-rich, as the Government
have
acknowledged.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042386000006">I
turn to the two issues passed by this House but overturned by the
Commons, which the Government have not accepted. First, there is the
right of public services to sue for defamation. Derbyshire, as the
Minister has said, is really shorthand for the democratic principle
that government bodies should be open to uninhibited public criticism
and therefore have no right to sue for libel. I assume that
arm’s-length bodies, such as the former Border Agency, English
Heritage and the Health and Safety Executive, are already covered under
Derbyshire. However, there is a wider and growing ring of organisations
contracted or commissioned to provide public services, such as
independent treatment centres, opticians, dentists and GP consortia,
which are either treating or diagnosing NHS patients. There are private
organisations providing care homes, school dinners, public transport,
advice agencies, prison management, free schools and DWP assessments.
These organisations deal directly with consumers, patients, travellers
or users—call them what you will—and are spending
taxpayers’ money to provide such services on behalf of the
state.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042386000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042386000007">Two
issues arise if such private bodies can sue for libel. First, there is
not a level playing field in tendering. Such organisations can
criticise a local authority provider with which they are competing to
provide a service completely free from the risk of being sued for libel
by 
<?notus-xml column=1370?>that local authority. However, the local authority can be stopped from
speaking about a private body in competition with it for the provision
of services by the receipt of a chilling letter. Secondly, consumers
and users cannot comment on a service they are getting without the risk
of that infamous chilling letter.</hs_para>

other place last week, Sir Peter Bottomley reported that Atos, which
does disability checks for the DWP, had sent a legal letter which
resulted in the closure of a forum for disabled people because of their
comments on Atos’s performance. This is deeply worrying. It is
quite wrong to deny users the right to discuss their experience of what
is, after all, a public service paid for by taxpayers. It is this that
most concerns me. Mid Staffs hospital patients and their families were
able to go to the press and finally get something done, as were the
Hillsborough campaigners who were aghast at the police’s actions
and the coroner’s findings. For big effective monopolies, this
is the only way of driving up standards or penalising poor services, as
consumers cannot shop around for an alternative
provider.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042386000009">It
is much the same for other big, albeit now private, providers of public
services. Users must be free to voice their concerns. This is what
Motion B1, which adds Amendment 2C, is all about. It is about
uninhibited users’ criticism of their public services, whether
their provider is a local authority or a private concern. In the other
place, the Minister did not really disagree with the case that we made,
only about whether an amendment was necessary. Worryingly—and
this has been echoed by the Minister this afternoon—she said
that rather than a statutory provision it would be much better for the
courts to develop the Derbyshire principle as they consider appropriate
and necessary in the light of individual cases. However, this runs
completely counter to the whole thrust of this Bill, which has been to
codify and set down in one place, rather than in umpteen legal
judgments that are effectively unavailable to the layperson, the whole
law on defamation, clearly accessible to all and according to the
decisions of Parliament on each issue. That is what this Bill and
indeed the Minister in working on it have sought to achieve. If we
agree that private concerns delivering a public service should be
treated as a public body with regard to libel, Parliament should so
decide and should write it into law.</hs_para>

issue sent by this House but rejected by the Commons concerns prior
permission for corporations to sue, or, to put it another way, whether

which seeks to add Amendment 2D. The Government’s Amendment 2B
in lieu, which, to be clear, we welcome, does not include the provision
voted on in this House for a judicial filter before a corporate body
can sue for libel. However, without such a filter, companies can
continue to use the threat of libel even when such threats are
ultimately spurious. Without a filter, companies will continue to issue
these unmeritorious claims where they calculate that they will frighten
the authors or their publishers, and the chilling effect of such
threats will persist because defendants will still have to incur the
costs, plus the burden of applying to court to strike

welcome, it simply does not answer the point and, in any event, risks a
delay of some two years, as we understand that work has yet to start on
this. However, in any case, it is not really the point. We want
non-natural bodies to have to show a court that they have a real case
before they send out those threatening and chilling letters which
bully, can silence and intimidate, cost a lot in legal fees simply to

about the findings of the research and some of my comments were

the website were not sued. When I spoke about what happened on the
Today programme on Radio 4 I was sued again, despite the interview
being pre-recorded so that the BBC’s lawyers could make sure
that there was no risk of further litigation. NMT did not sue the BBC.
Everything that I said was provably true, but that did not prevent NMT
starting expensive claims with the expectation that the cost would stop
me expressing concerns about the lack of safety and lack of efficacy of

of preventing this sort of bludgeoning of people into silence by the
power of the purse and the extraordinary extravagance of our legal
procedures. It comes home to us very clearly that simply saying that a
company must prove you are damaging them by what you are saying is not
going to prevent many of these cases because the aim of what many
people are saying when they provoke these actions is, indeed, to
inflict damage. The aim is to point out bad and unsafe practice and
unsound publications, and to damage the people responsible. I am not
clear that simply saying that companies must show they are damaged
would really cure the problem at all. I may be revealing my ignorance,
but I wanted to say again that this is what provoked it. In what

Lester of Herne Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope, in what will be a
short speech, to deal with all the amendments together. In answer to
the point just raised by the noble Lord, Lord May, corporations are not
the same as private individuals. They cannot have hurt feelings but
they can be seriously damaged by defamatory statements. I therefore
share the view of many courts across the world that corporations should
be able to bring libel proceedings but on certain conditions. The short
answer to Dr Wilmshurst is that we now have, in what will be Clause 4,
a public interest defence which, quite apart from the other provisions
in his favour, he would be able to rely
upon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042386000016">I begin
by dealing with the question of damages. I do not want to crow about
it, but it was actually in my own Private Member’s Bill that I
required corporate bodies to have to prove the likelihood of financial
loss or actual financial loss. That was commended by the 
<?notus-xml column=1373?>Joint Committee on the draft Bill and by the Joint Committee on Human
Rights on which I serve and, as a member, was able to inform its
report. I think that the Government have made an important concession
and I am delighted that the Opposition have recognised that and,
indeed, have called for it themselves. It is, of course, extremely
important that corporations are able to bring libel proceedings but, as
I say, are able to do so if they are trading corporations by proving
serious financial loss or the likelihood of serious financial
loss.</hs_para>

of that is now common ground, and what is left are the two important
issues of the Derbyshire principle and the notion of a special
procedural step to be taken, which is set out in Amendment 2D. It
requires the permission of the court before a trading corporation can
sue. I am persuaded by my noble friend Lord McNally’s way of
dealing with that. It is a procedural point that will be dealt with by
the early resolution procedure and by proper case management. It does
not require a rigid rule to be inserted into the Bill, and therefore I
would not support Amendment
2D<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:11:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Derbyshire principle? The House has the benefit of having as a Member
of the House of Lords the judge who decided Derbyshire when he was even
younger than he now is, my noble and learned kinsman Lord Woolf of
Barnes, and I am sure that he will correct anything I am about to
say.  I want to say something about Derbyshire because I think
that it has been misunderstood. It has been misunderstood by the
Government because they seem to think that if one were to
codify—I am now against codifying for a reason I shall come
to—that would be in some way rigid and inflexible because it
would prevent a body exercising functions of a public nature being able
to vindicate its reputation. That is wrong because, as the Derbyshire
case establishes and makes clear, unlike the position in the United
States where no one can sue to vindicate the reputation of a government
body, it is always open to a body exercising public functions through
its officers or any individual who is defamed to bring their own
defamation proceedings. It also makes it perfectly clear through Lord
Keith of Kinkel in his speech for the House of Lords that there is also
the tort of malicious falsehood. This means that if a government body
can prove bad faith or reckless disregard for the truth, it can also
bring proceedings. The Government are therefore mistaken in thinking
that to codify in the way that the Opposition wish to do—with my
support the last time round—would create a rigid and inflexible
position. That is not so, but the question is whether we were right

has happened which has caused me to think again. It is the situation in
Northern Ireland, and I hope very much that the noble Lord, Lord Bew,
will say something about it. Since the last occasion, the governing
authorities in Northern Ireland have decided in their wisdom that the
Defamation Bill should not apply to the Province. NGOs, newspapers,

Rights Act must act in a way compatible with human rights, is part of
the Derbyshire principle. I cannot see any argument to the contrary.
Common law is already quite clear. Any body, whether a public body or a
private body clothed with public functions that seeks to use civil
defamation law to vindicate its governing reputation cannot do so, but
its individual officers can, and if it wishes to pursue a

are many areas where charities carry on a trade, but it is a charitable

generates the wherewithal enabling them to run their hospital or

the meaning beyond doubt, but we have to live with the wording that is
here. As I understand it, there is no further opportunity to change the

Kingdom from which I come is opting for a more restrictive type of
public debate and deciding not to engage in the wider freedoms that
will now be available for public expression in the United Kingdom more
generally. I find that is almost a self-mutilating act. The only thing
I can say to the noble Lord, Lord Lester, is that I hope over
time—but not too much time—the Northern Ireland Assembly
will rethink its position. It was a position taken up when the tsunami
of Leveson was sweeping over this Bill and it was not at all sure that
this Bill would pass. It was a very surprising statement even in its
timing. The best resolution of that would be for the Northern Ireland
Assembly to reconsider, because innumerous anomalies will otherwise be
created as regards the circulation of British media—not just
newspapers but organs like the <I>New Statesman</I> and the
<I>Spectator</I>—in Northern Ireland unless there is a rethink.
I hope that there will be a rethink because otherwise it would leave us
in a very unsatisfactory situation. It might be helpful in promoting
that rethink if the leaderships of the parties in this House all
indicated their unease with the situation in Northern Ireland. This

of Amendment 2C, I am very reluctant to pose a question to the noble
Lord, Lord McNally, who has been so patient through so many questions
and has done so much to protect the Bill. In the light of our
discussion on Derbyshire and some of the observations made by the noble
Baroness, Lady Hayter, I want to pick up on some of the
Minister’s reasoning and to ask for clarification. He expressed
unease about Amendment 2C on grounds that I can fully understand; that
it could be disproportionate in its effect. He talked about the wider
impact on a business more generally. I understand his point, but if we
go back to the spirit of the original Derbyshire case, what seemed to
be being said was that there was a case for public debate even when the
consequences in some cases might be unpredictable. Even under the
definition that we all accept in the meaning of Derbyshire, there might
be wider impacts—for example, councillors might lose their jobs.
The concern is that we have to protect the logic of a ruling that has
widespread support in this House and that in future in the real world
there will be more privatisations and a context in which more
controversies will develop. I understand the argument of the noble
Lord, Lord McNally, that over time the law might evolve to deal with

occasions, even when I had a powerful and well supported case revealing
wrongdoings by a company, the legal letters from the
company’s representatives threatening libel action, and the
uncertainly of the outcome under the present libel laws, meant that
those articles were not published. We live in an era when business PR
regards anything but abject praise as an attack on a company. It seems

Human Rights Act 1998 which says that a private company performing

ever increasing expansion of private companies being subcontracted to

have a short example. Last year, the <I>Guardian</I> received evidence

that the private health care provider, Serco, which runs the GP

enough skilled staff to meet patients’ needs and that the
company was altering performance data to show a more positive outcome.
Throughout May of last year the solicitors, Schillings, on behalf of
Serco, sent a series of letters to the <I>Guardian</I> threatening it
with libel action if it went ahead and published the evidence. The
<I>Guardian </I>ignored these threats and published a series of
articles by Felicity Lawrence. Then in July 2012, a report by the Care
Quality Commission found that Serco had indeed not employed enough

friend Lord Lester introduced into this House just over two years ago.
It is not the Bill that the Government produced in draft for
pre-legislative scrutiny. I am proud that it is a Bill that has gone
through every process of political and parliamentary procedure, from a
resolution at a Liberal Democrat conference to being an Act of
Parliament, if we are successful today. However, this means that people
around the House and campaigning groups around the country have not got
everything they wanted from this Bill. One of my political heroes was
the late George Woodcock, the general secretary of the TUC, who once
said that good trade unionism was a series of squalid compromises. I do
not suggest that the compromises that we have arrived at thus far are
squalid. Nevertheless, when looking at a Bill such as this, it is
necessary to remember the various pressures—some of which have
been reflected in the useful debate that we have had—before
making a judgment about challenging the other place once
more.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042386000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042386000044">The

already dealt with the Derbyshire codification. I have been frank with
the House—it is a political judgment. For some of the reasons
that my noble friend Lord Faulks raised, I do not think I am going to
be able to take noble Lords any further on this. There is the fact that
companies do have good names. In an earlier life I worked for a public
relations company, where we used to earn good money helping companies
to develop their corporate reputations. Increasingly, over the years,
corporate reputation and social responsibility have appeared in annual
reports as something of value to companies. These things have to be
taken into account, as well as things like staff morale. So our
amendment—which my noble friend Lord Faulks was not exactly
enthusiastic about—was not a volte-face, but more a development
of
thinking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042386000052">Again,
this is rather like trying to establish a border between private and
public. Throughout this, and as the law develops even after this Bill
becomes an Act, we will find that balance in protecting against the
bullying to which my noble friend Lord Phillips and others referred,
between does it take place and it should not take place. With regard to
corporate reputation, it is disgusting and disgraceful of large
corporations 
<?notus-xml column=1381?>to use those kind of tactics. But there will always be the question of
how we protect against bullying. How do we recognise the points that my
noble friend Lord Faulks makes, that there is a real value to the loss
of reputation that has to be recognised as well? As he rightly says,
and as I explained in my remarks, the courts are
already, to use his phrase, patrolling the borders of Derbyshire. As I
said in introducing this, the Derbyshire principle was established
before the passage of the Human Rights Act. The issue of whether it
would extend to a body falling within the definition of a public
authority under Section 6 of the Act is not one that is being tested
before the courts. It is therefore not possible to predict the view the
courts would take were this issue to be
raised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042386000053"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lester of Herne Hill" PimsId="1473" UID="13042386000670" xid="1310" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042386000670">Lord

Where I do think there is a relevant question—not that my noble
friend’s question was not relevant, it is just that I
did not want to answer it—is on the question of charities. I can
confirm to my noble friend Lord Phillips that it is not our intention
to catch charities. We think that it is very unlikely that a court
would find that a charity was a body trading for profit. There is a
clear distinction between trading for profit and simply making a profit
to reinvest as part of the more general purposes of the organisation. I
hope that will give comfort to my noble
friend.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042386000055">He was

and Parliament have made clear our desire for a direction of travel
here, there is a danger that the Derbyshire principle may be eroded
because of this new configuration. However, trying to put the

action, companies would have to show serious financial loss. Of course,
that is not right with the Bill at the moment. Corporates do not have

that when this House considered the Commons amendments to the Bill on

Lord Justice
Leveson.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042386000088">In

Lord Justice Leveson himself was clear that he did not expect very
small publishers to join the new self-regulatory body. In recognition
of the continued debate around the extent of the definition of
“relevant publisher”, this House accepted the government
amendment, Amendment 131A, to allow a period of further reflection over
the Easter Recess and thereby ensure that the issue remained in play
and could be discussed further in the Commons during the next round of
ping-pong.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042386000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042386000089">It
might at this stage be helpful to remind noble Lords briefly of the
context of these further amendments and explain the rationale behind
the definition of relevant publisher. At present, four interlocking
tests serve to define who is, and is not, a relevant publisher and
therefore affected by the system of incentives. A relevant publisher
must publish news-related material, which must be written by different
authors, be subject to editorial control and be published in the course
of a business, whether or not carried out with a view to
profit.</hs_para>

number of specific exclusions have also been set out in the new
schedule provided for in Commons Amendment 131. These exclusions
include special interest titles, scientific journals, publications by
public bodies and charities, book publishers and company news
publications. However, the provision as drafted raised concerns on the
part of small-scale blog sites that they could be caught by the
definition of a relevant publisher, and that this was not an outcome we
sought in establishing the definition. We have now had the opportunity
to hold discussions with a number of relevant parties to understand
their concerns about the extent of the relevant publisher definition.
These were valuable discussions and Amendments 18A and 131B
agreed yesterday by the Commons reflect the outcome of those
discussions. I can also confirm that the amendments were agreed in
advance on a cross-party
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0001.htm#13042386000091">Amendment
131B develops the list of exclusions from the definition of relevant
publisher. Specifically, it exempts microbusinesses where they are
either a blog or where their publications are only incidental to their
other business activities. Microbusinesses which publish news-related
material that is incidental to the main activities of their business
are also exempted, whether they do so online or offline. The definition
of microbusinesses in this amendment captures any business with fewer
than 10 employees and a turnover of less than £2 million. This
definition is frequently used by the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills. We consider that measuring both the number of
employees and the turnover of an organisation, and setting the bar at
this level, provides the most appropriate proxy for potential impact
and harm and ensures that the incentive system is
proportionate.</hs_para>

certain that the incentive system affects only those publishers Lord
Justice Leveson intended to capture and that, by extension, many blogs,
small web forums and think tanks will fall resolutely outside the
incentive framework. Noble Lords will appreciate that it is, of course,
ultimately and properly a matter for the courts to decide in any
particular case whether a publisher falls within the revised definition
of a relevant publisher. It is worth noting here how blogs may be
perceived to be different from, for example, the online edition of a
newspaper. Blogging takes many forms and is an evolving concept.
However, there are some key features which distinguish blogs, even
where they are edited and multiauthored, from online news reporting. A
blog is used primarily for the expression of opinions, comments or
personal experiences by an individual or group of individuals.
Multiauthored blogs usually cover a single subject of interest, such as
food or fashion, or a particular viewpoint, such as a political
blogsite. Blogs do not usually report in a factual or neutral way on
news or current affairs but are led by the personal views and voice of
the individual or group of individuals concerned. The amendment
intentionally contains no definition of a blog. It will take its
natural, commonly understood meaning and, in the usual way, the term
will ultimately be subject to interpretation by the
courts.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_23_PT_1/D8EE5E2361C966144D488939E6F24D7662DB4D2A" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 April 2013">Tuesday,

concluding my remarks, I will clarify again the effect of the
definition of “relevant publisher” on some other
interests, in particular news aggregators. It is not our intention that
these provisions should capture news aggregators such as Yahoo!, MSN or
Google. News and content aggregators who license or otherwise acquire
news-related content from third parties control this content only in so
far as they decide how to present it in its totality to the end-user.
To that extent, they are not subjecting the material to
“editorial control” as defined in the
provisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0002.htm#13042386000095">Lord
Justice Leveson did not intend services that provide a platform for
bloggers to post content to be captured. Again, the control that is
exercised by aggregators here is limited to the high-level presentation
of the content. It is for these reasons that news aggregators are not
intended to be captured by our definition. Likewise, the definition is
also not intended to capture political parties. These were not the
target of Lord Justice Leveson’s reforms and it has not been the
Government’s intention to capture them. In order to qualify, an
organisation must meet all four tests in the definition: it must be
publishing news-related material; the material must be written by
different authors; it must be subject to editorial control; and it must
be carried on in the course of business. An individual MP who runs a
blog site should also be safely outside the definition as they would be
unlikely to qualify for the four tests. If for some reason it was felt
that they did, they would also be able to look at the microbusiness
exemption.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0002.htm#13042386000096">It
is also likely that many smaller political campaigning organisations
will be able to take advantage of the new microbusiness exemption. They
will qualify if they are microbusinesses and operating a multiauthored
blog. If they are operating a multiauthored blog but publication of
news-related material is incidental to their main activities, they will
also be exempt.</hs_para>

underline that the activity of running a web forum is also not caught
by this definition. I draw noble Lords’ attention to the
additional provisions in the legislation which explain that the
moderation of websites does not qualify. This is also true of blogs if
they are posted without the exercise of editorial control. Therefore, a
site like Mumsnet, to the extent that it runs a blog forum, is not
caught by these provisions. However, any site, including Mumsnet, that
moves into commissioning and publishing news stories may be caught by
the
definition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0002.htm#13042386000098">I
hope that this has helped to provide some clarity on who it has been
the intention to capture in the definition and, equally importantly,

Lord Avebury, to come to the white heat of the technological revolution
and ask a question that has stumped us all. On this side of the House,

adds a little piquancy to the debate which will, I am sure, be resolved

the Leveson trail is a bit like appearing in “Rosencrantz and

seem to be filling the spaces. We pay a small contribution to it and
then we discover that the whole event has moved on, another Bill has
appeared, and yet another set of amendments appears which look awfully
like the ones we have just been discussing. Only earlier today, we
knocked out one set of amendments, yesterday we could have done the
same, today we hope they will stick. I want to reassure the Minister
that we will be supporting him in this event and he will not need to
use the wiles he displayed when he almost reached across the Dispatch

her vote. The vote was unsuccessful so he won out in the end anyway: he

the Minister has explained, these amendments, inserted into the Bill
late in the process, provide for new rules on exemplary damages and
costs. They are an essential part of the cross-party agreement on a
royal charter which is part of the new framework of independent
self-regulation, guaranteed by law, as recommended by Lord Justice
Leveson. This part of the Bill aims to provide publishers with
incentives to sign up to the new system of self-regulation that should
meet the criteria set out in the royal charter. Publishers that join a
recognised regulator will receive protection from the award of
exemplary damages in media disputes, the opportunity to use an
arbitration 
<?notus-xml column=1393?>service and cost benefits from having access to this service. That is
one reason why it would benefit local as well as national newspapers.
If a complainant chooses not to use the arbitration service, they can
still be liable for costs even if they
win.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0002.htm#13042386000107">Lord
Justice Leveson’s report was mainly about the press but the
original drafting of this Bill had the unintended effect of catching
blogs. That said, Lord Justice Leveson did express the hope,
in Recommendation 73 of his report, that online publishers would also
join a regulator. The Bill therefore needs to be amended to ensure that
exemplary damages did not apply to blogs and they could receive the
benefits of joining a recognised regulator. In recognition of the fact
that this is a complex area, your Lordships’ House agreed a
placeholder amendment on 25 March. The Government’s decision to
hold a mini consultation and pause for reflection to consider how the
Bill should deal with the blogosphere was sensible and we agree with
the policy objectives that the Government are seeking to address to
exempt micro businesses from the definition of relevant publisher where
they are a blog or where their publications are merely incidental to
their other businesses and to enable such micro businesses to receive
the benefits and cost incentives of joining a recognised regulator. The
Minister has been helpful in setting out a number of accompanying
thoughts around these points and the issues relating to what would and
would not qualify, and I think they will bear further consideration
once we see them written up in

is that the amendments we are now looking at and which we support
define a small blog as one whose turnover is below £2 million
and has up to 10 employees. It exempts such businesses from exemplary
damages and enables them to benefit from the cost advantages of an
arbitration service if they join a regulator, and that last point will
be particularly welcome to the community. As I say, we support the
proposals, and I am grateful for the manner in which they have been
pursued within the all-party agreement which has underpinned the whole
process, so we will not be dividing the

I would like to make a couple of ruminations about some of the issues
that we are talking about today, and within that are two questions to
which I hope the Minister will be able to respond. The first is that
the digital world as we know it is changing rapidly and the complexity
and parliamentary arithmetic of changing the royal charter means that
it will be hard to alter the legislation after this Session, so it
needs to be right. What consideration have the Government given to the
health and future of the blogging industry, and can the noble Lord
share with us the Government’s thinking on this point? I
understand that the indicators for a micro-business have come from a
definition used by BIS, and in that sense they are not specific to the
blogosphere. I have had representations already, and I am sure that
other noble Lords will also have received them, from those who argue
that the figures being used are on the high side, as rarely do we find
10 employees or even an annual turnover of £2 million in a blog
company. That would make for a very healthy company, but it is not how
the sector operates. Can the Minister estimate roughly how many blogs
this definition would capture at
present<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:31:06"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=1394?><hs_para UID="13042386000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0002.htm#13042386000110">I turn to a related but
more general point. We are talking about an industry that is in the
process of change. For example, the print circulation of newspapers is
estimated to shrink by at least a quarter in the
next five years and yet we are facing a rather bizarre situation where
newspapers are exempted the full 20% rate of VAT on print sales despite
the fact that in many cases online traffic now represents the majority
of their audiences. This is something which is bound to grow as we go
forward. In fact, we are fast approaching a situation where what we
previously believed, which is that we in this country do not tax
reading, is becoming the reverse of what will happen. Those who read
using electronic means, which will include those who are caught by this
amendment, will be paying 20% VAT. Is this something that the Minister
can say is under consideration, because it seems to me that we will
need to face up to it before too
long<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:31:58"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

the Minister for mentioning Mumsnet because it was the subject of
discussions in another place, and others have raised it. The break
point that he expressed is one to which we may need to return. Perhaps
when he concludes he will reflect on this. At what point do those who
blog and use it as a campaigning tool get caught? There is some doubt
in what he has said about whether Mumsnet, which is not a charity but
exists largely to circulate material that is in favour of a particular
point of view, could possibly be caught by this exception. It is one of
a number of areas in which, as the Minister has said, time will show us
what emerges. However, a little more clarity at this stage would be
helpful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:32:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

was keen to assert that it would not be sensible at this stage to
define a blog. He was then caught quite quickly by a question related
to blogging which illustrates that sometimes it might be sensible to
have in primary legislation clear definitions which we can all use. I
understand and support the idea that it is probably wrong to try to be
definitive at this stage and that we should see how things go, but if
that is the case, are there are any thoughts about how the Government
might consider revisiting the issue within a reasonable time if it
turns out that we need to move? After all, as I have said, this is the
digital age and things are moving fast. What is a blog today may change
into something else, and we want to be sure that we have the
flexibility which I do not currently see in the

McNally:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, not only
for that reply but for the constructive role he has played in getting
us as far as we are today. It is important to retain an all-party
approach as we take this through. The noble Lord asked how many blogs
this amendment will cover. We cannot provide an accurate estimate
because blogs are constantly started up and then stopped. However, we
feel that this is the right figure in order to exclude all those who we
hope and intend to exclude. On the definition of a blog, I was tempted
to call in aid that used by Clement Attlee when he wanted to exclude
Trotskyists from the Labour Party. They said, “How do we know
who are Trotskyists?”, and he said, “It’s a bit
like an elephant—when you see one, you know
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:34:56"></hs_TimeCode>”. In
a way, we are groping with blogs in an age of technology that is

have tried to get some key features which distinguish blogs from online
newspaper reporting. A blog is used primarily for an expression of
opinion. Multi-authored blogs usually cover a single subject of
interest. In all cases, blogs do not report in a factual and neutral
way on news or current affairs but are led by the personal views of the
individuals. While an online news site may contain comment, opinion or
bias, comment pieces are not its principal focus. What constitutes a
blog may change over time as convergence
increases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:36:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000115" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0002.htm#13042386000115">It
is a difficult area. When we debate these areas, we often point out
that future-proofing is virtually impossible. We hope that the
definition I have given today has been sufficiently carefully drafted
to provide the maximum possible clarity to organisations seeking to
know whether they are caught. We have produced a handy set of questions
on our website to help organisations to work this out. This is intended
as guidance only. Ultimately, as in the case of all legislation, the
decision on whether an organisation comes within or outside the scope
of any particular piece of legislation will fall to the courts.
The intention of the definition is to capture news publishers
who were the focus of Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry and
his subsequent recommendations. They are intended to act as the key
incentive for those publishers to join the new press regulator, while
also protecting those not intending to
join<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:37:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042386000116" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-0002.htm#13042386000116">On
Mumsnet, protection is the interlocking test, but such an organisation
may branch out or develop a kind of activity which takes it into the
realms of news and newspapers—a news media. Again, we would have
to be flexible. If an organisation develops in a way that makes it a
news organisation, it would have to consider its position. Lord Justice
Leveson, in making his recommendation and recognising the changing
architecture of our media, specifically said that he hoped news
organisations that were primarily online would consider themselves
willing to join any new

Plant of Highfield:</Member></B> My Lords, I think it has fallen to me,
as the longest serving Peer on the Joint Committee, to introduce its
report on the ETPIMs Bill. This creates the final part of the
architecture of the arrangements to replace control orders. We need
only look around today to see that the atmosphere around this is
somewhat less feverish than it was when control orders were introduced
in 2005, when both Houses of Parliament sat throughout two days and one
night. Indeed, we acted as Time Lords, turning the Friday into a
Thursday to preserve the continuity of the Sitting of the
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000004">It is
very important that this Bill had detailed pre-legislative scrutiny
because it is a draft Bill that may never be introduced into
Parliament. It is designed to provide arrangements for preventive
measures to be used in a situation of emergency, which of course may
never arise, in circumstances in which the provisions of the 2011 TPIMs
Act are judged to be insufficient. The Bill will, by definition, be
introduced at a tense and worrying time, and would be expected to pass
through Parliament as an emergency measure in double-quick time. In
these circumstances scrutiny will be very limited, so pre-legislative
scrutiny is all the more important as the Bill is not likely to receive
intense scrutiny in the emergency situation that will provide the
context for the Bill’s legislative career in both Houses. It is
an unusual approach, to say the least. It has been called by one
person—I have forgotten who—a “back pocket”
Bill; it is a Bill that the Government have in their back pocket, which
has been scrutinised by this process and will be brought to the House,
if necessary, in emergency
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:32:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000005">I
have to say that the Joint Committee was not convinced that it would be
necessary to proceed in this way. The 2011 Act could have been
extended. Extra powers could have been incorporated into it, which
could then be activated by laying an order. This would 
<?notus-xml column=350?>have meant that the powers themselves would have been scrutinised
properly in both Houses of Parliament prior to such a different Bill
passing through the Houses. One can appreciate the political
difficulties in having something on the statute book that quite a few
well informed commentators regard as being a version of control orders.
I do not think that myself, but it is politically difficult. I shall
come to the relationship between the provisions of this Bill and
control orders in a few
minutes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:33:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042394000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000006">However, we are where
we are and pre-legislative scrutiny is now the only real scrutiny to
which the Bill will be subjected, so this process is of utmost
importance. The Joint Committee would still like to see the TPIMs Act
and the ETPIMs Bill consolidated into one piece of legislation at the
earliest opportunity, although the Government seem to have rejected
that in their response to our report.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042394000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000007">Control orders,
introduced by the previous Government, were always rather
controversial. The TPIMs and ETPIMs regimes are intended to succeed
control orders and produce a new regime that is more compatible with
individual liberty—to be “more liberal”, in the
words of the Joint Committee’s report. How, in fact, do ETPIMs
differ from control orders and, indeed, from TPIMs? There is no doubt
that there is an overlap of purpose, and some overlap of provision,
with control orders. However I will stress the differences between the
ETPIMs arrangements and control orders.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042394000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000008">The first difference is
very significant: control orders could be imposed on the basis of the
Secretary of State having “reasonable suspicion” that the
suspect was engaged in terrorist activity. In the case of TPIMs, it is
based on “reasonable belief”. In the case of ETPIMs, it
is based on the balance of probabilities, and this is regarded as a
more objective test. However, we have received contrasting and somewhat
contradictory evidence about how significant this change is. It is
represented as raising the threshold by two notches: from reasonable
suspicion through reasonable belief to the balance of probabilities.
The police evidence from Deputy Assistant Commissioner Osborne
certainly regarded it as a significant and real change.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042394000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000009">However, the evidence
we have had from lawyers on this point has been a bit more guarded.
They have taken the view that it is a somewhat semantic distinction,
since, in their view, in reviewing control orders judges have tended to
use the higher standard, namely the balance of probabilities. So there
is a disagreement about whether the threshold has in practice been
raised. Certainly, in theory and rhetorically it has been raised, but
there is this doubt. We should give quite a lot of credence to the view
of the senior police officer about his own practice in
evidence-gathering and so forth. He certainly saw the new standard as
having some important consequences for police
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000010">Another
significant difference between control orders and TPIMs is the range of
restrictions an ETPIM order can impose on a suspect. Under control
orders, the Secretary of State had extensive powers to impose
relocation; under TPIMs, the Secretary of State could require residence
overnight at a specific address. Under ETPIMs, the Secretary of State
would have the power to impose a curfew of up to 16 hours—the
point about 
<?notus-xml column=351?>the 16 hours being to make it ECHR-compliant. The court has ruled that
more than 18 hours would be a deprivation of liberty. The Secretary of
State would also have the power to require a suspect to take up
residence in a facility provided by the Government. Under ETPIMs, there
could be a complete ban on the use of electronic equipment, compared
with a partial ban under TPIMs. Thus the Secretary of State would have
the power to prohibit someone subject to a control order from
associating with specific individuals without the consent of the
Secretary of
State.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000011">It
seemed to the committee that the differences between ETPIMs and control
orders were significant in terms of the evidential basis. DAC Osborne
argued that they had led to a change in police practices to meet the
requirements of the more rigorous standard and the various impositions
I just mentioned. The requirement about hours of curfew had been, as I
mentioned earlier, devised to make the ETPIMs arrangements
ECHR-compliant, and the Joint Committee certainly welcomed this.
Furthermore, the requirements of an order under ETPIMs are limited to
those set out in Schedule 1 to the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000012">This is
a big advance on control orders because the 2005 Act just gave a list
of potential impositions on suspects or controlees. This is rather
burnt into my soul, since I had quite an altercation with the then Home
Secretary about it. However, the list that was given was for
illustrative purposes only and the Secretary of State could in fact
impose any constraint on the situation of a controlee so as to disrupt
the attempt by that person to engage in terrorism, whereas under ETPIMs
the Secretary of State will be able only to impose those constraints
actually set out in Schedule 1.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042394000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000013">There is another
difference from control orders in that an individual ETPIMs order lasts
at most for two years. It can of course be imposed again if the
potential controlee has been engaged in “new” terrorist
activities or terrorist-related activity. “New” is given
a definition in the Bill that is rather different from conventional and
ordinary uses of that word, but it is important that it is defined
because it is new terrorist activity that provides the justification
once the two-year deadline has been reached for reimposing an ETPIMs
order on a controlee. These are substantial differences from control
orders and it is important to recognise that.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042394000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000014">As with TPIMs, as soon
as an order under the ETPIM regime is imposed on an individual it would
immediately trigger an automatic review hearing of the Secretary of
State’s decision to impose the notice. The purpose of the review
is to determine whether the circumstances in Clause 2 had been met by
applying the principles of judicial review, such as rationality,
proportionality, legality and so forth. There would be an immediate
review, using judicial review principles, of the imposition of an ETPIM
order.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042394000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000015">However, since the
advent of the Human Rights Act there has been a strong emphasis in the
courts on proportionality in the assessment of executive action that
impinges on rights. Proportionality has now become the central strand
in judicial review. Some jurists certainly take the view that it is
very difficult to distinguish between a judicial review that puts
proportionality in 
<?notus-xml column=352?>a central position and a merits review, the reason being that if a court
can quash one or more of the individual restrictions on a person under
an ETPIM order because it is regarded as disproportionate in relation
to a legitimate goal, it is very difficult to see how that judgment can
be anything other than a merits sort of judgment about the
order.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042394000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000016">The
committee favoured that idea of a full merits review because
proportionality is central to the sort of jurisprudence that flows from
the ECHR and it is then very difficult to distinguish between a
proportionality review and a merits review. The noble Lord, Lord
Carlile, said in his evidence to us that the difference between the two
forms of review—a judicial review and a merits review—was
a distinction without a difference. I suppose that as a previous
reviewer of terrorism legislation he is one of the two most experienced
people in this area, along with David Anderson, the current reviewer. I
think that we agreed with that and we favoured the Government just
facing up to reality—that there would be what added up to a
merits review, and not just emphasising proportionality, legality and
the other criteria of judicial
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000017">Reference
to the ECHR is important because Article 6—this also
relates to the role of the judges in scrutinising
ETPIMs—requires a right to a fair hearing. Satisfying that right
has been the problem with control orders and with TPIMs and will be a
problem again with ETPIMs, if one accepts that a right to a fair
hearing requires that the individual has some knowledge of the case
against him or her. Of course, this is not just a matter of the ECHR;
it is a matter of common-law principles to do with a fair trial and
fair
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:46:45"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:46:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000018">Both
TPIMs and ETPIMs rely on the closed material procedure. In the AF case
in 2009, it was argued in judgment that a person subject to a control
order must be given sufficient information about the allegations
against him or her so that effective instruction can be given by that
person to their lawyers. The controlee must be given the gist of the
case against him for the regime to be Article 6-compliant. That was a
judgment in the UK courts. It is a big defect that the Bill does not
require the Secretary of State to furnish such a gist as a right but
that she will consider doing so only if requested by the court. That
puts the Secretary of State between a rock and a hard place. She will
have either to supply the gist if ordered to do so by a court or to
drop the action, as happened once or twice under control
orders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:48:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000019">Therefore,
there is a question about the legality of the ETPIMs order itself,
never mind prosecution: whether the person does or does not have the
gist of the case against him or her provided by the Secretary of State.
The Bill is clear that there is no right on the part of the controlee
to receive such a gist. The Joint Committee believes strongly that the
Government should be prepared to let the controlee have knowledge of
the gist of the case against him or her and that that would provide for
making the Bill not only Article 6-compliant but also compatible with
common law—particularly, English common-law
doctrines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:49:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000020">There
remains the question of what happens when the ETPIM order has expired.
It expires after two years unless the Secretary of State determines
that the 
<?notus-xml column=353?>person has been engaged in new terrorist activities and imposes a new
ETPIM regime based on the balance of probabilities. If there is still
suspicion about the person being engaged in terrorist activities but
not such that can satisfy the requirements of the balance of
probabilities, someone is let off the ETPIM regime. What happens next?
The Bill is more or less silent about this. The assumption has to be
that the controlee will be kept under surveillance by the security
services. It would certainly be useful to know from the Minister how
public protection will be ensured after the expiration of an ETPIM
order—a problem that did not arise under the control order
regime, which could be continued subject to periodic review and so
forth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:50:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000021">Two
further points have become more salient recently. One issue explored by
the committee was whether the security situation necessitating the
introduction of an ETPIM Bill could be made worse by public sector cuts
and a reduction in funds to the police and MI5. This issue was touched
on by DAC Osborne. The security situation can be changed by an
increased threat both because more people are engaged in this sort of
activity and because the police and security services lack the
resources to monitor the individuals concerned. The Minister, Mr
Brokenshire, rejected this view in his evidence. However, the
<I>Times</I> suggested today on its front page that the heads of MI5
and MI6 had made representations to the Government prior to the
spending review suggesting that further budget reductions put security
at risk. If they do, it might have an effect on whether an ETPIM Bill
is introduced. The security threat would have increased not because
there are more people engaged in terrorism but because fewer people
were engaged in monitoring it. That is an important issue, which was
crystallised by the <I>Times</I>
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:52:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000022">Secondly,
I would like to know how the requirements of ETPIM orders will be
implemented and compliance monitored. Will it be done by the police or
by private security companies? We are dealing with people who, on the
balance of probabilities and according to an objective threshold of
judgment, are regarded as being among the most dangerous people in the
country. If their compliance with an ETPIM regime is to be monitored by
a private company such as G4S, what confidence does the Minister have
that such firms will be up to the job after the debacle over the
Olympics? This is very important. We need to know, if not in detail,
how the Government see the implementation of this
working<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:53:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000023">My
final point is about prosecution. Paragraph 15 of the
Government’s response to the Joint Committee’s report
states that the Crown Prosecution Service, in consultation with the
police, will decide whether to bring a prosecution. I am not at all
sure how this rather bald statement is compatible with the role of
government in determining the public interest. Surely it cannot be the
case that the police and the CPS will be able to authorise prosecution,
with the disclosures that such a prosecution would bring, without
getting guidance from the Government about what is in the national
interest. If the Government have to have a view about whether a
prosecution should be proceeded with, it cannot be the case that only
the CPS and the police should decide on a prosecution. I would like 
<?notus-xml column=354?>some clarification over that. It was certainly the case under the
control order regime that the Government abandoned one or two
prosecutions because they regarded the disclosures required as being
against the public interest. The Government have to make that judgment
about the national interest, and, if so, then they are involved in the
judgment about whether or not to prosecute. I beg to
move.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_23_PT_1/B87DC86A45CBEACD8FB94AEF5772129BD7F46118" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 April 2013">Tuesday,

Doocey:</Member></B> My Lords, as a member of the Joint Committee that
considered the draft ETPIMs Bill, I seek clarification from the
Government on three points. The first is emergency legislation. The
committee considered the draft Bill in the context of recently enacted
TPIMs legislation and accepted it to be a positive move away from
control orders. However, I entirely agree with the comments made by the
noble Lord, Lord Plant: the progress of TPIMs legislation could have
included the option for such powers in the 2011 Act, but instead there
was talk of emergency legislation should such a need for extra powers
arise. The suggestion of emergency legislation for an ETPIMs Bill
strikes me as unacceptable to the principles of parliamentary scrutiny.
I urge the Government to think again on this point.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042394000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000025">The noble Lord has
suggested, and the committee is very much in agreement with this,
consolidating TPIMs and ETPIMs legislation without the pressure of time
or security threat. By its very nature, emergency legislation requires
enactment in a very short time—perhaps just a few days. The
committee heard that in such exceptional circumstances the Home
Secretary would be severely restricted in what information he or she
would be able to share with Parliament. One of our witnesses said that
the Home Secretary would almost be in a position of saying:</hs_para>
<hs_quote UID="13042394000273" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000273">“‘Trust

is essential that a credible process of briefing and scrutiny takes
place in the event that ETPIMs legislation is brought forward. It is
our duty to scrutinise; it would not do to reply on trust or indeed to
offer private briefings to select Members. The formal government
response to our report acknowledges that one way to achieve this would
be to brief the Intelligence and Security Committee and for it to
report to Parliament. Such a structured approach is far preferable to
the informal “trust me” option.</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="13042394000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000027">My second area of
concern is the definition of “exceptional circumstances”.
I encourage the Government to be clearer about the rare and exceptional
nature of the circumstances that might require the additional powers
covered by the draft ETPIMs Bill. There was consensus on the committee
that such circumstances were at the rarer end of the spectrum of
seriousness, but we heard a call for ETPIMs to be enacted ahead of the
2012 Olympic Games. This was sensibly rejected, but it indicates to me
that more clarity is needed.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13042394000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000028">The Government’s
response was that exceptional circumstances were those in which a
serious terrorist threat required the additional ETPIMs powers.
However, such a definition sheds little light beyond the dictionary
meaning of the word “exceptional”. I ask the Minister to
reflect on this because our discussions today may 
<?notus-xml column=355?>well be examined in years to come to see what we intended. The
Government must be clearer on this matter.</hs_para>

committee, the assurance from the Government that they will establish a
formal review group for any ETPIMs orders mirroring those operated for
existing TPIMs orders. This would be an important safeguard to ensure
that each ETPIMs order goes no further than absolutely necessary in its
demands on the person involved.</hs_para>

about judicial process. We are all agreed that where possible we must
always prosecute those involved in terrorism. A fair and open trial
must be the ultimate aim in all cases. To introduce administrative
orders restricting liberty stretches the principle of justice that we
hold dear. That is why it is
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T15:59:13"></hs_TimeCode> that,
unlike control orders, TPIMs and ETPIMs are time-limited measures.
However, such time limits mean that we must be ready to answer the
question: what happens when the time is up? The Government must take
real steps to develop TPIMs exit strategies based around
deradicalisation and judicial processes. I recognise that the use of
intercept evidence in court will not, in itself, remove the need for
TPIMs or ETPIMs, but it may help in later judicial processes. That
means that the Government must continue to examine ways to make
intercept evidence admissible in our courts, as it is elsewhere in the
world.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042394000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000031">The
Joint Committee was clear that exit strategies from TPIMs and possible
ETPIMs must be developed in every case. From my reading of the
Government’s response, this is a recommendation that has been

are currently in place for each TPIMs order? What is proposed for those
higher-risk cases where neither prosecution nor deportation is
considered possible? I look forward to the Minister’s response
but I retain the hope that the circumstances requiring the introduction
of ETPIMs legislation will not come

coalition Government decided that they did not like the control orders
introduced in the interests of national security by the Prevention of
Terrorism Act 2005. They therefore brought in the Terrorism Prevention
and Investigation Measures Act 2011, which replaced control orders with
something that was very similar in many respects, namely TPIMs or
“control orders-lite”, but which had the key advantage
from the Government’s point of view of having a different
name.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000034">However,
the Government had to recognise that no longer having the full powers
under the control orders, as provided for in the Prevention of
Terrorism Act 2005, represented a potential threat to national
security. As has been said, they were not prepared to address 
<?notus-xml column=356?>this reality in the original TPIMs Act because politically that would
have weakened even further their argument that control orders should
cease to exist. Instead they have prepared a separate Bill, the
Enhanced Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Bill, which
has been the subject of consideration by the Joint Committee, and which
the Government would seek to pass through Parliament as emergency
legislation providing for additional restrictive measures in an ETPIM

However, will the Minister say whether, under the draft Bill and in
exceptional circumstances, an ETPIM could be deemed necessary if, at
the end of the maximum period of two years for which a TPIM could be
enforced, an individual covered by that TPIM was still regarded as a

cease by law to have effect. Presumably, if the Government

the Government saying that, by a happy coincidence, these individuals

what action they would take, or what the options would be when the TPIM
expired, when they made the decision that TPIMs in respect of an

back to what the Government mean when they say that an ETPIM would only
be introduced in exceptional circumstances, the government Minister who
gave evidence to the Joint Committee identified “multiple
attacks” or a “really exceptional incident” as
possible triggers for the ETPIMs Bill to be introduced. If that is the
case, does it mean that an incident actually has to have occurred, with
possible injuries or loss of life, before the emergency Bill would be
introduced? Could the ETPIMs Bill be introduced in respect of an
individual where there was activity which suggested an incident might
be about to be perpetrated, or will we have to wait either until we are
sure an incident is about to be perpetrated, or wait for someone to be
quite possibly killed or injured in an incident before it was deemed
that there were “exceptional circumstances” which
justified the Bill being introduced? Apparently the independent

Bill sets out the conditions on which the Secretary of State must
satisfy herself before imposing an ETPIM. One of those conditions is
that the individual is, or has been, involved in terrorism-related
activity, and that some or all of this activity is “new”.
The definition of “new” is addressed in the Joint
Committee’s report, but it would be helpful if the Minister
could give us some examples from a government perspective of what would
or would not constitute “new” terrorism-related activity
in relation to the conditions on which the Secretary of State must be
satisfied before imposing an ETPIM. It could presumably be the ETPIM
itself and the conditions attached to it that were preventing the
individual concerned from embarking on “new”
terrorist-related activity. Could the reference to “new”
activity mean that the ETPIM could not be extended or renewed because
there was no evidence of new activity even though the reason there was
no “new” activity was the existence

powers should be introduced only if they are needed, and should be
specifically agreed by Parliament. Our view is that they should not be
routinely available on the statute book. That is why we have prepared,

by its very nature, unknown. It would be difficult and unwise to
attempt an exhaustive hypothetical definition. However, situations in
which the draft enhanced TPIM Bill might be introduced are if there was
credible reporting pointing to a series of concurrent attack plots, all
of which appeared imminent, or in the wake of a major terrorist attack
where there was a potential prospect that there may be further attacks.
I say to the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, that an individual may pose a
particular threat to national security such that it is necessary to
introduce the ETPIM
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:25:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

makes available a range of more stringent powers that are not available
under TPIMs. These include relocation to another part of the UK without
consent; the requirement to be in a named residence for up to 16 hours;
geographical boundaries beyond which they may travel only with
permission; a total ban on access to communications equipment such as
computers and mobile phones; and further restrictions on association.
The noble Lord, Lord Plant, went into those in his introductory
remarks. As the noble Lord identified, there are clear differences
between control orders and ETPIMs, and I thank him for setting them out
so clearly. They include the higher legal test, the limit on
restrictions that can be imposed and the two-year
limit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:26:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000066">The
noble Lord asked how ETPIM notices would be enforced, and specifically
what confidence I would have in a private contractor performing this
role. Of course we hope that the ETPIM Bill never comes into force, but
if we had to impose an ETPIM notice, enforcement, as with TPIMs, would
be a matter for the police, and I am confident that they would not take
a step that put public safety at risk. They would make a judgment that
conformed to the seriousness of the situation and the national security
risk involved.</hs_para>

includes some important safeguards. First, the enhanced powers will be
available only if Parliament believes that they are necessary. The
enhanced measures will also be subject to a higher legal test, as I
said, in order to impose them. The Secretary of State must be satisfied
that the person is or has been involved in terrorism-related activity
on the balance of probabilities. That is a higher threshold than
“reasonable belief”, which is the test for a standard
TPIM notice. I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Rosser that the ETPIM Bill
is clear that new terrorist-related activity is that which has been
committed after the imposition of an ETPIM notice. That is quite clear
in the draft Bill.</hs_para>

with my noble friend Lady Doocey that it is important to develop a
clear exit strategy for each TPIM subject. Noble Lords
will  
<?notus-xml column=362?>appreciate that I cannot go into detail on this work, but I confirm that
there is a multiagency approach to ensure that all options are
considered. We continue to believe that prosecution and conviction is
the best approach to combat the risk of terrorism, and that the best
place for a terrorist is in a prison cell. In addition, the police and
Crown Prosecution Service continue to keep under review whether a
successful prosecution could be brought against those subject to a TPIM
notice. We will also continue to keep under review whether further
tools are required to enable the prosecution of

say to the noble Lord, Lord Plant, that the Government maintain the
fully independent Crown Prosecution Service to apply the public
interest test. It is a two-stage test, as it is in all prosecutions:
first, that there is a realistic prospect of conviction based on the
evidence available; and, secondly, that it is in the public interest to
prosecute. To apply this test, it considers the evidence that can be
put forward in an individual case, including where there may be any
national security concerns. This is why the Government are conducting
an extensive and detailed review to assess the benefits, costs and
risks of introducing intercept as evidence. This work continues under
the guidance of the cross-party group of privy counsellors and will
report in due course. The former and current independent reviewers of
counterterrorism legislation and my noble friend Lady Doocey have said
that IAE would not remove the need for
TPIMs.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13042394000301" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000301">4.30

Government take their international obligations, to which I was pleased
that the noble Lord, Lord Plant, referred, seriously, and are committed
to ensuring that our counterterrorism legislation is compliant with our
commitments under international law. The finding in AF (No. 3) in 2009
set out the requirement to provide the control order subject with the
gist of the case against him. This has been taken as a valid precedent
in the treatment of TPIM cases. It is for the court—and properly
so—to determine the application and development of case law
surrounding TPIMs and, should it be necessary,
ETPIMs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000071">I
am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, understands that for obvious
national security reasons I am unable to comment on the specific detail
of the absconding of Ibrahim Magag, but I can help him on costs. In the
transition to TPIMs, significant extra funding was made available to
the police and security service to enhance its investigative
capabilities. Control orders cost the Home Office £12.5 million
in total between 2006 and 2010. The administrative cost of TPIM notices
is broadly comparable. A significant part of the costs relate to
extensive judicial scrutiny to ensure that the use of TPIMs is fair and
justified, and I am sure that noble Lords would not wish that to be
other than the case. The Government cannot speculate about why the
police used the phrase highlighted by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, but
we are confident that they have been provided with a range of powers
and resources to deal with the small number of individuals who are
subject to TPIMs.</hs_para>

address the question that I asked about what happens to those who are
on TPIMs at present? I understand that at least some, if not all, TPIMs
will come to an end at the beginning of next year. What is going to
happen to them? I asked whether, if those people were still considered
a threat to national security, the Government could seek an ETPIM in
respect of them or whether they would fail to meet the criteria if they
had not committed any “new” terrorist activity. I also
asked whether, if someone is subject to an ETPIM, the Government
envisage renewing it or extending it in any form because presumably,
under their own definition, they could do so only if the individual had
committed some “new” terrorist activity while under the
EPTIM which, if the EPTIM was being effective, the individual would not

question about the disengagement of subjects from a TPIM order. The
future conduct of individuals who have been subject to a TPIM or an
ETPIM will be subject to review regarding the nature of the threat that
they present to national security. That is how this legislation works

I thought that his response on private security firms was possibly a
little oversubtle. I do not know whether he meant that it would still
be down to each police force that was responsible for an ETPIMs
controlee to decide for themselves, in the light of the national
security position, whether or not they should contract out the
supervision and the way of imposing the ETPIM order on an individual.

the end of our time and effort today, but we have not really discussed,

provide an incentive for prosecution. Given that they last for only two
years, you might say that there is an incentive; on the other hand,

ETPIMs may militate against the capacity to bring a prosecution.

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:42:04"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I
shall provide the Committee with a brief summary of what the order is
intended to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:42:42"></hs_TimeCode>. The
order is made under Section 104 of the Scotland Act 1998, which allows
for necessary or expedient changes to UK legislation in consequence of
any provision made by or under any Act of the Scottish Parliament. This
order is made in consequence of the Children’s Hearings
(Scotland) Act 2011, which I shall refer to as the 2011 Act. The 2011
Act aims to improve support for both professionals and panel members to
ensure consistency of approach and practice, with a view to achieving
better outcomes for children and young people involved in
Scotland’s children’s hearings system. The 2011 Act will
provide for legal and procedural changes to ensure that
children’s rights continue to be properly upheld, while also
bringing the majority of existing law relating to children’s
hearings into a single
statute<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:43:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000084">The
2011 Act largely restates and updates the law relating to
children’s hearings in Scotland. The order will ensure that
existing legislation in England and Wales, as well as reserved UK
legislation, is updated to reflect those changes. The order also makes
cross-border provision to ensure that certain aspects of the
children’s hearings system—for example, the placing of
children in a particular place—apply to other parts of the UK.
The modifications made by the order are largely of a technical nature
and will ensure that the existing law continues to operate effectively
by recognising the modifications made by the 2011 Act and subordinate
legislation made under
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T16:44:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000085">The

civil servant in charge of the Bill coming to speak with us. I suppose
that I have spent the subsequent 45 years watching the development of
the children’s panel system, which is characterised by being
much admired but hardly ever replicated. I certainly believe that the
welfare approach is the right approach and that the children’s
hearings are more likely to find a suitable conclusion to, or
development of, the person’s situation. I think that we in
Scotland were right to abandon the juvenile court approach that was
extant before 1968.</hs_para>

the wonderful support of the Samaritans and other related charities,
such as Combat  
<?notus-xml column=370?>Stress? Technology is key to recognising that young people, in
particular, no longer use a phone in the conventional way. They text
and use social media to communicate and share their thoughts.
Partnerships between organisations affected by incidents of suicide are
critical. An example of this is a five-year partnership between the
Samaritans and Network Rail, who are working together to confront
suicide with some considerable success. In addition, there is a strong
role for government. The new suicide prevention strategy, <I>Preventing
</I><I>S</I><I>uicide in England,</I> published by the Department of
Health in September 2012, is very welcome. This important development
in government thinking recognises that any strategy to tackle suicide
must be cross-government and needs the support of the voluntary and
statutory sectors, academic institutions and schools, businesses,
industry, faith groups, journalists and other
media<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:12:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000109">The
link to other social problems, such as family breakdown, unemployment,
debt, alcohol and drug misuse and the criminal justice system is so
important. In short, we live in a complex society where, too often,
people are lonely and feel unable to cope, even when they may have a
loving family around them. The strategy makes some critically important
statements in its six defined areas of action, which aim to reduce the
risk of suicide in key high-risk groups; to tailor approaches to
improve mental health in specific groups; to reduce access to the means
of suicide; to provide better information and support to those bereaved
or affected by suicide; to support the media in delivering sensitive
approaches to suicide and suicidal behaviour; and, finally, to support
research, data collection and
monitoring<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:13:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000110">The
strategy includes a new area for action, highlighting the importance of
providing better support to people who have been bereaved by suicide.
Some bereaved families say that hitherto there has been little support
available for them to turn to. The strategy is also very clear that,
for suicide prevention to be effective, mental and physical health have
to be seen as equally important, and we need better mental health for
all. That in itself presents an enormous challenge, albeit one that is
entirely laudable and should be pursued with
rigour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:14:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is to ensure that the six areas of action are applied in practice and
filter through to all parts of the country, both urban and rural, and
reach those in need of support. All upper-tier local authorities in
England should, I suggest, commit to the development of a local suicide

to turn to when they are in shock following the suicide of a family
member or friend? Coroners’ officers, GP surgeries and other
gatekeepers need to ensure that they are referring people bereaved by
suicide to sources of support—for example, making available the
<I>Help is at Hand</I> support booklet. In addition, rollout of a new
free-to-caller number, allocated by the European Commission and
transferred by Ofcom to the Samaritans, is key, albeit additional

implementation of the strategy is crucial, the All-Party Parliamentary
Group on Suicide and Self-Harm Prevention has recently sought to
investigate the effectiveness of local suicide prevention plans in
England—a relevant question, given both the strategy and the
fact that both recent public health and NHS reforms have, as of this
month, become fully operational. The all-party group wrote to local
authorities and PCTs to establish the extent of suicide prevention
activity in each of the 152 county and unitary local authority areas in
England, and the response is concerning: 27% of local authority areas
do not have a local suicide prevention plan and 46% of local authority
areas do not have a multi-agency suicide prevention
group.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000114" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000114">The
all-party group made a number of important, practical recommendations.
At national level, these are aimed primarily at the Department of
Health, the main thrust being that a stronger set of requirements needs
to be imposed by the Government to ensure that the aims and objectives
of the strategy are implemented at local level. The necessary steps for
implementation at local level include requiring local authorities each
to develop a suicide prevention plan led by the director of public
health, and those plans should reflect the six areas for action to
which I have already referred. Progress needs to be monitored so that
there is a clear understanding at national level of where there are
gaps in local implementation. Also, a sharing of best practice and
other information about suicide prevention work across the country and
between the four nations of the UK should be put in place. Therefore,
there is a very important role for government and I hope to hear from
my noble friend this evening that there is a strong focus upon
practical implementation of the strategy.</hs_para>

Giddens:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady
Buscombe, on having introduced this debate in such an effective
fashion. Suicide is an extremely complex form of action to study and,
hence, to develop preventive strategies against. There are two reasons
for that. The first is that, by definition, you cannot interview people
who have committed suicide—there are very few other examples in
social life where this is true. Secondly, in order to be said to commit
suicide, you have to have the intention to die. If you step off a kerb
accidentally and a car knocks you down, it is not suicide. As most
people do not leave notes, intention has to be inferred retrospectively
by
coroners.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:19:26"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

I studied suicide in the early part of my academic career, we looked at
lots of judgments made by coroners. They led me to be deeply suspicious
of suicide statistics and therefore of preventive strategies 
<?notus-xml column=372?>based on those statistics. It is not that suicide statistics are just
inaccurate around the edges; in my opinion, they are often probably
totally wrong and non-comparable. One thing about the government
document on preventing suicide in England is that it is based almost
wholly on statistics, and risk is calculated in that way. For example,
the noble Baroness cited figures suggesting that three times as many
young men commit suicide as other groups. However, I think that that is
highly unlikely to be true. I do not have the time to say why, but I
think that it is highly unlikely. One must depend upon intensive
studies of suicide and not just statistical ones.</hs_para>

has committed suicide is to look at those who attempt suicide in
various serious situations. We had an interesting study of people who
jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. If someone jumps
off that bridge he is almost certain to die—only about 3%
survive. The study interviewed the survivors. It was interesting that
on the way down, people were thinking, “I didn’t need to
do this”, or, “I could have solved my
problems”. What they said was very interesting. It was
admittedly a small sample, because most people die, but they all said
that it was the Golden Gate or nothing. In other words, the method that
you use to commit suicide is very important, especially if you intend
to do it seriously—there is a massive difference between most
attempted and actual
suicides<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:21:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000119" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000119">Another
study of the Golden Gate Bridge covered 515 people who were stopped
from jumping. That was also interesting. One might imagine that people
who really want to kill themselves will go on until they do it, but
that is not so at all. In the study, of the 515 people, 95% were either
still alive 25 years later or had died of natural causes. In other
words, at least for certain types of suicide, if prevented at source,
it does not recur. That has important
implications.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000120" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000120">In
this country, some 20 people on average jump off Beachy Head each
year—124 people died there between 1965 and 1979. A medical
researcher who studied the details very intensively—this is why
I am recommending intensive studies—concluded that 115 of this
group were almost certainly suicides. To show the point that I was
making earlier, only 58 were recorded as suicides by the coroner. That
is a huge difference; it is double the rate. A lot of people who jump
off Beachy Head are women, not men. Having read <I>Preventing
</I><I>S</I><I>uicide in England</I>, a bit more lateral thinking would
be in order, in recognising all the great work that the Samaritans

my minute I must ask quickly, first, what is the Government’s
policy on popular suicide spots? Are they all left to volunteer groups,
such as at Beachy Head, where it is mainly a chaplaincy group that
tries to stop people? It is very important to know because probably
about 500 people a year die in popular suicide spots, which is about 4%
of the total number in the country. That is pretty significant. I do
not know whether the Government have a policy on that, but as the
Golden Gate study shows, if you stop them, the vast majority do not
come back to try again. Secondly, is there an analogue to the Live
Through This project in the United States, which is pretty intriguing
to me. 
<?notus-xml column=373?>It is backed by the American Association of Suicidology. Oh dear, I will
have to stop, I suppose. It is transformational because it is a website
for people who have survived serious suicide attempts. They speak out
openly in a variety of media sources and communities. The idea is to
strip away stigma and shame, and it is the first time that that has
ever been done. There is a major input from people on a large scale who
have attempted suicide, and there is a public-private partnership to
support it. The main thing is that people who have attempted suicide
have been seen as objects not subjects. In this case, they appear as
subjects. I had a good third point but have no time to make

Roberts of Llandudno:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Buscombe, for giving us this opportunity, and for
bringing to our attention, as the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, said, the
statistic that three times as many young men between the ages of 30 and
44 commit suicide than women in that age range, or perhaps a wider age
range. Does that not somehow reflect the economic situation—jobs
and so on? A University of Liverpool study suggested that 1,000
suicides in the general age range were because of the recession. How
true that is I do not know, but that is the figure that the University
of Liverpool gives
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000123">In Wales
we had a different situation. In 2007, seven youngsters in Bridgend
committed suicide, six of them by hanging. In that year, there was a
terrible dilemma in Wales: why were these people doing it? They were
saying, “It is such a boring place, what else can I do? What
other job can I get? I want to get out of here”. The only way
they could see to get out of there was by committing suicide.</hs_para>

reasons for suicide vary tremendously. As a minister, I encountered it
fairly often—not too often but often enough. Why did they try to
do this? Sometimes you just shook your head and said, “No
idea”. At other times you would say, “Ah
yes”—there were problems that we were aware of. According
to the statistics, 1 million people commit suicide every year
worldwide. Of these, 100,000 are young people, 15 to 19 year-olds. I
suggest that there are 100,000 different reasons why they would try to
commit suicide—so many different countries, so many different
situations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000126" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000126">A
new scheme is being brought in in Indiana in July this year. Everyone

families.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042394000127" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000127">I
have discussed this with ministers of other denominations—the
number of priests and ministers in communities and the number of
lively, active, alert churches is far fewer than it used to be. When
that happens, the community is weakened because there is not the person
there to support the most vulnerable. 
<?notus-xml column=374?>The figures from my own church in Wales are startling: 100 years ago we
had 137 Welsh-speaking ministers of our own home-grown variety; today
we have two or three. It is a big difference. A Presbyterian minister
told me, “In my church at the time of the great Welsh Revival
100 years ago we had 1,000 ministers. We now have 40”. So the
people who would be in the community to support and listen are not
there in the same way, and the families who would also get their
support in the churches are not there.</hs_para>

churches. I have a list here: policemen, village-based teachers, local
shop-owners, local football teams, bands and choirs, even well run
pubs—and I might well be struck off for praising well run pubs.
These are all part of the community and they are not there to the same
extent any longer. The local community is the strongest and best friend
of those who are most vulnerable. We must somehow give it new strength
so that it can fulfil what it used to do in treating and responding to
needs.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13042394000310" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000310">5.29

Wheatcroft:</Member></B> My Lords, every suicide is a glaring
reflection of the fact that our society has failed to look after its
most vulnerable. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, has just explained how
he sees failings in the community as partly responsible for that, and I
can only agree. I welcome the Government’s decision to produce
their new suicide prevention strategy, and congratulate my noble friend
Lady Buscombe on securing this debate. At this point, I must declare an
interest as a member of the Samaritans advisory board. We are well
represented here this afternoon. I am in awe of the remarkable work

decide to take their own lives are varied, although there are some
factors that seem to be very regular occurrences, particularly
financial ones. When World Suicide Prevention Day took place last year,
there was a campaign under the heading “You Can Cope”,
but those who kill themselves have generally decided that they cannot
cope, or at least that they cannot cope alone. I agree with the noble
Lord, Lord Roberts, that they feel alone. This does not necessarily
mean that they are single. They may be in relationships, they may be in
touch with their family, and they may apparently have a network of
friends, but the person who is driven to suicide tends to feel very
much alone. A problem shared is said to be a problem halved, but a
problem left to grow like a malignant tutor—tumour, although
there are a few malignant tutors around—inside the brain and
heart of an individual is a problem multiplied. For whatever reasons,
and pride may be one of them, too many people today have no one they
can share their problems with.</hs_para>

age when many people have hundreds, indeed, thousands, of what they
would term friends on Facebook, there are more and more people who,
when they hit the slough of despond, do not have a friend to turn to
but welcome being able to turn to a stranger. A friend of mine who
spent many years as a Samaritan told me that what was really wanted on
the end of the phone was a friend. The main cause that really drove
those people to ring was extreme loneliness. 
<?notus-xml column=375?>She told me that she kept one of her clients going for several days
after he called to say that it was the end, there was nothing to eat in
the house and he could not cope. She told him the ingredients for
cauliflower cheese and sent him out to buy them, and when he came back,
she talked him through the recipe. When he said, “But what about
the bird? There’s nothing for the bird to eat”, she
suggested that the bird should eat cauliflower cheese too. In the end,
this guy went away, not happy, but feeling less alone, and over the
years he called her again occasionally and they talked
recipes.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042394000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000132">For
those at their wits’ end, the Samaritans enable them to phone a
friend. People do that about 5 million times a year. Other charities do
fantastic work in helping those who feel suicidal, and the national
prevention strategy acknowledges the importance of getting all those
organisations to work together and to work in tandem with social
services and the National Health Service, but today I shall stress the
one way in which these charities can be helped to be more effective; it
is by making that life-saving phone call cheaper. The
Samaritans’ national helpline number is an 0845 number, which
means that landline calls are relatively inexpensive, but calls from
mobiles are considerably more. Incredible although it may seem, the
Samaritans’ research shows that the cost of that call will put
people off making it. The aim is to have a free-to-caller national
number. In 2009, Ofcom gave the Samaritans the number 116123, which is
pretty easy and memorable. It has been successfully trialled, but to
roll that out nationally requires about £1 million a year. It
would be dreadful for somebody to pluck up the courage to phone a
friend in extremis to ring that number and find it dead. Without the
certainty that that £1 million will be there or that there will
be some other means of achieving it, that potential lifeline is not
being rolled out. Far be it from me to suggest in the current climate
that the Government should dig deep, or even quite shallowly, into
their pockets and find that extra money, but there has to be a way that
together Ofcom, the telecoms operators and the Samaritans can get
together and produce some way of doing this. Perhaps the lottery could
help. It might cost a little money, but what it would save is
immeasurable.</hs_para>

Lord Bishop of Exeter:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, I, too, am
grateful for this debate. There are just two aspects on which I shall
comment. The first is the issue of suicide prevention among people in
contact with the criminal justice system—something that
concerned me greatly in my early years as Bishop of Exeter. In the
three prisons in the Exeter diocese, 20 men committed suicide between
2001 and 2011. Of these, 14 were at Exeter prison—a figure which
reflects the higher incidence of suicide in local prisons, especially
during the early days of imprisonment. Half of these deaths, though,
were between 2001 and 2004, and I note that the number of suicides in
prison nationally has also fallen steadily since 2004, apart from a
spike in 2007. Hopefully this is a sign that measures taken under the
NOMS suicide prevention strategy are having an effect. However, with 57
suicides in prison in 2011, there is still real cause for
concern.</hs_para>

6 March this year, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman published a
“Learning lessons” bulletin<I>,</I> following
investigation of the apparently self-inflicted deaths of three
teenagers in young offender institutions. Each of these children was
extremely vulnerable and the lessons learnt included better responses
to bullying and a greater focus on the involvement of families and
outside agencies. This is where I come to my second area of concern and
the main subject of this debate. From this month, local authorities
have new responsibilities for co-ordinating and implementing work on
suicide prevention. It will be for local agencies, including working
through health and well-being boards, to decide the best way to achieve
the overall aim of reducing the suicide rate. However, while there are
clearly opportunities here for local initiatives in co-ordinating and
commissioning work, there is also a risk that, especially where there
is no local suicide prevention plan, this priority may be overlooked in
the allocation of funds.</hs_para>

All-Party Group on Suicide and Self-Harm Prevention have already been
referred to by the noble Baroness. Only half of local authorities have
a local suicide prevention group, while a quarter said that there was
no local suicide prevention plan, even where there is a local suicide
prevention group. Often there is no formal mechanism for such groups to
report directly to health and well-being boards. Only one-third of
respondents mentioned specific suicide prevention programmes. Yet the
report also mentioned the key role of third sector groups. Many suicide
prevention actions contained in local plans involve the voluntary
sector in delivering programmes such as support services for people
bereaved by suicide. From the available evidence, the majority of
groups had voluntary sector membership, underlining their importance to
suicide prevention and the heavy reliance on
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000136" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000136">However,
within the voluntary sector there are real concerns about the
responsibilities placed upon them and the resources that enable them to
respond. Take the example of just one not-for-profit, open-access
counselling service in Devon. It sees around 160 clients a week. These
are self-referring adults who pay according to means. Work is with
individuals, couples and family groups. There are no paid employees and
all are qualified volunteers. The work of such groups is really
important, because the potentiality of suicide often does not appear as
a presenting issue, but rather through other therapeutic work,
revealing, for example, patterns of isolation, self-harm and
despair. However, the sustainability of such a model of group work is
increasingly a challenge in the current economic climate. Average
client contributions have fallen and margins are tight. Yet the
self-funding model still seems to be the only viable way of securing an
effective service. Counselling services are notoriously difficult to
fund. Counselling does not constitute a “charitable
purpose”—something at which Her Majesty’s
Government need to take a look—and thus many funders exclude
counselling services as recipients.</hs_para>

available, such as lottery funding, they can amount to the kiss of
death for a service as they are often short-term. Culturally, funders
tend to favour innovation and new services in preference to 
<?notus-xml column=377?>tried, tested and researched ways of working, and funding projects
rather than vital revenue costs. In my own areas, the combination of
these facts has led to the closure of numerous local services over the
years, revolving door-style, including high-quality and relatively
inexpensive services for young people at high risk. The fact is that
this very important voluntary sector, of which much is expected,
suffers from gross systemic underfunding, is too often neglected for
its experience and understanding, and thus such funding as there is may
often be misdirected and unwisely spent. I think, for example, of the
privileging of short-term cognitive behavioural therapy over
person-centred and psychodynamic approaches, which evidence shows have
a greater longer-term
effect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000138" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000138">If Her
Majesty’s Government’s well intended suicide prevention
strategy is to really work, more attention needs to be given to just
how the voluntary sector is most effectively supported and engaged.
This also means rectifying the fact that, while much of this work in
the third sector is underpinned by a strong faith base, and a great
deal of work is being done by faith groups in supporting those at risk
of suicide and self-harm, I find it concerning that there is so little
reference to faith groups in any of the official documents underpinning
the structures and strategies that we are debating

28 years ago, my boss and mentor fell out of a window four or five
stories high in a block of flats. The next morning, the <I>Daily
Mail</I>’s front page had a photograph of a mansion block of
flats, and a dotted line from the fifth floor to the pavement where he
fell. His children had to look at that in the newspaper. The story of
media coverage of suicide, and its imitative effects and so on, is
actually a good story from that day because coverage is much more
sensitive. It is much improved. Editors and journalists are much more
aware of the damaging effect of the wrong kind of sensationalist and
detailed coverage of the methods of suicide. This is particularly true
in broadcasting, where the statutory guidelines for producers and
coverage and so on deal in great detail with the coverage of suicide.
The media have for once a good story to tell in the way they deal with
this subject. There is a substantial body of evidence from around the
world which indicates that certain types of media reporting of suicide
can have a negative influence on the behaviour of people who are
already vulnerable and put them at greater
risk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000141" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000141">I am
worried about the uncertainty, the lacuna that exists, as we move from
the PCC to the Leveson-compliant new formula. There is considerable
uncertainty about the nature of that, who is going to sign up to that
regulation and so on, which has been well rehearsed in the Chamber. I
am worried that the progress that the 
<?notus-xml column=378?>media has made—and it is a good story—should not get lost.
The Government, and those charged with setting up the new body, will
understand that the good work that has been undertaken should not be
lost in the transition from the PCC to whatever the new body concerned
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000142" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000142">Others
have spoken about the good work that the Samaritans and other
organisations do, and that has to be true. The “116”
phone line that my noble friend Lady Wheatcroft alluded to is a serious
worry. We have to find the money to make this happen. I do not think it
has to be government money—it is only £1
million. I know it is easy to say that but, somehow, through the
lottery—I declare I was once chairman of Camelot—there
has to be a way to find this money on a regular basis, because those

life-saving.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000143">One
of the most worrying aspects concerns the causes of suicide. Sadly,
throughout my professional and personal life, I have been very close to
far too many suicides. In one or two cases you could look at them and
say they had everything to live for. Lack of recognition of the
symptoms is the most difficult aspect of this subject. I hope that the
ease and availability of the Samaritans service and the
“116” lines will permeate people’s consciousness,
that they will make that last despairing call and that they will be
able to afford to do so because the Samaritans can pay for it. That

as the vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Involuntary
Tranquiliser Addiction. We are a small core group of about
12 active MPs and Peers. With occasional help from the
media, we have been able to bring this issue to the attention of
successive Ministers. The BMA held a useful seminar recently. I am glad
to say that the present Health Ministers are now well aware of the
risks, because it is known that 1 million people or more are taking
benzodiazepines long term, not short term, and that their doctors are
not stopping them. The Minister will remember all the arguments that we
put forward during the Health Bill, and they remain valid today. These
include the obvious need for greater awareness among doctors and junior
doctors of the risks, good practice in the voluntary sector, better
NICE and NTA guidelines, more understanding of the general protocol of
withdrawal from prescribed drugs, and the need for a stronger national
policy backing up the confusing new local health agenda. I went to see
Public Health England only this afternoon and was encouraged that the
new health and well-being boards and CCTs will have this subject in
their list of priorities, but it will need a lot of
encouragement.</hs_para>

the need for the department to shift its spending priorities and its
drugs agenda just a little way away from illegal drugs towards
prescribed drugs. It is really the Samson and Goliath story. Almost all
the knowledge in the National Treatment Agency is about methadone and
alternatives to heroin, and about counselling. There is very little

and Z-drugs, unless they coincide because people are using them with
heroin<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T17:50:15"></hs_TimeCode>. The US

other noble Lords, I thank the organisations that have been mentioned,
including faith groups, and especially the Samaritans in their
important anniversary year. All these organisations, with their
thousands of volunteers, work with, care for and support people who are
troubled or have a mental illness. For too long, mental illness was
shrouded by stigma and deprived of adequate resources. People with a
mental illness, including those at risk of suicide, have always
depended on what the Government might call the big society. The
Samaritans have a shining record on this very tough subject.
Thankfully, the stigma in society relating to mental health is
increasingly being lifted, and all parties recognise the need for
mental health to have parity with physical health. We would all agree
on there being no mental health without physical health—and, I
would add, without appropriate social
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000154" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000154">As Call
to Action informs us, more lives in England are lost to suicide than to
road traffic accidents, and every life lost to suicide is a tragedy. I
welcome the cross-government strategy on preventing suicide. However,
like Sarah Yiannoullou, the manager of the National Survivor User
Network, I am concerned that self-help groups, survivor groups and
small voluntary and community organisations that have helped with
preventative support have had increased burdens put on them and are
having to close because of funding problems. There appears to be a
conflict between what is said in the strategy and people believing that
this can be delivered in the current climate. The right reverend
Prelate made very important points about systemic and short-term
funding.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000155" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000155">Mental
health services are clearly critical in providing the timely help and
emotional support that can reduce the risk of people committing
suicide. Having spoken to people working in mental health in my county
of Gloucestershire, I know that they fear that recent changes in the
NHS and the fracturing of services will have a negative impact on the
delivery of mental health services in the community, especially in
rural areas. There appears to be less co-ordination and less support
for joint efforts between health services, charities, churches and
other organisations that are working with people who have mental health
problems. I would be grateful for the noble Earl’s views on
whether there is appropriate integration where necessary. It feels as
if the postcode lottery is being
extended.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000156" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000156">A
briefing by the excellent organisation YoungMinds provides disturbing
information about cuts by local authorities. Some have slashed 27% of
their services, which has had an impact on people with mental health
problems. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, I am deeply concerned
about the lack of local suicide prevention plans. The Government must
not only provide requirements for such plans but must ensure that the
funding is there in order for local authorities to implement the
plans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000157">Society
has changed profoundly in the past 50 years. We now live in
a physically safer society, but emotionally people are far less secure.
As many noble Lords said, many people live alone, and even when they do
not live 
<?notus-xml column=381?>alone, they feel alone. We are all living longer, we have more stressful
and isolated lives and we have to cope with huge and constant change.
As the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said, the increase in young
people’s mental health problems is very disturbing. The factors
that contribute to mental health problems, and indeed to suicide, such
as drug and alcohol misuse, unemployment, social isolation, poverty and
poor social conditions, appear at the moment to be increasing, and
there are so many stresses and strains in society with little help
available. There is a lack of hope, and it is incumbent on us all to
give people more hope and vision for the future.</hs_para>

answers from the noble Earl about the support that the Government are
providing to the voluntary and statutory sectors. Perhaps one of the
greatest supports would be for the Government to change some of their
current policies so that factors such as poverty, which increase the
risk of suicide, are reduced. The risk of suicide in the whole
population increases when we experience times of financial
difficulty—this is not only my view but a widely held
one—so I urge the Government to maintain their support for
suicide prevention over the coming
years.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13042394000315" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000315">5.56

to suicide is a tragedy, and yet suicides are not inevitable. There are
often opportunities to intervene, and those missed opportunities can
highlight systemic failings. Timely access to high-quality mental
health services is an essential foundation for suicide prevention.
Although good progress has been made in reducing the suicide rate in
England over the past 10 years, the recent rise in the number of people
dying by suicide to around 4,500 in 2011 is worrying. Suicide continues
to be a major public health issue, particularly at a time of economic
and employment uncertainty. That is why we set out a new suicide
prevention strategy for England in September 2012, which highlights the
importance of targeting the groups most at risk by providing the right
support at the right time.</hs_para>

helpfully set out the key strands of that strategy and I was grateful
for her endorsement of them. She is right that success in suicide
prevention depends on communities, individuals and organisations
working together to tackle the issue. Much of the planning and work to
prevent suicides needs to be carried out locally. The right reverend
Prelate rightly referred to the role of the new health and well-being
boards in planning and co-ordinating local services based on local
needs. That role will clearly be a pivotal one in the future. These
health and well-being boards will become the forums for determining
local needs and priorities, bringing together local authorities,
clinical commissioning groups, directors of public health, adult social
services and children’s services. I am sure he is right that
third sector and voluntary groups will pay a 
<?notus-xml column=382?>key part in the delivery of local plans in many parts of the country.
The concerns expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, about
fragmentation of services are not ones I share. She may recall that in
the Health and Social Care Act we laid great emphasis on integration as
a key driver of commissioning. The very existence of health and
well-being boards acting as the hub for so many key players in the
public health and health arena will itself be a driver for that kind of
integration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000162" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000162">As
well as targeting high-risk groups, improving the mental health of the
population is another way to prevent suicide, as has been mentioned.
Our mental health outcomes strategy, <I>No Health Without Mental
Health</I>, sets out an ambitious vision for improving people’s
mental health. The implementation of the measures set out in the
strategy will build individual and community resilience, promote mental
health and well-being and challenge health inequalities where they
exist. Again, the Health and Social Care Act passed last year was the
first one to contain an objective in all parts of the health service to
drive out health inequalities.</hs_para>

Lady Royall, referred to the need for parity of esteem between mental
and physical health. Of course, I subscribe wholly to that aim. The
Government’s mandate to NHS England explicitly recognises the
importance of putting mental health on a par with physical health, and
closing the health gap between people with mental health problems and
the population as a whole. We expect the NHS to have made measurable
progress towards this goal by March 2015. This will include ensuring
timely access to the best available treatment through extending and
developing open access to the IAPT programme, Improving Access to
Psychological Therapies, particularly for those out of work. I think
that is an important part of the targeting
philosophy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000164" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000164">Alongside
the development of the suicide prevention strategy,
Samaritans—to whose work I pay special tribute in their
anniversary year—have been facilitating a Call to Action for
Suicide Prevention in England, supported by a grant from the Department
of Health. Over 50 national organisations have signed the Call to
Action, committing to work together so fewer lives are lost to suicide
and to support those bereaved or affected by suicide. Organisations
include public and private sector bodies and a wide range of charities,
including those set up specifically to reduce suicide such as Papyrus,

people who take their own lives have not been in touch with mental
health services. We know that some people, particularly men, find it
difficult to speak to their doctor if they are having mental health

noble friend said, the media have a significant influence on behaviour
and attitudes. There is already compelling evidence that media
reporting and portrayals of suicide can lead to copycat behaviour,
especially among young people and those already at risk. The media is
aware of its responsibility in the representation of suicide. In 2006
the Press Complaints Commission added a clause to the editors’
code of practice explicitly recommending that the media avoid
excessively detailed reporting of suicide methods. The 2009 edition of
the PCC <I>Editors’ Codebook</I> highlights, for example, the
distress that can be caused by insensitive and inappropriate graphic
illustrations accompanying media reports of
suicide.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000169">We
have made grants to charities directly involved in suicide prevention.
In March 2010, Maytree Respite Centre was awarded a three-year grant
totalling over £154,000 to support the continued implementation
and development of its service. Maytree is a sanctuary for people in
suicidal crisis, providing a non-medical alternative to hospitalisation
or sectioning. The grant helped the organisation support over 4,000
people, with 300 being supported through a stay at the house. It also
helped them to develop outcome-focused relationships with several NHS
and private organisations. In March 2011 we awarded a £50,000
one-year grant to Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide, a charity that
serves more than 8,000 clients each year. They provide a range of
services from a national telephone line to local area support
groups.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000170">Early
intervention is imperative to suicide prevention and various
organisations, including charities, can help highlight and address
problems such as bullying, poor body image and lack of self-esteem. The
commitment to early intervention is borne out by the Department of Work
and Pensions’ expectation that all Jobcentre Plus advisers are
trained to enable them to identify and support people who are
vulnerable and who may be at risk of suicide and self-harm. This is
important, as we know that community locations, such as job centres and
young people-friendly venues, are more successful in engaging with
young men than more formal health settings such as GP
surgeries.</hs_para>

Giddens, whose speech I listened to with great attention, spoke about
statistics. I will certainly go away and reflect on his points on that
score. He asked what the Government’s policy was on prevention
at popular suicide spots. The suicide prevention strategy recognises
that one of the most effective ways of preventing suicide is to reduce
the means to access. Suicide risk can be reduced by limiting access to
high-risk locations. Much of the planning 
<?notus-xml column=384?>and work to prevent suicides will, as I have said, be carried out
locally; it will be for local agencies, working through health and
well-being boards, to decide the best way to achieve the overall aim of
reducing the suicide rate. I fully expect that the local agencies will
work together to monitor those
hotspots.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000172" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000172">My
noble friend Lord Roberts pointed to the effect of unemployment, a
point made effectively by my noble friend Lady Wheatcroft. We know that
previous periods of high unemployment or severe economic problems have
had an adverse effect on the mental health and well-being of the
population and have been associated with higher rates of suicide.
Despite the good progress that has been made in reducing the suicide
rate, we need to remain vigilant on that particular aspect of the
risk.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042394000173" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000173">Faith
groups were mentioned by a number of noble Lords, including my noble
friend Lord Roberts. I assure the Committee that the department
recognises the comfort and support that people receive from their faith
and would expect all medical practitioners to treat their patients
holistically, taking into account their physical, cultural, social,
mental and spiritual needs. The Government’s mental health
strategy, <I>No Health Without Mental Health</I>, draws attention to
the importance of ensuring that services meets the needs of diverse
communities and faith groups. The right reverend Prelate will know that
the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, and Time to Change
recently hosted an event for leaders from different faiths to look at
ways of tackling the stigma and discrimination faced by people with
mental health problems in their communities. That seminar was held at
Lambeth Palace and was extremely well received.</hs_para>

Sandwich, spoke about the risk of prescribed anti-depressants. The
suicide prevention strategy highlights the potential increase in
suicide risk in the early stages of drug treatment and risks associated
with withdrawal where people are dependent on prescribed drugs. The
noble Earl has expressed his concerns forcefully in debate and
privately to Ministers, and he knows that these messages have not gone
unheeded—at least, I hope that he knows that. It is, as he said,
for health and well-being boards to build into the joint strategic

Blackstone:</Member></B> My Lords, I put down this Question for Short
Debate in a context where the prospects of an end to the civil war and
peace in Syria seem ever more remote. In these very sad circumstances
the flight from Syria to neighbouring countries of people seeking a
safe haven from the shelling, bombing and destruction of their
communities seems likely to continue indefinitely. In the past six
months there has been a rapid increase in the numbers fleeing, which
shows absolutely no signs of flattening off. There are now close to 1.5
million refugees in neighbouring countries, nearly half of whom are
children under 18. The United Nations predicts that the figure will
rise to 3 million by the end of the year. Inside Syria there are
currently another 2 million displaced people, and the UN estimates that
more than 4.25 million are in need of urgent
assistance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:12:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000180" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000180">The
number of refugees who have fled the country has almost doubled, then,
since the beginning of February, when the Secretary of State for
International Development made a Statement in another place. In that
Statement she said that pledges at the special conference in Kuwait in
January to discuss the humanitarian crisis amounted to £1.5
billion from 60 countries, which exceeded the UN’s target. Can
the Minister indicate how far these pledges have turned into tangible
commitments? The estimates I have seen make very depressing reading:
only just over half the pledges appear to have been committed. It would
be helpful if she could also give the most up-to-date figures on how
the funds are being distributed across the
region.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000181" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000181">I am
pleased, as I am sure other speakers will be, that at that time the
UK’s total commitment to humanitarian support had reached
£139.5 million. However, given the huge increase in the numbers
of people displaced since then, I ask what plans the Government now
have to increase aid, given the terrible suffering of those fleeing,
which I have seen at first hand, as well as the intolerable pressures
on neighbouring countries that are being overwhelmed by the escalation
in the number of
refugees.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000182" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000182">Early
in February, along with my noble friends Lady Jay and Lord Warner, who
are also speaking in this debate, I visited the Lebanon under the
auspices of the Council for European Palestinian Relations and 
<?notus-xml column=386?>witnessed what is happening to one particular group of refugees,
Palestinians, who constitute 10% of all refugees from Syria. Their
situation is even more dire than that of the Syrians. When they come
across the border into neighbouring countries such as the Lebanon they
are not eligible for UNHCR support but instead are looked after by
UNRWA, the UN agency responsible for supporting Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza as well as in neighbouring countries. Many of them
arrive with little money and not much more than the clothes they are
wearing. They are traumatised, having been bombed out of their homes,
and in some cases have lost members of their families, too. They are
poor people, made poorer by the war that has enveloped them.</hs_para>

Lebanon they are looked after by the existing Palestinian population
who live in semi-segregated communities in refugee camps, many of which
have existed since 1948. These so-called camps are already overcrowded
and without the space and facilities needed to take in the new influx
of refugees. As a consequence, families with children of all ages have
to fall back on renting appalling accommodation at exorbitant rents
with money that they brought with them from Syria, or sharing makeshift
rooms that have been provided with the help of NGOs or the Palestinian
political organisations. In some cases, Hamas and Fatah have made over
their offices to house these families; in other cases, the refugees are
accommodated in totally unsuitable vacant school buildings; in yet more
cases, they are put up in new temporary buildings with tiny rooms
divided by plywood partitions. Sometimes two or even three families
have to share whatever accommodation they have managed to find in a
room furnished only with thin mattresses. The washing and cooking
facilities are primitive and shared by many people. Some rented rooms
have water coming through the ceiling, and exposed
wiring.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000184" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000184">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:16:27"></hs_TimeCode>
influx of refugees has already pushed up the population in Lebanon by
over 10%, compared with around 6% in Jordan. As the conflict in Syria
continues, the numbers of refugees in Lebanon, and indeed elsewhere,
will go on growing, exacerbating the problem of accommodating them. So
far, the Lebanese Government have agreed to keep the border with Syria
open, but, in a context where their survival is by no means certain,
political pressure could push them into closing
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000185" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000185">Meanwhile
many of those crossing the border arrive with unresolved health
problems, and injuries sustained from bomb blasts and shrapnel. They
cannot afford to pay for the treatment they need after they arrive;
even modest amounts of medication to relieve suffering among children
and the elderly are often unavailable. Providing schooling for their
children has been jeopardised by differences in the curriculum between
Syria and the Lebanon, and many school-age children are receiving
little or no
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000186" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000186">UNRWA<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:17:43"></hs_TimeCode>
is struggling to deal with the crisis and has insufficient funding. It
is focusing its efforts on providing small cash grants to families and
trying to rectify the lack of schooling. It seems unable to tackle the
fundamental problem of providing adequate accommodation. The Lebanese
understandably consider that it is a matter for the international
community, and 
<?notus-xml column=387?>there is little or no political will to shoulder the burden. This means
that the burden falls on the existing Palestinian community, which has
never been able to throw off its refugee status in
Lebanon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000187" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000187">While
there has been some lifting of the prohibition on Palestinians
obtaining jobs, the reality is that there are few employment
opportunities for them. Hamas and Fatah are trying to raise money from
their own sources and are co-operating with the UN. Sadly, the EU makes

would welcome a view on this from the Minister. Do the Government
consider that contact on these issues would
help?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000188" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000188">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:18:49"></hs_TimeCode>
noble friend Lady Jay will focus on the effects of the influx of
refugees from Syria on the surrounding countries, so I shall be brief.
We owe our thanks not only to Lebanon and Jordan but to Turkey, Iraq
and Egypt for their generosity in supporting thousands of traumatised
and penniless people. However, it is imperative that the international
community does more to help these countries, several of which have
fragile regimes with their own problems of maintaining stable rule and
political, ethnic and religious harmony. These countries also face
increased economic pressures, with steeply rising rents caused by the
increased demand for housing as well as rising food
prices.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000189" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000189">Most<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:19:38"></hs_TimeCode>
aid is going to refugee camps, even though about 70% of Syrian refugees
live outside the camps, whether in urban or rural areas. Above all, the
urban infrastructure needs to be strengthened. Cash assistance is also
needed to help refugees feed their families. There is evidence that
women are going without food to provide what little they have for their
children. For the host countries the refugees are straining water,
sanitation, housing, health and education systems. Obviously, as this
continues there will be growing tension between the host and refugee
communities in the already depressed areas where they settle. The
political ramifications are obvious and could push some countries into
closing their borders, trapping refugees inside
Syria.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000190" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000190">What
progress have the Minister and her right honourable friends made in
securing greater earmarked commitments, especially to Lebanon and
Jordan, from other donor countries? Is further consideration being
given to whether the UK’s earmarked contribution of £8.5
million for programmes in Lebanon might be increased? Could she also
comment on how the vital co-ordination of humanitarian agencies’
work with UNHCR, which is needed to produce a more effective response
to the complex challenges that they face, might also be applied to
UNWRA? What is being done to facilitate co-ordination between the Gulf

with the emotional plea of one elderly Palestinian woman I met outside
the Wevel refugee camp not far from the Syrian-Lebanese border:
“We are human beings but we are being forced to live like
animals. Please help us”. She will of course be helped when a
ceasefire takes place and a political solution is found that leads to
peace, but we cannot leave her and the many others like to suffer so
terribly until that happens. We have to prepare for a protracted
humanitarian 
<?notus-xml column=388?>emergency with longer-term funding, allowing NGOs to plan for the
future. We should also be aware that an end to the conflict and a
post-Assad regime will not necessarily lead to an end to sectarian
violence. I hope that the UK Government will act urgently to do all
that they can in the international community to avoid a much
larger-scale humanitarian disaster than the one that we already face

appalling humanitarian crisis in Syria is heaping significant pressure
on neighbouring countries that are wilfully accepting refugees fleeing
in search of a safer environment. I maintain very close links with the
kingdom of Jordan and, as such, want to place a particular focus on the
situation there. Since early 2011 some 500,000 Syrian refugees have
fled to Jordan, an increase of two-thirds on the number that were
already settled there beforehand. Of even greater concern is the extent
to which the intensity of the crisis is increasing. Of those 500,000,
46% arrived just in the first quarter of this year. By these numbers,
Jordan projects that an extra 1 million Syrians will enter their
country in
2013.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000194" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000194">Jordan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:23:29"></hs_TimeCode>
has already established four refugee camps, run for the most part by
the United Nations. However, it remains the case that only 40% of
Syrian refugees actually reside in these camps, with the rest settling
into numerous communities across the country. There are now monumental
challenges to be overcome, just in terms of fulfilling basic human
needs. Greater power generation is urgently needed, which will require
greater imports of oil. This will have a negative impact on the economy
and Jordan’s balance of trade. Jordan is already short of water
supplies, and a sudden increase in population would serve only to put
further pressure on an already strained
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000195" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000195">The
Jordanian Government are also very concerned about the overcrowding in
schools and the inevitable effect that this will have on the quality of
education. Jordan has spent considerable money reforming its education
system in recent times, and this overwhelming pressure undermines that
progress. There are similar concerns in healthcare. Jordan has been
providing thousands of vaccinations to Syrian children against a number
of diseases and other forms of medical care to Syrians in general.
Again, it is now in desperate need of extra resources and hospital
expansions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000196" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000196">This
has all come at a time of a slowdown in economic growth and employment
rates in Jordan, as well as the country’s budget deficit
reaching an all-time high. Last year, Jordan spent more than $251
million providing basic services to Syrians in its cities and
communities. These costs are projected to skyrocket and my worry is
that a potential emerging market such as Jordan is having its economy
broken through its own goodwill to others.</hs_para>

influx of refugees is naturally going to present extreme political
challenges, too. Some of the camps have witnessed riots and some
Jordanian police have already been injured in clashes. While the
security services are doing their best, it is 
<?notus-xml column=389?>impossible to ensure the completely smooth running of such a complex and
ever-changing situation. The Government of Jordan have formulated their
own response plan for the country to host an increasing number of
Syrian refugees. I call on our Government to both increase their
support to Jordan and use our position within the international
community to call on others to do the same. We must all help to
alleviate the pressure on Jordan’s fragile
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000198" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000198">Diplomats

Jay of Paddington:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to my
noble friend for asking this Question. I found our visit to Lebanon,
short as it was, very disturbing but in a few days I learnt a great
deal, particularly about the special problems of the Palestinian
refugees from Syria. Of course, these people are refugees twice over.
In Syria, they had fled originally from their homeland and now have
fled again from the conflict in Syria. Interestingly, before the
violence erupted there surveys suggested that many of the Palestinian
population found Syria the best country of their exile. They had
educational and work opportunities denied in other places, and living
conditions which were reasonably pleasant. All that has of course now
changed and my noble friend has vividly described the terrible poverty
and despair of the displaced families we met.</hs_para>

a great sense of frustration. Many people, as I said, came from settled
lives in Syria and many had professional careers. We talked, for
example, to several teachers who are now unable to work in Lebanon
because of the restrictions imposed on them by the host Government.
These restrictions seem in some ways to illustrate the tensions which
there are between the refugee population and the Government of Lebanon.
It seems to create an obvious double difficulty, as the teachers cannot
help the many children who are now kicking their heels in refugee
camps. Neither can they earn their own living, so that any support they
have comes from the specialist Palestinian agency UNWRA—the
United Nations Relief Works Agency.</hs_para>

course not only one for teachers but for many other professional people
who have come from a Palestinian background from Syria. I was somewhat
surprised that the UNWRA officials we talked to seemed to accept this
situation as given. As far as we could tell, they were not pressurising
the Lebanese and telling them that they should be lifting the work
restrictions in the face of the influx of new people. I must say that
we were not entirely convinced that UNWRA has been sufficiently
flexible in its approach to the newcomers from Syria.</hs_para>

government meetings that I attended in Beirut, our delegation raised
the question of giving Palestinians the right to work. We were told
that new laws had been passed in 2010 to ease the employment
restrictions and improve general civil rights, but those laws have
never been implemented. The Libyan president, 
<?notus-xml column=390?>who we saw, was quite adamant: his Government must give first priority
to protecting Lebanese jobs for Lebanese workers. The country’s
political and economic situation is too fragile to do anything else.
The threat of internal instability was ever present in our discussions.
Indeed, the EU ambassador told us that she was surprised that the
Government had not yet collapsed under the new demands.</hs_para>

as well as hostilities with Israel still dominate the politics of
Lebanon. Indeed, both Jordan and Lebanon—the small neighbours of
Syria—have internal and strategic reasons to be unstable. If
their Governments cannot cope with the current refugee crisis,
particularly the Palestinians, this will create an international danger
way beyond the humanitarian crisis. The domino effect that could occur
would reverberate throughout the Middle East and beyond.</hs_para>

Falkner of Margravine:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Blackstone, for giving us this opportunity to debate
Syria in this short period of time. It is sobering to speak yet again
on the situation of the people of Syria in the context of humanitarian
assistance. It speaks to our impotence that more than two years into
the civil war, which is bordering on genocide, all these rich and
powerful countries are simply squabbling between themselves about not
violating national sovereignty.</hs_para>

right that we have a generous programme of assistance to those
unfortunate enough to be displaced, either formally as refugees or
informally, relying on their friends and families or simply
co-religionists in neighbouring Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq or Turkey. We
have heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, as well as the
noble Baroness, Lady Jay, and the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, about the
fragile situation in those countries. Our attempts to stabilise them
are to be commended but to restrict this debate to the humanitarian

the point.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042394000208" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000208">If
the civil war continues for the next few years, there will potentially
be no Syria left. What we might find when everyone is exhausted of
fighting and everything is destroyed is a series of provinces run by
warlords or rebel armies, ethnically cleansed, existing in a sullen
peace if peace is there at all— a larger Yemen, in the

what is to be done by the West or at least by the United Kingdom and
France? For a start, we should let the EU arms embargo expire so that
arms can flow to the Free Syrian Army. Syria is flush with arms. They
are mainly going to our opponents in the terrorist groups or to our
opponents in the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Moreover, we should
seriously contemplate enforcing a no-fly zone, at least over the part
of the country that we might declare a humanitarian enclave, and then
press the Syrian national coalition to work with the elements of the
FSA that are representative of all communities to run that enclave
peacefully. To do so would require us to equip the Free Syrian Army
more
adequately.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000210" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000210">Noble

only argument used against supplying lethal weapons to the Free Syrian
Army is that the weapons we might give them will slip away into the
hands of Jabhat al-Nusra, which declared its allegiance to al-Qaeda
only last week. In Istanbul General Idriss gave a commitment to the
West that his people would track every single advanced weapon provided
and return it when the conflict was over. If one did not believe his
assurance, the question remains: how do we expect the conflict to end
when Qatar, Saudi Arabia and other neighbours are arming some factions,
while Russia and Iran are arming the regime? Our Government must ask
themselves how they expect to bring the conflict to an end. Is it the
surest way to stop humanitarian disaster just to continue if everyone
bar us puts arms into the equation or provides military support? How do
we somehow obtain a peaceful Syria? What are we to do if chemical
weapons are used or if genocide is committed but we do not live up to
our legal obligations under the genocide conventions? Noble Lords will
know that the ICJ ruled only a few years ago that every state has a

Lord Bishop of Exeter:</Member></B> My Lords, I have just three points
to make. The first concerns the humanitarian dimension of this crisis.
The figures are horrendous. I shall not repeat what the noble Baroness
has already said but simply note an acceleration in the number of
refugees fleeing. There have been more than 40,000 a week since
January, and in four host countries—Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and
Lebanon—the number of Syrian refugees has to date already
exceeded the UNHCR estimate for January to June this year in
total<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:36:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=392?><hs_para UID="13042394000213" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000213">We have already had our
attention directed to Lebanon. It alone has received an influx
equivalent to 10% of the host population, placing a huge strain on the
country: communally, as most of the refugees are Sunni Muslim, which
threatens Lebanon’s delicate communal balance; economically, as
there are now food and power shortages; and socially, with a big
increase in the crime rate. This inflow, bringing 32,000 Palestinian
refugees from Syria into a country which already has around 450,000
Palestinian refugees, brings the potential for further destabilisation
in a country where volatility is already
great.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000214" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000214">There
are similar problems In Iraq, which not so long ago saw an exodus of
its own refugees, particularly Christians, into Syria. It is now in
receipt of at least 130,000 refugees, mainly in the Kurdistan region,
with all its own uncertainty. Then there are other large concentrations
of refugees inside Jordan with over 430,000, Turkey with nearly
300,000, and, increasingly, Egypt—a country which has also had
to host a large Sudanese refugee population in the recent
past.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000215" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000215">Secondly, I turn to the
geopolitical dimension. This very large movement of population not only
is disruptive and damaging to individual lives, and a cause of deep
concern for the receiving countries, with all the social, economic,
demographic and political consequences that it brings, but is further
undermining the stability of the region as a whole, as well as the
sustainability of many of the existing states and political entities
within
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000216" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000216">Just last
week, António Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,
who had led the UNHCR through the worst of the refugee crises in
Afghanistan and Iraq, said that in his view the Syrian civil war was
more brutal than both and was already the worst humanitarian crisis
since the end of the Cold War. With regard to refugees, he
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13042394000285" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000285">“The
system is at breaking point. There is limited capacity to take many
more. Where are the people going to flee? Into the
sea?”.</hs_quote>

on to speak about the potentially even more serious geopolitical
implications, with the political geography of the post-Ottoman Middle
East, which has been in place since the end of the First World War,
perhaps for the first time beginning to be put into serious question.
Should the substantial possibility of partition in Syria be realised,
this would inevitably have grave ramifications in Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan
and beyond.</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="13042394000217" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000217">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:39:04"></hs_TimeCode>
that context, I come to my third concern—the religious
dimension—and especially the future of Christians across this
part of the Middle East. For centuries, Christianity flourished in
Syria, as it did in Iraq, and, it has to be said, since the Baathist
coup in 1970 it has been a particularly safe haven for Christians
fleeing from conflicts elsewhere. Indeed, one reason that Russia has
refused to abandon President Assad is its sense of responsibility for
Syria’s Orthodox Christian community, which is now under a sense
of threat. Already, the Christian element of the Syrian population has
fallen dramatically to around 10%, and Christians are continuing to
haemorrhage from the area under the perceived threat of militant Islam.
The spread of  
<?notus-xml column=393?>jihadist groups within the Syrian opposition and the growth of the
mantra that “Islam is the solution” are only exacerbating
this flight. Therefore, Christian refugees are fleeing into northern
Lebanon as fast as Iraq’s 3 million refugees are beginning to
pour back whence they
came.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000218" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000218">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:29:05"></hs_TimeCode>
estimate suggests that of the Christian community of Homs, until
recently 150,000 strong, some 90% have now gone to Jordan, leaving only
a tiny minority hanging on. Where Christians do remain, once cohesive
communities marked by peaceful co-existence and co-operation are
beginning to fragment, as those of different religious traditions
increasingly draw apart. The disintegration, including the religious
fragmentation, that has marked post-intervention Iraq, with all the
desperate fallout and its consequences which that country continues to
suffer, now looks to be replicated in Syria, and the exodus of refugees
into neighbouring countries could exacerbate such a trend in this place
as well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000219" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000219">On

unless urgent new funding is received. World Food Programme officials
have stressed that they cannot simply rely on donations from countries
such as the United Kingdom and the US. They have particularly singled
out Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Emirates and
Kuwait, whose promised large donations have not arrived through UN
channels but instead, the World Food Programme claims, are often being
donated directly to opposition groups. In total, around $400

is vital that the humanitarian aid reaches those for whom it is
intended. Therefore, I hope that the Minister and Her Majesty’s

delivering contributions and commitments. I hope that assurances can be

doing so much on behalf of the international community. They are often
very courageous people who deserve our full-hearted
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000225" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000225">I
underline what has been said. If one is looking for an example of
collective international cynicism, one has to look no further than at
what has happened with the promises of assistance in this grim
situation. To have had offered what amounted to some $1.5 billion of
assistance at the recent conference in Kuwait and to now find the UNHCR
telling us that only $200 million has been made available is a dreadful
comment on us all. We need clear reassurance from the Government about
what they are doing to make people live up to 
<?notus-xml column=395?>their reputations. It is little wonder that the cause of
cynicism—if it is a cause—spreads so widely in the
international
community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:47:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000226" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000226">Dealing
with refugees on this scale is, of course, highly complex. Specific
elements arise within the general problem such as the acute needs of
the elderly and those with physical and mental disabilities. Specialist
support is crucial for people in those categories. There is also the
whole issue of psychological trauma, particularly of children. I
frequently think that in refugee situations around the world we give
far too little attention to the assistance and support that can be
provided for the psychiatric and psychological dimensions of the
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:48:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000227" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000227">My
noble friend rightly referred to the difference between the refugees in
camps outside the country and those in more difficult, sometimes very
distressing, situations who are not in camps. We have to ensure that
whatever is being done in mobilising assistance is reaching and
supporting both communities. In the middle of all this, we also have to
remember that we must not engender a culture of dependency. We want to
ensure that we are preparing people to return home. However, that is a
big issue because how long will it take for any realistic expectations
of return to be fulfilled? This issue is particularly acute in the
spheres of education for the young and
health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:49:19"></hs_TimeCode>. Turkey,
Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq have played an immensely important part in
keeping their borders open. However, they may well be tempted to close
them at some point. We all have to think what that would mean. That,
again, puts a responsibility on us all to make sure that we give them
every possible
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:50:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000228" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000228">Perhaps
the last point to be made in the time available is that all this is
putting a burden on the people of those countries which do not have
social provision of the highest order. Are we considering the weight
that is falling on them? How can we support the programmes of the
Governments in those countries to meet the needs of their own people in
the context of this situation? That is important not only in
humanitarian terms but to the long-term prospects of having a settled
solution in the area, as antagonisms could very quickly become
aggravated and escalate unless we look to the needs of the local
populations.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_23_PT_1/BB034650BE58BC307F5E2C7A4CD6127F9F97408C" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 April 2013">Tuesday,

Lady Blackstone on securing this debate and I support everything that
she said. I declare my interest as an adviser to the Council for
European and Palestinian Relations, under whose auspices our
parliamentary delegation recently went to
Lebanon<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:51:08"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Syrian conflict is a huge humanitarian disaster with well over 4
million people, and growing, still within Syria’s borders
needing humanitarian assistance, in addition to the at least 1.5
million people who have fled to neighbouring countries. The scale of
the population displacement caused by this conflict must start to call
into question the sustainability of some of the smaller neighbouring
states involved, unless there is significant international help over a
long period of time.</hs_para>

want to focus briefly on Lebanon, which has received over 450,000
Syrian refugees across its lengthy border with Syria. That is more than
10% of its population. Let us imagine how we would feel if 6
million people suddenly appeared in the UK, considering the fuss that
we have made about a relatively small number of eastern Europeans
coming into this country. Around 10% of the people coming across the
Lebanon border at the rate of about 7,000 people a day are Palestinian
refugees. They are fleeing from their camps in Syria, which have been
bombed by Bashar al-Assad’s military. It is very difficult to
explain to them why a no-fly zone was appropriate in Libya but is not
appropriate in
Syria<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:52:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that of children, is heartbreaking. Most of them are fleeing across the
border with little more than the clothes that they are
standing up in. Lebanon, which has considerable political and economic
problems of its own, as has already been mentioned, is paying a huge
political and economic price for keeping its borders open—and,
one must say, pretty much welcoming these people into their country in
many ways. It is asking its own population for the most part to host
these people. They call them guests, not refugees, and there are
relatively few refugee camps into which these people are moving and
living.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042394000232" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000232">What
we saw in Beirut when we visited the city were families of 20 to 30
people living in two or three rooms in bombed buildings that are open
to the elements, with little access to water or toilet facilities. They
sleep in shifts because there is not enough space for them to sleep at
night. They are struggling with exorbitant rents, sometimes $500 a
month, which is an enormous sum for these people. It is charged by what
I can only describe as racketeering landlords, and there is a lack of
food, clean water and medicines. Some have untreated wounds and
illnesses. Many are groups of vulnerable women and children with few,
if any, accompanying working-age men. Where there are men, they are
forbidden by local labour laws from working. Even in the well run
volunteer organisation camp that we visited, where the accommodation
and facilities are less primitive, dangerous electricity systems and
inadequate sanitation present their own hazards on
top<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:54:44"></hs_TimeCode>. The

do not have time to go further, so I should like to close by posing a
couple of questions for the Minister. Are the Government satisfied that
all the pledges made at the Kuwait summit are being delivered in terms
of hard cash for UN relief agencies to use for Syrian refugees? If not,
what action will they take with their international
colleagues—with a particular focus, I have to say, on the Gulf
states, which do not seem to have delivered on the promises that they
made? Do the Government accept that the population displacement caused
by the Syrian conflict is likely to prove permanent in many individual
cases? What discussions do they contemplate having with
international partners on this issue, particularly with regard to
Palestinian refugees, many of whom have been subject to multiple 
<?notus-xml column=397?>displacements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-23T18:55:52"></hs_TimeCode>? We

Collins of Highbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I too thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Blackstone, for tabling today’s Question. As we
have heard in this debate, there is an escalating humanitarian crisis
in Syria. The situation is spiralling out of control, leaving relief
agencies overstretched and struggling to cope. I thank all my noble
friends for their first-hand accounts of the situation in Syria and
neighbouring
countries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13042394000235" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0001.htm#13042394000235">The
two most strategic issues are, first, the need for longer-term funding
to enable an effective humanitarian response and, secondly, as my noble
friends have pointed out, the need for increased support for national
authorities in neighbouring countries. DfID has recently announced
additional UK humanitarian funding for the response in recent weeks,
which front-line agencies estimate will last approximately through to
the summer. That is welcome, but it has become increasingly clear that
this is not a short-term crisis. Longer-term funding for the host
government authorities is necessary to ensure that their national
infrastructure does not collapse under the refugee burden. As we have
heard from the right reverend Prelate and my noble friend Lord Warner,
the refugee influx into Jordan now constitutes 6% of Jordan’s
population. Some estimates suggest that up to 1 million may have
arrived by the end of this year.</hs_para>

government capacity in Lebanon has been mooted as an element of the
next UN appeal, to be announced on 28 May for the period June to
December this year. I understand that DfID has also seconded one staff
person to a government ministry in Lebanon to assist in liaising with
the UN system on the humanitarian response. It is possible that other
steps are being taken that I am not aware of, but support for the host
Government has not featured in a serious way in the UN-led humanitarian
strategy for Jordan, and that needs to change.</hs_para>

specific points and questions to put to the Minister in respect of
these key elements of the strategy. What steps will DfID take to
provide longer-term funding to enable a more effective humanitarian
response to what is proving to be a long-term crisis? Can DfID ensure
that its future funding pledges will allow for multi-year programming
by agencies, and use its influence to encourage the UN system and other
donors to shift beyond the current short-term six-month
timeframes?</hs_para>

devastating impact on the region. More than 1.3 million refugees have

unprecedented strain on the Governments and communities so generously
hosting refugees. We are well aware of the effects on those countries.
That is why aid is targeted to them, in answer to the noble Lord, Lord

internal domestic challenges. There are now almost 500,000 Syrians in
Jordan, with approximately 2,000 more arriving each day. While media
images often show refugees living in camps, such as Zaatari, the
majority of refugees live, as noble Lords have emphasised, in Jordanian
communities, which were already resource-constrained. Tensions are

<?notus-xml column=399?>As the noble Lord, Lord Warner, flagged up, that means that
one in four people in Lebanon will be a Syrian refugee. The cost to the
Lebanese economy is no less worrying. The response for July to December
2013 is expected to be $600 million. The refugee influx is also putting
pressure on Lebanon’s delicate political balance. North Lebanon

urgent assistance. A further 40,000 have fled to Lebanon and 5,000 to

humanitarian funding remain woefully inadequate. We continue to lobby
donors to deliver on the pledges made at Kuwait. I can tell the noble
Baroness, Lady Blackstone, that the UN has still received only 52% of
the funding that was pledged. We are working very closely with other
countries. Last week Kuwait fully translated its $300 million pledge

billion going to Syria, $0.5 billion to Jordan, and $0.5 billion
divided between Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. The UK and the UAE met
with UN representatives in the Gulf recently to discuss closer
co-operation over Syria. We constantly discuss with the Gulf states the
importance of working together and with the UN in this area, something
that noble Lords flagged up.</hs_para>

agencies operating inside Syria is indeed increasingly constrained, as
the noble Lord, Lord Judd, emphasised. They are facing considerable
bureaucratic hurdles as well as enormous insecurity. The noble Lord is
right to commend the enormous bravery of those working on the front
line in Syria. The UK is calling on the Government of Syria to remove
the bureaucratic barriers as a matter of urgency, and are calling on
all parties in Syria to take immediate steps to ensure that
humanitarian agencies have safe, full and unimpeded access to deliver
lifesaving aid to those in need by the most effective routes.</hs_para>

frustration expressed by my noble friend Lady Falkner, who urges that
we should consider no-fly zones and selectively arming. This is an
extremely challenging situation. We believe that political transition
has to be the best way to end bloodshed in Syria. However, in the
absence of a political solution, it is right that we do not rule out
any options. The use of chemical weapons would force us to revisit our
approach but these are not straightforward or easy decisions, as my
noble friend knows. I also point out to her that humanitarian enclaves
in other contexts have not always operated to protect people; she will
be acutely aware 
<?notus-xml column=401?>of that. At a minimum, we urge all parties to the conflict to respect
international and humanitarian law and point out the consequences that
we see through the International Criminal Court for those who do not do
so.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13042394000258" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130423-gc0002.htm#13042394000258">We fully
recognise the importance of this terrible conflict and the enormous
challenges in tackling it. Noble Lords have rightly highlighted the
particular 
<?notus-xml column=402?>destruction and devastation of civil war. We seek a negotiated end to
the conflict and continue to work with UN Security Council members in
pursuit of this. I assure noble Lords that we will continue to monitor
closely the situation in Syria and the region. We will remain, as we
have been thus far, at the forefront of the international humanitarian
response.</hs_para>

people consolidate their savings so they get a clearer view of how

combustion plant directive (LCPD). The LCPD sets limits on emissions of
oxides of sulphur and nitrogen and the decision not to upgrade means
these plants must close when they reach 20,000 hours’ operation
after 1 January 2008 or by 31 December 2015 at the latest. Around 5GW
of this capacity has now closed.</hs_para>

the property is not connected to the mains gas grid). As Warm Front is
a demand led scheme, there is no specific amount allocated for
insulation measures. However, the budget for Warm Front for the past
five years is set out below. The vast majority of the budget is spent
on the more expensive heating
measures.</hs_para><TableWrapper Columns="1" Size="8"><table><tgroup cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="50*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="50*"></colspec><thead><row><entry colsep="0" rowsep="2"><hs_TableHeading>Year</hs_TableHeading></entry><entry colsep="0" rowsep="2"><hs_TableHeading Justify="right">Budget
