we in the House of Commons are here to pay our own tributes to an
extraordinary leader and an extraordinary woman. What she
achieved—even before her three terms in office—was
remarkable. Those of us who grew up when Margaret Thatcher was already
in Downing street can sometimes fail to appreciate the thickness of the
glass ceiling that she broke through—from a grocer’s shop
in Grantham to the highest office in the land. At a time when it was
difficult for a woman to become a Member of Parliament, almost
inconceivable that one could lead the Conservative party and, by her
own reckoning, virtually impossible that a woman could become Prime
Minister, she did all three. It is also right to remember that she
spent her whole premiership, and indeed much of her life, under direct
personal threat from the IRA. She lost two of her closest friends and
closest parliamentary colleagues, Airey Neave and Ian Gow, to
terrorism. And, of course, she herself was only inches away from death
in the Brighton bomb attack of 1984. Yet it was the measure of her
leadership that she shook off the dust from that attack and just a few
hours later gave an outstanding conference speech reminding us all why
democracy must never give in to
terror.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000010">Margaret
Thatcher was a woman of great contrasts. She could be incredibly
formidable in argument yet wonderfully kind in private. In No. 10
Downing street today there are still people who worked with her as
Prime Minister, and they talk of her fondly. One assistant tells of how
when she got drenched in a downpour on a trip to Cornwall, Margaret
Thatcher personally made sure she was looked after and found her a set
of dry clothes—of course, she did always prefer dries to wets.
<I>[Laughter.] </I>On another occasion, one assistant had put in a
hand-written note to Mrs Thatcher to say, “Please can you
re-sign this minute?” Unfortunately she had left 
<?notus-xml column=1614?>off the hyphen, leaving a note that actually read, “Please can
you resign this minute?”—to which the Prime Minister
politely replied, “Thank you dear, but I’d rather
not.”</hs_Para>

Thatcher was a remarkable type of leader. She said very clearly,
“I am not a consensus politician, but a conviction
politician.” She could sum up those convictions, which were
linked profoundly with her upbringing and values, in just a few short
phrases: sound money; strong defence; liberty under the rule of law;
you should not spend what you have not earned; Governments do not
create wealth, but businesses do. The clarity of those convictions was
applied with great courage to the problems of the
age.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000015">The
scale of her achievements is only apparent when we look back to Britain
in the 1970s. Successive Governments had failed to deal with what was
beginning to be called the British disease: appalling industrial
relations, poor productivity and persistently high inflation. Although
it seems absurd today, the state had got so big that it owned our
airports and airline, the phones in our houses, trucks on our roads,
and even a removal company. The air was thick with defeatism. There was
a sense that the role of Government was simply to manage decline.
Margaret<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T14:41:40"></hs_TimeCode>
Thatcher rejected this defeatism. She had a clear view about what
needed to change. Inflation was to be controlled not by incomes
policies, but by monetary and fiscal discipline; industries were to be
set free into the private sector; trade unions should be handed back to
their members; and people should be able to buy their own council
homes. Success in these endeavours was never assured. Her political
story was one of a perpetual battle, in the country, in this place and
sometimes even in her own Cabinet.</hs_Para>

course, her career could have taken an entirely different path. In the
late 1940s, before she entered politics, the then Margaret Roberts went
for a job at ICI. The personnel department rejected her application and

she used that conviction and resolve in the service of her country, and

Thatcher was also a great parliamentarian. She loved and respected this
place and was for many years its finest debater. She was utterly
fastidious in her preparations. I was a junior party researcher in the
1980s, and the trauma of preparation for Prime Minister’s
questions is still seared into my memory. Twice a week it was as if the
arms of a giant octopus shook every building in Whitehall for every
analysis of every problem and every answer to every question. Her
respect for Parliament was instilled in others. Early in her first
Government, a junior Minister was seen running through the Lobby. His
hair was dishevelled and he was carrying a heavy box and a full tray of
papers under his arm. Another Member cried out, “Slow down. Rome
wasn’t built in a day.” The Minister replied,
“Yes, but Margaret Thatcher wasn’t the foreman on that
job.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000019">As
Tony Blair said this week—rightly, in my view—Margaret
Thatcher was one of the very few leaders who changed the political
landscape not only in their own country, but in the rest of the world.
She was no starry-eyed internationalist, but again her approach was
rooted in some simple and clear principles: strength abroad begins with
strength at home; deterrence, not appeasement; and the importance of
national sovereignty, which is why she fought so passionately for
Britain’s interests in Europe and always believed that Britain
should keep its own
currency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000020">Above
all, she believed to the core of her being that Britain stood for
something in the world: for democracy, for the rule of law, for right
over might. She loathed communism and believed in the invincible power
of the human spirit to resist and ultimately defeat tyranny. She never
forgot that Warsaw, Prague and Budapest were great European cities,
capitals of free nations temporarily trapped behind the iron
curtain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T14:44:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000021">Today,
in different corners of the world, millions of people know that they
owe their freedom, in part, to Margaret Thatcher—in Kuwait,
which she helped free from Saddam’s jackboot; across eastern and
central Europe; and, of course, in the Falkland Islands. A week from
now, as people gather in London to lay Margaret Thatcher to rest, the
sun will be rising over the Falklands, and because of her courage and

has been said about the battles that Margaret Thatcher fought. She
certainly did not shy from the fight and that led to arguments, to
conflict and, yes, even to division, but what is remarkable, looking
back now, is how many of those arguments are no longer arguments at
all. No one wants to return to strikes without a ballot. No one
believes that large industrial companies should be owned by the state.
The nuclear deterrent, NATO and the special relationship are widely
accepted as the cornerstones of our security and defence policies. We
argue—sometimes very passionately—in this House about
tax, but none of us is arguing for a return to tax rates of 98%. So
many of the principles that Lady Thatcher fought for are now part of
the accepted political landscape of our country. As Winston 
<?notus-xml column=1616?>Churchill once put it, there are some politicians who
“make the weather”, and Margaret Thatcher was undoubtedly
one of
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T14:46:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000023">In

country from post-war decline. They say that cometh the hour, cometh

is an opportunity for us to reflect on Margaret Thatcher’s
personal achievements, her style of politics and her political legacy.
As the Prime Minister said, the journey from being the child of a
grocer to Downing street is an unlikely one, and it is particularly
remarkable because she was the daughter, not the son, of a grocer. At
each stage of her life, she broke the mould: a woman at Oxford when not
a single woman in the university held a full professorship; a woman
chemist when most people assumed scientists had to be men; a woman
candidate for Parliament in 1950, against the opposition of some in her
local party in Dartford, at the age of only 24; a woman MP in 1959 when
just 4% of MPs in the whole of this House were women; the only woman in
the Cabinet when she was appointed in 1970; and, of course, the first
woman Prime
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T14:48:51"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
no wonder she remarked as early as 1965 in a speech to the National

broken so many conventions as a woman, it cannot be a coincidence that
she was someone who, in so many other areas of life, was willing to
take on the established orthodoxies. Margaret Thatcher’s ability
to overcome every obstacle in her path was just one measure of her
personal strength, and that takes me to her style of politics. We can
disagree with Margaret Thatcher, but it is important to understand the
kind of political leader she was. What was unusual was that she sought
to be rooted in people’s daily lives, but she also believed that
ideology mattered. Not for her the contempt sometimes heaped on ideas
and new thinking in political life, and while she never would have
claimed to be, or wanted to be seen as, an intellectual, she believed
and showed that ideas matter in
politics.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000028"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T14:50:10"></hs_TimeCode>In

Margaret Thatcher stood for not to be open with the House, even on this

communities felt angry and abandoned. Gay and lesbian people felt
stigmatised by measures such as section 28, which today’s
Conservative party has rightly repudiated. It was no accident that when
the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr Duncan
Smith) became leader of the Conservative party, he wrote a pamphlet
called, “There is Such a Thing as Society.” On the world
stage, as the Prime Minister rightly said in 2006 when he was Leader of

wish to be brief, but I would like to put on record that Margaret
Thatcher was the best boss I ever worked for. I was her chief policy
adviser in the middle years and was subsequently able to advise and
help her a bit as a Member of Parliament and a junior
Minister.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000039">Margaret
Thatcher was that great figure because her private side was so
different from her public side. Yes, many people beyond the
House remember the woman who was so powerful in argument and so fierce
in conviction, but those who worked with her closely saw someone who
worked incredibly long hours with great energy and diligence because
she was so keen to get it
right.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000040">Margaret
Thatcher took a very wide range of advice. When people worked with her
and put an idea to her, not only did they need to produce all the
evidence and the facts and go over it many times, but they knew that
person after person going to Downing street would be given it as a kind
of test. They did not know that they were part of a running focus
group, but one’s idea was in front of the guests, who were asked
to shoot it down, because she was so desperately concerned never to use
the power of the great office without proper thought. She was also keen
to ensure that, before she did anything, she knew what the criticisms
would be and what might go wrong with it, because she had tested it to
destruction. There is a lot to recommend that approach to those who are
making mighty decisions—they should spend time and take trouble,
go to a wide range of advice, and ensure that something works well
before it is put out
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000041">Margaret
Thatcher came, in the middle of her period in office, to be the
champion of wider ownership and wider participation. To me, that was
her at her best—when she could reach out beyond the confines of
the Conservative party, which she led so well in those days, and beyond
the confines of her fairly solid 40% voting support, much more widely
in the county. A Prime Minister can become a great national leader when
their ideas resonate more widely, and when their ideas become
popular with, or are taken up by, those who would normally
oppose
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000042">That
spirit of Margaret Thatcher—she had fought her way as
a schoolgirl to Oxford, as an Oxford graduate to Parliament, and as a
parliamentarian to the Cabinet—made her feel that opportunity
was there for people. However, she recognised that it was very
difficult, particularly for women and people from certain backgrounds,
and always told us that it did not matter where people came from or who
their mother and father were, and that what mattered was what people
could contribute. That, surely, is a message that goes way
beyond the confines of the Conservative party or the years of her
supremacy in Parliament. We should all remember that.</hs_Para>

to produce policies to reflect that more generally, we came
up with an idea. Owning a home had been the privilege of the richer
part of society, but we wondered why everyone or practically everyone
should not aspire to it. That is when the council house sale idea
gathered momentum. Many Labour Members in the early days were very
unhappy—debates on the policy remain—but an awful lot of
Labour voters and even some Labour councillors decided it was a really
good policy and joined us on it. It was one of those policies that
reached out so much more
widely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000044">We
tried to extend the idea to the ownership of big and small businesses
with a big programme of wider share ownership, and with the employee
and public elements in the great privatisations. Margaret Thatcher was
determined to try to get Britain to break out of the debilitating cycle
of decline that we had witnessed under Labour and Conservative
Governments in the post-war
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000045">I
have just one fact that the House and those who are worried by the
depressing number of jobs lost in the 1980s in the pits and steel
industry might like to bear in mind. The newly nationalised coal
industry in the early 1950s had 700,000 employees; by the time Margaret
Thatcher came to office in 1979, only 235,000 of those jobs were left.
There had been a massive haemorrhage of jobs throughout the post-war
period. Similar figures could be adduced for rail, steel and the other
commanding heights. It was that which drove her to say that there must
be a better answer and a way of modernising the old industries and
bringing in the new industries. One of her legacies is the
modernisation of the car industry, which gathered momentum under the
Labour Government and, more recently, under the
coalition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T14:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000046">Margaret
Thatcher’s other great triumph, as the Prime Minister mentioned,
was to extend her argument to a much wider audience around the world.
The ideas of empowerment, enfranchisement, participation, breaking up
industries, allowing competition and new ideas, and allowing the public
to be part of the process were exported and took off around
the world. That lay behind much of the spirit of revolution in eastern
Europe which led to the bringing down of the Berlin wall.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:00:24"></hs_TimeCode> there is a
single picture of the Thatcher legacy that I will remember, it is the
tumbling of the Berlin wall and the realisation that the path of
enterprise and freedom that has been adopted by all the democratic

who are not members of the Conservative party and who disagreed with
many of the things that Margaret Thatcher did, I have thought long and
hard about what to say. I am a Sheffield MP—a city
where the mere mention of her name even now elicits
strong reactions. I would like to think that she would be
pleased that she still provokes trepidation and uncertainty among the
leaders of other parties, even when she is not here, eyeballing us
across the
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:01:49"></hs_TimeCode>. That
those of us who are not from her party can shun the tenets of
Thatcherism and yet respect Margaret Thatcher is part of what was so

three short
observations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:02:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000050">First,
whether people liked or disliked her, it is impossible to deny the
indelible imprint that Margaret Thatcher made on the nation and the
wider world. She was among those very rare leaders who
become a towering historical figure not as written in the history
books, but while still in the prime of their political life. Whatever
else is said about her, Margaret Thatcher created a paradigm. She set
the parameters of economic, political and social debate for decades to
come. She drew the lines on the political map that we are still
navigating
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:02:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000051">Secondly,
Margaret Thatcher was one of the most caricatured figures in modern
British politics, yet she was easily one of the most complex. On the
one hand, she is remembered as the eponymous ideologue, responsible for
her own “-ism”. In reality, much of her politics was
subtle and pragmatic, and she was sometimes driven by events. Margaret
Thatcher was a staunch patriot who was much more comfortable reaching
out across the Atlantic than across the channel. However, she
participated in one of the most profound periods of European
integration and was herself an architect of the single market. Although
she was a Conservative to her core, leading a party that traditionally
likes to conserve things, she held a deep aversion to the status quo.
She was restive about the future, determined to use politics as a force
for reform and never feared short-term disruption in pursuit of
long-term change. In many ways a traditionalist, she was one of the
most iconoclastic politicians of our
age.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000052">Margaret
Thatcher was therefore far from the cardboard cut-out that is sometimes
imagined. For me, the best tribute to her is not to consign her to
being a simplified heroine or villain, but to remember her with all
the nuance, unresolved complexity and paradox that she
possessed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:04:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000053">Finally,
there was an extraordinary, even unsettling directness about her
political presence. I remember vividly, aged 20, reading
that Margaret Thatcher had said that there was no such thing as
society. I was dismayed. It was not the kind of thing that a wide-eyed,
idealistic social anthropology undergraduate wanted to hear. With
hindsight, what strikes me is that although I disagreed with the
untempered individualism that those words implied, I never for a second
thought that she was being cynical, striking a pose or taking a
position for short-term
effect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000054">You
always knew, with Margaret Thatcher, that she believed what she said.
It is interesting to reflect on how she would have reacted to
today’s political culture of 24-hour news, pollsters and focus
groups. She seemed blissfully indifferent to the popularity of what she
said, entirely driven instead by the conviction of what she
said. Somehow, her directness made you feel as if
she  
<?notus-xml column=1621?>were arguing directly with you—as if it were a clash of her
convictions against yours. As a result, you somehow felt as if you knew
her, even if you did not.</hs_Para>

inspired or confronted, led or attacked, she did it all with
uncluttered clarity. Her memory will no doubt continue to divide
opinion and stir deep emotion, but as we as a nation say farewell to a
figure who loomed so large, one thing is for sure: the memory of her
will continue undimmed, strong and clear for years to come, in keeping

Thatcher was many things. As has been said, she was a pioneer. She was
the first female leader of a major political party in the United
Kingdom, and the first female Prime Minister. She did break that glass
ceiling, but she also broke through the social barrier that
stood in the way of anyone of that time and generation becoming the
leader of a major political party. She was a woman of personal and
political courage, a politician of formidable ability, and a
stateswoman who transformed not only the United Kingdom but played an
enormous role in changing, fundamentally, the world order.</hs_Para>

there were many who disagreed with her. Even within her own
party and among those of us who are Unionists in Northern
Ireland there were those who disagreed with her on occasion,
particularly in relation to the Anglo-Irish agreement. But whatever our
views, people today, by and large, must accept, acknowledge
and admire her as a politician and statesperson of conviction. The days
of focus groups, the amorphous middle, the soft imaging—none of
that would have suited her. How many times have we heard it said,
during her lifetime and since, that, like her or loathe her, at least
you knew where Maggie stood? People admire that in their politicians.

of her attraction was that she was seen as taking on the vested
interests and the political establishment. She was impatient of the old
brigade, and prepared to shake things up. However, like all great human
beings and all great politicians, she was a person of contradictions.
Very often her rhetoric did not match her actions, and her instincts
were blunted. She did become persuaded, on some issues, against her
better judgment. On Europe, she is rightly lauded for the actions that
she took in relation to, for instance, securing our rebate, for
her stance against European federalism, for her Bruges
speech, and for her stance in defence of our currency; yet she signed
and implemented the Single European Act, which many see as
the forerunner of the Maastricht

Northern Ireland, again, she was full of contradictions. We in the
Democratic Unionist party, and indeed the entire Unionist community in
Northern Ireland in the 1980s, opposed the Anglo-Irish
agreement,  
<?notus-xml column=1622?>and many Conservative Members and others opposed it too. Once she had
said that Ulster was as British as Finchley; once she had
said, rightly, that it was “out, out, out” to a united
Ireland, a federal Ireland or joint authority. Yet
a year later, in 1985, she signed the Anglo-Irish
agreement without any consultation with the Unionist community, and
without its
consent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000061">The
reason why many Unionists felt and spoke so strongly at that time, and
why there remain many strong feelings about that era, is that they
remembered her strong stance during the hunger strikes, when she had
stood up in defence of democracy and against terrorism; they remembered
how, as the Prime Minister and others mentioned, she had suffered the
loss of close colleagues to terrorism; and they remembered how she
herself, just a year before, had survived an IRA assassination attempt.

am glad that in her later life, Margaret Thatcher came to recognise
that the agreement was a mistake. Lord Powell, her former
close adviser, said the other night on “Newsnight” that,
as it is said of Mary Queen of Scots that the word
“Calais” was inscribed on her heart, so he believed that
the words “the Anglo-Irish agreement” would be inscribed
on the heart of Margaret Thatcher, because she had become increasingly
disillusioned with it. People say, “But was it not the template
for what we now have in Ulster?” I say it was not, because we
cannot base a future on exclusion. I say that as a Unionist
in Northern Ireland, with all our history, because we must go forward
with the inclusion of all communities.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:10:40"></hs_TimeCode>Today, there is
little of the Anglo-Irish agreement left and instead we have a
settlement that has been consulted on and has the consent and agreement
of both communities in Northern Ireland. I am glad that we have that,

want to close by saying, yes, we had our disagreements with Margaret
Thatcher, but she was, fundamentally, instinctively and truly, a great
patriot, a great Unionist and a great Briton, and that is why we are
right to pay tribute to her today, while recognising her faults and the
divisions that exist—of course, there are divisions, but there
were divisions long before Margaret Thatcher, and there will be
divisions long after her in other eras. She is not unique in that
sense. I heard today Gerry Adams and others talk about the legacy of
Margaret Thatcher as if she and the British Government and the British
state had created the violence in Northern Ireland. The fact is, of
course, that the hunger strikers were in jail and had been convicted
for terrorist acts long before she came to

11 years of her term of office and to be in her Cabinet for almost half
that time. It was never dull. Each day we saw political leadership and
statesmanship of the highest order and a Prime Minister with remarkable
personal qualities. It was sometimes said that she did not have a sense
of humour, and it was true that there was very little wit in many of
her speeches, but I recall on one occasion that she was asked,
“Mrs Thatcher, do you believe in consensus?” To our
surprise, we heard her saying, “Yes, I do believe in consensus;
there should be a consensus behind my convictions.” I thought at
the time that this was an extraordinary example of wit, but as the

was also said that Margaret Thatcher could be very intolerant of those
who did not agree with her. That was also a parody of the truth. She
was intolerant of people who were woolly and who argued that things
could not be done because they would be unpopular or that it was too
difficult, but when she met someone able to argue from a point of fact
and whom she respected, she not only listened, but could change her
mind. I was moved to the Foreign Office at the time of the Falklands,
and she recalled Sir Anthony Parsons, our ambassador at the Security
Council, to ask him how it was going at the United Nations. He had
never met her before; he was a rather grand diplomat. When he started
trying to report to her, she, not uncharacteristically, kept
interrupting him, and he was not used to this. After the fourth
interruption, he stopped and said, “Prime Minister, if you
didn’t interrupt me so often, you might find that you
didn’t need to.” She not only kept quiet but six months
later appointed him her foreign policy adviser.</hs_Para>

entitled to ask, “Was she actually a Conservative? Does not the
word “Conservative” normally mean someone who is rather
wedded to tradition, cautious of change, and unwilling to act too
precipitately?” Yet she was the most radical Prime Minister of
the past few generations. There is nevertheless a consistency between
those two statements, because she had recognised that Britain had gone
the wrong way—that it had taken the wrong path for 20 or 30
years, and that needed change. That is what made her a radical. Many
hon. Members will know the great novel, “The
Leopard”, by Giuseppe di Lampedusa, in which the hero says,

spent a lot of my time in the Foreign Office, I am conscious of the
fact that diplomats in the Foreign Office were not her favourite
Department. I went to see her when I was Defence Secretary some years
later, after she had retired, and she said to me, “You know,
Ministry of Defence, your problem is you’ve got no allies. The
Foreign Office aren’t wet—they’re
drenched.” When it came to the Foreign Office and to diplomats,
she sometimes had a remarkable capacity to distance herself from the
Government of which she was Prime Minister.</hs_Para>

one glorious occasion in which I was personally involved, we had a
difficult negotiation getting a package of sanctions against South
Africa. They did not include 
<?notus-xml column=1624?>economic sanctions, but she was very unhappy that one of the proposals
at the European Community Council was that we should withdraw our
defence attachés. The Ministry of Defence did not mind, but it
took an awful long time for Geoffrey Howe to persuade her to
go along with this, and she was basically unconvinced but
did go along with it.
Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:16:55"></hs_TimeCode> weeks
later, we had a visit from the President of Mozambique, and I was asked
to sit in on the meeting at Downing street. The President rebuked her
for not doing enough against apartheid in South Africa. I will never
forget her response. She bridled and said, “Mr President, that
is simply not the case. We are refusing to sell arms to South Africa.
We have initiated the Gleneagles agreement whereby we don’t have
any sporting contact with South Africa. We’re using all
diplomatic means to try and bring down apartheid.” “We,
we, we”, she said—and then suddenly she stopped, pointed
at me, and said, “They’ve decided to withdraw our defence
attachés”, adding, “I don’t know what good
that will do.” The President of Mozambique was rather bemused by
what seemed to be happening.</hs_Para>

she may have had mixed feelings about the Foreign Office, she actually
owed it a great debt of gratitude, because one of her greatest
triumphs—her relationship with Mr Gorbachev and what flowed from
that—was a result of the diplomats in the Foreign Office
spotting at a very early stage that the youngest new member of the
politburo, Mikhail Gorbachev, was a man to try to cultivate, and she
had the wisdom to accept their advice. We should not underestimate what
followed from that, which was her persuading Ronald Reagan to accept
her view that Gorbachev was a man with whom we could do business.
Reagan would not have accepted that advice from most people,
but coming from the Iron Lady, he said, “Well, if she believes
that, then I can proceed on that basis.” The result was
not only a remarkable set of initiatives but the end of the
cold war and the liberation of eastern Europe without a shot being
fired—a remarkable epitaph.</hs_Para>

do not intend to speak for too long, but I want to make one other
point. One of the big issues that is relevant to the debates we have
today is whether, in the relationship with the United States, British
Prime Ministers always have to agree with the President or otherwise we
risk that relationship. All I can say is that Margaret Thatcher had no
doubt that the answer was, “No, you don’t have
to.” On several occasions she had deep disagreements with Ronald
Reagan, one of her closest friends. For example, when British companies
had got contracts to help to build a Soviet oil pipeline in the early
1980s, the Americans threatened sanctions against those British
companies, and Margaret Thatcher bitterly criticised them. I was sent
off to Washington as a junior Minister to have meetings with Mr Kenneth
Dam, the American deputy Secretary of State. We reached a compromise.
The only thing we could not agree on was whether the compromise would
be known as the Rifkind-Dam agreement or the Dam-Rifkind
agreement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:19:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000073">Margaret
Thatcher had openly and publicly disagreed with Reagan on the Reykjavik
summit, when she felt that he was surrendering too many nuclear weapons
without getting enough in return, but most important of all, she
bitterly resented the invasion of Grenada. The House will recall that
Grenada was invaded by the United States, which had forgotten,
unfortunately, that Her Majesty was the Head of State of Grenada, and 
<?notus-xml column=1625?>had not even informed the British Government of what it was about to do.
Margaret Thatcher not only criticised it, but she went on the BBC World
Service attacking the United States and saying that it could not behave
like that. Some days later, Reagan recorded in his
memoirs that he was sitting in the Oval office with some of his aides
and he was told that the British Prime Minister was on the phone and
would he take a call. Yes, he said, of course he would. She started
berating him in a rather strident way down the telephone. It went on
for only about a minute, but some of us who have been on the receiving
end know how long that can feel. When she was in full flight, Reagan
put his hand over the receiver so that she could not hear, turned to
his aides and said, “Gee, isn’t she marvellous?”
Far from resenting it, they appreciated that sometimes they got it
wrong and even their closest allies were entitled to point it
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:21:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000074">I
conclude by saying that Margaret Thatcher was someone who did not
worry, as has already been remarked, about people being rude about her.
The term “Iron Lady” was first coined by the Soviets as
an insult. She, of course, took it on as a badge of pride. Denis Healey
referred to her memorably as Attila the Hen. François Mitterrand
famously said she had the eyes of Caligula and the lips of Marilyn
Monroe. She took them all as compliments because she asked for no
quarter and she certainly gave none.</hs_Para>

down to London, spent the night on the pavement and watched the arrival
at St Paul’s cathedral. We will honour the other great Prime
Minister of the past 50, 60 or 70 years, Margaret Thatcher, in a
similar way. That is something which not only we can be proud of and
the country can be proud of, but the whole world has a debt to her,

For those of us who worked with, loved and admired
Mrs Thatcher, her death is immensely sad, but there is one
small compensation: she leaves immensely vivid 
<?notus-xml column=1626?>memories. So vigorous, energetic and decisive was her personality that

for Mrs Thatcher as a humble speech writer, long before I entered
Parliament or became a Minister and eventually joined her Cabinet. My
most personal memories conflict with the caricature that has been built
up over time, as much by her friends as by her opponents. First, she
was immensely kind. The less important someone was, the kinder she was
to them. She gave her Ministers a pretty hard time, and quite right
too. I remember an occasion on which she had returned from three days
abroad, having had little sleep. I had been summoned, in my role as a
minor cog in her speech-writing machine, to help with some speech. She
tore a strip off the Chancellor of the Exchequer before noticing me.
She saw that I was wearing a black tie and deduced that I had been to a
funeral, and was immediately full of solicitude for me—in marked
contrast to her tearing a strip off her senior Minister.</hs_Para>

Thatcher could also be remarkably diplomatic, not least in how she
handled those who worked for her. As a junior Treasury Minister, I once
ventured to disagree with a policy of a Secretary of State, and we were
both summoned to appear before her to argue our respective cases. I
thought my arguments were overwhelmingly the better ones, but she
summed up in favour of the Secretary of State. Subsequently, she sent
me a private message saying, “Peter, I was impressed by your
arguments but it would have been quite wrong for me to overrule a
senior Minister in favour of a junior Minister on a matter that was not
of paramount importance.” She was right.</hs_Para>

Thatcher was also very cautious, again in contrast to the legend that
she recklessly took on all comers. At the expense of a humiliating
settlement with Arthur Scargill in her first Parliament, she deferred a
confrontation in order to allow Nigel Lawson to build up coal stocks so
that, should another confrontation arise—as indeed it
did—the nation would not be held to ransom. Her trade union
reforms were implemented progressively, step by step, and whenever she
felt that she had bitten off enough for one Parliament, she would
politely reject proposals for further reform, however much they
appealed to her.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:26:58"></hs_TimeCode>However, once
she was convinced that a policy was right in principle and workable in
practice, and that it had been elaborated in detail—of which she
had a masterly grasp while maintaining a focus on the central
issues—she would push it through with unswerving
tenacity.</hs_Para>

is probably not done on these occasions to face up to the criticisms
that have been made of Mrs Thatcher, but she was never one to be
limited by what was the done thing. I want to respond to the comments,
made more in the media and also by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:27:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Moray (Angus Robertson), that she was deliberately harsh and
divisive. It is said that she was harsh, but she made us face reality,
and reality was harsh. Those who did not like facing reality projected
their hatred of reality on to her. The human cost of facing up to
reality would have been much less if previous Governments of both
parties had not, for reasons of false analysis and cowardice, failed to
deal with those realities earlier. If blame is due for the fact that
any harshness materialised, it is due to her predecessors rather than
to her. Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:28:46"></hs_TimeCode>
who hated reality, who hated being proved wrong and 
<?notus-xml column=1627?>who hated seeing their illusions shattered transferred their hatred to
her. Fortunately, she was big and strong enough to act as a lightning
rod for their feelings.</hs_Para>

second adjective, “divisive”, was used of Margaret
Thatcher this morning by the BBC in its headline news, which probably
tells us more about the BBC than it does about her. She was described
as a divisive leader. That is a strange epithet, because for any
division to exist, there have to be two sides, yet no mention was made
of those who opposed the changes that proved so necessary. It is
stranger still when we consider that her greatest success was, by her
own admission, to convert her opponents to her way of seeing things.
Not a single one of the major measures she introduced was subsequently
repealed or reversed by those who followed her. Indeed, she has the
extraordinary achievement of uniting all parties in this House behind a
new paradigm: before she came along the assumption was that all
problems could best be solved by top-down direction and control of the
state. She introduced the idea that quality and efficiency are most
likely to follow if people are free to choose between alternatives.
That is now, I am happy to say, a model adopted by other parties and,
after a faltering start, was implemented by Tony Blair, even in the
public services where she had to feared to step. Far from being harsh
or divisive, she leaves a legacy that unites us all. It behoves us, on

acknowledge the wide range of contributions across the House. It is
clear from some of those testimonies that there was a side to Baroness
Thatcher which those who knew her personally saw and for which they
cherished her. I am not here to deny or counter those
personal truths, but as a democratic Irish nationalist I
must speak with sincerity and honesty about her political contribution
and legacy. She always expected and respected candour. Not to register
our differences with her politics and approach would be a dereliction
of responsibility. Many have said, in earlier contributions, that in
many ways Baroness Thatcher made a divisive political contribution and
has left a divisive legacy in Britain. That, too, is the case in
Ireland.</hs_Para>

was a formidable lady and a formidable politician, and only a
formidable politician could have made the breakthrough she
made—that cannot be denied. Neither can it be denied, however,
that she caused great pain, hurt and distress in Northern Ireland. She
was ill advised that the very deep political issue, driven by many
injustices in Ireland, could be solved by military and security methods
alone. Her policy and her approach to hunger strikes hardened and
polarised moderate opinion, and demonstrated a lack of knowledge of the
island of Ireland 
<?notus-xml column=1628?>and our peoples. Her actions proved counter-productive to her own cause
time and time again, handing the IRA political propaganda victory after
political propaganda victory. The culture of collusion within the
security service, and the licence it had from Government, was also a
major problem. The fact that at the time concerns raised by the SDLP
were rubbished and dismissed—they have subsequently been
vindicated by de Silva and many police ombudsman reports—all
served to harden and alienate further constitutional nationalist
opinion. That has left many questions, much hurt and a legacy that
remains to this day. A large part of that unfinished legacy is how we
must deal with the past and help the many victims, not just in Ireland
but on this side of the Irish sea as well. The quest for truth will go

difficulties and political differences did not stop on the shores of
these islands. The SDLP not only held a different outlook on Europe,

can deal with many difficulties and differences, but history has shown
that the signing of the Anglo-Irish agreement, by Margaret Thatcher as
Prime Minister and Garret FitzGerald as Taoiseach, was a pivotal and
defining moment in our shared history. Indeed, it was a pivotal moment
in changing the direction of our relationships in these islands. It was
the first significant agreement between Ireland and Britain since the
treaty of 1921, and it laid the foundations for the peace process and
much of the progress that has taken place in the past 27 years. It
changed for ever relationships between our two countries and was the
foundation of many of the positive changes we have experienced
since.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000092">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:35:14"></hs_TimeCode>
is poignant that today is the 15th anniversary of the signing of the
Belfast agreement—the Good Friday agreement. That effort
involved building layers upon layers of understanding, and moving on
from that agreement over the past 15 years has involved building more
layers of understanding, but we have to agree that the bedrock and the
foundation for all that has been achieved was the Anglo-Irish agreement
in 1985. The signing of that agreement showed that, as some said
earlier, at times Baroness Thatcher did listen to good advice from her
advisers. She also listened to her friends—formidable friends
such as US President Ronald Reagan; but just as Prime Minister Thatcher
might not have recognised the malignant hardening and polarising effect
of her policy and attitude towards hunger strikes, she may not have
appreciated or recognised the potential benign and long-term softening
effect on future relationships of her commitment in that Anglo-Irish
agreement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:36:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000093">In
placing our problem in these islands in a British-Irish context, the
Anglo-Irish agreement challenged the traditional Unionist mindset and
equipped political constitutional nationalism to make an even more
compelling case against violence to those engaged in violence. Indeed,
I believe it laid the foundation for stopping the violence in Ireland.
At that stage, the pages were turned to a new history—the
beginning of a new history in Northern Ireland, and with it a new
history for these islands as a whole. The benefits of the Anglo-Irish
and Good Friday 
<?notus-xml column=1629?>agreements are being reaped today by the peoples of Britain and Ireland,

She asked when the next election was, so I said that there was a little
over two years to go. She said, “That’s not far enough

Gerald Kaufman</B> (Manchester, Gorton) (Lab):</Member> I join in
paying tribute to my old adversary, Margaret Thatcher. For many, of
course, Margaret Thatcher was synonymous with
“milk-snatcher,” and it would be idle to pretend that to
us in the Labour party, and to millions of our supporters, many of her
policies were other than anathema. But Margaret was much more complex
than that, both as a politician and as a person, and her international
significance was emphasised quite recently when, almost 24 years after
she had stopped being Prime Minister, an actress in Hollywood could win
the “best actress” Oscar for portraying her almost as
well as she used to portray
herself<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:50:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000113">I
served in the shadow Cabinet for 10 years when Margaret Thatcher was
Prime Minister. I saw her in action, and I often opposed her in action.
After she left office—or rather, was ousted from office by some
of her colleagues—I had contact with her from time to
time.</hs_Para>

a Labour Member of Parliament, I deplored many of the drastic changes
that she made in society. I was Labour’s Front-Bench spokesman
during the coal strike, which she provoked, prepared for and won,
although she was greatly helped by the stupid approach of Arthur
Scargill, who destroyed the once almost revered National Union of
Mineworkers by refusing to hold a strike ballot—a victory for
her—just as Michael Foot, who has been mentioned this afternoon,
contributed very significantly indeed to her greatest election victory
in 1983.</hs_Para>

was my job to oppose her right-to-buy legislation, whose impact on the
availability of social housing persists to this day, which is quite a
charge sheet, not to mention the blunders that finished her off: the
poll tax and “no, no, no” to Europe. But after all, she
was a Tory Prime Minister and was not elected to implement policies
that I or my constituents favoured. Unlike Winston Churchill, Harold
Macmillan or Ted Heath, she broke the post-war consensus; that was her
objective, and that was her achievement.</hs_Para>

personal relationships, and in some policy areas, Margaret Thatcher
could be more than civilized—indeed, punctilious and cordial. I
was a junior Housing Minister when she was shadow Environment
Secretary, and I recall an occasion when one of her Front-Bench
spokesmen violated the kind of across-the-Floor Front-Bench deal on
which the functioning of this House depends. It was Margaret who sought
me out to apologise and to say that she knew nothing about it, and
would have stopped it had she known.</hs_Para>

she became Prime Minister, she baulked at railway privatisation. It was
imposed by John Major, and its messy consequences we suffer to this
day. Although she won her second and third elections with enormous 
<?notus-xml column=1633?>majorities, she was always accessible. She announced that any Member of
Parliament with employment problems in his or her constituency could
come and see her at No. 10, and I availed myself of that
offer when a computer multilayer board factory in my constituency was
at hazard. We met in the Prime Minister’s study in 10
Downing street and I explained the problem. “But how are we to
save it?” she asked. I suggested that it could be taken over by
the National Enterprise Board, which had been created by Labour.
Kenneth Baker, the junior
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:55:00"></hs_TimeCode>
responsible for this policy area, was present, so
she turned to him and asked plaintively, “Kenneth, what did I do
with the National Enterprise Board?” I am sorry to say that the
factory is now a blood transfusion centre, but, still, she meant
well.</hs_Para>

Thatcher was brave. In the parliamentary week following the Brighton
bombing, in which terrorists tried to kill her and her entire
Cabinet—and British democracy, by seeking to do so—she
came here; she was present, bright and perky in the House of Commons,
for the Government statement, to which I responded. She was also
absolutely right on a considerable number of foreign policy issues.
Against timorous nerve-trembling on both sides of the House and
attempted international interference, she was utterly determined that
the people of the Falkland Islands, who wanted to be British and who
still want to be British today, should not be the victims of a fascist
dictator. How some Labour Members of Parliament could actually want to
water down a response to an aggressive fascist dictator, I could not
understand then and I still do not understand today.</hs_Para>

Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait, she was actively part of the preparations
to oust him by force. I was shadow Foreign Secretary at this time and
had to seek to carry with me our Back Benchers, some of whom were
spineless<I>—[Interruption.]</I> I am here to try to
obtain a consensus. In the debate, I therefore told the House that
Labour policy was based not on supporting the United Kingdom
Government, but on implementing United Nations Security Council
resolutions. She knew what I was up to, and she dug the Foreign
Secretary in the ribs with her elbow and smiled a wry smile.
She<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T15:58:51"></hs_TimeCode> was also
much more far-sighted than most United Kingdom Prime Ministers about
rightward trends in Israel and in the middle east. When, as shadow
Foreign Secretary, I visited Morocco, I was told by the United Kingdom
ambassador there that she had given him a direct instruction to
approach the leaders of the then substantial Moroccan Jewish
community and urge them to exhort the sizeable
number of Moroccan Jewish immigrants in Israel to vote
Labour—Shimon Peres—in a forthcoming
election.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000120">Until
her final debacle, she generally found ways of getting her own way.
There had been a Lionel Bart musical called “Maggie May”
and the saying went, “Others may not, but Maggie may”,
and that was very much her watchword. I saw her from time to time after
she had left office. On one occasion I attended a social event and when
I came in she bustled over to me. I had recently had published in a
newspaper an article about protecting children from pornography on TV
and videos. She told me how much she admired the article and said,
“I carry it with me everywhere in my handbag.” To
be part of the contents of Margaret’s
handbag—what greater apotheosis could one possibly
hope for, Mr Speaker?</hs_Para>

Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 election, but we older ones can remember
the rubbish piled up in the streets,
corpses being left unburied and industry being held to ransom by the

Thatcher arrived as a new breed; not just a woman, but, as the Prime
Minister said, a conviction politician who was driven by a belief that
Britain, and the British people themselves, deserved
better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:00:17"></hs_TimeCode>. She
did not need a focus group to decide what she believed in.
She was driven by a set of clear Conservative principles, underpinned
by a fundamental belief that it was free enterprise that would deliver
the prosperity she so craved for our people in
the aftermath of the second world war and the malaise to which the
Prime Minister
referred.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000124">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:04:23"></hs_TimeCode>
I became a shadow Minister in 2002, I received a hand-written note
congratulating me and advising me, “Know your facts.” In
that spirit, I wish to remind the House of a couple of facts. Margaret
Thatcher believed in sound money, as the Prime Minister said, and in
her time public sector borrowing fell from 4.1% to 1% of GDP. The
national debt was cut from 43.6% to 26.7% of GDP. She took on the trade
union barons and restored the trade unions to their members. It is
interesting to look at the figures: in 1979, 29.8 million days were
lost to industrial action, or strikes, but that figure was cut to 2
million by the time she left office, and last year it was fewer than
250,000. Such has been the change that this divisive woman wrought to
industrial relations in our
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000125">She<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:01:53"></hs_TimeCode>
also abolished exchange controls. In about 1972 I went on a
demonstration outside the Bank of England—I was running the
Society for Individual Freedom at the time—and I held a placard
that read, “End Exchange Controls”. I did not really
understand what it was all about, because I had not yet embarked on my
banking career, but I had a vague notion that it was some sort of
ghastly second world war regulation. The first thing Geoffrey Howe did
after becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer was abolish exchange
controls. For those of our young people who do not understand what I am
talking about, as I did not then, let me explain. In those
days, when we went abroad we were allowed to take 30 quid
out of the country, and our passports had to be stamped to
show that we were entitled to do so. It is important that we take this
opportunity to remind people of the changes that have been wrought. I
was working in a bank at the time. I took all the regulations relating
to exchange controls off the shelves and have them at home to remind
myself, and anybody else who might need to, of the iniquity of exchange
controls.</hs_Para>

also ended the party line. I do not mean the line that we are so
privileged to receive from central office every morning. Again, I
remind those who are a little younger that the party line, which we had
at home, meant that a telephone, which was graciously provided by
something called the General Post Office, could not be used if a
neighbour who shared the line was already using it. I
remember in the late 1990s all the smart, Armani-suited new Labour
types clutching their mobile phones. Those
friends and comrades should not forget that had it not been
for us privatising the telecommunications industry, they
would not have had their mobile

Friends the Members for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr Lilley)
and for Wokingham (Mr Redwood) and many others in the No Turning Back
group urged her to go further and faster—we were called the
“Don’t Turn Your Back” group for some obscure
reason. I remember that we proposed to her a system in education
whereby the money followed the pupil. At an NTB dinner, she told us,
“Grow up boys and be your age. We can’t possibly do
anything like that.” We were all crestfallen and went home very
disappointed that the Prime Minister had not listened. Come the general
election in 1987, we were out canvassing all day long and would turn on
the telly at night to see what was going on at the centre. There was
the press conference, with the Prime Minister in the middle and Ken
Baker to her side. She said, “We’ve got this new idea
about education. The money follows the pupil.” That was what we
had proposed to her and she had told us to grow up and that we could
not possibly do anything like that. That was the art of Margaret
Thatcher’s political argument, of which the Prime Minister
spoke: she challenged people and made sure that they got their facts
right. She challenged that proposal and found that it was a policy
worth

“What are you going to say?”, and she said, “I am
going to tell him that if France signs the Maastricht treaty, France
est mort.” I said, “I think actually that it’s
‘La France’”. She said, “Yes. La France est
mort.” I said, “Well, because it’s
‘La France’, you have to say
‘morte’” She went round the room saying,
“La France est morte. La France est 
<?notus-xml column=1637?>morte”, and that weekend she went off to
dinner with President Mitterrand. In my view it is no coincidence that
on Monday morning, President Mitterrand announced that France would
hold a referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The eyes of Caligula and
the mouth of Marilyn Monroe, perhaps.</hs_Para>

first seat that came up after the 1992 general election, which I think
rather worried No. 10 at the

the nation, and that she restored our position in the world.</hs_Para>

of us can forget Margaret Thatcher’s extraordinary elegance. I
remember coming to the Chamber at about 4 o’clock in the morning
during an all-night sitting—none of you lot know what an
all-night sitting is about, but we used to have them regularly. It was
4 o’clock in the morning, people had had a bit to drink and, for
us chaps, there was a bit of stubble and it was really pretty
unpleasant. I was sitting on the Front Bench wondering when this
purgatory was going end, and then there was a frisson at the back of
the Chair. All of a sudden, in walked the Prime Minister, not a hair
out of place, hand bag there, smiling. We sort of slid up the Bench and
looked at the Prime Minister, saying, “Here I am.” She
was an inspiration to us all and she inspired huge loyalty. When I
asked Bob Kingston, her personal protection officer, what it was like
working for her, he said, “I would catch bullets between my
teeth to save that woman.”</hs_Para>

soldiers whom Margaret Thatcher so admired reciprocated and admired
her. I was at the Painted Hall for the 25th anniversary of the
Falklands campaign. A lot of people who had been injured, either
mentally or physically, were there. When Margaret Thatcher got up to
leave, there was the most astonishing roar from men who had been
maimed, cheering their warrior leader who had instructed them to go
into battle and they wanted to pay tribute to her.</hs_Para>

by the BBC “Panorama” programme, it took a bit of time to
see the chairman of the party—who happened to be Norman
Tebbit—but only a couple of days to see the Prime Minister. She
listened for 25 minutes and at the end she turned to the Chief Whip,
John Wakeham, and said, “These are members of our party in good
standing. Please ensure that they get the necessary support.” We
got that support. We won our libel action and the director general of

Michael Meacher</B> (Oldham West and Royton) (Lab):</Member>
I very much endorse the measured and dignified
remarks of my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition. I should
like briefly to add to them in two ways. First and most importantly, I
want to be a voice for my constituents, and secondly I want to speak as
someone who has been a Member of the House from the very
start, when Margaret Thatcher became Conservative party leader, and who
was here when she was Prime
Minister.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000144">Almost
everyone agrees that, in 1979, Britain was set on a course that could
not go on. It demanded radical change. At times of deep crisis, the
whole country rallies behind a unifying leader, whether it is Churchill
in wartime or Attlee in peacetime—the latter constructed a peace
that broke with the despair of the 1930s. Mrs Thatcher was a
very different kind of leader. She was someone who took the fight to
her opponents, and who deployed a scorched earth policy to destroy
them. That polarised the country, which is why, even today, she is
lionised in the south, as we have heard repeatedly this afternoon, but
remembered with a very different memorial in the
north.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000145">The
task in 1979 certainly required a dominant personality to shake this
country out of its somnolent conservatism—all hon. Members agree
on that. Whatever else Mrs Thatcher was, she was certainly a dominant
figure. She dominated, or came to dominate, her Cabinet, and she
dominated her party and the country. Her influence was felt across much
of the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000146">In
that context, I recall a story I recently heard while sharing a
platform with my very good friend John Gummer, who is now
Lord Deben. When he was Secretary of State for the Environment in the
1980s, he complained that he could not get his Department to take
climate change seriously. He rang Mrs Thatcher to ensure that he had
the necessary support. When he explained the situation, she said to
him, “John, you really shouldn’t worry. There are two
persons in the Cabinet who are committed over climate change—you
and me, so we are in a
majority.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000147">Dominance,
however, should always have a counterpart in concern for the victims of
radical change. One should never destroy without then building up
again. Too many industries and too many working class
communities across the north were laid waste during those years without
an alternative and better future being constructed to replace what was
lost. Many of those communities are still desolated
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000148">In

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:22:13"></hs_TimeCode> conclude by
saying simply that the unwavering conviction that Lady Thatcher
possessed so magnificently sets an example for every generation in
confronting the problems that challenge them. This generation is
confronted by very different problems: the straitjacket of prolonged
austerity, the lack of accountability in corporate power, the
over-dominance of finance, a grossly unjust system of remuneration and
the destruction of the public realm. I say genuinely and forcefully
that it is to Lady Thatcher’s credit that she has shown that we
should not be daunted by problems of that scale and magnitude, but
should tackle them head-on and overcome them with the same flame of
conviction and resolution that remains her greatest

someone with a reputation of wanting to be the only woman in the

<?notus-xml column=1640?>other women, particularly those who wanted to enter politics. As a
direct result of her comments to me back in 1979, when I sat next to
her at a dinner, I believed that I, too, could serve my country as an

was Margaret Thatcher’s clearly defined philosophy and stubborn
adherence to her own beliefs that fashioned the opinions both of her

one such detractor—he entitled his book on the Thatcher years
“Dancing with Dogma”, to reflect her often intractable
views and approach—but even he praised her attention to detail

takes no prisoner, man or woman, and being Prime Minister is no
sinecure. I think that, as an individual, she was braver than many men.
She took on the vested interests, the dictators and the misogynists,
and triumphed. She engineered the end of a cold war, and, against all
odds, won a distant one; she curtailed the powers of the unelected
unions, and restored it to elected representatives; she removed the
dead hand of the state from enterprise, and helped people to improve
their lot and their lives through hard work and home ownership; and she
established the United Kingdom’s ground, quite clearly and
uniquely, in a Europe that had its own grandiose ambitions to usurp our
British sovereignty. Any one of those feats would have been enough to
mark out an individual, but they, and many more, reflect a politician
of substance whose like we may not see again in our

became Margaret Thatcher’s personal aide and research assistant
in the October 1974 general election. The Conservative party was in
opposition and Margaret was a member of the shadow Cabinet as shadow
housing and planning Minister. In those days, Members of Parliament did
not have numbers of research assistants—they had just a single
House of Commons secretary—so the core campaign team in Finchley
was small: Mrs Thatcher’s secretary, Alison Ward, now Lady
Wakeham, her agent and me. What struck me first about working for
Margaret Thatcher was her prodigious work ethic, her indefatigable
determination to analyse and understand any brief that she was given

Thatcher was also incredibly kind, particularly to those who worked for
her. Of course, she revelled in the Iron Lady sobriquet given to her by
the Russians and others—it was a badge of respect for her
steadfastness and determination—but there was also a much softer
and more caring side to her. Perhaps I can give one example with which
I think every Member could empathise. One of my intake, Patrick
Nicholls, was a very effective junior Minister, but had had to resign
from office following a road traffic offence. Not surprisingly, he was
cross with himself and very frustrated, and thought he had let people
down.</hs_Para>

o’clock vote. Patrick asked why and was told simply to be there.
Patrick arrived, as instructed, at five to 10, and shortly afterwards
Margaret Thatcher walked in, put her arm through his and said,
“How are things going, Patrick? How are you?” As the
Division bell rang and as the Lobby filled with parliamentary
colleagues, the Prime Minister slowly walked through the Lobby, arm in
arm with Patrick, chatting to him all the way—a kind and clear
gesture of support for someone who had been a hard-working junior

also had a great sense of humour. In the 1983 general election, another
of our intake, Jeremy Hanley, won Richmond with a majority of just 74
votes. The day after the general election, Margaret, the Prime
Minister, telephoned Jeremy to congratulate him on winning
Richmond. The Conservative vote in the constituency had been about
21,000. The conversation went like this. Jeremy: “Thank you very
much, Prime Minister, for getting me the 74 votes that I
needed.” Prime Minister: “Jeremy, I got you the 21,000
votes—you just got the 74.”

Conservative party, I joined her private office for a while
as the personal link between her and the Britain in Europe campaign
that was going on as a consequence of the EU referendum. I therefore
had a good opportunity to see how Margaret worked, in the early part of
her leadership, with parliamentary colleagues and advisers. Yes,
Margaret Thatcher was certainly a person of robust views. She liked a
good discussion—robust argument, even—but she was always
willing to listen and heed the views of others. There were, I suspect,
countless occasions when having heard the arguments—having heard
the advice of Willie Whitelaw, or, on more personal matters, heeded the
good counsel of Denis—Margaret would accept 
<?notus-xml column=1643?>other people’s contributions and advice, perhaps saying something
like, “All right, we’ll do it your way, but you had

is also a caricature to portray Margaret Thatcher as simply
anti-European. I have in my desk at home the originals of a number of
speeches that she gave in her constituency and elsewhere during the
1975 EU referendum campaign—speeches clearly amended and
corrected in her own very distinctive cursive handwriting. Margaret
campaigned wholeheartedly for a “yes to Europe” result in
the referendum. As those speeches demonstrate, she clearly believed in
a strong Europe being a counterweight to the then Soviet Union and a
strong partner to the United States. She clearly undoubtedly believed
in a Europe of nation states. She strongly believed in ensuring the
speediest possible creation of the European single market and was
always extremely frustrated by other member states that sought to
frustrate the further creation of a single market for their own
particular nationalist interests.</hs_Para>

I think that this where her frustration may have started with some of
the workings of the European Union. Prior to the Single European Act in
the mid-1980s, every EU member state had, in effect, a veto on any
issue of any importance. This meant that the EU Commission or the
President of the Council of Ministers, when wishing to get business
through had, importantly, to negotiate with and square any member
states that they thought would veto a particular proposal.
That meant that any single member state could veto advances in the
single market. It was therefore decided, in the Single European Act, to
move to a system of weighted qualified majority voting. This,
overnight, fundamentally changed the way in which the Council of
Ministers and the Commission worked, because now all they needed to do
was to secure the support of sufficient member states to get a majority
vote. They would therefore start with the member states they considered
the most supportive of a proposal and work on them until they got a
qualified majority, and if, at the end, there were some member states
on the other side of the argument, they were not necessarily
particularly
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:39:00"></hs_TimeCode>. This
change meant that while Margaret had succeeded in making the single
market work much better, she was no longer able as easily to threaten
to exercise a UK veto, and I think in time she found that very
frustrating.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000175"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T16:39:16"></hs_TimeCode>I

there are those who say that Margaret was divisive. To them I would
simply observe that Margaret Thatcher was a democrat, and a democrat
who won three general elections in a row with increased majorities. I
was elected in 1983 when Margaret secured a majority of 144 in the
Commons. I do not think any of us who were elected in June 1983 were in
any doubt that we owed our election to Margaret Thatcher and the
affection 
<?notus-xml column=1644?>in which she was held by huge numbers of voters. This, for me, is best
recalled in a single soundbite in Banbury market. One of the television
stations had come to do some vox pop on the election in Banbury. They
went up to a chap who ran the fruit and veg stall. “What do you
think about the general election?” they asked. “I
don’t know much about politics,” said the guy,

was very cruel that Margaret Thatcher should have been so unwell for
the last years of her life. I first realised that something was not
quite right a number of years ago when Margaret was speaking at a
fundraising dinner for Somerville college. Lady Thatcher, as she then
was, was making a bravura speech, clearly setting out the thoughts and
principles that had guided her throughout public life, but she was
finding it difficult to bring the speech to a conclusion. I suspect
that those of us there who knew her must have suspected that all was
not well, and so it sadly proved to be. In passing, it is important to
recall how proud Margaret was of having been made an honorary fellow of
Somerville, the college which had set her on the path to becoming the
UK’s first woman Prime Minister, and also how sad she was that
was never awarded an honorary degree by Oxford.</hs_Para>

reputation of Oxford university that it had not felt able to recognise
Margaret’s unquestionable and outstanding achievements in
politics and public life. Somerville established a number of
fellowships in law and chemistry in honour of Margaret Thatcher, and I
suspect that if anyone wanted to make a bequest in Margaret’s

will, I am sure, continue to speak in this debate, but the House is a
place where opinion should be expressed freely, even if it is
controversial, and those of us who so strongly disagreed with
the policies pursued by Lady Thatcher should make our views
clear today. It is more political than personal. Of course I 
<?notus-xml column=1645?>regret, like everyone else, the passing of Lady
Thatcher. I recognise that by becoming the first female Prime Minister
in Britain, she made history, and that cannot be disputed. However, we
have to remember what was done during the 11 years—or, to be
exact, as she always was, the 11 and a half years—of her
premiership in No. 10 Downing street and the way in which those
policies were carried out. It was my view, and that of those on the
Opposition Benches at the time, that those policies were highly
damaging and that they caused immense pain and suffering to ordinary
people.</hs_Para>

therefore believe that it is right that, while tributes are being paid
to the life of Lady Thatcher, we should not forget what happened at
that time. Those of us who were here in the House of Commons used every
opportunity to protest on behalf of our constituents who were the
victims of those policies, and we were not wrong to do so. This is not
so much about Lady Thatcher herself as about the way in which, once the
election had been won in 1979, it was decided to pursue policies that
almost immediately—certainly within a year or two—caused

do not want to dispute in any way the extent to which Lady Thatcher
made a contribution in relation to eastern Europe. However, it is
unfortunate, is it not, that she was so totally unsympathetic to the
fight against apartheid in South Africa? To describe the African
National Congress as a terrorist organisation and Nelson Mandela as a
terrorist cannot be justified under any circumstances. I remember when
Nelson Mandela came to Westminster Hall as a very distinguished
visitor––as President of South Africa. We paid tribute to
him and listened keenly to what he said. I could not but notice that in
the front row listening to him was Lady Thatcher. I hope that by then
she had realised that she had taken the wrong line on apartheid. We
should not just be concerned about freedom in Europe, but in South
Africa and Latin America. I was never a fan of Pinochet, a professional
mass murderer.</hs_Para>

Thatcher was a divisive figure, and she would not for one moment have
argued otherwise. One thing on which we can agree in this House is that
“consensus” was not her favourite word. The Prime
Minister mentioned former Prime Ministers. Of the two Prime
Ministers who have made the greatest impression since 1945,
in my view, and in the view of the Opposition Benches, Clement
Attlee’s tremendous changes—the national health service,
national insurance and the like—made Britain a far 
<?notus-xml column=1647?>more civilised country. The other figure, to whom
we are paying tribute today, is Lady Thatcher. She
believed that much of what occurred post-1945 was wrong and
should be undermined. My view remains that what the Attlee Government
set out to do was absolutely right, and that what Lady
Thatcher set out to do—undermine many of the changes brought
about immediately after the second world war—was
wrong. I know which side I am
on.</hs_Para>

Thatcher was a controversial and sometimes divisive figure. It was
inevitable given the scale of the challenges she and her Government
faced. She had to make difficult and unpopular decisions, but her
conviction and strength of purpose enabled her to achieve what she did,
often in the face of enormous opposition. She confronted opposition
right from the start of her career. The Leader of the Opposition
referred to her time at Oxford. She became active in the Oxford
University Conservative Association––indeed, its
president––because women were not allowed to participate
in the Oxford Union. Once she became leader of our party, she
confronted huge opposition within our own ranks. Many people resented
her background, from a middle-class family in Grantham; they resented
her sex and they also resented her ideological certainty. All those

Thatcher’s strength of purpose allowed her to confront our

invasion of the Falkland Islands. She played a role in persuading
George Bush that she must confront Saddam Hussein when he invaded and
occupied Kuwait, and, with Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev, in bringing
about the end of communism. She was also a pragmatist and a realist.
She was responsible for the Lancaster House agreement, which ended
white rule in Rhodesia and ushered in black majority government. She
negotiated the hand-back of Hong Kong to the Chinese, and as we have

attention to detail and her occasionally somewhat unreasonable demands.
I also saw at first hand her instinctive feel for the aspirations and
beliefs of the people of Britain. It was her identity with those people
that allowed her to articulate so clearly what they wanted and that
delivered successive general election majorities for the Conservative
party of 144 and 102—some of us might think that those were the

1988, Margaret Thatcher asked me to become her political secretary in
Downing street. I saw then her huge respect for Parliament
itself. She occupied the position of Prime Minister, but she never
forgot that she was also the Member of Parliament for Finchley and she
believed that it was her duty to come here not just to speak but to
vote—to go through the Division Lobby on behalf of her
constituents. I used to help her with preparation for Prime
Minister’s questions, which in those days lasted for just 15
minutes and took place twice a week. She used to spend six or seven
hours preparing for that 15-minute session. We used to go through
briefs from every Department across Whitehall, which set out the
exposition of the Government’s policy and the line to take.
Sometimes, she did not think it was very good and I would be sent to
ring the Minister’s private secretary to tell him that the Prime
Minister did not like a particular line. Occasionally, she strode
across the study, took the phone from my hand and told the private
secretary that not only did she not like the line to take but that she
did not even like the policy either. Every now and again, she had a
remarkable ability to distance herself somehow from the policies of the

leader.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000201">I

to the hon. Member for Walsall North (Mr Winnick). Although Margaret

Nelson Mandela, if not by the hon. Gentleman.</hs_Para>

say to the leader of the Liberal Democrats, who I am sorry to say is no
longer here, that, yes, Margaret Thatcher did say that there was no
such thing as society, but she went on to say that there are families
and communities. She set out the fact that if individuals see people
less well off or in need, they bear a personal and moral responsibility
not just to let society—some amorphous body—take
responsibility, but to act themselves. People claiming now that she
said that there was no such thing as society is an appalling twisting

first hand her immense personal kindness and compassion. As has been
said, those were often shown to the most junior members of her staff.
On the famous occasion when the waitress spilt the soup on Geoffrey
Howe, it was not Geoffrey Howe whom Margaret Thatcher worried about,
but the waitress. She always insisted that she could never be
late—particularly to funerals, to which, sadly, I used to
accompany her occasionally. We used to sit in lay-bys for 15 or
20 minutes; we would have set off early in case there was

handwritten letters from Margaret Thatcher when they experienced a
tragedy in their private

that they should come and spend it at Chequers with her. Ronnie Millar,

on empty. Patients were staying on trolleys in corridors. I tremble to
think what the death rate among pensioners would have been this winter
if that version of Thatcherism had been fully up and running this year.
Our schools, parents, teachers, governors, even pupils, seemed to spend
an inordinate amount of time fundraising in order to be able to provide
basic materials such as paper and pencils. The plaster on our classroom
walls was kept in place by pupils’ art work and miles and miles
of sellotape. Our school libraries were dominated by empty shelves and

Thatcher created an aspirational society. It aspired for things. One
former Prime Minister who had himself been elevated to the House of
Lords, spoke about selling off the family silver and people knowing in
those years the price of everything and the value of nothing. What
concerns me is that I am beginning to see what might be the
re-emergence of that total traducing of what I regard as the spiritual
basis of this country where we do care about society, where
we do believe in communities, where we do not leave people and walk by
on the other side. That is not happening now, but if we go back to the
heyday of that era, I fear that we will see replicated yet again the

<?notus-xml column=1652?>hon. Friend the Member for Maldon (Mr Whittingdale) addressed some other
myths that have been spread recently. It is true that the restructuring
of our economy in the early 1980s hit parts of the north hard, because
a concentration of heavy industry and mining had become uncompetitive
and uneconomic, but many metropolitan journalists fall into peddling an
easy fallacy, suggesting that the north was uniformly hostile to the
message of Lady Thatcher—we were not. Many Labour
Members will recall that the seats they now represent
returned Conservative Members who supported Margaret Thatcher’s
strong defence, modernisation of the economy, determination to extend
opportunity, and spreading of wealth and home ownership to their
constituents. Many of those seats across the north returned Labour
Members only after Tony Blair embraced the free market, low-tax message
of Margaret Thatcher.</hs_Para>

Sheppard was a left-wing Bishop of Liverpool, who was much
admired and also loved. In one volume of his autobiography, he recalls
his meetings with Mrs Thatcher—or, rather, the lead-up to those
meetings. He recalls the state he would be in—the feeling of
illness as the dreaded hour approached. On one occasion, I asked her, a
year before she would appoint a new archbishop, whether she would
appoint David Sheppard if his name was one of the two on the list that
came to her from the royal commission. Her reply was immediate:
“Yes, of course.” I was slightly staggered by that
response, so I asked why. She said, “He always tells me to my
face what he thinks and we always have a good argument.” It
therefore seems proper that in the tributes we pay to this
extraordinary person we should follow her example and not be frightened

world in which all of us and all of our constituents live has been
shaped by Clement Attlee and Margaret Thatcher. The danger for both
those people, who brought an ideology into politics and saw it
operated, was that some of their supporters might think that just
preaching the ideology was enough, rather than also responding to what
the real world was teaching them.

Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood) talked about the sale of council
houses—all of us in this debate sometimes give a slant to
history. There were people in the Labour party who also wanted to sell
council houses, and the record shows that both the Wilson and Callaghan
Governments looked at the idea—the problem was that the civil
servants told them that it was not doable. So one of the lessons about
Mrs Thatcher is that one should not necessarily take the advice of the
civil service if one actually wants to see radical politics.</hs_Para>

Mrs Thatcher was not uncritical of her own record. On one occasion I
asked her, “Mrs T, what was your greatest disappointment in
government?” Again 
<?notus-xml column=1653?>as though she had thought long and hard beforehand about it, she said,
“I cut taxes and I thought we would get a giving society, and we
haven’t.” She thought we would, by low taxation, see that
extraordinary culture in America whereby people make fortunes and want,
perhaps publicly, to declare what they are doing with them. That had
not taken root here. I think we should look critically at her record.
Of course, it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T17:17:30"></hs_TimeCode> is

want to mention three areas where we are still grappling with her
legacy, and with which Members on both Front Benches have not managed
to come to terms. First, there is the great question of riches. She was
not satisfied with the results of her Government, so should
we? Secondly, despite all the gains that the market economy has given
this country, there are clearly some areas—part of my
constituency is one of them—that its powers cannot reach. We
have not come up with policies that can move those areas
back to full employment. How do we raise demand in those
areas specifically, and how do we ensure that the supply side, to which
most of us are now committed, can also take
effect through our
schools?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000227">The
third big area is a problem in our country that she thought she had
solved but that now appears in a different guise. We have mentioned,
even quite properly on the Opposition Benches, that one of her great
struggles was to bring the trade unions within the law decided by this
House—not the law that they thought they would abide by. I have
been perplexed by some of the recent newspaper coverage of her
stewardship, much of which has stated that the country was previously
ungovernable. It was governable all right, but not from here and not by
the Government elected by the people.</hs_Para>

would Mrs Thatcher say about a global economy, part of which she was so
responsible for creating, in which great world companies can choose
whether or not they pay taxes and whether giving a donation to the
Treasury might be an adequate performance of their duties instead? I
would be very surprised if she did not see that as a challenge to our
authority, and one with which we need to grapple. All three areas are
part of the current agenda for our politics, and that is part of her
legacy. I wonder whether she, if still in power, would
not be tackling that in a more resolute way than we
are
currently.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0001.htm#1304104000229"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T17:22:06"></hs_TimeCode>I
would like to end with two comments about Mrs Thatcher. We
have talked about the power and force of her personality, but she was
also brilliant on detail, and that was part of her power in Whitehall.
I once had to see her to discuss a defence order for Cammell Laird.
Indeed, my relationship with her began after the second meeting I had
as MP for Birkenhead, when the shop stewards said, “Cut out all
this old stuff. We want a cross-party group and we want you to lead it.
We want all the parties in the Wirral lobbying for orders.” That
was the beginning of my friendship with
her.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#1304104000230">Our
discussion took place the day she returned from a meeting with
President Bush to decide on the first Gulf war. She had every reason to
cancel it, but the meeting took place in her study. I had never seen
her in such a state. She was marching around the study saying,
“You’ve no idea what a struggle it is putting backbone
into him.” I said, “Prime Minister, come and sit next to
me because I have some things I would like to discuss 
<?notus-xml column=1654?>with you.” She kept talking about putting backbone into the
American President in order to fight this great war. Finally, she took
pity on me and asked, “What do you want?” I made the plea
for the defence order and she said, “Fine. Anything
else?” When I said no, she immediately got up and continued,
“You’ve no idea the victory I’ve had today over
this.” I was really rather excited to be this very small
footnote in
history.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304104000231" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#1304104000231">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T17:20:38"></hs_TimeCode>
course, courtesy dictated that whichever of the Wirral MPs had lobbied
her would tell the others, but in my excitement I forgot to do so.
About 36 hours later I saw David Hunt walking down the
corridor and I remembered, so I began apologising. He said,
“There’s no need to apologise, Frank. The relevant
Secretaries of State have received a prime ministerial minute and it
has been copied to their permanent secretaries.” There was a
Prime Minister who was making history, for right or wrong—for
right, I think—and who was extraordinarily wound up by the
events that she had managed to bring about, and she had no staff with
her, but before she went to bed that night she wrote that minute to
implement what she had agreed. She was wonderful to lobby, because I
knew within seconds whether she would do something or whether she
thought it was a barmy idea, in which case there was no point
discussing it further.</hs_Para>

one last point. Towards the end of her time as Prime Minister, Mrs
Thatcher was captured by a court on the Government Benches whose
members made it difficult not only for many Government Back Benchers
but particularly for someone such as me to see her. I wrote to the
court and said that if they continued to block my chance of talking to
her and lobbying her, I would kidnap her and tell her what they were
doing—and would also lobby her. I got a note back late in the
debate saying that the Prime Minister would see me at 10
o’clock. This is a good lesson for the Prime Minister and the
Leader of the Opposition. She had a hugely impressive voting record. In
my experience, she was one of the last out of the Lobby, and she was
there for people to talk to—rather than going in, out and away
to do what was thought to be more important
business.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T17:25:38"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

she passed by, I said to her, “Prime Minister, should I follow
you?” She said, “People do.”

mirror in front of her, I have never worked out whether she was
smiling. I hope she was. Following her is a challenge to us. Do we see
her record as though it had been brought down from Mount Sinai on

seniority to go into her Cabinet. She encouraged women, so that by the

not just raising money to help women enter Parliament, but her very
presence in a room of aspiring people. After a mere handshake from

not. Such was the power and personality of this great

that Margaret Thatcher did not encourage women because, of course, it
goes without saying that she preferred to see Conservatives elected
rather than Labour, or Liberal, female Members of Parliament. In her
encouragement and advice, however, on a personal level she was much
more like a mother than a Prime Minister. She would hold one’s
hand and say, “Well my dear, what are you doing about this? What
is going to happen about that?” She gave people true
encouragement and confidence. Actually, I am wrong to stand here and
say that she did that for women—she did it for everyone who had

always valued and tried to live up to, not necessarily with the
greatest results for 
<?notus-xml column=1656?>which she might have hoped. She understood the difficulty that women
experience in public life because they are trying to balance their
duties to their families, their constituency, Parliament and their
general duties. She understood that and made allowances for it. Again,
the way she dealt with such matters was to give encouragement. It never
occurred to her, of course, that women might need special pleading. Of

Thatcher was a radical politician and will remain a controversial
figure. She would have expected that her conviction politics would
court controversy even at such a time. Many of her domestic policies
caused great concern and harm to many people and communities. I entered
the House in 1983, nine months before the start of the miners’
strike. I come from a mining background and represent a mining
constituency. My overriding memory of the 12-month strike was not the
violence that we saw on our television screens—I condemned the
violence at the time—but the poverty and hardship that miners
and their families went through for the best part of 12

the Member for Maldon (Mr Whittingdale) spoke so eloquently.
Margaret Thatcher was a passionate Conservative, but she was also a
compassionate Conservative. When I first met her in 1976—I was
then chairman of Putney Conservatives—she visited an old
people’s day centre in Putney, where I saw her in action. She
spoke to every single person in the day centre sitting room. She, as
leader of the Conservative party, knelt down in order to be able to
converse meaningfully with those who could not speak to her easily.
That, for me, was a demonstration of her humility and
compassion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T17:40:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041010000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041010000009">People
have spoken about the way in which Margaret Thatcher would write
letters to colleagues who had been bereaved and so on. A few years ago,
my wife was in hospital. The flowers from Margaret Thatcher arrived
before my own, which was rather embarrassing. That was the extent to
which she was on the ball with her generosity and kindness not only to
colleagues, but to their

on which I disagreed with her fundamentally was her decision not to
stand in the second ballot in 1990. If she had stood, I think that she
would have won and that the course of history would have been
different. I am sad that those of us who went into her study that
evening to persuade her to change her mind were unsuccessful. It was
typical of her that she sent special notes to all of us who had tried
to persuade her to stay on. It was a humiliating experience for that
fantastic Prime Minister. Having been in that study and seen her
condition, I would not wish it on anybody. Somebody who had served her
country with such distinction and who had been a global leader in 
<?notus-xml column=1658?>bringing freedom to much of eastern Europe was humiliated by people whom

1997, Margaret came and supported my election campaign in Christchurch,
where we were trying to overturn the majority of about 16,000 that the
Liberal Democrats had won in the 1993 by-election. That was her first
outing in the campaign. She was confronted by the press because one of
our colleagues who was standing in Tatton had suddenly hit the
headlines. Margaret demonstrated her ability to deal with the press
with a phrase or, as in this case, a very short sentence that could not
result in any follow-up. When asked about Neil Hamilton, she said,
“Nobody is perfect.” In those three words, she closed
down the conversation, because she was not passing judgment on his
case, but saying something that applies to all of us. That is an

He said, “I want to be a musician.” She paused and stared
with her wonderful eyes at this young man and said, “And what
else do you want to be?” That demonstrated that she did nothing
for effect. When she asked somebody a question, she was willing to
listen to the answer and make a comment. She gave that person the
benefit of her views, whether they liked it or not. I hope that that
individual is now a successful musician. If he is not, I hope that he

me say something about Margaret Thatcher and the representation of
women. I do so as a Member of Parliament whose constituency has been
represented by women for longer than any other constituency in the
country—since 1953. The first of those women was Dame Edith
Pitt. The then Conservative and Unionist party had to nominate her as
the candidate because the local association had rebelled against the
original nomination on the basis that it had a perfectly good
candidate, albeit a woman, and the party caved in. When Dame Jill
Knight was nominated in 1966, the Conservative association said
“We have already tried a woman, so we will have a man
now”, and she said “I will accept that
argument, but only if it works both ways.” Of course, it did
not.</hs_Para>

Minister said, Margaret Thatcher broke through that glass ceiling. She
kicked doors open. Indeed, she kicked doors open for Labour women, in a
way that they perhaps did not entirely appreciate, because the trade
unions had an enormously powerful role in candidate selections. It
benefited us when the unions were forced to provide more openings for
women, and when “one member one vote” and many similar
changes came along, although Margaret Thatcher would not have thought
of those developments in that way.</hs_Para>

think Margaret Thatcher realised that the problem was more systemic.
Notwithstanding what was said by the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs
Laing), before the 1997 election there were more men called John than
there were women MPs in the House of Commons. In May 1997,
121 women were elected, which meant that there were more women MPs in
one intake than there had been in the entire history of Parliament. I
do not think we are right to lay the blame for that at the door of
Margaret Thatcher, because it was a reflection of the times. I think
that if she had not been the way she was, she would not have been in
the position that she was in.</hs_Para>

Geoffrey Howe who presented him with it. Two old adversaries met in
friendship at Speaker’s House. Denis Healey said “When
you get to my age, there are no enemies any more; there are just people
who are still alive with you.” Somehow, I do not think that
Margaret Thatcher would have seen it in that way. She was fighting to
the very end, and I think it was a sign of the times that she had to
fight to the very end.</hs_Para>

generations have forgotten what 1979 was like. I came here from Germany
in the 1970s. I know that Margaret Thatcher would not want us not to
learn any lessons from the battles that she had fought—some
lost, some won, and some which continue. I am thinking in particular of
the role of the market. It is interesting that Margaret Thatcher
considered that Hayek’s book “The Road to Serfdom”
should be compulsory reading. Many Government Members, and probably
even more of my hon. Friends, will be surprised to learn that I agree
that it should be compulsory reading, as a reminder of the
role of the market. [<SmallCaps>Hon. Members:</SmallCaps> “Come

arguments have been advanced about the force of the market. It has been
argued that it actually liberates. The market does not need to be made
social, because it is already social. It challenges vested interests,
and lets outsiders in. In Germany, that was a social democratic
argument advanced by Ludwig Erhard, the father of the social market
economy. One legacy of the entrenchment of Thatcherism in the
’80s that might have to be looked at now and in years to come is
the polarisation of the argument with false options. We are boxing
ourselves into corners, which will not be terribly beneficial to either
side of the House. If we believe that markets are social and
important—in everything Margaret Thatcher did, she realised that
they could challenge the status quo, vested interests and outsiders,
and bring them in—perhaps we should recognise that
they are also

all she said, why then can I vividly remember the moment Margaret
Thatcher left No. 10—Government Members have talked of
tears—as being to me an enormous joy? I have been reflecting on
why I felt so strongly. It took me back to the Kent miners’
strike in March 1985. I was in Essex, my children were small and I was
listening to the radio about the end of that bitter, final strike. I
was in tears, but could not work out why. I think it was because the
people at the bottom were taking an enormous hit and suffering for the
mistakes of people in power, whether people in government or the trade
union representatives. The same thing is now happening again in parts
of Europe. It would have been interesting to hear what Margaret
Thatcher would have made of what is happening in the eurozone, where
the people paying the price are not the politicians who took wrong
choices or the people in power who made mistakes, but the generations
of unemployed people.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T17:52:39"></hs_TimeCode>people
associated with the Thatcher Government and what makes that Government
that much more contentious. She is one of those few figures whose
obituaries are not sufficiently balanced to reflect her achievements as
well as her weaknesses, which she had—as she herself said,
nobody is perfect. The reason for the insufficient balance is that
polarisation. She was one of those public figures for whom it will take
much longer for both sides to make a true assessment, but make no
mistake—I think now of all the figures of Prime
Ministers in the Lobby—she was one of the defining figures of
the last century. The House should be proud that the first woman Prime
Minister of this country will be honoured in the way I think she

conversation with Margaret Thatcher was to disagree. If somebody
disagreed, her eyes lit up and she launched into the argument. If
somebody had a proposition, or she had a proposition, she turned the
discussion into a friendly argument. My hon. Friend used to sit to one
side, but between us, like an umpire at Wimbledon, with his head moving
from side to side, with a faint grin, and I would peer out of the
corner of my eye to see if I was winning. In any discussion with

Thatcher’s saying, “The Lady’s not for

listen to an argument, particularly if there was a political aspect to

suitable and good enough. She must have done so, because she could not
have won so many elections in row had she had mural dyslexia and been
inflexible or unable to see the point of an argument. I think that is
why she used to spend time talking to all kinds of people, from
Presidents through to business people and the little people, such as
me. I remember Lord King telling my business partner and me that he was
to see Margaret Thatcher and that he was going to tell her this, that

many Members have said, Margaret Thatcher was also prepared to help
with campaigning, if we felt it would be of benefit, which I found
extraordinary and it provided a real insight into her ability to
understand. In 1986, we had a small battle in Wandsworth. We went into
an election with a majority of one out of a full council of 61. Her
standing in the polls, if I remember correctly, was 19% or 20%. Being a
great supporter of some of the things we were trying to do and had
done, she offered to drop in on the campaign in support. This was
politely declined, and equally politely our “Thank you, but
no” was accepted. Do remember, however, that shortly afterwards,
that 19% or 20% lifted to a win at the election that shortly followed.
It also,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T17:57:54"></hs_TimeCode>regretfully, in
a way, meant that we won and we went from a majority of one to a

had a session at which she picked my brains over what Wandsworth was
doing, the election result and so on, followed by a request for an
urgent formal report. My hon. Friend is a past master at quiet
whispering in someone’s ear so that they do not miss the point,

I particularly enjoyed in discussions with Margaret Thatcher was that

was told where I stood. That was extremely useful. On one visit, I
sought an audience to explain that the then Inner London Education

London, including those in my own borough. My proposition was that the
authority could and would provide a better education for inner-London
children. I had no inkling of her thinking, but she

was going to ask her first question. Unfortunately, my predecessor,
Curly Mallalieu, died that week, and I had to withdraw from that first
Prime Minister’s questions. It took me a long time to get
another question to the Prime Minister. Indeed, the next time I got a

I was at the London School of Economics, I studied with Michael
Oakeshott and read Hayek, and I was very much influenced by
both those gentlemen. 
<?notus-xml column=1663?>Oakeshott took me through a wonderful study of
Machiavelli’s “The Prince” and
“Discourses”, which tell us that for a leader—a
prince or Prime Minister—to survive, they have to be
lucky. Mrs Thatcher was not only talented as a leader, but lucky. I was
on the Opposition Benches knowing what a shambles the Opposition were.
We spent more time fighting each other within the Labour party than we
had time to fight the Government. It is not good for democracy to have
such a weak Opposition as we had post 1979.
Sometimes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:09:28"></hs_TimeCode> we
stand up and say that Mrs Thatcher rolled over the mining communities,
and she did. She caused great hardship. Terrible things happened to
people in the mining communities, and the miners’ dispute should
have ended much sooner than it did. My heart went out to the wives of
miners selling things to raise money and trying to keep families
together. I remember it very well. Although my constituency is not a
mining constituency, it is very close to mining constituencies. I
understand the people who loathed Mrs Thatcher, but I also understand
that at that time those people were let down by the Opposition because
we could not get our act together to defeat her.</hs_Para>

been some very good and perceptive speeches. I agreed with one or two
Government Members and did not agree with two or three of my

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:04:42"></hs_TimeCode>on what Mrs
Thatcher contributed, and I think it was this. What happened in 1979
was a colossal sea change in British politics, and we needed it. We
needed something radical to happen to the untidy post-war shambles of a
consensus, and Mrs Thatcher was it. It was not about Conservatism or
Toryism. The people who said that it was Gladstonian, laissez-faire
liberalism were absolutely right, as we know, because that blue
liberalism was well known and understood in West Yorkshire. That is
what she stood for, and it surprised everyone. Labour Members did not
know how to handle it, and partly because of that she had three general
election victories. We were trounced. We were a divided party and a
divided Opposition, and we had a very long and tough time getting
through it. Mrs Thatcher transformed the Labour party. We had to reform
and change and get our act together, or we would have ceased to have
the presence and power of a major party in our country. We must
remember what Mrs Thatcher did for parliamentary

are again overdue a radical change in how we regard our parliamentary
democracy. We need a voice in this Chamber—I do not know which

inequities in our society. There are serious problems, different from
those that Mrs Thatcher faced in 1979 and in the years of her prime
ministership, but very deep.

There is the tragic decline of our great cities, many of them in the
north and the midlands. That has happened all over the developed
world—in the United States, we should look at what is happening
in Detroit and Pittsburgh. There is something deeply wrong with how our

international capitalism, as Labour Members would call it, and the
international structure of
economics.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041013000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041013000006">Something<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:09:28"></hs_TimeCode>
fundamental is happening that we have become a bit complacent about in

on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:07:56"></hs_TimeCode>. If we are
honest—I make this a constant theme in my speeches; I am
sorry—most of us will admit that tiny numbers of people in our
constituencies are actively involved in politics. We are in a democracy
where only 65% voted at the last election and 6 million people did not
even register to vote. The state of our parliamentary democracy is
deplorable. We will need someone with a vision, perhaps based on a very
different political view, who will say, “If we value this
democracy we have got to shake it
up.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041013000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041013000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:08:39"></hs_TimeCode>I
have spoken today because I got to admire and quite like Mrs Thatcher,
who, as some of my colleagues have said, could be very pleasant indeed.
She would give someone a real roasting from the Dispatch Box if they
made a comment, but out there in the corridor she would be
very kind. That is the truth of the woman. She was phenomenal. She did
things that I deplored; she did things I thought were wonderful. There
is a balance, and over time we will judge how good it was. We are
facing a challenge to our democracy, and we need a
Thatcher-like—not the same as Thatcher—radical change
that will again wake us up to the fact that our country faces
challenges to which, at present, we have no answers.</hs_Para>

into that selection meeting saying, “I’m not voting for a

changed his mind in short order when she was clearly head

is said about Mrs Thatcher’s background. She is described, often
disparagingly, as the grocer’s daughter and the housewife who
knew the value of thrift and of living within one’s means, as if
there was something wrong with that. For me, Mrs Thatcher illustrates
clearly and sharply what shapes our views as Members of Parliament,
whether is it ideology, background or our casework. It is probably a
blend of all
three<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041013000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041013000011">Finchley

would have seen at first hand how Government policies
affected the lives of local families —families who

commentators describe her as driven by ideology, they fail to

her constituents and, equally importantly, by her supporters and her

Thatcher returning to Downing street, the No.10 machine would be on the
phone, demanding politely to know what she had been told in Finchley,
because she had returned to Downing street full of vigour, demanding to
know what was going on with this or that. Finchley brought home to her

is one incident that perhaps explains her drive to abolish the rates

her constituency work shaped her policies. The rights and wrongs of the
community charge are not for today, but the casework that Mrs Thatcher

earners paying the same as a pensioner. She saw at first hand the
struggle that many on low and fixed incomes had with the rates. One
experience I will relate. I am told that one elderly resident came to
see her in a state of distress. The resident had paid her
rates in cash in an envelope to the town hall. The cash went astray.
Mrs Thatcher knew the hardship that having to find the rates once had
caused, let alone having to find them a second time to make up the cash
that had gone astray.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:15:44"></hs_TimeCode> is not

Thatcher took enormous interest in her constituents, and her ability to
remember their names and their concerns, often months after
first meeting them, was truly astounding. In the early 1990s when I was
a local councillor in Finchley, Mrs Thatcher came to a summer fete,
which was held every year on a small council estate. She arrived bang
on time, for she was a stickler for punctuality. She swept in, in the
Jaguar. Out she came, as immaculate as ever. She ignored the local
dignitaries such as humble councillors, went straight across to the
organiser of the fete, whom I will call Mrs Smith, and said,
“Now, dear, how did your daughter get on with her GCSEs? She sat
them last year, didn’t she? Wasn’t she sitting
seven?” I was completely bowled over by this. I spoke to her
agent and asked if he made copious notes while no one was

Thatcher had an amazing knack of being able to put anyone at ease,
usually because she knew that what was important to them had to be
important to her. The dripping tap that the council would not repair
was the most important thing to that constituent, and so it became the
most important thing to Mrs T. There are countless examples of her
warmth and her compassion. The devotion of those who worked with her
and stayed with her after she was no longer the Prime Minister is
testament to that. Many of her close protection officers chose to stay
with her, rather than move up the ranks. One of them recently told me
of a Christmas time at Chequers. He came back to the police mess room
to find that Mrs Thatcher had been in. She had tidied up and decorated
it with Christmas decorations. She had cleaned out the hearth, laid a

virtues and I would rank her as one of the two best politicians of the
last century. The other one was Clement Attlee.

should like to share a little story with hon. Members. It involves a
cunning plot by the late Tony Banks, who had some power over the
decisions about statues in the House as he chaired the Advisory
Committee on Works of Art. He commissioned a statue of Mrs Thatcher
that was of exactly the right dimensions to fit into one of the empty
niches outside the Chamber in the Members’ Lobby. It was made of
white marble. Unfortunately, however, it was decapitated. His cunning
plan was to put that white marble statue there in the hope of having a
bronze statue of another Prime Minister, who is possibly not held in
the same respect today.</hs_Para>

Thatcher was not like most politicians. We all pretend that we act on

prejudice and perception. Those are the things that move us and 
<?notus-xml column=1667?>determine what laws are passed in the House. She was a woman who knew

also believe, however, that Mrs Thatcher was very wrong in many of the
things that she did, and my main reason for speaking today is to tell
the House what happened to my constituents at that time. No one would
question the need for greater financial discipline in the 1970s and
into the 1980s; industries were in a mess. However, the great tragedy
for Mrs Thatcher was one that befalls many leaders who stay long in
office: she became surrounded by sycophants who praised her
extravagantly—<I>[</I><I>Laughter.</I><I>]</I> We have heard a
great deal of that today, and much of what has been said is entirely
true, but there has also been a huge amount of hyperbole. When she was
in charge, what followed was hubris, and hubris was followed by
nemesis.</hs_Para>

way in which Mrs Thatcher treated heavy industry in this country
involved pursing a mission to discipline the industries and to make
them profitable, but she did not know when to stop. I am thinking
particularly of the industry that was the backbone of my city of
Newport, the steel industry, which is now a pale shadow of its former
self. I am afraid that she did not fight for heavy industry in the same
way that she fought for the farming industry or for the financial
industry, and that had terrible results. Many of the people in my
constituency who had devoted their lives to the steel industry had
special skills. They defined themselves as steelworkers, but suddenly
their skills were redundant. Those people were no longer important;
they were robbed of that scrap of dignity around which we all need to
build our lives. She went too far, and we all know the
result.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041013000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041013000027"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:23:38"></hs_TimeCode>There

people here as great virtues. Her role was to alter the appearance and
persona of England—rather than Wales or Scotland —in the
world, but there has been a cost to that. The cost of punching above
our weight militarily is that we spend beyond our interests and we die

should be talking about Mrs Thatcher, but we should also mention Lance
Corporal Jamie Webb of 1st Battalion the Mercian Regiment. He
was 24, and he died on 25 March. He was repatriated to this
country last Thursday. I do not know whether anyone saw any publicity
about that, or whether any attention was paid to the event. He was the
441st of our soldiers to die in the Afghan war.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:25:12"></hs_TimeCode>I have visited
Brize Norton and seen the sensitively conceived arrangements there. I
cannot think of any way in which they could bring greater comfort to
the bereaved families of those who have fallen in the name of this

place has been designed to avoid drawing attention to these tragedies.

with that of Margaret Thatcher, we should remember the names of the 441

county of Lincolnshire. Given that she also had the same birthday as my

followed her career with greater than usual interest once she entered
the Heath Cabinet. As has already been mentioned, she set many examples
to follow. She set an example to young people by first standing for
Parliament at the age of 24, and to people who do not succeed the first
time, in that it took three goes before she got here. She then became
her party’s leader before she was
50<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:27:37"></hs_TimeCode>. I remember
hearing the news of her election as leader, and of Ted Heath’s
defeat, when I was standing at the railway station in Bruges during my
year as a postgraduate student at the College of Europe. It was clear
that that was a significant moment in British political history. It
also caused a bit of a dispute in our family. My dad was not keen, but
my mum was more admiring.</hs_Para>

public life and politics. Let us check the figures. Before she was
elected, there had been no general election with more than 200 female
candidates, or more than 30 elected women MPs. In the general election
of 1992, when she stood down, there were 571 female
candidates, and 60 women were elected to this place. The numbers have
risen significantly since then. She would not have argued that there
was a direct cause and effect, but I am sure that there was one, and

that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:28:38"></hs_TimeCode>. It was
also significant that, through her election, a scientist became a
British party leader and Prime Minister. Her forensic skills and

Thatcher winning the 1979 election was clearly another defining moment
in our history. I hope that colleagues on the Opposition Benches will
not try to airbrush the fact that, before that, this country had been
through a dire few years economically. It had not been a happy time. We
had had to go to the international community for financial rescue, the
lights had been going out in the early part of the decade, and we had
been working only three days a week. So it was not as though the 1970s
were halcyon days. She then delivered three election victories, two of
which had majorities of more than 100, always with 13 million or more
votes, and always with more than 42% of the electorate supporting her.

first came to this House when she was Prime Minister, in a by-election

House on 19 occasions between 1983 and her final debate in November
1990. I was able to thank her for supporting work on the Rose theatre,
which had been excavated—she did have an interest in culture and
the arts. On a few occasions, I had to have a strong go at her with
regard to London matters. There was a need to reform London government,
but abolishing the Greater London council was absolutely not the way to
go. There was a need to mobilise the docklands and urban areas for
regeneration, but having no democratic participation was not the way to
go. Then there were other issues that were good ideas in part, but
often left some things worse off than before. Giving people the right
to buy their own council homes was popular and in many ways a good
idea, but not giving councils the power to decide whether they wanted
to use that power was wrong. Not to make the discounts reflect
accurately the length of time someone had been in a home was
inappropriate. Not guaranteeing that all the moneys went back to
councils was extremely unhelpful, and is one cause of the shortage of
social and affordable housing today.</hs_Para>

decimated much of manufacturing industry, not just in our coal mines

did successfully, to bring down the inflation rate from 13% in 1979 to
5% or less in five of the next 10 years. However, presiding
over unemployment going up from 4% to more than 9% was not a price
worth paying and it had serious, adverse consequences. Although
pensioners were better off in terms of the amount of money they had in

would certainly be the case that for most of my youth Margaret Thatcher
was not somebody I admired, and there were occasions when I actually
felt quite scared by much of what she said and what her Government
seemed to do. Some 25 or 30 years later, I feel slightly
different. My political generation, which includes the leaders of our
political parties, coincides with a period in politics of 24-hour
media, presentation, soundbite, spin and polling. All of us in this
House have met politicians who seem to not really to know their own
mind. We have met politicians who say one thing one minute and then,
when they have met someone else, seem to say the last thing they heard.
Some of us have even met party leaders like that. In that context, I
have tremendous respect for someone with conviction and courage,
someone who is willing to stand their ground and who is clear on their
values. At this time in our history, when things are so hard and there
is so much deep concern about our political class, we could do with

the second part of my youth I spent seven years in Peterborough. There,
I came across a different kind of working class attitude to Margaret
Thatcher. These were people who had left London and gone to
a new town. They were making their way and wanted
to forge ahead. They were enjoying holidays and owning their homes for
the first time. I would go around to their small houses and on their
coffee tables they would have the “Tell Sid” brochure, so
keen were they to take part in the experiment of buying shares in
British Gas. I have to say that my mum got one

a former miner and trade union leader and as the Member for a
constituency whose history was built on the hard work of ordinary men

for people in such constituencies because of policies promoted by
Margaret Thatcher. She came to power promising to bring harmony where
there was discord. I can safely say that in mining communities up and
down the country she brought the opposite. Most mining areas were
stable, secure and safe communities where we worked hard and played
hard. We did not complain about the difficult conditions in which we
worked. All we asked for was the chance to carry on doing that
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041013000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041013000054">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:44:22"></hs_TimeCode>
had built communities over decades, in some cases over centuries, and
they had stood the test of time. We built sports centres, swimming
pools and cricket and football clubs. We built libraries and developed
brass bands, and we ran art classes that gained international fame.
That was part and parcel of our culture, but none of it seemed to
matter to Margaret Thatcher. She believed that we were no longer any
use to the nation because we were deemed
“uneconomic”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041013000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041013000055">O<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:44:51"></hs_TimeCode>n
what basis was that case made? I believe that the main reason why the
United Kingdom coal industry was classed as uneconomic was that we
insisted on running safe coal mines, unlike those in the rest of the
world. Our history was longer than that of other coal industries. It
was littered with numerous examples of avoidable deaths, and we as a
country agreed to invest in the best quality equipment in the world and
in training people to produce coal as safely as possible. One of the
great disgraces in this country is that we import more than 50 million
tonnes of coal a year from countries where men are killed in their
thousands, yet we closed down an industry that was the safest and most
technically advanced in the world. There is still blood on the coal
that is burned in British power stations, but it is American blood,
Russian blood, Chinese blood or Colombian blood, so that is okay. Well,
it should not be okay. As a country, we have millions of
tons of coal beneath our
feet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T18:45:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041013000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041013000056">The
other area where the so-called economic justification falls down was in
the failure of Margaret Thatcher and her Governments to take into
account the social cost in communities such as mine, where there was no
alternative employment for people who were losing their jobs, and
particularly for their children. The village where I lived had seen
coal mining for almost two centuries. In a matter of months after
closure, we were gripped by a wave of petty crime—burglary and
car crime—mostly related to drugs. We have never recovered from
it. When someone wakes in the middle of the night and goes downstairs
because their home is being burgled, and finds out the next day that it
was the son of one of their best friends, it puts into perspective a
community that was built on reliance and taking care of each other.

was compounded by the crass decision in 1988 to sell off houses owned
by the National Coal Board to private landlords. They brought in
people from outside the area who had no respect for the
community or for the houses they were given. Twenty years later, houses
that were sold to private landlords for £4,000 were bought back
by the council for £60,000 of public money, only for them to be
pulled down because of the failure of the policy agreed as part and

of the responses to the news of Mrs Thatcher’s death, but the

colours were warned of the impact of the policy. We have seen the
reaction of people whose frustration is heartfelt. They have lost their
sense of place in society. They are being made to feel worthless. They
are being cast aside like a pair of worn-out pit boots. They have seen
their community fall apart and their children’s opportunities

today’s debate those people may never be listened to again, and
Mrs Thatcher’s lack of empathy, her intransigence, her failure

is uncharacteristic of miners and their communities. Her accusation

Mrs Thatcher was the inspiration for our going into politics in the

conviction that even the toughest task, including Britain’s

state had lost sight of its essential role of protecting our freedoms,
that it was encroaching on them and that it had to be rolled back.
Above all, there 
<?notus-xml column=1674?>was her patriotism—she wanted to restore pride in our country and

first meaningful encounter with Margaret Thatcher took place at 7.15 am
in a windowless back room in Conservative central office just before a

central office for only a few months, I was unnerved to find myself
placed opposite her. She had, it seemed, read all the extensive
briefing that we had prepared for her. She fixed me with a stare. Her
first question identified an apparent contradiction in the briefing.
Before I had time to admit that I did not know the answer, Geoffrey

Thatcher was kind enough to add me to a lunch party at Chequers after

Thatcher sporadically over the following few years. I was at the
Treasury, with a ringside seat for the Thatcher-Lawson row, the rights
and wrongs of which—and there were both—are for another
day. More generally, I had a chance to observe several of her
well-known traits. At the heart of her approach was her instinctive
understanding that the restoration of prosperity depended on
supply-side reform: breaking down the entrenched privileges—of
the professions as much as of the trade unions; simplifying and
reducing taxes; cutting back the tangle of regulation; and enhancing
individual opportunity and aspiration. She wanted to break with the
consensus of an over-mighty state and a dependent
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041013000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041013000066">Some
have been arguing recently that Mrs Thatcher’s reforms are
responsible for the failings of the banks today. I doubt that. Whatever
the merits of the prudential regulation that came with the big bang in
the ’80s, those rules were no longer in place when the crisis
broke five years ago; they had been replaced by another set of rules
put there in the 1990s in both the US and the UK. In any case, the
notion that Mrs Thatcher, who cared most of all about the consumer and
the taxpayer, would be an apologist for the banks, is implausible. She
would have found the abuse of market power by some bank leaderships for
their own gain at the expense of the rest of us every bit as deplorable
as the behaviour of trade union
leaders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041013000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041013000067">Most
of Mrs Thatcher’s legacy on the supply side survives, although
her supply-side reforms were, to some degree, reversed by the last
Government. Perhaps I should take this opportunity to say that, in my
view, the importance of the supply side is still not yet fully
recognised by this Administration.</hs_Para>

said today that Mrs Thatcher’s judgment faltered at the end, and
there was perhaps a touch of that hubris that always lurks in
No.10’s bunker after a long stay. The pain of her reforms still
lingers. Over the longer view, none of that, I think, will detract from
her legacy. What will linger in the memory is the single most
extraordinary achievement of any leader in the post-war era—that
of turning a failing country and a basket-case economy into a country
that had recovered its self-respect and had a

Davies</B> (Swansea West) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I
speak as one who was a 14-year-old schoolboy in south Wales when
Margaret Thatcher became party leader and as a
representative of the Swansea West constituency. Mrs
Thatcher was obviously a person of steely determination and focus who
cared not about the ebb and flow of opinion or focus groups, but about
her strategic vision to deliver change, and that is good. However, she
should be judged on her own terms—on whether she did deliver
harmony where there was discord and hope where there was despair.
Certainly in south Wales, she failed on those two counts. On whether
she delivered a better Britain, she did for some and did not for
others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041020000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041020000002">Her
leadership was born in the economic and political trauma of the 1970s.
Inflation peaked at 25% thanks to oil price increases, the
miners’ strike got rid of Ted Heath and then the Labour
Government were held together by a Lib-Lab pact that tried to bring
down inflation through pay relationships with the trade unions; it had
some success approaching 1978.</hs_Para>

my predecessor Alan Williams, a former Father of the House, Callaghan
said, “I think we can have another round of pay
restraint—the unions won’t want Margaret Thatcher as the
new Prime Minister.” How wrong he was. We had the coldest winter
for 16 years, strikes lasted until February 1979 and an
election was called after a vote of no confidence. Saatchi’s
then brought forward “Labour isn’t working” and
delivered Margaret Thatcher. That was a cruel irony, because
unemployment went up from 1.5 million to 3.2 million between 1979 and
1983. That was the human cost of bringing inflation down by 4%. That
certainly did not deliver harmony at all.</hs_Para>

was deeply unpopular then. The Labour left was split and the SDP broke
away in 1981. In 1983, the SDP-Liberal Alliance got 25% of the vote to
Labour’s 28%. Had it not been for that and the Falklands war,
Mrs Thatcher might not have won in 1983. When she did, her first focus
was to settle scores with the miners who had brought down Ted Heath.
She built the coal stocks up in the winters of ’83 and
’84 and announced that there would be closures and that the
National Coal Board would be privatised and sold off. Scargill, of
course, fell into the bear trap. He did not hold a vote, there was a
12-month strike—a third of the pits were still
working—and a great mining industry was destroyed. As has
already been described, we are currently consuming 50 million tonnes of
coal a year. but there is no coal industry. Near my constituency, there
is the Tower colliery, a co-operative through which the miners bought
their own mine, and it operated successfully for 10 years.
But communities have been left on their own in despair without support.
That is the politics not of hope but of fear, as Nye Bevan put
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041020000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041020000005">Economic
Thatcherism is a matter not just of using unemployment to keep down
wages and unions, but of mass privatisation. Crucially, the proceeds of
that privatisation—the £70 billion, alongside the
£80 billion from oil—were not used as they should have
been: to renew our industrial infrastructure, our hospitals, our
transport and our schools. The legacy was one of squandering instead:
we ended up in a situation where money was being used to keep people on
the dole and to  
<?notus-xml column=1676?>provide tax breaks. We ended up with an unmanaged oil system where high
exchange rates meant that manufacturing was declining much faster than
it should have
been.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041020000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041020000006">Ultimately,
Mrs Thatcher got re-elected through the Lawson bubble that burst. In
the final chapter, while the rich were getting richer, she
wanted the poor and the rich to pay the same tax for local services:
the poll tax. As we saw the grey smoke emerge from the violent protests
in London, the grey suits went round Lady Thatcher and wanted to elect
a grey leader—John Major, who, of course, managed to get in.
Then, naturally, everything broke down and afterwards we got a new
Government who reinvested the proceeds of growth in new schools,
hospitals and opportunity. I fear that some of Thatcher’s legacy
will involve going back and claiming that everything she did was right.
What she did not do, however, was to deliver what she should have
delivered—harmony and unity, a future that works and a future
that cares, rather than a divided nation. I very much hope that we will
not continue to press along the road of division and austerity, but

respect. Even if not popular, a politician can still be respected, and
Margaret Thatcher was one of those politicians. She was a Marmite
politician: people either loved her or hated her, but she was
universally respected, even among her political foes, because she knew
what she believed in, she stood up for it and she delivered it to

country liberated the Falklands and encouraged the freedom of the
peoples of eastern Europe. Let it be said, too, that she played a key
role in the development of Britain’s role in Europe and the
single market. The young Margaret Thatcher was a good European. We
should acknowledge too, if not to celebrate it on the Labour Benches,
that Mrs Thatcher won three consecutive general elections. There were

was born and brought up in a largely mining community—Cefn
Cribwr, near Bridgend. Both my grandfathers were miners and both knew
from first-hand experience how difficult and dangerous coal mining was.
Like so many of my generation in south Wales, the miners’ strike
of 1984-85 left an indelible mark on me. Let me be clear: the tactics
of Arthur Scargill were wrong and played into the hands of the
Government; but it was wrong, too, that the Government gave the
impression of relishing the opportunity to mobilise the
state against working people who were trying to defend their jobs,
their families and their communities. In our country, no opponents
should ever be described as “the enemy within”.</hs_Para>

long year of the miners’ strike, there was undoubtedly real
hardship. In my own village, we organised a support group and raised
hundreds of pounds to help miners’ families. The same happened
throughout south Wales. If the hardship of the strike was bad, what
happened afterwards was truly awful. Within months of the end of the
strike, nearly all the remaining collieries in south Wales were closed.
Nowhere was worse hit than the Rhymney valley, the greater part of
which I now have the privilege to represent. Two of the biggest
collieries in south Wales were within the Rhymney valley—Bedwas
and Penallta. Each employed more than 600 men. Bedwas was closed
literally weeks after the strike and Penallta followed suit a couple of
years
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041020000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041020000022">Those
closures were body blows to the valley. Closing the collieries was bad,
but what made things worse was the absence of any real attempt to
provide alternative employment or even training for those made
unemployed. There was, it is true, a much heralded “valleys
initiative” but that, like so many other Government initiatives
of the time, was all hype and little substance. In the aftermath of the
miners’ strike, unemployment rocketed, and so did economic
inactivity.</hs_Para>

the brief time remaining, I want to say a few words about foreign
policy. Mrs Thatcher was absolutely right to sign the Single European
Act. She was absolutely right to be in favour of enlargement of the
European Union. The consequences of those policies have influenced the
politics of this country ever since. That is why we have free movement
of people in the European Union. That is why we have the current debate
about immigration policy. A lot of that is to do with economic
decisions taken at that time. It is well worth our thinking through the
consequences for the

other foreign policy issues Mrs Thatcher was wrong. We have
heard about South Africa and her attitude to Nelson Mandela, and I am
very pleased that Nelson Mandela is still with us today, in this world,
and I hope he carries on living for a decent period of time, so that he
is able to understand more about the changes that have taken place in
this country since the days of Margaret Thatcher, because one thing she
did was to cut the overseas development budget. It went down
to 0.26% of GDP, yet this coalition—I praise them for
it—have kept to Labour’s pledge of funding at 0.7% of
GDP, which shows that what is being done in the world today is very
different from what she did in

other thing that Mrs Thatcher got wrong was her attitude to the
unification of Germany. She was vehemently against it, but as a result
of that unification, and at great cost to the Germans in the west, we
have seen the peaceful transformation of central and eastern Europe, as
well as the enlargement of the European Union and the end of communism
in our continent. Those fantastic achievements could not have been
achieved without the support of Margaret Thatcher but, above all, the
man responsible was Mikhail Gorbachev, whom she recognised as a man she
could do business with. As we heard, she should be praised for that,
because she convinced Reagan, although she sometimes tried to rein
Reagan back when she was wrong to do so, as at the Reykjavik
negotiation, where he was ahead of his time and ahead of the world
today in aspiring to a world without nuclear
weapons.</hs_Para>

Her sister then also settled in north Essex and I was delighted to make

Ministers, which had wild interruptions from Ian Paisley senior, as we
have come to know him, and the overtures she made to Mikhail Gorbachev.
I was in Berlin, attending a European Parliament Committee on Legal
Affairs meeting, on the day the wall fell, and that will be one of my
lifelong memories. That presaged the move for cities such as Warsaw,
Prague and Budapest to join the European Union. I am delighted that it

of Newcastle, although this was in a council flat rather than a
grocer’s. Just as she grew up always knowing that she wanted to
be a politician, I grew up always knowing that I wanted to be an
engineer. I grew up in a city and a region that valued
engineering—making and building things. It was the birthplace of
the railways, and it was the powerhouse of the country, with the coal
beneath our feet, the steelyards and the great ships being launched
from Wallsend and
Sunderland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:29:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041020000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041020000050">When
I was accepted to study engineering at Imperial college it was the
proudest day of my life—until my election of course. So hon.
Members can imagine how my heart sank when the Prime Minister of our
country said, not long after, that engineering and manufacturing were
the past, that the future was services and that the world would be our
workshop while we would keep our hands clean. I had no desire to keep
my hands clean. I had already seen what that policy was
doing to the north -east: the unemployment; the communities
devastated; and the lives of men and women robbed of meaning and pride.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:29:26"></hs_TimeCode> statistics
speak for themselves: between 1979 and 1987, the level of employment in
the north fell by 1.3 million; 97 mines had been closed by
1992; Sunderland, the largest shipbuilding town in the world, no longer
built ships; and Consett had lost the industry that had been a part of
its fabric and identity for more than 140 years.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:29:26"></hs_TimeCode> ask
Conservative Members to contrast the huge bail-out that a Labour
Government offered the financial services sector to protect
jobs and investment with the brutal, bone-crushing and soul-destroying
destruction that Margaret Thatcher’s Government offered the
shipbuilding, steel and mining industries, losing those very skills
which we now need so very much.</hs_Para>

but it is the Government’s job to protect communities from the
impact of change. That change could have been managed; there could have
been a transition and that could have been invested in. There was
another way, and Nissan, which has been mentioned, provides an example
of that. It is a great private sector success story that has been
enabled by the support and investment of central Government, local
authorities and the unions. The 2008 intervention by the previous
Government through the car scrappage scheme and bringing forward
training enabled Nissan to go through a difficult period and showed
that intelligent active government is possible.</hs_Para>

those of us who are old enough to have been politically active in the

four years old when Soviet deployment of deadly SS-20 missiles began in
1977. At the same time, here at home, Labour MPs, including a sitting
Cabinet Minister, were being deselected in their constituencies by
Marxist and militant infiltrators. I am pleased that

will add another short list that others could undoubtedly extend.
Margaret Thatcher gave the unions back to their members by making
postal ballots for trade union elections compulsory. She freed the
Falklands and, indirectly, caused the downfall of dictatorship in 
<?notus-xml column=1686?>Argentina—something that President Kirchner would do well to
remember. She secured the future of Britain’s Trident nuclear
deterrent, as I trust my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and the
Leader of the Opposition will continue to do, despite the blandishments
of the absent Liberal Democrats. She insisted on the deployment of NATO
cruise missiles, without which the hard-line grip on the Kremlin would
undoubtedly have lasted longer. She worked with Presidents Reagan and
Gorbachev to secure the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty of
1987, which eliminated cruise missiles, the Pershing missiles and the
Soviet SS-20s, paving the way for what happened two years
later.</hs_Para>

would like, if I may, to focus on one accusation levelled against her
both by Opposition Members in this debate and by the media more
generally, which is that she was a divisive figure. If those who levy

am honoured to take part in this tribute debate—we have heard
some great speeches today—but there is a danger that we will
forget just how bad the economic situation was in the 1960s and 1970s,
as well as what she had to tackle and to deal with to bring this
country round. We forget that for the best part of two decades
successive Governments had pursued inflationary policies to try to gain
full employment or something near to it. The unions had become
all-powerful and they could not be tamed, with successive wild-cat
strikes. All sorts of economic chaos resulted. We had Chancellors going
to the IMF cap in hand, the three-day week, the

I can add anything of value to this debate, looking at the age profile
of many of my colleagues, it is that having lived through the 1970s I
can testify to what it was like. It was absolutely
dire—[<SmallCaps>Hon. Members:</SmallCaps> “It was
horrible.”] As my colleagues say, it was horrible. The
atmosphere was full of pessimism. There was no hope and no
aspiration. We were the sick man of Europe. She, through her policies,
her conviction and her belief in aspiration, opportunity, kicking back
Government controls and reducing Government spending, brought this
country around. If testimony is required to how successful she was, we
need only to look at the fact that very few of her major
policies—I can hardly think of any—were reversed by the
Governments who succeeded hers. Perhaps her greatest legacy is that she
converted the Labour party from a party that was doing no good for this
country, in the sense that it was pursuing extreme left-wing policies,
and dragged it kicking and screaming to the centre of the political
landscape.</hs_Para>

provided leadership to a cause and to a country. She led the battle of

sector and free enterprise and the innovation that
comes with them; the idea that tax rates of 83% and 98%
stifle initiative—a battle she won so convincingly that no
subsequent Government have dared even to contemplate raising rates to
such levels; and the idea that the money supply was key to controlling
inflation, which was again a battle that she won so
convincingly that it was a Labour Government who established
the Monetary Policy Committee. She fought the battle of
ideas with courage and, in doing so, inspired a

just 54% in 1979 to more than 80% by 1991 and in the proportion of
owner-occupied housing rising from 55% to 66% by 1990. She truly was a
transformational leader—a leader who changed this nation for the

<?notus-xml column=1690?>beating very, very strongly, and it was one of the most fascinating
experiences of my life. Afterwards, when photographs of us were taken,
I remember towering over her because of my height of 6 feet 9 inches,

somebody of Polish origin, I can say that Margaret Thatcher’s
visit to the shipyards at Gdansk in 1988 was transformational and gave
the people of Poland great hope that there was the possibility of
defeating communism. Nobody did more to give the people of eastern
Europe that tremendous hope that a better day would come. I remember
visiting my beloved grandfather who was a great Polish patriot. Late at
night, we listened to the BBC World Service—of course, it was
illegal to do so —very quietly and with the curtains drawn so
that nobody would hear us. I remember tears swelling in my

the election going up lamp posts putting up “Vote
Conservative” signs because I was so tall the socialists could
not pull them down. I was so disheartened because I felt that Neil
Kinnock was so left-wing that if that man got into office he would
destroy everything that my heroine had built up for this

constituency of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T19:57:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell). I said to her at the time
that I was a bit concerned about my desire to be a Member of
Parliament. I left school aged 15 and did not have many qualifications,
but I had a desire to work and help people. She said to me, “If
you have the desire to do it and want to work and help people, then do
it.” She inspired me to be here today 
<?notus-xml column=1691?>and, like many Members from across the House, I can honestly say that I
would not necessarily be here today if it were not for Margaret
Thatcher. She will always have my gratitude for that.</hs_Para>

other occasions, when Margaret Thatcher walked into a room people knew
that it was somebody special and that they were in the presence of a
figure who would go down in history. If we put the clock forward 100
years, I am sure that people will still remember Winston Churchill,
Margaret Thatcher, Mr Attlee, perhaps even Mr Blair,

briefly to pay tribute to and thank Margaret Thatcher for saving our
country and for inspiring me, and many thousands of people from
ordinary working-class backgrounds in this country, to achieve and to
get on in life. Her understanding of what working-class aspirational
people wanted was a great strength, and like Clement Attlee she was a
Prime Minister dedicated to the cause of working-class aspiration. Some
try to propagate the myth that Mrs Thatcher was simply on the side of
the wealthy, which is nonsense. She did not win three
elections by appealing only to the wealthy or to the south of the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041023000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041023000033">I
recall as a schoolboy at the end of the 1970s the national decline, the
endless strikes, the lights going off, and the rubbish not being
collected. Ordinary people were simply fed up with how our once proud
country had been turned into a basket case. Margaret Thatcher turned
our country around and saved it. She wanted to improve ordinary
people’s lives by giving them more personal freedom and
encouraging them to stand on their own two feet. She certainly did that
for me. I was a young person from a working-class background, the
grandson of coal miners. All of a sudden, there was a national figure
and a leader of our country who made it clear that people can achieve
success, whatever their background or walk of life. That was a
politician I could relate to. She is the reason why I am standing in
this Chamber
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041023000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0002.htm#13041023000034">I

hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs Laing), on the role Lady
Thatcher played in inspiring so many women in

Thatcher was always absolutely remarkable in her
steadfastness and support for women in the Conservative party,
but—this comes better from a Conservative woman MP—she
was also always absolutely immaculately dressed. She always looked
fantastic. Has it not been wonderful over the past few days watching
those old news reels and seeing that, on every occasion she faced as
the first female leader in the western world, she always
wore exactly the right thing? Whether she was in a tank in Germany or
dancing with a former movie star—Ronald Reagan—she always
looked impeccable. That held true even very recently, when
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T20:02:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

is only right that we pay tribute to Lady Thatcher’s personal
assistant, Cynthia Crawford, who lives in Worcestershire, and who made

secret about Lady Thatcher’s later years is that, as a result of
that friendship, she came frequently to Worcestershire. She spent quiet
retreats and holidays at the cottage in the woods in Malvern, where she
found peace and beauty in the country. She grew to love the Malvern
hills—she was inspired by Elgar, who was born there. It gives me
and the people of West Worcestershire great satisfaction to know that
she enjoyed the beauty of the great constituency that I have the

the best possible chance in life. A good education and
stability were important to my mum. Balancing working shifts and doing
her own child care was always a huge challenge. One of Margaret
Thatcher’s key policies provided my mother with a huge lifeline.
I refer, of course, to the assisted places scheme, for this policy had
a huge benefit in my life. People from my background in Scotland did
not go to private school, nor did they go to university, and the scheme

would like to make three brief personal points about how Baroness
Thatcher touched my life and why so many loved her and will miss her.
First, Lady Thatcher was the embodiment of aspiration. She studied
science when few women were doing so. She was one of only 25
women to be elected in 1959, when only 4% of MPs were women; now, there
are 146, or 22%. Lady Thatcher was someone who absolutely believed in
aspiring to the highest levels, and she proved that it could be done
and that nothing was
impossible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T20:39:18"></hs_TimeCode>. My
parents always brought up my sisters and me to believe that we should
aim high, work hard, try our very best, give any task 100%, and fulfil
our potential. Baroness Thatcher was the epitome of this—that it
does not matter who you are, where you come from, what your background
is or what your gender is. You can absolutely succeed and achieve your
goals and dreams, and it is what you deliver and do right now that
counts in
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T20:39:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041026000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0003.htm#13041026000003">Secondly,

a child of the Thatcher era and was in school and university when Lady
Thatcher was Prime Minister. I did not think it was strange or unusual
to have a female Prime Minister. It felt natural. After all, we also
had a female monarch. Lady Thatcher made me believe that anything was
possible. If a woman could be Prime Minister, surely other women, too,

immigrants, I was fully aware of the disastrous state this country was
in. Our economy, society and politics lay crippled after decades of
decline. We had become the sick man of Europe and we were seen as weak
across the world. Hope, aspiration and entrepreneurship were being
suppressed by the instruments of the state—militant trade unions
and vested interests that stood opposed to change and
reform<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T20:59:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041028000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0003.htm#13041028000004">Margaret

Thatcher was determined to smash the obstacles that held people back.
She was a champion of opportunity, battling against the forces of
privilege and the establishment. In my view, she was the ultimate
warrior for the working class and for aspiration. She knew
how to unlock Britain’s strength to empower individuals and
businesses. She laid the foundations for council tenants to buy their
homes, lowered and simplified taxes, reduced the deficit,
secured the rebate from Europe and brought democracy to the trade union
movement. She worked alongside the great Presidents Reagan and

always said that she might not look like us, but she absolutely thought
like us. What he meant was that she shared and empathised with our
values, experiences and ethos. She faced prejudice not because of her
race but because of her gender. As the Prime Minister said earlier, in
his moving tribute, she understood what it took to break through the

Prime Minister and the Government are absolutely right to push forward

original architect of the modern British aspiration nation. She
believed in people working hard and being rewarded for it. She believed
in education as a great leveller. She believed in helping
entrepreneurs, business and the private sector to create the wealth to
pay for our public services. She believed in respect for the rule of

come to countries of the former Soviet bloc. In Mirfield, there is no
suggestion that IRA prisoners should have had political status, and in
Denby Dale they do not say that the trade union legislation should be
repealed so that the unions become so powerful that it is possible to
turn up for the night shift with a sleeping bag and expect to get paid.

a man in Emley who was kind enough to tell me I seemed a nice lad, but
then explained that as an ex-miner he could not vote Tory. Of course,
it is the latter area—industrial policy—where controversy
might lie. In the early 1980s, when I had had so many problems with my
Austin Metro that they sent a man from Longbridge to look at it, he
shrugged his shoulders and said it was a Friday car—built at the
end of the week when people were in a hurry to be away. That was not
Margaret Thatcher’s fault. They did not have Freitag cars at VW,

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T21:19:26"></hs_TimeCode> lived in
Liverpool when the riots happened. They did not affect my neighbourhood
but they affected school friends, one of whom was supposed to come to
stay with us to get away from the horrendous things that were
happening. I also remember Derek Hatton, who said the most despicable
thing yesterday. What I remember of him is that he destroyed my city.
Militant Labour was the employer involved, and my parents, both
teachers, were among the 30,000 who received their redundancy notices
overnight. I have been hearing about how people were cast aside, but
militant Labour tossed aside the clerk, the cleaner and the street
sweeper, as well as the teacher. That is when I woke up and realised
that politics mattered, and the following year I got involved in a
by-election. Admittedly,

constituency I now represent perhaps benefited from some of the issues
arising from the militancy of the dockers’ strike in Liverpool.
Similar things happened elsewhere. Felixstowe grew as a port during
that time. When Mrs Thatcher came to Felixstowe in 1986 to speak at the
Conservative central council she referred to the modern industrial
relations that the good trade unions had with their employers at the
port of Felixstowe. We see the same thing now in much of our
manufacturing industry, where some of the unions are working well.
However, one thing she did was to ensure that it was the democratically
elected Government who ran the country, bringing to an end to the
closed shop, the “all out” and the flying pickets that
crippled industry at the time.</hs_Para>

do not believe that Margaret Thatcher hated the state. What she hated
was the state telling the people what they should want. She wanted the
state to serve the people and put their needs first. She trusted people
to choose. Her very first speech was about the private Member’s
Bill in which she opened up council meetings to the press and the
public; she made sure that happened. She also did things such as
putting parents on school governing bodies so that they were involved
in the direction of the schools. She had backed the police, of course,
but she had recognised that there was trouble there and that there was
a need to reinstate trust, so in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984 she introduced the tape recording of evidence sessions. She
started to bring those kinds of reforms in where they were

Shelbrooke</B> (Elmet and Rothwell) (Con):</Member> Two people in the
political world had the biggest influence on me. The one who made me a
centre-right politician was Ronald Reagan—I will talk about that
another time—but Margaret Thatcher did three important things to
me and formed who I am, as a child of the ’80s. First, she did
not just abolish the glass ceiling that had been there from time
immemorial—she smashed it to smithereens. That is why I, like a
great number of my hon. Friends, stand here as a child of a
comprehensive school; our parents had very normal jobs and we did not
go to a fee-paying school. I ended up with an engineering degree and I
am now a Conservative Member of Parliament, and my sister is an
orthopaedic surgeon. We went through that comprehensive school system,
and Margaret Thatcher said to us, “If you work hard, there is no
limit to what you can achieve.”
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T21:20:00"></hs_TimeCode>We took that on.
It was about a work ethic.</hs_Para>

are five comprehensive schools in my constituency, and when I visit
them I tell the children, “I went to a comprehensive school,
too, and nothing can stop you achieving whatever you want.”
Margaret Thatcher did for me what the tabloid press have done for
children these days, who think that if they go on “The X
Factor” they will become a pop star. She made us realise that if
we worked hard we would achieve our dreams and that it was not just
about fame and
fortune.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041028000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0003.htm#13041028000036">Conviction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T21:20:10"></hs_TimeCode>
was very important. It is about standing up for what we believe in,
rather than taking the path of least resistance. Political history
around the world is littered with leaders who took the path of least
resistance. Conviction politics is vital. I want to give a live example
for people out there today: the privatisation of British Telecom, which
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T21:20:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Aldershot (Sir Gerald Howarth) mentioned earlier. It is
not just that before privatisation people had to wait six months to get
a telephone line, or that they needed permission from British Telecom
to put an extension in their house. We look today, after the death of
Margaret Thatcher, at how advanced telecommunications have become in
our society.</hs_Para>

did not privatise British Telecom in the 1980s because she foresaw that
we would all be using Twitter, Facebook, the internet and e-mail and
have constant access to news; she did it because she knew that the
state could never do for those industries what commerce and people with
experience of running businesses could do for them. All those people
who have used Twitter and Facebook to make the most vile comments in

hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope), in an
excellent speech, said that he did not disagree with a single one of
Margaret Thatcher’s policies, except her decision not to stand
in the second round. I agree. I do not think that I disagree with
anything she did, but there is a lesson that I think we could learn on
something that was not done. I passionately believe that 
<?notus-xml column=1714?>she was absolutely right to tackle the union menace
that had crippled this country and made us the laughing stock of
Europe. When we look at the growth factors in western Europe and what
was happening in this country, we see that we were doomed. That
culminated in the miners’ strike. There were rights and wrongs,
but that is not a debate for today. However, I will say that it was
wrong that more was not done after those communities lost their
mines.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041028000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0003.htm#13041028000039">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T21:19:54"></hs_TimeCode>
think that a lesson has been learnt. Our current Prime Minister has
picked up on the idea of the big society and, by looking at what
happened in the 1980s as a whole, what it means to help whole
communities. Yes, they were the right decisions to make and the
convictions were right, but there are always consequences that must be
dealt with. He rightly describes himself as a one-nation Conservative,
and I agree. It is about managing for the whole country. However, I
believe that Margaret Thatcher’s intention was to do that. It
cannot be said that she was there only for the rich, because she
empowered the poorest people in society and, as has been said, she knew
that education is the great
leveller<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T21:23:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041028000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0003.htm#13041028000040">Conviction
is the hardest form of governance. It will never be popular,
but it is the only honourable way to govern. As the Prime Minister said
recently, he is here not to be popular, but to do what is right. We owe
Margaret Thatcher so much. She literally saved this country from
becoming, in the current context, probably worse than Greece, Spain and
Portugal are today. May she rest in peace; she certainly deserves
it.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13041028000091" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/debtext/130410-0003.htm#13041028000091"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T21:24:59"></hs_TimeCode>9<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T21:24:59"></hs_TimeCode>.24

remember the early days. Most anecdotes have been from when she
dominated the House of Commons, but I well remember that it was a
difficult time for her when she was first elected as leader of the
Conservative party. As a fresh-faced young student, I attended one of
her first speaking events after she had been elected as leader, at the
Federation of Conservative Students’ conference. At the time,
the FCS was dominated by a Heathite element and there was deep
suspicion about what Margaret Thatcher would do to the party and the
country if she became Prime Minister. She espoused firm principles and
a belief in free enterprise, sound money, strong defence, individual
responsibility and, above all, personal liberty. As she addressed that
conference, one could see the ripples of change among the young people
attending the conference, probably for the first time. She transformed
many of us so that we became clarion calls for change across our
campuses. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-10T21:25:47"></hs_TimeCode>
fought the battle for four years after she became leader and we got our
reward in the 1979 general election. We fought a war of ideas on
campuses and in universities and we won, with her support and her firm
view.</hs_Para>

anecdote that has not been told concerns the fact that when she was
first elected leader and went on that first speaking tour, a brief went
out from Conservative 
<?notus-xml column=1715?>central office that she was teetotal and abhorred
alcohol. As many Members will know, that was not the case. She attended
a meeting at a Conservative club in the north-west and, of course, the
briefing had not reached them. She had been around a series of
different events, and the chairman of the club said, “Mrs
Thatcher, would you like a drink—a whisky, perhaps?” The
person from Conservative central office shook, thinking that there
would be an explosion, and Mrs Thatcher said, “Thank goodness

squeals of horror as the first Budget was unveiled. Next week, we will
no doubt continue the rather anodyne debate about whether the top rate
of tax should be 45% or 40%. We should remember that in those days it
was 98%, and 68% on earned income. She abolished that penal taxation

to understand the interface of politics and economics. At the time,
Margaret Thatcher and the now noble Lord Lawson were involved in a
disagreement about shadowing the Deutschmark, and on that issue I
believe that Margaret Thatcher was simply right. Even at the time, it
seemed to me that it was just too good; we had had a consumer-led
recovery, but as a teenager in my naive way I thought it was getting
out of control. Nevertheless, I heard that there could not be a problem
because the pound was at the same level against the Deutschmark and we
had cut interest rates to keep it below three Deutschmarks. There was a
disagreement between the Chancellor and the Prime Minister that I think
was resolved terribly unfortunately for our country, but it was the

with Geoffrey Howe was about personality. On 25 June 1989,
Geoffrey Howe with the noble Lord Lawson said to Margaret Thatcher that
unless she set a timetable to join the exchange rate mechanism, they
would resign. She believed that Geoffrey Howe was behind that, and a
month later she removed him from his post as Foreign Secretary.
Eighteen months later she made a statement when she came back from the
Rome summit, which we recall for “No. No. No.”, and which
led to Geoffrey Howe’s resignation and his later speech that set
in train the events leading to Margaret Thatcher’s downfall.

answered Tony Benn when he said to her, “You now say this, but

short-term advantage by wrapping yourself in the flag? It was you who
took us into the ERM without consulting the British people, you who

Thatcher answered him and said that she would have used different
words. In essence, however, she agreed with him. There was a mea culpa.
On those issues, he had been right and she regretted the stance that
she had taken. She said those things while she was Prime Minister, and
I believe that it set in train the process that led to her fall.
However, she also inspired a new generation of politicians.
There is the question 
<?notus-xml column=1717?>whether we will ultimately be part of an ever-closer union in Europe or
again be an independent country. Margaret Thatcher at least kept open
that possibility by restoring our national strength, so that it could
once again be resolved in favour of
independence.</hs_Para>

Margaret Thatcher had a compass to steer by. A meeting with

it was a meeting at which she adduced all the evidence and arguments,
and applied her principles and convictions to them. She might express
her support for free enterprise, for instance. My hon. Friend the
Member for Chichester described her support for freedom and liberty
against an over-mighty state. She might express her support for
personal liberty, as distinct from the idea that all responsibilities
could be handed over to some society without a sense of the
responsibility of individuals, families and communities to step up and
do what needed to be done. My hon. Friend the Member for North

high wholesale gas prices observed in 2008 are a result of the oil
price spike when prices peaked at $146/bbl in July. Gas prices are
linked to oil prices due to the widespread use of oil-index gas supply
contracts in Europe, which feed through to the UK wholesale market. In
2009 the gas prices fell as demand contracted following the global
recession, and production from unconventional sources in the US also
increased the availability of LNG supplies, putting additional downward
pressure on prices. This glut of LNG has subsequently been eroded due
to increased demand for gas in Asia, putting upward pressure on UK
wholesale gas
prices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304106000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/text/130410w0001.htm#1304106000079">In
general, wholesale electricity prices have moved with gas prices over

UK has a competitive retail energy supply market and setting of retail

(MOD) supply chain, information about delivery targets for equipment
outside of the UK and north-west Europe is not readily available. For
the Afghanistan theatre of operations equipment is dispatched by land,
sea and air. All priority requests are required to be delivered by air
within nine days from the point of departure in the UK to the point of
arrival in theatre. In the majority of cases this timeline is achieved.
In order to mitigate against delays in journey times the MOD holds
sufficient stocks of equipment in Afghanistan to meet operational
demands.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304108000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/text/130410w0001.htm#1304108000035">Information

decrease in the number of businesses served with civil penalties can be
explained as follows: employers' increased awareness of the regime
together with improved guidance on the UK Border Agency website; and
providing clear advice on how to conduct document checks to verify a
person's right to work, which has contributed to an increase in
employer compliance. The Agency's work in summer 2012 under Operation
May apple targeted enforcement activity on overstayers, including
students whose leave had been curtailed. This activity drives up
compliance across the board. Robust debt recovery processes have been
implemented with employers becoming increasingly aware that where
penalties are not paid debt recovery enforcement action will commence
against
them.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13041015000009" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/text/130410w0002.htm#13041015000009">Immigration</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13041015000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/text/130410w0002.htm#13041015000088"><B><Member PimsId="4426" UID="13041015000441" xid="614" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/text/130410w0002.htm#13041015000441">Keith

Hoban:</Member></B> DWP Jobcentre Plus advisers focus on providing a
personalised, flexible service. This approach recognises that
individuals may have conditions or circumstances that require different
levels of support. They will discuss with the claimant how
significantly they are affected by their disability, in relation to
employment. They will also help the individual to agree job goals and
the best way forward into employment, which may include whichever
‘Get Britain Working’ measures are offered locally, or
referral to contracted programmes, such as the Work programme or other
non-contracted provision, if
appropriate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041016000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/text/130410w0002.htm#13041016000046">Anyone
who requires more specialist help, because of their disability, will be
able to see a disability employment adviser, who can identify suitable
job opportunities, while acting as an advocate for the individual in
approaches made to potential employers. The disability employment
adviser will also aim to identify work solutions, overcoming or
minimising any difficulties, relating to a claimant's disability in the
work place. If they are having difficulty in identifying work
solutions, they will seek help from a DWP work psychologist. They will
also be aware of appropriate local support organisations, where they
are
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041016000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/text/130410w0002.htm#13041016000047">Disability
employment advisers are also able to refer claimants to the Work

Webb:</Member></B> The following table shows the initial level of
discretionary housing payments allocated to local authorities in
London. The Government originally 
<?notus-xml column=1157?>allocated £5 million to the Discretionary Housing Payment scheme
towards the cost of foster carers. As legislation has now been amended
to cover the cost of allowing foster carers an additional room, if
appropriate, this £5 million will no longer be
required by local authorities to assist this group. Revised allocations
of discretionary housing payments to local authorities will be made
available
soon.</hs_Para><TableWrapper Columns="1" Size="8"><table tabstyle="nofoots"><tgroup cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="51*"></colspec><thead><row><entry colsep="0" rowsep="2"></entry><entry rowsep="2"><hs_TableHeading Justify="right"><I>£</I></hs_TableHeading></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colsep="0" rowsep="0"><hs_Para UID="13041016000053" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/text/130410w0002.htm#13041016000053">Barking

existing building in green belt to a dwelling should be assessed in the
light of all material considerations, including green belt policy in
the national planning policy framework. This says that reuse of
permanent, substantial buildings in green belt may not be inappropriate
if the development preserves the green belt’s openness and does
not conflict with the purposes of the designation. This is intended to
allow redundant and empty buildings to be brought back into productive
use, increasing rural housing for local people and promoting
regeneration. The Government recently announced at Budget its intention
to consult on allowing further flexibilities between use classes to
support change of use from certain agricultural and retail uses to
residential
use.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13041016000019" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/text/130410w0002.htm#13041016000019">Homelessness</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13041016000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/text/130410w0002.htm#13041016000198"><B><Member PimsId="2358" UID="13041016000426" xid="77" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/text/130410w0002.htm#13041016000426">Ms

The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons
for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more
offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed.
Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the
offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty
is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>3</Sup>
Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate
and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have
been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the
courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to
ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are
taken into account when those data are

going to court is not always the right answer. We estimate that the

available to courts to secure this basic right for vulnerable
defendants. There is no evidence to suggest that the available
measures, which include giving evidence by live link and, where
necessary, the assistance of an intermediary, fail to achieve that
objective. Courts have a responsibility to check throughout a case that
the defendant understands what is going on. Vulnerable defendants
should always be represented, as one of the criteria in the Interests
of Justice test is that the defendant may not otherwise be able to
understand the court proceedings. It is generally through the defence
that courts are alerted to the fact that a defendant may be vulnerable

school meals are not compulsory and there are many reasons why a family
may choose not to claim a free school meal to which they are entitled.
The fear of being stigmatised can prevent many children from taking a
free school meal. But we have made progress in addressing this. For
example, many schools now have cashless systems and other methods to
ensure that it is not obvious which pupils are receiving a free school
lunch. The Department for Education's eligibility checking system, used
by local authorities, has also made it much easier and quicker to check
anonymously which families are entitled to free school meals. National
free school meal take-up increased by 60,000 between 2010 and

The fear of being stigmatised can prevent children from taking a free
school meal, but we have made progress in addressing this. For example,
many schools now have cashless systems and other methods to ensure that
it is not obvious which pupils are receiving a free school lunch. The
Department for Education's eligibility checking system, used by local

available in line with an estimate of demand from schools for new
teachers. This includes using evidence as it becomes available of the
likely impact of Government policy such as curriculum and qualification
reform on that demand. The growth of school centred initial teacher

to plan locally for any requirement for new teachers as a result of the

Laws</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 25 March 2013]:</I> The new Troops
to Teachers (TtT) programme will encourage high quality, eligible
graduate service leavers to apply for School Direct (Salaried) places,
and receive additional personalised training. For graduate service
leavers preferring fee-paying routes, there will be an additional
bursary available to incentivise these routes. Troops to Teachers will
provide opportunities for service leavers without degrees, but with
some prior academic credits, to train as teachers during academic year
2013/14 and 2014/15. The opportunities offered under Troops to Teachers
will be linked to market need and jobs in schools, and will be open to
service leavers in England. Through Troops to Teachers there is
capacity to support over 1,000 places during 2013/14 and
2014/15.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041024000846" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130410/text/130410w0004.htm#13041024000846">Since
the Troops to Teachers policy was first announced, the Teaching Agency
reports that between March 2011 and March 2013 over 7,200 service
leavers have registered their interest in teaching. The numbers of
service leavers who have chosen to apply for existing initial teacher
training courses has also increased: 342 service leavers applied over
this period, with 139 accepted and currently training.</hs_Para>
