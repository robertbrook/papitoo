Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord
</B><B>Nash</B><B>):</B></Member> My Lords, bullying should not be
tolerated. Schools should take action to prevent bullying and protect
pupils. Alternative provision is provided if a pupil cannot remain in a
mainstream school. This enables pupils to receive education in
different settings with specialist support if necessary, including for
a return to a mainstream school. Some parents may none the less decide
to withdraw their child altogether from all state-funded education.
Local authorities may offer support to parents in those
circumstances.</hs_para>

</B><B>Brinton</B><B>:</B></Member> I thank the Minister for his
response. Given that the National Centre for Social Research report in
2011 estimated that 16,500 young people aged 11 to 15 are absent from
state schools where bullying is the main reason, does the Minister
agree that specialist education and psychological support
interventions, such as the very successful Red Balloon Learner Centres,
are the best way of helping these children back into mainstream
schooling? Can he also say how such interventions can be funded if it
is voluntary on local authorities’
behalf?</hs_para>

</B><B>Nash</B><B>:</B></Member> The noble Baroness’s pioneering
work in this field in Cambridgeshire is a model of best practice, and I
am familiar with Red Balloon’s work. I very much agree with her
that, for some severely bullied children, the type of intervention she
describes may well be the most appropriate provision to support a pupil
returning to mainstream education. However, that will not always be the
case. Severely bullied children are not a homogenous group and among
them will be some with a wide variety of specific needs and
requirements. Local authorities can commission appropriate provision
from a wide variety of providers and are funded to do
so.</hs_para>

Alton of </B><B>Liverpool</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, with the noble
Baroness’s Question concentrating our minds on a toxic problem
which is estimated to have led to at least 20 suicides each year,
should we not be thinking of more imaginative and radical ways of
co-ordinating our approach to bullying in schools? I commend to the
Minister particularly the work of theatre companies such as Ten Ten,
whose production I recently saw in a school setting and which, by
working with young people, imaginatively addressed this issue of
bullying. 
<?notus-xml column=522?>Does he agree that with one survey stating that 69% of UK children
reported being bullied, and now with the phenomenon of cyberbullying
and 31 million school days being lost each year through bullying, we
need to take this incredibly seriously?</hs_para>

</B><B>Nash</B><B>:</B></Member> I could not agree more. Suicide is a
tragedy whenever it occurs. I am not familiar with Ten Ten but I would
like to be; perhaps the noble Lord and I could discuss it later. We are
particularly focusing on cyberbullying. Our central thrust is to send a
strong message to all schools that bullying is not to be tolerated. We
have focused Ofsted much more on four specific categories of which
behaviour and well-being—including bullying—is one. We
have also recently funded four organisations with £4 million to
work with schools specifically on
bullying.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000011"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Geddes" PimsId="3402" UID="13051661000782" xid="1235" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000782"><B>Lord

that I have covered, including the Ofsted framework and the four
organisations we have funded—namely BeatBullying, the Diana
Award, Kidscape and the NCB—we are working with other innovative
provision. In my own school, for instance, we have a programme where,
if a child has been bullied and wishes to be out of school for a while,
there is a student centre where they can come back in on a temporary
basis and gradually engage again with classes until they have the
confidence to get back into school life. I am keen to spread this
practice elsewhere.</hs_para>

areas such as the BBC, as we have heard via the media. Given that
prevention is better than cure, as everybody has stressed, what
practical steps are being taken to ensure not only that playground or
classroom bullying is classified as absolutely unacceptable but that
every school is required to eliminate it? Will the Government publish a

achieved in some
areas?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000016"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Nash" PimsId="7004" UID="13051661000787" xid="2171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000787"><B>Lord

alternative provision providers. This Government have sent a very clear

to that in mainstream schools. There is no doubt that alternative
provision in this country is extremely erratic. I am delighted to see
that we have a number of alternative provision providers coming through
in the new free school applications, and I expect that a number of them
will be approved. A number of alternative provision providers are
converting to academies. We have some excellent alternative provision
providers. We have also asked Ofsted to look specifically at
alternative provision through a thematic inspection
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000019"><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Jones of Whitchurch" PimsId="5099" UID="13051661000790" xid="1945" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000790"><B>Baroness

the Minister accept that many severely bullied children are very bright
and can flourish educationally if they are given the right specialist
intervention? However, such intervention has to happen at an early
stage and all too often there is a gap between these children being
identified and their being brought back into proper educational
provision. The Minister has presented a picture of patchy provision
across the country and said that it is erratic. What is the department
doing to make sure that we have a complete picture of what is happening

educational provision are stepping up to the
mark?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000020"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Nash" PimsId="7004" UID="13051661000791" xid="2171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000791"><B>Lord

Baroness’s point about the patchy nature of the provision. That
is why we are encouraging more new providers to enter the system and
set some standards. It is also why we have asked Ofsted to focus
particularly on this area. Children who are excluded from school are
often very bright and very energetic and we have a duty to make sure
that they can be educated in the best way possible.</hs_para>

“no decision about me without me” and the freedom of
patient choice have been pivotal to the Government’s NHS
reforms? Does he not think it crazy that I, as a patient of a
dispensing doctor, can either ask my doctor for a prescription which I
can take to a pharmacist in the nearest town or have my prescription
dispensed by his staff, whereas my neighbour, who might live just
within that 1.6 kilometre boundary, is allowed to get his prescription
dispensed only in a pharmacy in the town? Does the Minister agree that
the reasons for this rule are now obsolete? It was created in 1911 when
there could have been corruption between doctors and patients, and that
possibility no longer exists because of the

least the interests of the patient. We therefore need a set of rules
which reflects those interests. Patients who live in a rural area can
be dispensed to by their GP if there is no pharmacy within 1.6
kilometres of where the patient lives, or within 1.6 kilometres of the
GP practice. Without these rules, it would rarely be viable for new
pharmacies to open to serve rural areas. That would deprive people
living in rural areas of the opportunity to benefit from the more
comprehensive health service that a combination of a GP practice and a
pharmacy can provide.</hs_para>

major obstacle for disabled patients. Many pharmacies, for example,
offer a free prescription

pharmacy collects the prescription from the surgery on behalf of the

whether the current arrangements are justifiable in 2013. Does the

of the balance that has to be struck here. A GP’s primary
purpose is to provide comprehensive medical care and treatment to his
or her patients. More than 90% of prescription items are dispensed by
pharmacies, which is what most patients expect. However, we must have
arrangements to enable patients who live in rural and more remote areas
to access medicines more easily. I think the noble Lord will understand
that the arrangement for some GPs to provide dispensing services has
always been the exception rather than the rule. I do not think there is
an appetite on anyone’s part among the professions to reopen
these
arrangements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000032"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Jolly" PimsId="5895" UID="13051661000804" xid="2109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000804">Baroness

cost, but as someone who lives in a rural area I am very glad of it,
because it saves me a 12-mile round trip. However, the cost of a
practice-based prescription will be apportioned to the CCG in two
parts: the actual cost of the medicine itself and disbursement costs.
Does my noble friend expect that the disbursement cost mechanism will
be looked at again in the light of GPs running CCGs, where, of course,
every penny will count towards the care of the

always be looked at very carefully to ensure that the right balance is
struck. It is open to commissioners to propose a change in the
arrangements. If a new pharmacy applies to open, and that could affect
GPs dispensing to patients in a rural area, we would fully expect there
to be consultation with patient groups and the public. There is a
mechanism to ensure that that process can take
place.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_16_PT_1/649DC2102F701EF4DF95788AC25D500995163161" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 May 2013">Thursday,

following up the PM’s speech with some detailed work under way
at present on precisely what our reform agenda should be. I will simply
set out that it includes changes in the EU budget. We have already made
some progress on that in the multiannual financial framework, but that
needs to continue. There will be a stronger role for national
Parliaments. The Lisbon treaty allows for that, and we are encouraging
our own Parliament and others to work more closely together. An
external trade agenda will include in some ways more European action;
the Prime Minister, after all, pursued that very thing in his
discussions with President Obama in Washington. There will be a
deepening of the single market, such as digital single market services.
Therefore there is a range of areas, including better regulation and

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the joint HMRC and UK Border Force
efforts to tackle tobacco smuggling were strengthened in 2011. This
included further investment of more than £25 million from the
Government’s 2010 spending review to increase HMRC’s
capacity to target and disrupt illicit trade and investigate those
behind that trade. Latest estimates indicate that the illicit cigarette
market has more than halved since 2000, from 21% to 9%, and the
hand-rolling tobacco illicit market share has reduced from 61% to
38<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T11:30:35"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000051"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Sheldon" PimsId="665" UID="13051661000824" xid="1626" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000824">Lord

which is why the Government have put more money into this. The money
that we have put in will mean that 120 additional enforcement staff are
employed at borders, looking specifically at this. There is a 20%
increase in criminal investigations and a 20% increase in the overseas
intelligence network, which is instrumental in identifying the sources

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, some of the additional effort that I have
been talking about is being deployed in that area. The Irish tax rate
on tobacco has increased recently, so the differential is less. But
there is also an issue that is currently being looked at by the
Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, which is relevant here, namely that
the penalties for tobacco smuggling are significantly less than those
for drug smuggling. There is a discussion about whether the sentencing
guidelines for tobacco smuggling should now be tightened to move them
more closely into line with drug
smuggling<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T11:32:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000055"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hannay of Chiswick" PimsId="3746" UID="13051661000828" xid="1625" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000828">Lord

Pearson of Rannoch:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise again to query the
usefulness of our proposed European Union Committee, and especially of
its six sub-committees. I do so against the background of our Liaison
Committee’s recent review of our committee structure, which was
debated in your Lordships’ House on 21 March. This revealed that
there were requests for no fewer than 28 ad hoc committees
from your Lordships, of which only five could be accommodated. We could
not even find the resources for a foreign affairs committee, which was
widely supported, nor for a committee on preventing religiously based
gender discrimination in arbitration and mediation services, which was
supported in writing by 70
Peers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000065">I
will very briefly repeat the case against this committee. First, its
composition remains heavily, if not uniformly, Europhile, as it has
been for the past 20 years, and therefore does nothing to reflect the
growing Euroscepticism of the British people. Secondly, its findings
are almost entirely ignored by Brussels, which routinely overrides our
scrutiny reserve. That is the agreement whereby successive Governments
have promised they will not sign up to any new EU law in Brussels if it
is still being examined by the Select Committee of either House of
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000066">Between
January 2010 and June 2012 the scrutiny reserve was overridden 212
times in the House of Commons and 191 times in your Lordships’
House. Furthermore, the new “yellow card” system, whereby
Brussels has to reconsider one of its new laws if eight national
Parliaments object to it, is proving to be just as fraudulent as
subsidiarity, as some of us forecast. If the Chairman of Committees
does not agree with me, can he say what has happened to the proposals
by Brussels for gender equality on company boards? Indeed, can he tell
your Lordships of any new Brussels law that has been avoided by a
yellow
card<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T11:40:27"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000067">I
am aware that noble and Europhile Lords will claim that our reports are
taken very seriously in Brussels and that Eurocrats can be seen
reverently devouring our reports as they go about their unhelpful
business, but the Government can point to hardly a single worthwhile

law—witness their Written Answer to me on 10 April. We are told
that our committee has inspired the long-overdue reform of the criminal
common fisheries policy, but if you put your ear to the ground in
Brussels, you learn that this was inspired more by Mr
Fearnley-Whittingstall’s television exposé than anything
that our committee may have said. In passing, the answer is not to
reform the CFP but simply to leave it and reclaim our great fishing

open, wild places. It includes walking, climbing, mountaineering,
canoeing, cycling, riding, sailing, orienteering, fell running and

even field sports, although I would draw the line at
hunting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T11:45:57"></hs_TimeCode>. I

never heard of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T11:46:12"></hs_TimeCode>.
Some are very organised and highly commercialised; others involve
voluntary activities in local clubs, rambling groups, mountaineering

million visitors and was worth £16 million to the Welsh economy
over the 12 months from September 2011 to August 2012. In 2011, the
LSE’s “gross cycling product” report—an
economic report on British cycling—said that British cycling
contributes £2.9 billion to the UK economy. I suppose that these

anything more about it, although others do. However, there is a
question about national trails generally. Natural England is moving
responsibility to local trail partnerships and there is a concern that
while local involvement in national trails is vital and can be
beneficial—I speak as someone who was instrumental in securing a
toucan crossing for the Pennine Cycleway across a busy dual carriageway

out, but if you suggest to them that they could go for a walk, they are
bewildered. That is why most people who go out into the countryside

well-being of the nation in so many important regards. It comes just a
few days after the publication of a new report by the Mental Health
Foundation to mark Mental Health Awareness Week and therefore it is

secretary of the All-Party Mountaineering Parliamentary Group and as
one of three Members of your Lordships’ House to have climbed
all the Munros, the other two being my noble friends Lord Elder and
Lord Smith of Finsbury. I am sorry that my colleagues have not put
their names down to speak in this debate because they are more eloquent
than I and because I know that they share my enthusiasm for walking in
the hills, and we are all fully aware of the health
benefits—physical, mental and spiritual—that we derive
from spending time in the
hills.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000094">All

also the organiser of two rambling groups—the Radical Ramblers
and the Wednesday Wanderers—and it is from the perspective of
the first of these that I wish to make my brief contribution to this
debate. The Radical Ramblers has been in existence for more than 30
years; we celebrated our 30th anniversary earlier this year, on the
Sunday after the Eastleigh by-election, almost exactly 30 years after
our first walk, which was on the Sunday after the Bermondsey
by-election. I am 
<?notus-xml column=550?>sure that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, remembers both those
by-elections well. His party used to do well in parliamentary
by-elections, and Bermondsey was certainly a
landmark.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000097">In
the past 30 years, we have walked very extensively in southern England.
Indeed, there is scarcely a long-distance footpath south of a line from
the Wash to the Bristol Channel that we have not walked. Some of the
best walks have been along the coast. We have walked east from
Gravesend on the Saxon Shore Way, turned right at Thanet and headed
west along the south coast all the way from Dover to Dartmouth. That
includes the South Downs Way from Eastbourne to Winchester and the
South West Coast Path from Poole Harbour along the Dorset and Devon
coasts, plus the bits in between through the New Forest and the
surrounding countryside.</hs_para>

was done before the passage of the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, on
pre-existing paths, some of which were some distance from the actual
coast. That Act was widely welcomed by the walking community, in
particular for giving legislative underpinning to the inspiring notion
that as far as practically possible the public should have a right to
walk right round the coast of England and Wales. In Wales this
aspiration has been fully met, thanks to the enthusiastic support of
the Welsh Government. Recently published research has shown that the
Wales Coast Path attracted nearly 3 million visitors over a 12-month
period and was worth an estimated £16 million to the Welsh
economy, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has already
mentioned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000099">In
England the evidence on the ground is that significant improvements to
the coastal footpath network are coming—but very slowly. Natural
England has an important role to play in this regard, in co-operation
with local authorities. I have to accept that in a time of austerity
progress will be slower than one might like, but I hope that the
Minister will recognise that progress needs to be steady and determined
and that the Government have a role in ensuring that the momentum is
maintained and the will of Parliament
prevails.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000100">Lots
of figures are bandied about to emphasise the importance of walking to
the economy. I have just mentioned one for Wales. Another, provided by
the Ramblers, suggests that walkers in the English countryside spend
around £6.14 billion a year, supporting almost 250,000 full-time
jobs. Recently my group had a marvellous bank holiday weekend walking
up the Suffolk Coast Path, taking it fairly easy over four days from
Aldeburgh to Lowestoft. There were about 16 or 17 of us on that walk,
including two other colleagues from your Lordships’ House. A
rough, back-of-an-envelope calculation suggests that our little
rambling group spent more than £3,000 in and around Southwold
during those four days—on hotels and B&amp;Bs, in pubs and
restaurants et cetera. Why were we there? It was because of the coastal
path.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000101">The

that Essex County Council can be encouraged to see its extensive
coastline as an economic opportunity, not merely as an expensive

yet do the same. I sincerely hope
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000107">It will be
too late for the Radical Ramblers, as we are all getting a bit long in

Essex backwaters provide splendid habitats for overwintering birds and

on foot to these hidden gems needs to be greatly enhanced for future

school trips and learning activities. It did quite a bit of work

Addington:</Member></B> My Lords, when my noble friend Lord Greaves was
lucky enough to secure this debate, because he got himself together to
put in for it, he asked me to contribute and I said yes. When you talk
about the countryside and the great outdoors, what exactly does that
mean? It suddenly became clear to me that it means something different
to everyone. We have heard from noble Lords about serious walking and
long-range walking. These walks are structured and take up the day.
People plan them to be the major part of their day. My noble friend
Lady Miller spoke about being in the
countryside<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:20:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000124">I
thought about what the countryside means to other people. Let us
remember that we all bring our own baggage to these debates. My
childhood was in Norfolk, which we all know is very flat. It probably
does not present the challenges suggested by noble Lords who have
spoken here about walking. I now live in Berkshire, which is
experienced differently because of where it is. I live in Lambourn,
which is dominated by the racing industry and horses. The
industry’s attitude to the usage of the countryside is very
different from that of the average walker. It is worried about the
people who use the paths. It does not want, for instance, to risk great
holes in the paths and bridleways that might trap a horse’s
foot, which could lead to a broken leg, a damaged horse or
worse.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13051661000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000125">The
area is close to urban centres. Swindon is just over the hill. We also
get people in motor vehicles and cyclists on these paths. The usage and
distortion of the paths and access points mean that once again there
are different priorities. My experience of the countryside usually is
walking, accompanied by a dog on a lead. My bête noir is the
green laner in his 4x4 who seems to get a great buzz from going up the
same small bit of hilly path that cuts across a walk I do frequently.
In the past, I have been told that I just do not understand people who
want to experience this activity or want to improve their driving
skills. Over the winter, periodically 
<?notus-xml column=555?>I saw the same person in a nice warm heated cabin bumping along the same
path. You are quite right: I do not understand
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:22:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13051661000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000126">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:22:20"></hs_TimeCode>
have slightly more sympathy for those on scrambling bikes, which we see
quite a lot. That is possibly because I feel that there is a greater
danger of them falling over and hurting
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:22:33"></hs_TimeCode>. The
competition for usage in the countryside is great, particularly around
centres of population. Of course, everyone knows that what they are
doing is most important, which is intrinsic to us all. To get the best
out of all those activities, we have to look at co-ordination.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:23:01"></hs_TimeCode> addition, as
my noble friend pointed out, local authorities are under pressure. It
is no surprise that a path will be lost if it is not opened up or
maintained. If you want to lose a path, brambles and nettles will cover
it pretty quickly, particularly if it is not used frequently. How do we
prioritise getting into those places to make sure that multiple uses
are
available?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000127">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:23:31"></hs_TimeCode>
noble friends have reminded me of the CROW Act. At the time, there were
rows with the Ramblers’ Association, which suggested looking at
better services on more public paths. Someone said, “No, we
cannot tarmac over the countryside”. I said, “But you are
quite prepared to have expanding paths that spin out to the side,
making an environmentally sterile situation with great scars running
across the countryside”. Very few people can access those paths
unless they are determined
walkers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:24:00"></hs_TimeCode>. On the

disability lobby, with which I have strong connections, saying,
“No, we want places that we can use”. Then you discover
that they are using small, powerful, electronic, jeep-type wheelchairs.
Their level of access is different from someone who has a slightly bad
leg but wants just to walk in the countryside. How do you co-ordinate
that? Effectively, unless we take action to bring these people
together, these conflicts will always occur. They will become quite
intense at times and get in the way of the idea that there should be
room for us all to do if not everything we want, at least some of
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13051661000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000129">The
economic and health arguments are fairly straightforward. My noble
friend may be very cynical about the exact figure for the economic
benefit, probably with some justification, but the fact of the matter
is that if you are selling walking boots and giving out cream teas and
coats, and the odd bit of bed and breakfast, there is going to be a
benefit. In the same way, if you want horses that go out and are used
for hacking around, there is a benefit to everybody, from farriers to
saddlers and the people who run the stables. There are benefits to be
had from this, and you can go on and do this again and again.</hs_para>

clearly there. Given that and the fact that gentle walking must be,
shall we say, the most perfect form of low-impact exercise for weight
control, particularly if you are not in the peak of condition and want
a shorter activity, to get these benefits in all these areas we must
have somebody who looks at the overall picture and tries to pull them
all in together.

people who are dealing with countryside access talk about access
without a car from an urban centre? Either you walk there or
you can catch a bus. That is quite an important part of access. It once
again addresses a fact that was already raised: that the middle class
who jump in a car and go get the best out of this. There again, do we
particularly want them to use their cars more? Not really.
We would much rather have it that anybody with a reasonably sturdy pair
of shoes and a coat with some water resistance can access the
countryside. Better still, if we can co-ordinate access from urban
centres to the countryside without using a car, it would be a massive
help.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000132">The
serious walkers also have an inbuilt interest in this, for the simple
reason that we will encourage more people to take up the activity.
There always has to be an entrance point, particularly if you are
taking this on without having a cultural reference within your family.
Having easy access to a start is very important. I have no doubt that
the Ramblers’ Association, among others, will have views and
opinions about how that should happen but unless it starts to
co-ordinate it with those in urban environments who are, for instance,
planning such things as bus routes and transport, it will not have the
maximum effect.</hs_para>

taken and some people are made to pay attention to it, we are never
going to get the best out of this environment. We are always going to
be chasing round and putting people under pressure, who will then
defend with tremendous fervour their own particular interest. Unless we
can form this overview and make people sit down and talk together more,
we are always going to have that conflict. I look forward to hearing
what will be said to address this, but can we please take on board that
huge benefits are to be had here? They will never be maximised if we
always find people in those situations of rivalry defending their own
patch.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_16_PT_1/02488AD0A8E267F1907902724826D92A5A9C9635" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 May 2013">Thursday,

disposal of the population? Do we want a Britain in which people are
materially existing or a creative, living Britain in which
youngsters—as an ambition, all youngsters—have the
opportunity to discover themselves physically and spiritually and
fulfil their lives by their experiences? For me, that is the value of
the countryside and why all those who fought to make it available and
enjoyable were so important.</hs_para>

with the environment and the rivers racing and flowing, there is an
excitement and a dimension. I think, “My God, why are more
people not able to enjoy this? Why have they not seen this potential in
life?”. I know that when I have struggled, panted, climbed and
clambered up a fell—although not at the moment, because my
chassis plays me up a bit—and come over the brow of the fell,
and there was range of hills and mountaintops in front of me, it was an
extraordinary experience. Why is it not more available to people of all
ethnic groups in our society or to the handicapped? We should find ways
to make it available, sympathetic ways that do not spoil the objective.

I do not apologise for that, because it had a deep effect on me. Down
on Windermere, there is a YMCA training centre. I was
talking to a really rather impressive middle-aged lady who was utterly
committed to the work going on there, and she said, “The other
day, I had a youngster here from an inner-city area, aged about seven
or eight. In the evening, I said to this youngster, ‘What did
you do today?’. The youngster looked at me with wide eyes and
excitement, and said, ‘Miss, I saw far!’. A few days

Oxfordshire County Council, we moved to erect traffic regulation orders
on the Ridgeway. This was a joint action between the county councils of
Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. I was also a member of the
Thames Valley Police Authority, which was willing to enforce the
traffic regulation orders. The reason for these was the need to protect
the Ridgeway against the depredations of motorcyclists and 4x4 sports
vehicles, which were turning it into an absolute quagmire. My noble
friend has referred to the fact that it is a wide way, but it was
muddy, dangerous to ride a horse and quite impossible to ride a
bicycle. It really was a disgrace. We managed to do something positive.
I am sorry to hear my noble friend’s story of the water across
the Ridgeway, but I think that that is perhaps beyond the control of
the county council. In any case, we should do something about it.
Maintaining a footpath or bridleway costs a lot of money, but they are

many more things to do. I will not talk for a long time about the Peak
District, but it is an absolute disgrace in most places. The noise and
intimidation that are presented to walkers, cyclists and horse riders
are quite awful. This goes on 
<?notus-xml column=560?>because no traffic regulation orders are even being sought by the
several local authorities in the Peak District. The reason for this is
that traffic regulation orders can be difficult to obtain. The
procedure is convoluted and allows lots of scope for objectors to make
their views known, which they do. That makes the process very
expensive. The result is the destruction of the countryside. The noise
of many of these vehicles is really quite awful in a place that should
be peaceful. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, has referred to his returns to
the Lake District, and it is the peace of the place that is part of the

is worth pointing out that the cost and time involved in making one of
these orders is far outweighed if the matter goes to appeal and the
appeal goes against the authority, when it is faced with the costs of
the appeal, of making good the damage and of enforcing the traffic
regulation order. Therefore my noble friend Lord Greaves, who has done
a great service in securing this debate, will provide the opportunity

reinforced the fact that while most people who use the great outdoors
are able to get along with each other with a degree of tolerance, there
is a problem. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, mentioned 4x4 vehicles,
and we could have talked about speedboats in certain parts of the
national parks. I hope that the Minister will reflect on the particular
points made about the Peaks, which is a wonderful, beautiful area in
which people’s enjoyment is being spoilt at the moment. If there
is a real issue about the laying of traffic orders, one might want to
look to primary legislation as a way of helping local authorities to do

it means the great city of Birmingham, and rather different
circumstances, but we have wonderful parks—and canals, which, in
some parts of the city, meet the description by the noble Lord, Lord
Greaves, as open and wild places—and we

been reassured that the intention was to implement the coastal pathway.
However, I have been very disappointed by the pace of implementation.
Is the Minister able to give us any words of comfort about when we

health evidence of an active lifestyle, including a lifestyle in the
great outdoors, is overwhelming. The WHO estimates that around 6% of
global deaths are caused by physical inactivity. It also estimates that
between 20% and 35% of cardiovascular disease could be prevented if
people became more active throughout their lives. We have the Chief
Medical Officer’s guidelines, which is 30 minutes of physical
activity on at least five days a week for adults, and at least one hour
of moderate or intense activity a day for children aged five to 18. We
also have a 17 year-long study of 10,000 people, published by the
University of Exeter last month, which looks at the impact of living in
a green area, and which concluded that it has a significant positive
effect on well-being. My noble friend Lord Haworth made the point that
the green space effect is that you can have lower levels of mental
distress and higher life satisfaction, which can still be seen, even
after changes over time, in participants’ income, employment,
marital status, physical health and housing type. Although we are
talking about the great outdoors, and inevitably think about the
national parks, of course a green space can be in a city if planners
are imaginative about their provision of
facilities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000162">My
noble friend Lord Haworth is going on the John Smith memorial walk this
weekend, and I wish him well in that endeavour. He showed, and
mentioned, the economic benefits of rambling, and mentioned the coastal
path, as did my noble friend Lord Judd. It is interesting that the
national parks have estimated that 110 million people visit them each
year. They contribute about £4.5 billion to local economies, and
more than 100,000 jobs are directly dependent on the national parks. In
other country areas one can see similar impacts. Therefore, there is an
overwhelming case for the economic, health and well-being benefits of
encouraging the use of the great outdoors. Again, I would be interested
to know what the Government are doing to recognise that and to
encourage us to see even more positive impacts on the economy in
future. The next debate, which is coming up a little earlier than some
noble Lords thought, is about growth in the economy.</hs_para>

back to an issue mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller: children
and schools. Unfortunately, not many young people meet the levels of
exercise recommended by the Chief Medical Officer. My information is
that in England, 32% of boys and only 24% of girls meet the basic
levels of activity that the Chief Medical Officer recommends. For
adults, the figures are 39% of men and 29% of women—so they are
low, and there is a gap between men and women. There is also some doubt
about whether the figures are accurate. Some people responding to the
surveys were tested to see whether there was evidence that they were
engaging in physical activity. This reduced the figures that I have to
6% of men and 4% of women.
Clearly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:02:20"></hs_TimeCode>, the
overwhelming evidence is that although activity of the type mentioned
by noble Lords is good for people, only a small proportion of people in

it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:02:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000165">This
brings us back to schools. I have to mention my disappointment at the
Olympic legacy. Of course not all young people will engage in the
physical activity involved in competitive sport—although we
should do everything we can to encourage those sports. There is no
doubt that when the Olympic bid was won, and when we had the wonderful
Olympics, we expected there to be a positive impact in schools on sport
and physical activity generally. Mr Gove’s decision to get rid
of funding and then bring some of it back is having a direct impact on
the levels of physical activity in schools. I hope the Minister will be

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate my
noble friend on securing this debate and acknowledge his long-term
commitment to these matters. I also reiterate, as noble Lords said,
that outdoor activity means many things to many different people. That
is its appeal. It provides millions of people with the opportunity to
participate in a diverse range of activities. It gives them much
pleasure and improves their mental and physical health and general
well-being. It also contributes to the
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:04:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000168">Inactivity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T11:24:58"></hs_TimeCode>
is associated with many diseases. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings
Heath, suggested the figure of 6% of early deaths globally. My figure
is 9%. Whatever the correct figure, it is a very serious
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:04:46"></hs_TimeCode>. For those
reasons and more, in July 2011 the Chief Medical Officers of the four
home countries published <I>Start Active, Stay Active</I>, setting out
the new guidelines for physical activity. For adults, the new
recommendation is for at least 150 minutes of physical activity spread
across the week. Importantly, the guidelines address the whole-life
course, from early years to older people, and include advice on
avoiding sedentary
behaviour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000169">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T11:24:58"></hs_TimeCode>
we have just lost a Garden but there is a Gardiner on the Front Bench,
I will raise the issue of gardening. That is an activity that millions
of us engage in, all 
<?notus-xml column=564?>year round. Only two days ago I read that gardeners can burn off 19,000
calories a year. There were 20.9 million visits to
allotments and community gardens between March 2012 and February 2013.
The 100th anniversary of the Chelsea Flower Show is approaching next
week—I declare that I am a member of the Royal Horticultural
Society—and millions of us enjoy walking round this
country’s wonderful parks and gardens. There were 34
million day visits to gardens in 2012
alone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:06:06"></hs_TimeCode>. As I
gardened as a schoolboy, I was particularly struck by the important
observations of my noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer on
school
gardens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:06:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000170">Much
is being done to encourage people to take more exercise, but in
England, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, suggested, six
out of 10 men and seven out of 10 women exercise less than the
guidelines would like us to. For children, the guidelines recommend at
least 60 minutes of daily activity, but, again, participation levels
are too low. I shall address how we should tackle some of these
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:06:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000171">In
the face of the statistics, the Department of Health has established a
national ambition for physical activity for a year-on-year increase in
the number of adults doing 150 minutes of exercise per week, and a
similar reduction in the number of those who are inactive. This
represents what could be achieved if all sectors worked together,
supported by the new delivery system for public health. The ambition is
reflected in the public health outcomes framework indicator for
physical
activity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:07:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000172">There
are so many health benefits from outdoor activity. Walking brings
important mental health benefits. The noble Lord, Lord Haworth, and
other noble Lords spoke powerfully about these benefits. It can help
prevent dementia in older people. I read recently of the important ways
in which depression can be helped by people walking much more. The
noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, also raised this
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:07:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000173">I
turn to the Olympic and Paralympic legacy, which was mentioned.
Grass-roots participation is crucial to a successful legacy. To support
this, Sport England’s Places People Play programme is making a
significant investment in local sports facilities, with more than 1,000
community sports facilities receiving grants totalling more than
£50 million. It is also protecting playing fields, which are so
important in enabling all members of the community to take part in
sport and physical
activity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:08:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000174">The
latest active people participation figures for England from December
last year showed that between October 2011 and October 2012 more than
15 million people aged 16 and over participated in sport at least once
a week. This was a significant increase in sports participation over
2010-11, with more than 750,000 more adults taking part. Surely we must
build on this. The Government recognise the importance of sport for
people of all ages, and particularly for young people. In January last
year, we launched the £1 billion youth and community sport
strategy with Sport England, with the aim of creating a sporting habit
for life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000175">The
devolved Administrations are also actively engaged in promoting health
and well-being via their sporting
agencies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:09:59"></hs_TimeCode>.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:10:10"></hs_TimeCode> part of that
strategy, in December last year Sport England announced a £493
million investment 
<?notus-xml column=565?>between 2013 and 2017 in the national governing bodies of sport to
deliver a year-on-year increase in the number of people, particularly
those between 14 and 25, doing regular sport. Sport England
is also funding programmes for community organisations, charities and
local authorities, putting sport organisers into colleges, helping
disadvantaged young people to develop life skills though sport, and
funding to improve participation among those currently least
active.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000176">Major<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:10:21"></hs_TimeCode>
sports play a crucial role in the health and well-being of the UK.
Sport England’s Active People survey shows that just over 2.1
million people play football for 30 minutes once a week. The
forthcoming Rugby League World Cup in October and November this year
and the Rugby Union World Cup in 2015 will inspire a new generation to
play the game across the country. On the first day of the test season,
I must not forget cricket,
either.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000177">I
would like to highlight three sectors where we did extraordinarily well
in the Paralympics and Olympics. First, there is equestrianism. Sport
England has funded £6 million to the British Equestrian
Federation, which will be used to deliver a number of activities to
attract new riders, keep more people riding, and bring former riders
back to the sport. I would particularly like to mention an organisation
that I know well, the Riding for the Disabled Association, which is
such a force for good. Then there is sailing. The Royal Yachting
Association is expanding on programmes which introduce new young people
into the sport by teaching them new skills in a safe and controlled
environment. It is also continuing the successful Sailability
programme, which supports disabled people to sail through specialist
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:11:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000178">Then
there is cycling. The huge success of Team GB truly inspired many more
to get on a bike. The impact of the Grand Départ of the Tour de
France setting off in Yorkshire next year will be immense. The
Department for Transport has published details about how it will
allocate the £42 million investment in cycling
announced in last year’s Autumn Statement. It will comprise an
urban<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:12:05"></hs_TimeCode> element,
which I hope will please the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, and
a rural element for areas that are covered by national
parks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:12:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000179">I
turn to mountaineering. I am very conscious that the noble Lord, Lord
Haworth, has climbed all the Munros. I have a mixture of admiration and
dread at that prospect. Of course, I wish him and all his colleagues
well in the memorial walk that they are doing very shortly. I also
mention the close interest taken by my noble friend Lord Greaves in
this matter. Mountaineering is receiving £3 million through
Sport England’s whole sport plans. Almost 100,000 people
regularly take part in those activities. Figures from Natural England
show that there were more than 60 million visits to mountains, hills
and moorlands between March last year and February this year. They are
much cherished parts of the
countryside<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:13:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000180">Outdoor
pursuits can happen anywhere, be it large-scale events such as the
London marathon or the Great North Run, Ramblers’ Association
activities, or those at community level. We are now into the Walking to
Work week, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings 
<?notus-xml column=566?>Heath, mentioned. My own contribution is to get off the bus one stop
earlier, as part of that exercise. It may not be the most robust
contribution, but I am with them in spirit. Next week is Walking to
School week. I am very conscious of safety matters in that regard. But,
clearly, that is something that we should encourage wherever
possible.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13051661000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000181">I
turn to the matter of access, raised by quite a number of noble Lords.
Defra has announced a £2 million fund for the
creation of new permanent access rights, following the rural economy
growth review in 2011. My noble friend Lord Greaves, in particular,
raised those points. The Paths for Communities scheme, funded by the
Rural Development Programme for England, aims to develop and enhance
the rights of way network to the benefit of the local economy. Natural
England, on behalf of the Government, has appointed Walk England as its
partner on national trails at the start of the financial year. Natural
England has completed a two-year review programme to develop a new
operational management model for national trails. During that review,
we are looking into the possibility of taking proposals forward on how
we could leverage the economic potential of trails more strongly. It
was raised by many noble Lords that the network of national trails is
an important generator of local businesses. The noble Lord, Lord Judd,
mentioned the south-west coast path, which I understand generates over
£300 million a year for the economy of the region, supporting
over 7,500
jobs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:15:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000182">I
am also very mindful of what my noble friends Lord Addington and Lord
Bridgeman have said on these
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:15:35"></hs_TimeCode>, and on
the challenges of the multiuse of rights of way, as well as the
discussions and negotiations that have to take place to try to find a
settlement. I am particularly conscious of the representations that my
noble friend Lord Bradshaw has made, especially about the Peak
District. I had an opportunity before the debate to discuss those
matters with my honourable friend Richard Benyon, the Minister in
Defra, and I know that he would be very happy to meet my noble friend.
He is actively seeking to find solutions to what are clearly
unsatisfactory problems in that part of the world. It has been
mentioned that many local authorities are engaged in this matter, but I
wanted to emphasise that the Minister specifically asked me to say that
he is happy to meet and that he is working on this matter
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:16:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000183">I
raise the matter of the countryside—and how could I resist, when
my noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer
spoke<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:16:31"></hs_TimeCode> so
wonderfully about its place in the nation’s affections? Its
beauty means so much to us, and binds together past and present, nature
and culture, and tradition and invention. The countryside is where my
soul certainly soars, but I equally respect the fact, along with the
noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, that the urban dimension also has
a soul-soaring
aspect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:16:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0001.htm#13051661000184">Our
“green and pleasant land” is hugely important for
tourism. Domestic tourism, as well as that from overseas, plays a vital

the British passion for these pursuits, be they camping, 
<?notus-xml column=567?>country sports, hill-walking, climbing and outdoor adventure. They all
play a key role in underpinning many rural economies. Indeed, Sport
England has recently announced its largest ever investment in angling,

leisure is a key area for the GREAT campaign, as it enables us to
promote the UK as a fantastic destination for adventure and
exploration. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, spoke very strongly about the
economic benefits that derive from outdoor activities. We received many
excellent briefs stressing that point, and it is important that we
should emphasise it. The GREAT campaign is run directly from the Prime
Minister’s Office and celebrates our country’s rich
heritage, countryside and contemporary culture, our people and places
to visit, as well as our great economic strengths. Only last week,
VisitEngland launched the follow-up to last year’s hugely
successful Holidays at Home are GREAT campaign. There is no doubt that
outdoor activities would have played a very considerable part in that
success, with an additional £300 million spend, equivalent to
4.5 million nights

is also promoting outdoor activity in its work with the Regional Growth

campaigns<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:19:07"></hs_TimeCode>. One
of the most powerful experiences that I have had in connection with
children and urban schools is a visit to the countryside that I
undertook with Kate Hoey with a Vauxhall primary school some years ago.
It was among the most powerful effects that I have seen on children who
have never had any opportunity before to see the countryside—and
there they were with brushes, grooming cattle and running
through fields of corn, barley and
wheat<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:19:39"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:19:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:19:39"></hs_TimeCode>.
I have to say I was quite horrified but it was encouraged because they
came back with ears of cereal and were asked what food came from them.
It was probably one of the most effective ways of capturing those
children’s imagination as regards where their food comes from
and what a great place the countryside

youth and community sport. I would also like to mention the launch of
the Britain on Foot campaign, led by the Outdoor Industries

these activities and many government departments are co-ordinating to

many businesses, communities and organisations in the private sector

noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer talked about playing
outdoors when she was a young person. That reminded me that for the
first 11 years of my life I lived on the edge of a very built-up,
working-class area of Bradford—Bradford Moor—but across
the main road was the huge great open air playground of Myra Shay,
which had a stream going through it. We 
<?notus-xml column=569?>used to dam the stream there as well and fish for sticklebacks, minnows
and others. I do not think that would be allowed nowadays as it would
be considered far too dangerous. The important point here is that
children nowadays are often provided with activities which give them a
thrill but are totally and utterly safe. Many of the things that I did
in my childhood, with semi-official approval, would never pass a risk
assessment. However, we are all exposed to risk in our lives in all
sorts of ways. Learning to cope with risk and to deal with it is very
important. I do not think that we are quite getting the balance right
at the moment with the whole compensation culture, health and safety
and so on. I am sure that outdoor activities have a part to play here.
People have to realise that many outdoor activities are dangerous by
their very nature but there is nothing wrong with that. What is
important is being able to cope with that danger. In many cases, modern
equipment has been developed for use in caving or skydiving or whatever

Soley:</Member></B> My Lords, the international financial collapse in
this country and many other countries around the world produced a
situation which in many ways was very similar to that of the 1930s and
had a devastating effect on the economics of family life here and
elsewhere. It is not something that was born and bred in the United
Kingdom, as some people say. If anybody has doubts about the
seriousness of the problem, they should look at the excellent BBC money
programme on the subject—the second part of which was on last
night, and there is a third part coming soon.

everyone, hope that the outgoing chairman of the Bank of England is
right, I cannot be sure. I have not argued much about whether we are in

need to reduce the deficit, the key problem is growth. If we do not get
growth into the economy we cannot deal with the deficit quickly enough.

Government were concerned enough to say that if we were not careful we

“It doesn’t matter so much anyway”. It does not

debt which had been dumped on us during the Napoleonic wars. Britain
has always borrowed and done what most other advanced

the temptation among all political parties to blame the Government whom
you are trying to replace for just about everything which has happened
anywhere in the world including the weather—in fact,
particularly the weather. At the last general election it was clear to
me that the outgoing Labour Government had already lost the argument on
this subject. The then Conservative Opposition and the Liberal
Democrats were going round saying that this was the most desperate
situation that we in this country had ever been in, but that was not
true. It was not true that the deficit was the key problem. The
international financial collapse caused the

down in that election. Once you do that, people will naturally pull
back. They will not spend money—they tend either to save it or
to wait to see what will happen, and that adds to the problem. The
debt-to-GDP ratio showed only small changes between 1970 and 2010, and
a number of economists are now stating that much more clearly. They say
that history suggests that the current radio of debt to GDP is not
alarming. If my views on that do not satisfy noble Lords, let me quote
the IMF’s <I>World Economic Outlook</I> of October 2012. It
states:</hs_para>

was the view of people such as Robert Neild, the Cambridge economist,
and others who have said that the debt-to-GDP ratio is not alarming.
That does not mean that it is desirable or that we should not reduce
it, but it suggests that we have had the argument the wrong way round
for the past few years, and that is what troubles me. I suppose that I
am a natural Keynesian, and I felt that although we had to give the
Government space in their deficit-reduction programme, the position
should have been reversed and we should have been saying that growth
comes first. If you do not get growth, your debt problems will be far

arguing that getting the right public sector and public debt

recently has it begun seriously to address growth. That is what I

not just about the current Government but for a considerable time is
that when they talk about transport, they are referring to rail and
road and do not mention aviation. The Minister knows my strong views on
Heathrow. Before he gets worried, I should tell him that I am not about
to embark on a debate on Heathrow; this issue goes much wider. I have
always argued that growth in aviation is crucial, and is important for
the regions. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:38:23"></hs_TimeCode>
Government have placed great emphasis on high-speed rail. I agree with
that and do not have a problem with it. However, high-speed rail deals
with the transport of people, not of goods, whereas every aircraft that
flies out of this country with passengers also usually has in its belly
large quantities of high-value export goods. I shall mention Heathrow
once and try not to mention it again. Only 0.001% of flights in or out
of Heathrow are cargo aircraft. All the cargo comes and goes in
passenger aircraft. The same is true for all our local regional
airports. If you want to encourage exports, we must allow aviation to
grow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:39:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

question to the Minister is: are the Government taking seriously enough
the contribution that aviation can make to growth? There is enormous
potential there. It is no good telling people in Exeter that the
high-speed rail line will help them because it will not. However,
flights from Exeter airport to other airports around the world will
help them. Birmingham Airport, which is currently trying to expand,
needs to have permission to go ahead—again, because Birmingham
can export more if it has growth. Therefore, the growth factor is very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:39:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

points that I want to make in relation to aviation. First—again,
the Minister will have heard this before—air passenger duty is a
disaster for the aviation industry. It is massively outpricing us in
competition with other countries and other airlines. We need to reduce
air passenger duty. I know that we cannot do that quickly—it
cannot be done overnight—but the duty is a major hindrance to
the expansion of growth for the British aviation industry and that
presents it with very real challenges at the
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:40:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

have to say about aviation also applies to other areas of transport.
One reason that aviation has not been focused on by successive
Governments in the way that it should have been is the fear of climate
change. I yield to no one in my concern about climate change. I first
wrote about it back in the 
<?notus-xml column=573?>early 1980s and I still have the same views about it. However, I do not
believe that you deal with it by closing down aviation. There is a
terrible warning here from the way we conceded to the green movement
the argument about nuclear power. Only now are we catching up with the
green movement and saying, “Yes, we must have nuclear
power”, when the whole argument against it was what held us back
early on. The same is happening with aviation and we have to be very
alert to that. All sorts of efforts are now being made—frankly,
they should have been made earlier and I have been very critical of the
aviation and aerospace industry on this—to deal with climate
change issues through, among other things, fuel research, which is
showing real
possibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:41:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

want to touch on is housing, which every political party is saying is
important. We now have the Green Investment Bank and a business
investment bank. It may interest the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that many
years ago in the 1980s, when I was dealing with housing in the House of
Commons, we put forward a proposal for a housing investment bank. The
proceeds from the sale of council houses, which were very high at the
time, would be placed into a housing investment bank, which would then
receive matched money from the building societies and big building
companies. They were very positive about that process and they wanted
to do it. Unfortunately, the receipts from council house sales were
simply used to cut taxes, whereas if they had gone into the investment
programme, that would have been far more effective. I ask the Minister
to look again at this possibility.</hs_para>

am in favour of selling public housing up to a point. However, that
housing must then be replaced, and you do that by having sufficient
income from the sales to fund a replacement programme. That would
enable us to have a steady housebuilding programme, instead of what
tends to happen in this country, which is a lurching from excessive
building to none at all. We have gone backwards and forwards with some
pretty disastrous consequences, as we saw in the 1950s and

the other area on which we need to be much more focused—the
emerging countries. We have tended to talk about just the Brazil,
Russia, India and China group but we really must not forget Africa. I
have seen some very interesting articles. The other week, Chuka Umunna
in the House of Commons made a very good point about this. Nigeria has
a dramatically growing economy, as have many other countries in Africa
with which we have good relationships. There is an expanding market
there, particularly in high-tech goods. It is high-technology that can
drive our
expansion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:43:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that today we will look at how we can achieve growth. Over the past
year or two, I have heard the Government shift their position away from
simple deficit reduction to growth. Very recently, I have heard some of
their suggestions on infrastructure, transport and housing in
particular, and I should like the Government to say a bit more today
about how they are going to deliver that growth. That is the key
question. We could bounce along the bottom for a long time yet but, if
we get growth going in the economy, frankly we will do what Britain did
very 
<?notus-xml column=574?>successfully in the 19th and 20th centuries, which was to grow itself
out of its economic problems. That is what most advanced countries do.
I have the IMF on my side on this, as well as a large number of
economists, so I think that I have quite a strong
argument.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_16_PT_1/72764CECC0D3BACA633B7292E0685300005F0987" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 May 2013">Thursday,

I would challenge him on his analysis of how we got where we are today.
I fully accept that a financial crisis came—some say like a
meteor out of the sky; others, who have looked at the banks, thought it
was predictable—and hit us hard in 2007-08. This country was in
no position to sustain that blow. We were at a point where the former
Labour Government had raised public spending and public borrowing to a
point where it offered no resilience. I can understand how the Labour
Government got there. They bought into the idea that boom and bust had
ended and that there would be a constant flow of substantial tax
receipts coming from the financial services industry and that they
therefore could let loose the leash on both spending and borrowing
because there would be a constant flow of money coming into the
Treasury. They should have recognised that we were at the top of an
economic cycle—we do not end boom and bust; economies
cycle—and every Government have prudently to take cognisance of
that. So that is the situation in which we found
ourselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:53:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000231" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000231">We
also found through that process that the underlying British economy was
in very weak shape. We had become so dependent on financial services
that we had bled much of the life out of our other activities, both in
the service industries and manufacturing industries. We had allowed the
balance to swing so heavily to London and the south-east that much of
the north was being sustained only by having public service activities
there—the private sector had not been building and thriving for
a long time—and, worst of all, we had failed to recognise for
more than a generation that the backbone of the economy is our small
businesses. Twenty per cent of all the small businesses in the EU are
in the UK. This is a thriving location for small businesses but it has
not been receiving the kind of support that it needs to grow, to take
risks, to create new jobs and to build its export
base<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:54:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the rebalancing of that shift has been the work of this coalition
Government. I am encouraged by the comments of Sir Mervyn King and the
CBI made earlier in the week which suggest that they can finally see
that we are going into a modest recovery. It is very dangerous in this
current unstable international environment to focus too much on green
shoots, but the same verdict is coming back from small businesses, from
the accountants who spend time up and down the country with businesses
and even from the commercial section of the banks. They identify that
the beginnings of a real recovery are under way, in part because of the
rebalancing and redevelopment of those abandoned areas. This work will

people’s minds. There has been a turnaround in that area: more

I wonder whether he recognises the inconsistencies in his own position.
I agree that regional aviation capacity is the key issue we must look
at. As he knows, that is not hub aviation capacity but very much
point-to-point. One of the issues that the Davies Commission will have
to take on is whether we should try to build a single London-style hub
as our primary connection both within the country and outside. Should
we have one main hub and a number of minor hubs? Should we build a
balance between one hub and a number of point-to-points? We have to
come up with a solution that manages and supports the rebalancing
necessary for our economy. That means that it must service the north
and the west as well as London and the south-east. That is one of the
arguments that leads people to think that much of the London hub should
now be shifted somewhere between London and Birmingham, potentially
alongside an HS2 route, but there are a number of other

stressed the fact that aviation, usually thought of as passenger
aviation, plays a crucial role in freight. I fully accept that.
However, you cannot drag those words out of most of the aviation
industry because it becomes impossible to argue for the use of
Heathrow, an incredibly expensive and scarce resource, when you are
doing a point-to-point freight movement. So that issue has to come into
the picture and it will be interesting to see where it

are two issues I wish to address before I sit down. I shall certainly
not use my full time today. One is an issue which is sometimes not
addressed in the context of economic growth—that is, tax
avoidance. I recommend a speech made on this yesterday in the other
place by my colleague, Ian Swales, MP for Redcar. As he was discussing
the problem that we face—the inherent reality that most
multinational companies now effectively enjoy a corporation tax rate of
zero because they export their profits to somewhere such as Luxembourg
or outside the G20—he said that one of the impacts of that is
greatly to disadvantage those very small and medium-sized businesses in
our economy that we need to grow for the future. For example, a chain
of three book shops within my local community have pasted on their
walls that each book shop pays for a trainee nurse through its taxes on
an annual basis, whereas Amazon, their great rival, effectively
contributes nothing. Yet they face this price differential because, in
effect, the international community has provided a taxpayers’
subsidy to the large multinational entities. We have to tackle the tax
avoidance problem for that reason in addition to the failure of those
companies to contribute as they should to the public spending that, as
it were, pays for the society in which they participate and provides
the basis for many of their sales. I think that the level playing field
argument is an incredibly powerful
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T13:59:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

wish to pick up on the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Marland, on
exports. I agree completely that building the exports of our SMEs is
absolutely vital. However, sometimes I disagree with BIS about its
focus on saying to small businesses, “Come on, go to China,
Brazil and India”. It is wonderful if small businesses can
export to those countries and I have no problem with that, but when you
talk to these businesses, you find that many of them have had very bad
experiences when they have tried to do it. It is quite risky to export
to China if you have a patent you wish to protect. It is very difficult
to export to the United States because of all its non-trade barriers. I
have talked to quite a few small businesses, but I shall not use their
names because they are quite hesitant about this, which have found that
in the end they had to form a joint venture to sell into the United
States and essentially surrender most of the upside of their additional
revenues and the exports from their US operations. Instead, they just
accept royalty payments because, without a joint venture relationship,
it is impossible for them to operate on American
soil.</hs_para>

the small business perspective, the ongoing debate that David Cameron
was leading on in the United States in his discussions with
President Obama on an EU/UK trade negotiation to tackle many of these
non-tariff barriers, is absolutely crucial. There is a real need for an
awareness that this is the kind of thing we can tackle only as part of
the EU. I lived in the United States for 20 years and I know a lot of
people in the Administration. The chance that they would ever waste
time on a UK/US debate along these lines is close to zero. I suspect

exceedingly exciting point where there is great potential. We are

sustainable growth, not growth created by a sudden surge in public
spending that sparks a short-term response and transient behaviours. We
need long-term, sustainable growth by getting new businesses off the
ground and encouraging them to export. Any discussion is too much to
try to include in this speech, but it is also crucial that the banks
back up that growth with a credit supply, because it will be in huge
demand as businesses begin take off when they see the end of the
recession and can move into a much more investment-focused and
expansionary mode. We are at a very interesting point at which the

Bhattacharyya:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend
Lord Soley on securing this debate on economic growth. We all have an
interest in this subject, but I should declare my interest as chairman
of the Warwick Manufacturing Group at the University of Warwick. For
more than three decades, we have been working very hard, helping
companies to grow. A week ago the gracious Speech pledged that the
Government would focus on, “building a stronger
economy”—fine words, even if they are undermined by the
recent rows about referendums. Britain’s economic situation is
extremely weak. Yes, we have avoided a 
<?notus-xml column=579?>triple-dip recession and it may even be that the double-dip recession
will be revised away, but that is little to boast about. After five
years of recession, our GDP remains 2.6% below where it was before the
crash. Our productive sectors have struggled, with manufacturing gross
value added down 10% over the past 10 years. Construction has fared
worst of all, falling into deep decline in 2012, and it is now almost
20% down on 2008. Nor will foreign growth rescue us. The European
Commission, the IMF and the OECD all say that the eurozone will decline
this year. Finally, devaluation cannot solve our problems. Sterling is
almost a quarter below its peak, but many exporters are facing
increased costs from raw materials and components, which means that we
are not benefiting from the short-term competitiveness we enjoyed in
earlier devaluations.</hs_para>

problems are deep and significant and they require great
attention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:04:41"></hs_TimeCode>, but
if we take the right decisions, they can and will be resolved. I have
spoken many times in this House about the need to take a long-term
view. The challenges we face have arisen as the result of years or even
decades of too little innovation, too little investment,
undercapitalisation and not enough support for the physical and social
infrastructure which can deliver lasting growth. We must all pull
together to change this. Step by step and day after day, we must follow
a steady path that supports innovation, investment and infrastructure.
I am encouraged that the leader of my party and the shadow Chancellor
speak regularly on these issues, and commissioned Sir George
Cox’s excellent report on long-termism. Even the Mayor of London
now talks about the need to take a long-term view on growth, but
unfortunately the Government seem mostly to be focused on the tactical
short-termism that got us into this mess. We will not get a recovery
from immigration crackdowns and referendums.</hs_para>

be fair, the Government are doing some good things, mostly at the
urging of the Business Secretary. We share the aim that all young
people should take up training apprenticeships or go into higher
education on leaving school, and I congratulate the Government on
pressing ahead with high-speed rail. It is politically difficult, but
necessary. While the science budget is declining in real terms, the
Government have at least tried to protect it. However, sadly, this is
where their long-term vision ends. Despite all the talk about growth, I
searched the gracious Speech in vain for a mention of science,
technology or research. In the press briefing that accompanied the
speech, we heard much about scraping the barnacles off the boat, but
these issues are not barnacles, they are the materials from which the
boat is built. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:07:11"></hs_TimeCode>

way that can be done is by supporting reshoring, which when I put it in
plain English means bringing back the jobs that left Britain due to
globalisation and cheap labour
overseas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:07:02"></hs_TimeCode>. In
both manufacturing and services, rising wages abroad and technological
innovation at home could mean that these jobs come back, and we should

expectation that those who get government help will return their back
office and IT functions to the US. That is why “Buy US”
clauses have appeared in many bailed out companies’ purchasing
contracts. Today, a combination of informal pressure, immigration
rules, tax changes and US wage competitiveness means that companies
such as General Electric and General Motors are creating IT jobs in
America, not in India. Indian outsourcing companies are facing tough
times because of this. Their growth and profits are down, and the
outsourcing market is projected to stagnate or even decline.
Yet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:08:22"></hs_TimeCode> the UK seems
to be uninterested in supporting the reshoring of its own money. The
NHS spends millions of pounds on offshoring IT and data management. For
example, half of the NHS shared business services staff are based in
India. If we were to demand that such direct government spending was
done in the home market, we would immediately create many hundreds of
thousands of jobs in

procurement is that it should act as a capacity and innovation builder
for British business. Many people ask me, “Why can’t we
have a Google or an IBM in this country?”. Britain is a small
country. The reason those companies succeeded in the beginning was by
growing in their internal market. Government procurement must be such
that it helps small companies to create an internal market and then
grow. If we use procurement to support innovation through a major
extension of the Small Business Research Initiative, we would help UK
businesses develop new products and services for both the home and the
export markets. As I said, we are a relatively small country. We do not
have the critical mass to support innovation in the domestic market
unless we focus resources on it directly. This is needed to help small
companies grow.</hs_para>

our approach to skills so that investors want to create jobs in
Britain. The government response to the Richard report was full of warm
words but kicked the question of funding for skills into the long
grass. We need to find a better response. We do not need government to
spend more but our businesses to invest in their people. We should
create sector training boards, with the power to issue training levies,
as they do in construction, so that all firms have a common incentive
to invest in their employees. If we approach skills in this way, we
might be able to rid ourselves of our cumbersome skills bureaucracy.
Some object that this means a new tax on business. I understand this
concern, but if firms train their people they will more than get that
money back.</hs_para>

real opportunity for growth here, if only we seize it. We should use

firms to invest in skills, and give tax incentives to smaller firms;
use business banks to support innovation investment in sectors and
regions with high growth

of tax reductions and controlling public expenditure, as well as the

talking, particularly about developing IT, I should have been paying
more attention but I was flicking through pages 4 and 5 of the
excellent House of Lords Library briefing that has been prepared for
this debate. I found a lot of very encouraging things. Some things, I
have to say, had passed me by, such as the tenfold increase in the
annual investment allowance for small enterprises; the introduction of
a seed enterprise investment scheme offering investors 50% income tax
relief to encourage investment in early-stage companies; doubling the
lifetime limit on gains for eligible entrepreneurs’ relief to
£10 million; providing 100% business rate relief for
small businesses seeking to get going; a £200 million growth
accelerator scheme designed to provide business coaching for
high-potential firms, which 4,000 SMEs have signed up with; start-up

this really is the most important issue for our country at the present

leadership and government are about is creating confidence in the

contrast to other parts of the world; for example, in Europe. The same
newspaper has heralded the encouraging performance of British business
in terms not just of growth figures but of greater confidence, as
evidenced by the Purchasing Managers’ Index report on new export
growth, which had gone from expansion from contraction, tipping over
the 50-point threshold for the first time in recent years. It pointed
to the fact that 500,000 vacancies were being advertised in jobcentres,
which was their highest level since 2008. Let us contrast that with the
eurozone. We do not want to point to other people’s suffering,
although, sometimes, when I hear the policy prescriptions put forward
by the party opposite, they remind me of something that you can point
to as if they were on “Blue Peter” and say,
“Here’s one where we can actually see it being
road-tested”. You have only to go across the Channel to see
President Hollande putting forward his solutions for the economy. They
are having a disastrous effect. His wealth tax of 75% is driving people
through the Channel Tunnel to London to build up our economy rather
than build up their own at a rapid rate. We need to remember that, in
an age of intellectual capital, intellectual businesses are highly
mobile and pay attention to tax rates, as the noble Lord, Lord
Bhattacharyya, reminded
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:25:24"></hs_TimeCode>. At a time
when we are reporting that we have perhaps come out of that phase of
the recession, that is why the French economy has gone back into it.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:10:00"></hs_TimeCode> unemployment
rates are another indicator here that we have to look at. According to
the <I>Economist </I>this week, the unemployment rate in France is 11%
and rising; the UK’s is 7.9% and stable or falling. That is a
very important indicator along with GDP.</hs_para>

other thing that we need to look at is the number of new jobs being
created in the economy. One and a quarter million jobs have been
created in the economy since 2010, which is the fastest rate of job
creation that we have witnessed since 2000. Moreover, for every one job
lost in the public sector, six jobs are being created in the private
sector. That addresses one of the points made earlier about one of the
objectives that we set out with being to rebalance the economy away
from relying just on financial services towards relying on
manufacturing—we are seeing a growth in exports. We need to move
away also from overdependence on the public sector to a more balanced
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:26:57"></hs_TimeCode>. We are
seeing a rate of growth in new enterprise that is almost unprecedented,
with 471,466 new businesses, new enterprises, established in the past
year. Anyone who has ever set up a business will know that the first
year is incredibly tough, and the number of start-ups which go out of
business in their first year is tragically high, but the ones which
stay the course are where the growth will come from—in
employment, in revenues and in taxes. Therefore, the fact that we have
an enterprise-friendly culture in this country is
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:27:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000264" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000264">Perhaps
I may offer a note of caution about the growth figures for an unusual
reason. Understanding national accounts is something which I never
really got to grips with—even when I was a Treasury Minister, I
have to confess; understanding corporate accounts comes a little bit
more naturally. National accounts are incredibly complex and faceted.
We chase after this half-time score of the GDP growth rate every 
<?notus-xml column=585?>quarter, and sometimes we are happy and sometimes we are sad. Knowing
what goes into a lot of indicators is a bit like the old argument about
pasties: if you knew what went into them, you perhaps would not eat
them quite so readily. We have to get better at measuring what is
happening and following the right KPIs for the growth of our
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:28:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000265" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000265">The
GDP figures are collected by way of a survey, as those who have worked
in that area will know. The mix of the survey, which is organised by
the Office for National Statistics, includes 6,000 manufacturing
companies, 25,000 service sector companies, 5,000 retail
companies and 10,000 companies in the construction sector. I am always
suspicious of round numbers. We should look into this and ask why we
define progress and growth in our country by that mix of samples. How
often is that looked at? I encourage my noble friend, who I know takes
these matters seriously and perhaps understands them much better than I
ever did, to undertake a review of what goes into the GDP statistics.
That in itself would make for an interesting debate. At the time that
the first data are released, only 40% of the information is in and
available. That is why we constantly get revisions and it comes down.
At the end of the day, it is only a
survey.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000266" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000266">In

ourselves against. There are some better indicators. VAT receipts would
be a very good indicator to use to track the health of the economy:
they are reported quarterly and are one of the highest levels of
adhered-to taxes. We have to look again at the basket of what we are

we talk about cash at the bank, the reality is that we seem to be doing

£159 billion three or four years ago. The deficit is
down by a third but there is still a very long way to go before we ever
get to the point we need to reach of paying down some of the debt as
well. That has now been moved to 2017-18. It is encouraging that that
cash element in the transaction between what is going out of the
government bank account and what is coming in seems to be heading in

Lord Soley on securing this debate and concentrating on the issue that
must be of prime importance to all of us: how we restore growth to a
flatlining economy. Of course, there are rather fewer contributors
today than there were in the economics debate on Monday. It is also
true that just before the end of the previous Session we had a major
debate on the issue, so one would have thought that the relatively
small number of noble Lords participating in this debate reflects the
fact that others have made their contributions already.</hs_para>

on growth. I hope that the Minister in replying will indicate where he
thinks growth is coming from and acknowledge the danger our society is
in from an economy that has flatlined, as ours has. It is all right for
the noble Lord, Lord Bates, to indicate that six times as many jobs are
being created in the private sector as are being lost in the public
sector, but then why do the latest unemployment figures show a
distinctive and frightening rise? Why are a million of our young people
still unemployed? What does it mean for the next generation when jobs
are so difficult to
obtain?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000270" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000270">I
also appreciate the self-restraint of my noble friend Lord Soley on
aviation, which is nothing like the self-restraint of this Government,
who have pushed aviation policy not into green shoots but into some
distant long grass before any decision will be taken. Let us look at
long-term investment by the Government. In aviation we have to wait a
considerable time before decisions will be taken, and the much-vaunted
HS2, which we welcome, is also a considerable period away from any
significant investment being made. In the depths of a recession at
least certain factors ought to work to the country’s advantage.
After all, sterling has depreciated by almost a fifth. Yet has that
produced a significant increase in exports? No, since that devaluation
of sterling we have seen our balance of payments deficit get
worse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000271" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000271">No one
should underestimate the problems that accrue from the crash of 2008,
but our challenge to the Government is that they have pursued the wrong
priorities. The noble Lord, Lord Bates, compared Britain with France.
There was never a mention from the government side comparing Britain
with the United States of America. Has no one from the government
Benches looked at the Michigan economy and seen what the response has
been to a Government who pumped in resources to save two of the biggest
car manufacturers in the world and to sustain employment and their
balance of payments position by ensuring that such critical industries
were not lost? Of course, for our Government such action would be
complete
anathema.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000272" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000272">We
are content to see austerity being pursued to such an extent that no
one in our society with resources has the confidence to invest.
Quantitative easing goes to banks, but banks do not have the confidence
to lend to industry. In industry, many of our major companies are awash
with resources, with £670 billion in cash, but they do not
invest either. Why? Because the pursuit of austerity and impoverishing
our people throttles demand. What is actually happening is that there
is very limited purchasing power in the economy. It is of course right
that we pay some regard to the activities of the Government in seeking
to promote small businesses, but every noble Lord knows that the
contribution made by small businesses to our balance of payments and
exports is quite limited, although I note the points made by the noble
Baroness, Lady Kramer, and agree with a number of them. We have to get
our major areas of investment right, and at the present time we have
not because of the absence of
demand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000273" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000273">My
noble friend Lord Bhattacharyya indicated how we could improve crucial
aspects of the supply side of industry. There is no doubt that the
Minister ought to 
<?notus-xml column=587?>respond positively to his recommendations in this debate. With such a
low level of demand in society, it is extraordinarily difficult to get
investment going again. It is not as if the Government exude confidence
by their actions. After all, their austerity targets are missed. We
were meant to see the deficit disappear by 2015, but we are now working
to a longer term cycle of 2017, with a certain elasticity even in that.
We were meant to make ourselves pristine for the credit agencies, but
two of the credit agencies have reduced our three-star status. We were
meant to hold our heads high in the international world, but a
visitation from the IMF has been presaged by serious criticisms of the
Government’s position for having produced an economy so devoid

means that the Government are patching up rather than following an
intelligent strategy. They have to patch up. Think of the schemes that
have already failed. Think of Merlin, which was meant to give some

included, whereas London and East Anglia were not. The problem is that

in the most recent Budget, have the Government learnt lessons? Of
course they are right that we should address the issue of housebuilding
and achieve stimulus in those terms, but they have not suggested that
the resource should be directed at the first-time buyer. They are not
even suggesting that the resource should be directed only at someone
buying their first house. It looks as if all that they will do is give
a further twist to the house price spiral, thereby making even more

we are critical of the Government about demand, it is because every
Budget under the Government has significantly reduced purchasing power.
The Government must recognise that if they slash benefits, many of
which also apply to people in work, they are cutting demand. They must
appreciate that if they direct their significant resources to the elite
in our society, particularly those who enjoy millionaire status, it
will be such an unfair society as to be demoralising for people who
work hard but receive very little. One statistic of which the
Government should take note is the significant fall in real wages since
2009. That is not just a real reduction in purchasing power among
people at work but a worrying reduction in

significantly to reduce public expenditure and, in doing so,
deliberately create circumstances in which there is higher unemployment
and lower demand in society. That has underpinned the whole strategy of
the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister since 2010, and
that is why the Minister must respond on the state of the economy,

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Soley, for
initiating this debate, because he asks the single most important
question facing the country: how do we get more growth? He and the
noble Lord, Lord Davies, have a relatively straightforward answer.
Sadly, we believe that it is the wrong answer. Their answer is to
borrow more. It was not the answer of the previous Labour Government.
The Fiscal Responsibility Act required the Government to have halved
the deficit by the financial year 2013-14. I am not sure whether the
Labour Party has finally and formally renounced that legislation, but
that was the course that it
set.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000279" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000279">The noble
Lord, Lord Soley, points out that we had 225% of GDP borrowing after
the Second World War, but I should have thought that he could see that
the circumstances at the end of the Second World War were so
fundamentally different in almost every respect from those of today
that that is not a useful
analogy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:45:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000280" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000280">There
are a number of reasons for getting the deficit down. In my view, the
most clearly demonstrable one is that a higher deficit and an
incredible fiscal consolidation programme would undoubtedly lead to
higher interest rates. Why is it that at the end of last week the UK
was paying 1.84% on its debt, the US was paying 1.86%, Italy was paying
3.89%, and Spain 4.25%? The answer is: because this country has a
credible economic policy in which the markets believe. Without that,
there is no reason why our interest rates could not rise by 1% or 2%.
Bear in mind that a 1% increase in interest rates means that a mortgage
payer with a £100,000 mortgage is paying out an extra
£1,000 per year, leaving aside the additional costs to industry
and the additional billions of pounds extra that the Government will be
paying to service their
debts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000281" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000281">When
the Government came in, national debt was running at 11.2% of GDP. That
was possible in a crisis. I do not think anybody believes that such a
level of national debt, which seems to be the level that the Opposition
are talking about—we still have national debt running at more
than 7%—is sustainable. The noble Lord, Lord Soley, talked about
Keynes. People disagree about Keynes, but I am pretty certain that he
never advocated sustained levels of borrowing over a long period. He
knew, as everyone else knows, that although such a thing is possible,
and desirable, over a short period, it is not possible in the long
term<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:47:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000282" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000282">Today,
in part, we have been discussing another of Keynes’s aphorisms,
which is hugely important at the point at which we find ourselves in
the economic cycle: his emphasis on the role played by “animal
spirits”, to use his phrase, on investment decisions and a whole
raft of economic decisions. Indeed, that was the burden of the speech
by my noble friend Lord Bates. At this juncture, the turn in the cycle
that we are clearly seeing will accelerate because the view of people
in the markets—“animal spirits”: what people are
saying to each other—is changing
positively<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:48:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000283" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000283">I
would like to address specifically several of the points made by the
noble Lord, Lord Soley, about the components of growth. Indeed, most of
these features have been about one or more components of the growth
picture. I start with infrastructure, where there 
<?notus-xml column=589?>was widespread agreement that more needed to be done. Last year,
according to the World Economic Forum, the overall quality of our
infrastructure was 24th in the world. We do not believe that this is
good enough, which is why we are investing more in transport
infrastructure in this Parliament than was the case under the previous
one. Our railways are seeing the largest programme of investment since
the Victorian
era<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:49:36"></hs_TimeCode>.
Incidentally, I am pleased to see, as I am sure the noble Lord, Lord
Soley, is, that the amount of freight carried on the railways is going
up significantly, which reverses a very long-term trend and is very

public and private investment in infrastructure between 2010 and 2012,
at £33 billion per year, is higher than that of the final five
years of the previous Government. At Budget 2013, the Chancellor
unveiled an increase in capital spending plans by £3 billion per
year from 2015-16. That is in addition to the £5.5
billion of investment in infrastructure announced in last year’s
Autumn Statement. This included £1.5 billion for the road

Soley, and my noble colleague Lady Kramer talked about airports, which
is clearly a significant component of the nation’s
infrastructure. I do not believe that there is total agreement that we
need to have a major national airport hub in this country, but the
Government believe that it is a requirement. As noble Lords know, the
Airports Commission, headed by Sir Howard Davies, is looking at airport
capacity in the short and the long term. We are looking forward to
seeing his interim report later in the
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:51:20"></hs_TimeCode>. In the
mean time, Heathrow has spent £1 billion upgrading
and Gatwick is spending £1.2
billion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:51:27"></hs_TimeCode>, so it
is not as though our airports are atrophying. We know that it is a
long-term issue and has been a long-term problem with no consensus

Soley, talked about housing, which again is a long-term challenge. All
parties have taken their eye off that issue over the past decade as
house prices have risen inexorably and the proportion of the population
owning their own homes has risen. There are three components to
improving the stock and appropriateness of housebuilding. First, we
have to make it easier to build houses. Secondly, we have to help to
supply more houses. Thirdly, we have to make sure that there are no
artificial restraints on demand for
housing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:52:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

National Planning Policy Framework, which we published in March 2010,
has had some effect in a positive direction. The proportion of planning
applications being approved is at a 10-year high, a significant
proportion of which are around housing. As for building more houses, we
already have an £11 billion commitment in the spending review.
The Budget 2013 announced a housing package totalling £5.4
billion, including the Help to Buy and mortgage guarantee schemes.
There is a lot of activity on that front. However, I agree with most
noble Lords that we have to do more, and we are actively attempting to
do so in three strands: to make it easier to get planning, to help have
more finance to build houses, and to make it easier for people to
afford a

component of our economic activity is clearly crucial. To rebalance the
economy, we need to export more. Last week’s evidence of a
narrowing of our trade deficit is a positive sign that UK exporters
have faced significant challenges in recent years. Yesterday’s

important export market, continued in the first quarter of this year.

be looking more

of the world rose by 1.2%. While we look elsewhere, we should not
forget that we are still exporting 42% of our goods and services to the
eurozone. As we try to get more SMEs involved in exporting, many will
go to the eurozone because it is so much easier for a whole raft of
reasons. Getting on a plane or a train to get to a potential export

capitalise on it. They have no idea who the people are who have asked
for this export. The directors have had a long discussion about whether
they should go to Brazil. Eventually, they decided that they will go
but the cost, in time and money, meant that that was a very difficult
decision. If that order had come in from Spain, they would have been
off straightaway. Therefore, as we rightly put more emphasis on the
rest of the world, we must not ignore the fact that the bulk of our

which included George Osborne, it became clear that we had the support

Italy, Spain and the UK agreed to develop and pilot multilateral tax
information exchanges. Also in April, we set out our priorities around
tax transparencies for the May European Council. Most significantly of
all, perhaps, within the past month the overseas territories have

I say in passing that the suggestion that we should be emulating the
Americans to increase car manufacturing here seems to ignore the fact
that car manufacturing has increased here substantially, without
government bailouts but with government support. That is because we

completely turned around iconic British brands by investing more than
£100 million of their own money in innovation and investment.

placing a certain amount of hope are perhaps not worth the paper they
are written on. I paraphrase slightly. However, I think we will have in
the UK what has just happened in the US, where the basis of the
GDP figures is being looked at. I believe this is the case, although it
may not be on exactly the same basis as he wants. The sad thing is that
if the consequence of that rebasing of GDP leads to GDP figures going
down, everybody will say that this is the Government’s fault for
being completely incompetent, while if it shows them going up,
that will lead to everybody saying that they have been fiddled,
so I do not place too much hope on that. A consistent series of figures

encourage British exports. I very much support that. Indeed, I was
quite excited, so maybe we ought to have a word outside afterwards. I
must declare an interest as the chairman of the Good Governance

simply say to him that science and technology deserves a debate on its

slightly disappointed by the Minister’s response because I feel
that he slipped back a bit. Yes, Keynes did say to take interest rates
into account, but in view of the fact that the noble Lord referred to
the long

“In the long term, we are all dead”. That is perhaps
worth remembering, but the important point was really what the IMF and
various economists are saying. I simply remind the Minister of the
quotation I gave from the IMF report: that many advanced countries had
debt to GDP ratios much higher than we have now, and they have dealt
with them through growth. It is the alarmist approach, which I thought
the Government were moving away from, that undermines confidence,
because it says to people, “Oh, we are like Greece”.
Well, we are not. That was a silly argument in the first place. Britain
is in a much stronger position and we should not talk ourselves down in

number of people chided me again for my interest in aviation, let me
say one thing about why this is so important. This is not about hub
airports but about airports generally. It is not about the Davies
report. I gave evidence to that and will do so again. It is that
Britain invented the Industrial Revolution. The second stage of that
revolution resulted in railways, which produced the first country in
recorded history where manufactured goods could be delivered from one
part of the country to the other in large quantities. In other words,
we had the world’s first integrated manufacturing
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000305" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000305">This
is such an important point because what aviation is doing for the
global economy today is what railways did for the British economy in
the 19th century. We lost our lead on railways after the end of the
19th century. We still have the second most advanced
aerospace industry in the world. Do not let us lose our lead in this as
we did on railways, otherwise we will regret it deeply. Aviation
delivers goods, and people, all over the world, and it does not require
public money. Most of it can be done with private money, so your
Lordships can relax a little more about debt. I thank everyone for this
debate.</hs_para>

asked to chair the first post-legislative scrutiny Select Committee on
the current adoption legislation. As we went along, we also became a
pre-legislative scrutiny committee. Consequently, we published an
interim report to express our views on the first two clauses of the
Children and Families Bill in December 2012 and our final report in
March 2013.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000307" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000307">I
begin by thanking the committee staff and our specialist adviser,
Professor Harris-Short, for their dedication—I use that word
deliberately—extremely hard work and the efficiency of their
support in the 
<?notus-xml column=594?>evidence-gathering and in writing the two reports. I am also very
grateful for the enthusiasm and enormously valuable input from the
members of the committee. It would be invidious to single out any
particular organisations among those which gave evidence, and we are
extremely grateful to all of them for their invaluable contributions.
In writing each report, we felt that we were running to keep up as we
received, and had to digest, the Government’s adoption
initiatives at short notice. Our committee staff wrote and rewrote the
reports to meet those initiatives and our views on the adoption clauses
in the Children and Families Bill.</hs_para>

several months and made a considerable number of recommendations. In
the time available, I will pick out several of those that I consider
the most important and refer to the Government’s initial
response. Inevitably, I shall omit important issues. As we considered
the evidence presented to us, we had very much in mind the right of the
child to be brought up in his or her birth family, whenever possible,
and the right of parents and their children to respect for their family
life. Children should not be removed from their birth family unless
their welfare requires it, but, sadly, not all children are able to
remain with their birth families. The welfare of the child is the
paramount
consideration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000309">It
was abundantly clear to us from the evidence that there is no need for
far-reaching changes to the adoption legislation. The main issues of
concern we found were the unacceptable delays in the adoption process,
failures of the processes and practice, and the shortage of adopters.
Even for babies and young children, who are seen as easier to adopt,
the delays are significant. The average age of a child at adoption is
three years and eight months, and the average length of time taken from
entry into care to adoption is two years and seven months. The longer
children wait to be placed, the more difficult the adoption outcome for
them and for the adopters.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13051661000310" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000310">From the evidence
presented to us, we identified numerous failures of procedures and,
particularly, of practice contributing to those delays. Consequently,
much of the evidence we received focused on those failures and how they
might be addressed effectively. Our recommendations have therefore been
largely directed to those issues. They are set out at some length in
our final report. The initial response of the Government sets out
sensible steps to be taken—and steps that are being
taken—to reduce delay, but there is nothing much new or that we
did not know before we started our investigations.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13051661000311" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000311">There is undoubtedly
potential for more children to be adopted. Adoption is unique as a
change of the status of the child who becomes the child of the new
family. The Government are to be congratulated on recognising the
importance of adoption and seeking practical ways to improve the
situation in guidance as well as proposed legislation. However, there
are not enough potential adopters and, further, there are many children
suitable for adoption and placed for adoption—that is, ready
from the court procedures to be adopted—but who are not adopted
for lack of available adoptive parents. In March 2012, there were 4,263
approved adopters and more than 4,600 children who had completed 
<?notus-xml column=595?>the adoption process and were ready to be matched with adopters. The
process of matching is slow. In addition, there were many more children
for whom an adoption decision had been made but who had not completed
the court process. Until now, potential adopters have been largely
recruited by individual local authorities and retained by them on their
books. The national register is an excellent initiative and will, I
hope, mean that approved adopters will be more widely available, which
should improve the matching process from a wider pool.</hs_para>

only one relatively small solution to the large numbers of children
entering the care system. For various reasons, adoption is not
appropriate for many children. On 31 March 2012, there were 67,050
children in care, of whom more than 60,000 were placed away from their
families. Proper provision has to be made for these vulnerable children
who need to be looked after away from their birth parents. All these
children need to be loved, cared for and provided with stability and
long-term security. Most of them may be cared for by other members of
their family, friends, special guardianship or long-term fostering.
However, a danger was articulated to me by a district judge this week
that the 26-week requirement for the completion of care proceedings may
concentrate on process rather than on the welfare of the child and may
create injustices through the inability of some social workers to make
adequate assessments of the birth family and of the wider family who
might otherwise be able to take over the care of the child. I therefore
stress the importance of early family conferencing throughout all local
authorities.</hs_para>

concerned that the Government’s proper concern with and focus on
increasing adoption may risk disadvantaging those children in care for
whom adoption is not an option. Improving the outcomes for all children
should be the priority. All routes to permanence merit equal attention
and investment. In the initial response, the Government have set out
a number of steps already taken to improve the
fostering process and commissioned research on special
guardianship.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000314" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000314">The
committee believes that early intensive work with birth parents where
there is capacity to change has the potential to allow the children to
remain safely with their parent or parents and would reduce the number
of children entering the care system. There are excellent
government-supported early-intervention initiatives, but the committee
was concerned that a substantial sum—£150
million—is to be removed from early intervention to help local
authorities improve their adoption procedures. The Government’s
initial response has, rather surprisingly, been to point out that
fostering for adoption is a form of early intervention. That is true,
but it removes the child from the birth family. Early intervention,
working with the birth family, can be successful and, if so, the child
can remain in the family and fostering for adoption would not be
necessary. It would be most unfortunate if the potential benefit of
early intervention were to be undermined by the greater focus on
adoption.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000315" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000315">We
are told that a significant increase in the budget is being allocated
to early intervention. I should like to

post-adoption support, most children are adopted from the care system
and most of them, other than babies, will have had unhappy experiences
in their birth family, which is why they have been removed from the
family. Adoption provides the opportunity for the adopted children to
have a secure and stable childhood. It does not rid them of the unhappy
early part of their lives. Some of these children present major
problems for their new, adoptive families and both the children and
their new parents often need a great deal of practical help,
counselling and therapeutic help. It is much to the credit of the
Government that they now recognise the importance of post-adoption
support. The adoption passport will be available online to be accessed
by potential adopters and sets out the help which may be available to
them.</hs_para>

committee recommended that there should be a statutory duty on local
authorities and other service-commissioning bodies to co-operate, to
ensure the provision of post-adoption support. The Government have not
responded directly to that recommendation—it would be fair to
say that they avoided doing so—and I hope that it will be
seriously considered when the Children and Families Bill reaches this
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000318" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000318">We
invited adopted and looked-after children to come and talk to some of
the members of the committee; we are indebted to the Children’s
Rights Director, Roger Morgan, for arranging for these children to
come. Both groups ranged in age from about 17 down to eight and were
most informative, particularly the younger children when they developed
sufficient confidence to tell us what they really thought. The two
points I pick out today were said by both groups of children. First,
they were not consulted. They did not expect that their views would be
accepted, but at least they might be asked. Most of them were very
critical of independent reviewing officers whom they had not met or who
were not helpful to them; to the contrary were one or two children
whose independent reviewing officers had done a very good job with
them. Some children were critical of their guardians, who neither spoke
nor listened to them.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:21:27"></hs_TimeCode> am
disappointed that the Government have rejected our recommendation that
IROs should be genuinely independent—it is an important
issue—but I hope that something effective will be done about the
IRO case
overload.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000319" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000319">The
second point the children raised concerned the training in schools of
other pupils about the meaning of adoption and the meaning of being
“in care”. Much more importantly, however, they focused
on the training needed by teachers. Two adopted children told us that
they were criticised by their teachers for being unable to complete a
family tree. They were actually put in front of the class and told that
they were being unhelpful. I cannot believe any teacher could be so
insensitive as to tell an adopted child that he or she was not
supportive of the class when they were unable to produce a family tree
of their new family. I am glad that the Government are looking at this
important issue of teachers.</hs_para>

outcomes and data. The Government have rightly concentrated on the
importance of improving processes, but there has not yet been
sufficient focus on outcomes. Some adoptions fail, with disastrous
results for the child and for the adopters and with considerable
additional cost to the state in taking a seriously damaged child back
into care. We need much more data and research on breakdown and how it
can be avoided. The Government say that they are looking at it. I hope
very much that they take some effective steps to find out what lies
behind these breakdowns.</hs_para>

helpful if a child’s passage from the moment of going into care
to being placed in adoption, and thereafter, was monitored so that one

headmaster’s stick behind the curtain, which is the possibility
of directions. I have to admit to a personal dislike of any clause that
has directions in it as there is no parliamentary procedure for
appealing against the decision of a Secretary of State.</hs_para>

that may be—let us hope that Clause 3 never needs to be

remember quite a number of things. A lot of very expert people are
involved in these complicated matters: not least, of course, the
courts. Views about child psychology and the best interests of the
child are a moving target. I was an economist at one time and, as noble
Lords will know, no two economists agree. I am not sure that any two
child psychiatrists entirely agree either. There is a very wide
intellectual background to these matters and of course there are wide
differences on the

demographics of Bradford are not the same as those of north Yorkshire
and Hackney is very different from Southall. The divergences of
circumstances on the ground—between local authorities and
between individual circumstances—are enormous. As the chairman
has already said, we found—and the evidence completely 
<?notus-xml column=598?>supported this—that the behaviour within the existing system is
much more important than the probably helpful tweaks that can be given
to it in legislation. This issue of the behaviour within the existing
system will stay with us. That is why I am very interested in how the
Government approach their relationships with local authorities in a
matter such as this.</hs_para>

authorities are responsible for such a small part of their own funding

governance of the eurozone and the monetary problems that arise from
that, but there are parallels. If you split these responsibilities in a
quite draconian way, it does not help and it contributes to the public
not turning out in very large numbers in local government elections and
coming to think of their elected representatives as delegates—a
very non-Burkean position. Centralisation makes the question of the
postcode lottery more difficult. Dealing with children in care in Kent

how to handle these matters in the best possible way. I suppose that
that is inevitable. Therefore, the question becomes whether the

about them and an acceptance that we have to get on with thinking about
this very carefully, even if we are somewhat uncertain about the right
answer. Otherwise, uncertainty will have to be rationalised out and so
will become indifference and certainly delay. Therefore the central
issue is how the Government intend, in their relationship with local
authorities, to impart a degree of confidence that will lead to a
degree of certainty and a willingness to make decisions in a timely
fashion. That goes right through all the people involved in the system,

Armstrong of Hill Top:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the House for
appointing me to this committee. It was my first Select Committee at
this end of the building, 
<?notus-xml column=599?>and I enjoyed being part of a very thorough piece of work with a very
interesting and varied group of people, with very different expertise
and experience. Of course we were expertly chaired by the noble and
learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. I had the enormous privilege of
encountering her chairmanship much earlier in both our careers, when
she chaired the Cleveland child abuse public inquiry. I was new to the
House of Commons but I had been working as a social worker in the
north-east, so was involved and interested in the issue. I was also
serving on the then Education Bill Committee in the Commons. This was,
I think, in 1998—the Bill became the 1998 Act. I was able to
learn from her work and report in getting a much firmer framework for
child protection in this country. She was immensely gracious to those
of us who were new to Select Committee work in this House, and very
tolerant of our different approaches, and I am very grateful to her for
that. I am also grateful that she has today given us a much more
expansive report, in a sense, of the overall conclusions of the
committee, because I want to concentrate on a much narrower area of the
committee’s considerations. However, it is important for noble
Lords to remember the whole context in which the committee was
working<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:35:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000333" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000333">Adoption
is, of course, an important option for children who are not able, for
whatever reason, to be cared for by their birth parents, but it is
sometimes forgotten that the pattern of adoption has changed
significantly over the past 50 years. No longer is it dominated by
newly born babies, probably put up for adoption because their mothers
were out of wedlock. These days, that is not the main reason for
children coming into care or, indeed, being placed for adoption. Many
of the children who are placed for adoption today will be from what the
Government often call “troubled families”, which means
that many of them will have had very traumatic experiences in their
childhood and will be very damaged by the neglect, violence or abuse
that they have already
suffered<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000334" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000334">The
report is trying, in the areas with which I am concerned, to establish
that careful balance between the importance of achieving early
permanence for vulnerable children alongside that key recognition that
the best place for a child is to be raised within the family network,
provided that it is safe and in their best interests. I remember as a
social worker many moons ago just how anxious and obsessed were many
adolescents with whom I worked because they did not have contact with
their birth parents or their early family. It did not matter what we
did in the care system; they wanted to know, wanted the reasons and
wanted to see what we could do to establish contact. Today, if they go
down the adoption road, that is very difficult for them. For me that
means that we have a responsibility to take early intervention
seriously. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:38:25"></hs_TimeCode>
committee felt that the careful balance that I am talking about could
be met only by effective early intervention. Again, my experience as a
Minister in tackling social exclusion was that there are good
evidence-based programmes around the world on early intervention. There
is now a lot of knowledge and work around that, and we have a
responsibility to use that knowledge, now that we know.</hs_para>

is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:38:58"></hs_TimeCode> increasing
evidence of the importance of the time from conception to the age of
two in the development of a child. We know that this is the crucial
phase of human development. It is in this period that children form
those solid psychological and neurological foundations to optimise
lifelong social, emotional and physical health, and that of course then
has such an important effect on their educational and economic
achievement. Lack of attachment, neglect and abuse all have serious
detrimental effects on children, and severely affect that

commend to the House a report that has been published since the
committee deliberated this issue from the special interest group for
nought to two year-olds set up by the Government. The report was
co-written by Sally Burlington at the Department for Education and
George Hosking, CEO of the Wave Trust. I remind the House of my
interest as a trustee of that
organisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:40:04"></hs_TimeCode>. I
hope the Minister has been briefed on that report as it clearly points
out that the most effective interventions are often preventive rather
than reactive. The report says that preventive interventions address
risk factors likely to result in future problems for particular
families without waiting for those problems to emerge. That is
precisely what I urge the Government to do. Although we considered
early intervention we were not able to look at that report, but I think
that many of us on the committee agree with that
finding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:41:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000337" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000337">We
heard from the NSPCC about some of the work that that organisation has
done in this area. I talked about evidence-based programmes such as the
Family Nurse Partnership, and continue to do so. Indeed, some people
think that I am obsessed with those programmes. I had the privilege of
witnessing the Family Nurse Partnership in the United States of America
and then persuading my Cabinet colleagues to fund pilot programmes in
this country. It became clear from that work that health visitors and
midwives are the key to achieving better health and well-being for
children in their foundation years. We are simply not sufficiently
innovative in how we use their knowledge and expertise to understand
what is happening to children and prospective parents in these most
vulnerable families. If we used their work much more creatively, we
would be able to take decisions which could well achieve the
Government’s ambition of providing more early placements and
early decision-making. We have the opportunity to change the manner in
which parents behave, or are likely to behave, towards their children.
We now know about that from the Nurse Family Partnership; or the Family
Nurse Partnership, as we have rechristened it. We know what can be
done. We know how we can change the behaviour and ambition of young
mothers undergoing their first pregnancy. That should be the
overarching ambition in early
intervention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:42:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000338" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000338">The
challenge for the Government is to get the legislation right to ensure
that families are given the right support at the right stage to avoid
problems of neglect and abuse so that the child’s interests are
attended to before damage is done. If that work is guaranteed, if there
is no prospect of the parents’ behaviour changing, or of other
appropriate kinship carers, families or friends taking on the care of
the child, permanent solutions should kick in quickly. We 
<?notus-xml column=601?>have just not been good enough at this. We have not been good enough at
early identification or early intervention to optimise the
child’s opportunities. Too often potential carers among family
and friends are not investigated at an early stage: it comes as an
afterthought. Too often there is insufficient support for kinship
carers. Earlier this week, I popped into the Family Rights Group
reception in the Palace of Westminster. Members of that body gave
evidence to the committee. At the reception we heard about the
experience of kinship carers, which was incredibly moving. However, we
also heard their pleas for greater
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000339" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000339">I
accept that there is, on occasion, risk in kinship placements. Anyone
who has listened to the remarkable story of my very good right
honourable friend along the Corridor, Alan Johnson, about his
experience of kinship care, knows that taking a risk is important. He
had a remarkable social worker who was prepared to take that risk and
leave him with his sister who was 16. However, such risk should be
mediated by the guarantee of support, and that is the issue on which
many kinship carers feel we let them down. The Government sort of
acknowledge that in their response to the report, but I want more
action on that. I would like them to take account of the
recommendations of recent research by Oxford University for the Family
Rights Group, which gives us a menu of how we might provide that
support more

covered many other aspects of the report. I conclude by saying that
sometimes the rhetoric from the Government about adoption overshadows
the other things that the committee knows are important—indeed,
our chairperson has identified them as being important—such as
early identification and the menu of different forms of permanence for
children in care. It is important to recognise the complex jigsaw of
ways forward, and I know that that is where the Government are, even if
the rhetoric sometimes belies

this instance I think that that is important, because it reinforces the
central 
<?notus-xml column=605?>message. I felt that the noble and learned Baroness and my computer had
been in collusion, but I can assure him that they were not. I have
known the noble and learned Baroness down the years because she was
president of the Family Division when I had the somewhat mixed

right to concentrate hard on this aspect of children’s needs
because, as the Minister must know, there really is a crisis at the
moment in childcare. Care applications in April 2013 were 20% higher
than in the previous year. We really cannot continue on that sort of
trajectory. To quote the chief executive of CAFCASS, the number of
children legally freed for adoption but without an adopter available is
increasing relentlessly. As has been said, the figure is just below the
5,000 mark. Not only do we need to ensure speedy but appropriate
planning for these children, but we must stem the flow by questioning
what it is in our society, our services and our systems that brings so
many children into care. What can we do better in order to support
children at
home?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000362" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000362">Apart
from the possibility of safe reunification with one or both
parents—sometimes it is with one parent if the other parent can
be distanced; I will return to that later—children can find
secure, loving relationships through kinship care, permanent fostering,
special guardianship and good residential care. We have seen that, as
special guardianship has increased, sometimes adoption has gone down.
That has been seen as a reduction in adoption but what we should be
looking for is permanence, not a particular answer. Children often need
combinations of care at different stages of their childhood and the
development of their family. By overemphasising
one—adoption—we may demean the others. Different pathways
also require a variety of support services. We acknowledge gratefully
what the Government have proposed through the adoption passport,
recognising the wide need of adopted children, but we regret that the
provision of the services identified is not to be a statutory duty. We
hope that the Government will look again at this through the Children
and Families
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000363" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000363">It has
been said several times this afternoon that the committee endorsed the
importance accorded to the right of a child to be raised within their
birth family wherever possible. If I could say that in bold and
underlined, I would do so. I have spent enough of my working life, as
many of my colleagues know, developing safeguarding programmes, dealing
with the worst of neglect or harm and indeed the murder of children by
their parents, to have a more than realistic picture of what life can
be like for some children left in unsafe situations. Indeed, we know
from consultation directly with children that top of the list of things
that they look for is to be safe.</hs_para>

enough years as a social worker involved with families with complex
problems to know that, with clear assessment, proper planning and

changes. We have heard about the 
<?notus-xml column=606?>NSPCC programme, which has had very good outcomes. All this will lead to
positive family life, but it takes skill, time and, especially, good
social work intervention, and that is where there is a key difficulty
for local authorities at the moment. In this regard, where parents have
the capacity to change, the committee was clear that evidence in favour
of that early, intensive intervention to address family problems is
compelling.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000365" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000365">As
I said, local authorities, particularly their social workers, are under
severe pressure. It was therefore with deep concern that we learnt that
adoption reform is to be funded by taking money from the early
intervention grant. I ask the Minister directly: how can good early
decision-making based on these clear assessments be achieved, with
permanency planning being prioritised one month after entry into care,
without the financing of a skilled workforce to carry this out? Social
workers continue to have a bad press and remain undervalued in terms of
pay and conditions of service, and I wonder sometimes why any person
joins the service. But we need teams who can approach every new
situation with a broad understanding of children and their families,
where adoption is fully integrated into child protection and family
support. We need a more rounded approach, which we had at some point in
the past.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000366" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000366">The

simply to say that further information to support the Bill’s
provisions would be provided. Is the Minister in a position to provide

to support and develop social workers in their practice? As our chair
has done, I draw attention to the position of independent reviewing
officers and ask what is to be done to ensure that their decisions are
independent of their employing authorities and their workloads are
manageable. We heard during the inquiry of one case where a reviewing
officer really took the brunt of a serious mistake and then discovered
that his workload was totally impossible. Anyone carrying that workload

committee came to the conclusion that concurrent planning is essential
and I am delighted that CAFCASS and the Association of Directors of
Children’s Services are undertaking work on early permanence
analysis. This approach reflects the concern and commitment of those
working for children—people who know that a week in a
child’s life is a long time. I welcome the Government’s
response to make it a duty of the local authority to place a child with
carers who may go on to be their permanent carers at a very early
stage. However, I hope that care will also be taken in ensuring the
human rights of families, which means having the right length of time
for social workers to engage and make their decisions. In saying that,
I again acknowledge that there are times when immediate intervention
must take
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000368">It has
been said previously that we have no evidence, except anecdotal
evidence, of the broad success or failure of adoption. I found this
astounding having 
<?notus-xml column=607?>been involved in childcare statistics for many years. We urge the
Government to undertake research that, by gathering statistics of
adoption breakdown, would give some basis for planning. While everyone
in the children’s social care field welcomes any plans to reduce
the time taken by care proceedings, I repeat that there must be enough
time to make appropriate plans. Nothing that I have said in support of
social work with birth families indicates a lack of value for adoption;
it simply indicates a need for a balance. I have direct personal and
professional experience of the security that a good adoptive family can
achieve, but we must assess each child’s situation on its
merits.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13051661000369" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000369">To
meet the expectation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child,
we must wherever possible ensure that the child is an active
participant in their future. We have heard how often children felt that
things were being done to them rather than with them. The Royal Borough
of Kensington and Chelsea has recently introduced an advocacy service
to ensure that children can be properly heard and their
views incorporated into decisions at the child protection conference
stage. That is a good deal earlier than family conferences. When the
child is old enough, it is essential that their views are known. The
NCB only yesterday published a report, <I>Time to Listen</I>,
showing how advocacy can enhance
children’s involvement. If we are to get the placements right,
including adoption, we must know what the children think and feel. It
does not necessarily mean that that will the right plan, but how can
you make a good professional assessment without listening to the
children? Recent events in Oxford surely illustrate what happens when
they are not heard. I wonder what else the Government are doing to
encourage child participation and
advocacy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000370" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000370">I
repeat: a week in the life of a child can be a lifetime. Whatever path
we take to ensure that each child has a happy and secure permanent
placement must be found with skill and application. I look forward to
the Children and Families Bill and to the Minister’s
response to the issues raised today, but I ask him and his
colleagues to remember that, while leaving a child in an unsafe
situation and without adequate support can be a death sentence,
removing a child from parents is for them a life sentence. Those
difficult decisions, keeping the child always at the centre of
consideration, require professionals who can deliver what the
Government in partnership with local authorities need to do. It is
practice rather than legislation that will make the difference. I hope
to hear what the Government are going to do to ensure that that
practice is
adequate.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_16_PT_1/4D01B73E2CFAFC461B5F57BB3472AA5E0F46465B" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 May 2013">Thursday,

this subject is that we were more or less able to approach it from a
non-party-political angle. No one in this House would not want to see
Britain treat its most vulnerable children in a fairer manner. I say

Government’s desire to improve life chances for children in the

shocked and must confess my ignorance because I did not realise that
when we talk about children in care today in Britain some 56% of them
are over the age of 10 and will never realistically be
adopted. Although I am evangelical on the subject of
adoption—even more evangelical than the Secretary of State in
the other place as I have three adopted children—to focus on
adoption at the expense of other permanent care solutions would
inevitably be to neglect over half our children in care. That simply is
not an
option.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000374" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000374">The
best way to help children in care is to change circumstances in their
birth families so that they are not taken into care in the first place.
That is why every single member of the committee to speak so far has
brought up the subject of early intervention and the fact
that the grant was raided, manoeuvred or manipulated. Whatever word you
want to use, the Government announced they were taking £150
million from councils’ early intervention grants. The Government
argued they were doing so because adoption is a form of early
intervention. Of course that is true but the whole point of
“early” early intervention is to prevent children being
removed from their birth families in the first place. In that respect,
adoption is not early intervention but an act of last resort when all
else has

we heard time and again that either families today are failing more and
more often or their failure has now become unacceptable. Whatever the
reasons for that, the upshot is clear: we heard again and again that
the water table is rising. All the professionals we took evidence from
were alarmed by the rising tide of children coming into the care
system. If more money is taken out of early intervention then even more
children will be put up for adoption. The NSPCC has

we are on the subject of money, I want to mention post-adoption
support. This was one of the committee’s most important
recommendations. We proposed a statutory duty to co-operate so that
families which adopt Britain’s most vulnerable children receive
the professional help they need. Of course, they do not know when that
help will be required. It might be six weeks after they adopt a child
or it might be six or 10 years. We are talking about
children who have been abandoned, neglected or abused—whether
physically, emotionally or sexually. They may be withdrawn when they
arrive at their new families. They may be physically aggressive towards
their new parents. I have spoken to many adoptive parents who were
literally taken aback at what hit them when newly adopted children
arrived in their families. The idea that these new parents should be
left to deal with the consequences of early abuse and neglect is
unconscionable. It is also financially 
<?notus-xml column=609?>irresponsible. The costs of adoption breakdown are met by the state and
it is invariably more expensive to take a child back into care than to
give those families the help they need at the appropriate

an adoptive parent who was forced to return to work early. She was not
eligible for statutory maternity pay because her child was adopted and
she worked freelance. If you are freelance and you have a baby, you
receive SMP, but if you are freelance and you adopt a baby, you do not.
I know that that is true because the same thing happened to me. I
submit that I am more able to deal with that situation than many
freelancers. It is iniquitous and a clear case of discrimination that
if you adopt a baby and are freelance, you do not get the same support
as if it was a birth baby. That is despite the fact that an adoptive
child has an even greater need than a birth child to form healthy
attachments with its new parents. I should be very grateful if the
Minister would undertake to write to me on the issue, if he cannot give
a response at this

a committee, so ably led by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Butler-Sloss, was a great honour and pleasure. One felt that one was
doing something really worth while. I very much thank her, the members
of staff who supported us and all those who gave an enormous amount of
time to present us with evidence. 
<?notus-xml column=610?>It was the evidence to which we listened and responded and which has
been produced in our report. If we are interested in evidence-based

have been involved with adoption since I was three years old, because
at that point I suddenly acquired a little brother. This was not
because my mummy had had a big bump in her tummy. At that age, I did
not realise that that was a bit odd. I acquired a little brother
through family adoption. A close member of the family died immediately
after she gave birth and the baby became my little brother.
Subsequently, his older siblings became regular visitors to our house
and became sort of second-stage members of our

adoptive parents go through all the hassle of being approved and all
the decision-making because they want to add to their family. They want
to give a child a loving home. However, the child brings something
terribly important to that family and we must never forget that when
adoptive parents give the wonderful gift of a home to a baby, the child
also brings something very important to that

was put in legislation because racial issues are an important
consideration in the identity of the child. When the Select Committee
was taking evidence, we heard pretty unanimous evidence that people
felt that there was not a lot wrong with the Government’s
intention when that recommendation was put into what was then the Bill.
However, there were a few cases—this should not be
overemphasised—where there was excessive delay in the system
because the practice was not quite right. Some social workers took that
part of the legislation as a message to say that racial matching was an
overriding consideration when matching a child with a
family<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T16:28:01"></hs_TimeCode>. Most

are very keen to reduce delay from whatever cause. Therefore, they have
looked at this issue and said, “We are going to cut it out 
<?notus-xml column=611?>completely from the legislation”. The Children and Families Bill
before us, which, I imagine will go through in 2013, has removed that
consideration. Our Select Committee recommended something slightly
different. Accepting that racial matching is an important factor and
that the adoptive family must be aware of the needs of the child
because of the racial part of his or her nature, we need to put it in
somewhere. It has to be taken account of by practitioners. It should
not be an overriding consideration but it is important. We suggested
that it should go in the previous subsection, subsection (4)
of the Adoption and Children Act, as part of the checklist. But I do
not see anything like that in the legislation before us to implement

that where you have an interracial adoption which involves a visible
difference between a child and the rest of his or her family, they
might as well have a sign on their forehead saying, “I am
adopted”. To me, that is a great thing to have because it means
that your family has chosen you. You have not just happened. Your
family wants you and there is no doubt about that, which is a wonderful
thing. Most of these adoptions are highly successful, but really only
when the agencies work with the parents to ensure that the parents
understand that this is an element they have to take into consideration
when bringing up that

why our committee, which was remarkably unanimous on most issues, felt
that this issue should not be taken out completely but should be in the

was being discussed in a committee in another place the Minister, Mr
Edward Timpson, for whom I have a great regard, assured the committee
that it was going to be in the checklist. However, it is not being put
into the legislation, so I wonder whether my noble friend the Minister
can clarify that matter because I think the committee all felt very
strongly that while it should not be an overriding consideration, it is
a very important one and must be taken into account when finding the
right family for the
child.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000390" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000390">Of
course, we have a problem because black and ethnic minority and
mixed-race children are overrepresented in the cohort of children
waiting for adoption and we do not have enough parents of that kind of
ethnicity coming forward and asking to be adoptive parents. One way of
solving that problem is to try to get more of those parents to come
forward and foster and maybe move on to adoption, or just to go
straight to adoption. I am sure that the Government are taking
initiatives in that direction, which is very welcome, but we need to do
more.</hs_para>

is quite dangerous because of the message it sends out to
practitioners, which has been mentioned. Those practitioners who took
the wrong message from the previous legislation might swing in
completely the opposite direction and say, “The Government do
not want us to take any notice at all of ethnicity when matching
children and families”. We know that is not the
Government’s intention. The previous Government’s
intention was not that it should become an overriding factor but
because of what happened, we need to think very carefully about the
message if we take it out completely.</hs_para>

to a couple of other issues in relation to overseas adoption. First, I
am very disappointed that the Government have rejected our
recommendation to extend priority access to schools for children
adopted from care overseas. Why not? This is very mean-minded, as we
are not talking about a large number of children. These children, as
much as any who have been adopted from care in this country, have gone
through difficult situations and if the parents have chosen the school
they think is most suitable for them, they should be given their
wish.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13051661000393" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000393">Secondly, there is the
visa applications delay. It is complete agony for parents who have gone
through all the processes of being approved to be parents of a child
adopted from overseas to then have to wait for a visa application. It
comes as no surprise when a visa application is put in for a child to
be adopted from overseas; the parents have been going through this
process for years. Is there no way in which some kind of conditional
visa could be issued, subject to the proper approvals and the adoption
going through with the authorities both in this country and the country
of origin of the child, so that could then be ratified quickly once the
adoption has gone through? It is not a good start to the adoption of a
child from overseas to have to be separated from the new parents.

perhaps I might say a quick word about family group conferencing.
Again, best practice is something that we as a Government should be
doing everything to disseminate. I noticed that where we recommended
that family group conferencing should always happen, the
Government’s response to our report said that it is not
appropriate in some cases and that the family has to agree to it. You
could always<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T16:35:03"></hs_TimeCode>
make it conditional on the family agreeing to it. At the very least,
should we not be saying in guidance that family group conferencing
should always be considered as long as the family accepts it? It can
reduce delays, which is what we all want. We can avoid situations where
family members come forward at the last minute, when all the other
processes have gone through, so that we have to do all the assessments
and there will be further weeks of delay for that child. We have heard
that every week’s delay is bad and contributes to the damage
that that child suffers. I hope that the Government will consider those
few
suggestions.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_16_PT_1/1703328FCBE9D14436E3A1A9E0D74EFECB54F77B" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 May 2013">Thursday,

materials for health professionals and will be looking to NICE to
consider how teachers might be provided with a wider range of resources
in this area. I commend the Government’s work in this area. I
know its importance from the Caspari Foundation. It is essential that
teachers have a better idea of child development and of what happens
with children who have experienced trauma. I hope the Minister has a

confidence in judges, but in reducing the number of expert witnesses
and saving the courts money I hope the fact that the court still needs
to attract the best expert witnesses is not overlooked. As has been

psychiatrist and psychologists. One needs to attract the best of these

so long past, I recall the noble Earl, Lord Howe, making an eloquent
case for the assessment of adopters’ needs and for duties on
local authorities to meet those assessed needs in the course of past
adoption legislation. I remind your Lordships of the young man I worked
with a few years ago in north London. I had a summer placement on a
play scheme and this 10 year-old was just about to be placed for
adoption. In the lunch hour, he would rock himself in a tractor tyre in
the setting. During activities, he would simply walk away and a member
of staff would have to trail him on his journeys. He repeatedly got
himself into arguments and fights with the other children. One saw in
him what one would expect in a child who has experienced multiple
trauma, multiple losses of carers, abuse or neglect. He had regressed
to a much earlier stage of his development: he was more an infant than
a 10 year-old in many ways.</hs_para>

supported when they adopt such challenging young people. I am grateful
for the recognition of this in the Government’s response. The
prospect of inadequate support and a further placement breakdown, a
further trauma or loss for the child, is unthinkable but not so
unusual. As has been pointed out many times today, we simply do not
know how often placement breakdown happens, and the details of why.
That needs to be
addressed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000403" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000403">Adopters
also need to be supported in managing any contact the child may have
with his biological parents and his siblings, and in speaking with the
child about his past. Yesterday, I spoke with a care leaver about his
experience. He repeated what he had said in the past: good
communication is key to a child’s success through care. Adoptive
parents need to have the confidence to be honest with their adopted
children. The current film release “The Place Beyond the
Pines” has a scene in which an adolescent tells his mother that
she had lied to him, before he leaves the house to seek revenge for his
father's killing. He had been told by his mother that his father had
had an accident rather than that he had been shot dead. That moment
seems uncanny in its appropriateness to our debate today. The young man
says to his mother, “You are a liar”. One would not wish
that to happen in any adoptive situation. Unless adoptive parents are
really well supported, there may be similar difficulties when
adolescence comes.</hs_para>

comments on the challenges of adolescence. I have worked with 16 to 23
year-olds over a number of years. I have witnessed a teenager

outburst of anger and hatred from seemingly nowhere and with young men
who in depression, as has been mentioned already, are unable to stir
from the couch on which they
lie.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000405" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0002.htm#13051661000405">It is
generally accepted that children in the course of their development go
through a period of latency between the ages of five to 10 years-old
and then, as they enter adolescence, a period in which they
recapitulate their earliest development, from nought to five, with its
jealousy, tantrums and all its uncontrollable feelings. However, in
adolescence, they experience this in bodies that can act on these
impulses. They can hurt themselves 
<?notus-xml column=615?>or others, they can take what is not theirs, and they can set the house
on fire if they choose to. Adopters need help, therefore, when their
child enters adolescence. Early trauma that may have lain dormant will
more than likely reappear in these years. Adopters need a right to the
assessment of need and to services when their child enters
adolescence.</hs_para>

future the police will be given the names and addresses of
children’s homes in their area so that they can better protect
vulnerable children. Rules will also be changed so that
children’s homes in unsafe areas—such as in the same
street as a bail hostel housing paedophiles—can be closed down
or refused registration. There will also be stricter rules on out of
area placements where children are placed in homes miles away from
their home areas. Almost half of all children are placed in
children’s homes out of their areas and this makes them
susceptible to sexual predators … In future the government wants
a decision to place a child in care away from their home town to only
be made by a senior council official, who will have to be satisfied
that the placement is in the child’s best interest. The new
rules will also set out a requirement for the placing authority to
consult with the local area authority before they place a child in a
home. There will also be a duty on homes to notify local area
authorities when children move in from other local authority areas and
when they leave the home. … Better and more intense training

that these issues will not be lost when we finish debating the Bill,

will highlight some issues in the report where there might be
differences of approach between us and the current Government. A number
of points that I will make echo those raised by the noble and learned
Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, in her excellent introduction to the
debate. First, we believe that the benefits of adoption over other
permanent care solutions have been overstated. As the report points
out, adoption is a sensible route out of care only for a proportion of
children, and there is a danger that the current emphasis on this
option will skew resources away from those providing equally beneficial
forms of care. This point was made eloquently by my noble friend Lady
King. Therefore we believe that it is essential, when a child’s
future care options are assessed, that all potential provisions are
considered on an equal footing, including long-term fostering, kinship
care and special guardianship. We would like to see this in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T16:51:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000417" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0003.htm#13051661000417">Secondly,
we believe absolutely in the importance of early intervention. This
means early intervention in supporting birth mothers and early
intervention if a decision is needed to remove a child into care. This
is why we have been so frustrated that the Government have allowed the
Sure Start schemes to wither on the vine through lack of funding. This
was and is a cost-effective way of providing community support and
education to new mothers, particularly in deprived areas. It encourages
new mothers to step out of the isolation of a potentially dysfunctional
home environment and learn how to nurture their child successfully. It
is 
<?notus-xml column=617?>crucial for identifying family problems from birth. I echo the points
made by my noble friend Lady Armstrong concerning the role that health
visitors and midwives can play. No other schemes that the Government
are proposing come anywhere near the scale and comprehensiveness of the
services that are being
disbanded<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T16:52:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000418" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0003.htm#13051661000418">Early
intervention also requires social workers with the training, judgment
and experience to act decisively when a family is unable to meet the
expectations of basic care and nurture. This is inevitably a tough call
and should not be made alone. Equally, we should not allow bureaucratic
form-filling to get in the way of social workers acting in
the child’s best interests, and should not allow parents to play
the system and drag out any chance of their child being removed and
having a better
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T16:52:53"></hs_TimeCode>. These
issues go to the heart of how we value, judge and reward good
performance among social workers. I agree very much with the points
made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, with her considerable
experience<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T16:53:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000419" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0003.htm#13051661000419">Thirdly,
there has been considerable debate about the status of ethnicity in
matching children to potential adopters. We believe that the wording on
this in the previous legislation was clear. It made it clear that the
interests of the child were paramount, and that in this context due
consideration should be given to their religion, race, culture and
linguistic background. Since then, there have been a number of
allegations that the requirement is being overprescribed, leaving
children trapped in care and awaiting a perfect racial
match. The extent to which this has happened is difficult to
quantify, but if the fundamental principles of placements need to be
restated, let us use this opportunity to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T16:53:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000420" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0003.htm#13051661000420">We
are concerned that the Government have moved too far in the opposite
direction by attempting to remove altogether the reference to
ethnicity. Again, I echo the point that it would be helpful if the
Minister would clarify the Government’s position, because it
appears that by denying that we risk causing real hardship and
unhappiness to children by placing them in families that do not
understand their heritage. That is why we will push in the Bill for
ethnicity to be listed as a welfare factor in the checklist to be taken
into account in the matching process. This point was made by the noble
Baroness, Lady
Walmsley<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T16:54:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000421" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0003.htm#13051661000421">Fourthly,
we absolutely understand the argument that there are too many adoption
providers in England, which reduces the scope for making successful
matches for adoption. Clearly, it is not acceptable that agencies guard
information about suitable adopters or children awaiting adoption and
are not prepared to share it for the common good. We are pleased to see
that consortia and joint local authority working, combined with
improvements to the national register, are beginning to address these
problems. Further funding and inspection mechanisms could be used to
make this the
norm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000422" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0003.htm#13051661000422">However,
we share the concern of the committee that it is premature for the
Secretary of State to take on extra centralising powers, in addition to
the swathe of powers that he has already taken across the education
sphere, to force outsourcing of adoption services. If anything, this
might result in a greater fragmentation of the service at a time when
streamlining is
required<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T16:55:23"></hs_TimeCode>. In
addition, we want to be assured that proper measures 
<?notus-xml column=618?>are in place to scrutinise the decision-making process of the Secretary
of State and hold him to account when the outsourcing of services is
imposed. This is something that has been missing in other aspects of
education provision, and we will return to the issue during the course
of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T16:56:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000423" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0003.htm#13051661000423">Finally,
the key to judging how successful any measures are is to look at the
outcomes. We know from statistics that looked-after children have worse
health, education and employment outcomes than their peers, and this
should continue to be a real worry for us. We have also heard that the
older the child being adopted, the more likely it is that the adoption
breaks down. However, as the report suggests, we need more hard facts
on this. We believe that it is our responsibility to compensate
looked-after children for the effects of early trauma, including
removal from their birth mother, by providing extra investment in their
care and support so that they can catch up and have parity with their
peers. One way of doing this is to provide all looked-after children
with a virtual school head, who will take responsibility for their
educational attainment. We are also keen to explore other means by
which outcomes can be measured and improved. Again, we will raise these
issues during the course of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T16:56:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000424" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0003.htm#13051661000424">I
am grateful for the opportunity to raise these issues today as a
rehearsal for the issues arising in consideration of the Bill. Again, I

their birth parents, we must ensure they are provided with a safe and

overwhelming evidence of harm being done to vulnerable children and
inexcusable levels of drift and delay in care and adoption services.
That is why, alongside our work to improve outcomes for children in

grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, for his words about that

believe that the Children and Families Bill carefully strikes the
necessary balance between putting in place a maximum 26-week time limit
to tackle delay in all cases while also allowing sufficient judicial
discretion to extend time where necessary to resolve the case justly,
having explicit regard to the child’s welfare. The Bill also
ensures that when making any timetabling decision, including whether to
grant an extension, the court must have specific regard to the impact
on the welfare of the child. As the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Butler-Sloss, said, a family group conference helps to ensure that all
relevant measures are
considered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T17:00:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051661000430" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516-0003.htm#13051661000430">I
am pleased to address the points concerning reform of adopter
recruitment. We have identified several problems with adopter
recruitment such as the small scale of many adoption agencies and the
fact that local authorities look first to their own adopters and then
to adopters recruited by organisations with which they have an
arrangement. Only if these are unsuccessful, and after an unnecessary
delay, might they consider adopters recruited by voluntary adoption
agencies. Not only does this create delay for children, but it also
artificially narrows the choice of adopters that social workers have
when looking for the best match for a child. This is simply wrong.
Decisions should legally and morally be on the basis of what is best
for the child, not on the basis of organisational convenience. It is
for this reason that, while we welcome all improvements in recruitment
of adopters, we want to be certain that bureaucratic arrangements do
not lock out choice for children. Because of the nature of this
problem, while we would like to see the reforms we need being put in
place by the sector itself, and we would like, as the noble Baroness,
Lady Hamwee, said, to see local authorities working together, we have
had to accept, based on historic experience, that it may be necessary
for the Government to direct local authorities to achieve changes, as
the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, said. We would, though, use this power
only if the Secretary of State felt it was absolutely necessary to
direct that services be pushed outwards, not to achieve efficiencies or
because of ideology but to improve the lives of children now and in the
future. This is about opening up services, not centralising

particularly of the right to an assessment, remove any stigma from

matching was raised by the noble Baronesses, Lady Hamwee, Lady Walmsley

contributed to the delays, such that black children take on average a
year longer to be adopted, and that that conceals a number who wait so
long that they never get adopted. We believe that a nudge on this is
not the way to change behaviour but that we should remove the wording
altogether, as is proposed, so that we can change practice, which is
what we are after. Of course, we will be looking for social workers to
come to a balanced decision, weighing up all the relevant factors, one
of which will, of course, be ethnicity. However, as I say, we are
convinced that to change practice we should remove the wording as the
fact is that for certain children there are just not enough adopters of
the appropriate race. If, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, says,
the use of the provision is not widespread, why does it take a year
longer for a black baby to be adopted? As I understand it, we will not
be putting the wording into the checklist. We do not believe that it is
realistic that social workers will swing back to no emphasis on
ethnicity. It is just not in their nature, particularly if they are
better trained, as we intend them to

support, whereby it can be seen as an investment rather than a cost.

apply to the Registrar-General for a copy of any person’s birth

person. However, there are cases in which the applicant does not have

particularly his officials, look at the very cogent evidence that we
received on the danger of entirely excluding ethnicity from the
legislation? We got that evidence from people whom we thought were
worthy of listening to and whom we would have thought the Government
would think were worthy of listening to. My recollection is that Coram
and BAAF were among them. As I think the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley,
said, there is a danger that social workers who make ethnicity too
important a consideration will say, “Well, now it’s gone,
we have to ignore it”. That is what the people on the ground who
know about it were telling us. Therefore, I should be grateful if the
Minister’s officials would have a look at the evidence that we

have been some preliminary shots across the bow concerning what is

the Minister, that is now likely to be in July—and, I assume,
well beyond July. The Minister is likely to be challenged by me, among

Suicide was defined using the International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes E950-E959 and E980-E989 (excluding E988.8)
for the years 1991 to 2000, and Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes X60-X84
and Y10-Y34 (excluding Y33.9 where the Coroner's verdict was pending)

Comparisons between suicide rates for 2002 to 2010, and 2011 should be
treated with caution, as rates across the two time periods are not
directly comparable due to the planned revisions to population
estimates. More details can be found in the section ‘Population
estimate revisions and their impact on suicide statistics for 2002 to
2011’ in the latest statistical
bulletin.</hs_quote><hs_quote UID="13051660000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130516w0001.htm#13051660000007"><Sup>5</Sup> Deaths

registered, rather than suicides occurring between 1997 and 2011. Due

Scotland. Further information is available
