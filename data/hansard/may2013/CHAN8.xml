me begin my questions with the key issue of arming the rebels, which in
recent months the Prime Minister has suggested is key to
“tipping the balance” and creating peace in Syria.
Indeed, in his statement today the Foreign Secretary
added<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T15:44:35"></hs_TimeCode>:
“The case for further amendments to the EU arms embargo on Syria

This signal should not surprise us. Indeed, in recent weeks, there have
been newspaper reports of a confidential document that sets out a range
of options that would allow the UK to send lethal support to
Syria’s opposition. The Foreign Secretary has again chosen his
words carefully today, but I believe that the risk of a decade-long 
<?notus-xml column=907?>sectarian civil war in Syria, fuelled in part by weapons supplied by the
UK, should give him serious pause for thought before embracing that
course.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052013000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0001.htm#13052013000224">The
struggle in Syria today is between forces funded and armed by outside
sponsors, notably Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Iran. Also participating are
foreign religious groups that are not directly controlled by their
sponsors, namely the Sunni Salafist and Iranian-aligned militias,
together with intensely anti-western al-Qaeda fighters. I would
therefore be grateful if the Foreign Secretary addressed himself to
this point: if, as he states, his priority is a negotiated end to the
conflict, is contemplating arming the rebels the crucial question?
Surely the crucial question is how to create a sustainable political
settlement in a complicated and fractured country. The conflict is so
vicious today in part because the stakes are so high for each of the
communities involved. Does the Foreign Secretary accept that Syria is
awash with weaponry? What is his assessment of how much weaponry would
be required to tip the balance against Assad, and how, in practical
terms, will the Foreign Secretary ensure that weapons supplied do not
fall into the arms of al-Qaeda-supporting
jihadists?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052013000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0001.htm#13052013000225">The
choice for the international community is not between sending military
support to Syria’s opposition and doing nothing at all. Assad is
sustained by external support from Russia and Iran and the foreign cash
that allows him still to pay his forces. Will the Foreign Secretary
explain why he did not place more emphasis in his statement on the
practical steps that could be taken to choke off Assad’s
finances and the country’s energy supplies through effective
enforcement of sanctions? Any future actions or policies of the UK
Government should be adopted only on the basis of their capacity to

71% funded. However, that was an appeal to cover the period from
January to June. We have to expect, in the near future, a new UN
assessment of the humanitarian aid that will be required, which could
be well above the previous appeal of $1.5 billion. This is already the
biggest ever UN humanitarian appeal, demonstrating the scale of what we

somehow an alternative policy by which sanctions could be better
enforced. The European Union enforces its sanctions tightly, but the
House must remember that the EU is alone in the world, as a grouping,
in enforcing sanctions. The United States and some of the other Arab
states enforce sanctions on Syria, but there are no UN sanctions of
that kind, and there are routes around such sanctions over time. It is
not within the power of the EU to change that; it is within the power
of the UN Security Council, but Russia and China have never supported
resolutions on that subject, so that is not an available alternative
policy.</hs_Para>

did indeed choose my words carefully on the question of arms. We are
seeking amendments to the embargo, not to immediately use those
amendments. In the discussions we have in the EU in the coming week, we
think is very important in making the Geneva negotiations take place,
let alone be a success. We need more pressure on the regime. We need
more encouragement to the opposition that they will not for ever have
to endure, if all negotiations fail and there is no way forward,
people—who may be described as rebels, but are men, women and
children sitting in their communities—suffering virtually every
kind of weapon that man has ever invented being dropped on them while
most of the world denies them the means to defend themselves. If we
come to a choice about that, it is a very important foreign policy and
moral choice, which of course should be discussed fully in this House.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T15:52:32"></hs_TimeCode>It is a very
important choice indeed. We have to bear it in mind, however, that one
of the drivers of radicalisation is the availability of weapons to
extremist groups and to the regime, but often not to moderate
opposition groups. Of course there are legitimate differences over all
such issues, and it would be a very difficult foreign policy choice. We
are clear that we need amendments to the arms embargo to take EU policy
in the right direction, which is what I will be working for over the
coming week.</hs_Para>

also know that the military and civilian leadership of the National

they are doing their utmost to ensure that they are not done in their

fighting in such a disparate way, that extremist groups and others do

our view, as Foreign Ministers of the core group, that the Syrian
National Coalition is sincere in its commitments, which is based on our
knowing the people involved over some months and seeing how the
opposition has developed. They know that the commitments are very
important to their future success and they have discussed them at great
length. They contain and comprise a steadily broadening group of people
of different ethnicities, origins and professions. I believe the
sincerity of the commitments, but I also believe that the coalition is

complex and substantial than those my hon. Friend mentions, and it
certainly plays a major role in bolstering the Assad regime. It was not
our view at the time of the previous Geneva conference that

gather evidence about these crimes, and to make it easier for others to
do so. It is the gathering of evidence that is always very difficult in
these situations. I anticipate that there will be many further
deployments throughout this year, including to the Syrian border. That
expertise also helps to address issues of violence against children,
which is all too common. I will keep the House regularly updated on
this.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052013000285" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0001.htm#13052013000285"><B><Member PimsId="-1" UID="13052013000695" xid="-1" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0001.htm#13052013000695">Several

reflect briefly on some of the other significant changes to
people’s lives that have passed through this House, including
one of the great reform Bills, which passed by one vote, the
frustrations that William Wilberforce had in his time, and the reasons
that people gave against extending the vote to women, but I shall
confine myself to saying that the programme motion allows it to be
understood that those who were among the 400 saying yes on Second
Reading have to accord some respect to the 175 who said no. It would be
a very good idea if those who comment on our proceedings realised that
by more than two to one we were in a majority on Second Reading. If we

the Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley) has been typically
generous to those with whom he is not in agreement, but I point out
politely to him that although there was a majority in the House in
favour of Second Reading, there was not a majority of Conservatives.
The majority of Conservatives who voted voted against the measure. It
was not in any party’s mandate at the last general election. It
is therefore presumptuous of the Government to seek to railroad the
measure through the

properly to respect the crucial issues of freedom of speech and

clause 1 goes to the heart of one of the many serious issues regarding
the Bill’s implications for freedom of speech in schools. The
law requires that schools and teachers must not only relay the legal

that the Bill would create a duty to promote and endorse the new
definition of
marriage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052013000369" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0002.htm#13052013000369">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:45:59"></hs_TimeCode>

teachers are not happy to promote or endorse a different understanding
of marriage and would risk their employment if they were required to do
so. New clause 1 focuses particularly on seeking to ensure that Church
schools are not obliged to promote or endorse same-sex marriage, which

seeking, with the support of other hon. Members, to provide a
conscientious objection clause that would not necessarily have any
detrimental effect on the Bill. 
<?notus-xml column=929?>This is not unprecedented. For example, section 4 of
the Abortion Act 1967 allows individuals with a conscientious objection
to abstain from participating in abortions. Section 38 of the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Act

refrain from providing contraceptive
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:48:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
Atheist teachers are not required to conduct collective services or to
teach religious education. Those are just a few of the conscientious
objection clauses that are already enshrined in law and do not seek to
go against the principle of the legislation concerned. What is

new clauses would strike a proper balance between the right of marriage
and the right of conscience. If the Bill is passed, they should not in

the police went away, but it was a close call and that was before the

will make one final point because I want to allow other hon.
Members to speak. New clause 8 and amendment 4 relate to
whether the Government’s locks will apply properly. I commend
the Government for doing all that they can, particularly through
working with the Church of England, to ensure that the locks are
adequate. The Church of England is satisfied that the Bill will do what
it says. However, it shares the concerns of others that go beyond that.
Large denominations such as the Catholic Church and small independent
Churches are concerned that they may be discriminated against because
of their decision to opt out. The Bill takes us on to new terrain, and
not just with regard to the definition of marriage; there is the new
terrain of legal challenge. The Government need to be as clear as
possible to avoid encroachments on religious
liberty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:56:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052013000396" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0002.htm#13052013000396"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Edward Leigh" PimsId="1455" UID="13052013000763" xid="352" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0002.htm#13052013000763"><B>Mr

number of confused and concerning e-mails and e-mails from people who
are absolutely behind the House and the clear majority expressed on
Second Reading and behind the polls that show the public’s clear
support for the Bill, notwithstanding their respect for those who feel
differently. I therefore feel that there is simply no need for a number
of the amendments proposed, and having seen some of the evidence
presented I would have thought some of them might have been
withdrawn.</hs_Para>

registrars should perhaps rethink their position. The difference
between a registrar and an abortion surgeon is that a
registrar’s sole duty is to conduct marriage. If they are
unhappy about the central purpose of their job, then of course they
should reconsider what they are doing. A surgeon has lots of things to
do and—hopefully—abortion is a tiny, tiny part of what
they might be called upon to do. That is why the exemption is there;

that the Church of England, as the established Church in England, has
special requirements to marry people who come to it. It has other

Other religions will not be compelled by the law to marry people if
they do not want to do so. As has been made clear at numerous points,

somehow breaking a new social taboo and doing something in their
workplace, particularly in the public sector, that they should not be
doing. Some people say that the new clause is not necessary, but it is,
because, as we all know, the tenor of debate on same-sex marriage is
often characterised, I am afraid—not here, but in the public
marketplace; we have heard of cases in the past —by hectoring,
bullying and name calling. Given that, as I have said, most decent

to the evidence of what is now happening in the workplace and this is
it. I named the Bill in honour of a gentleman who was demoted for
“gross misconduct”. This was a man with a perfect work
record who lost 40% of his salary. What did he say? Was he guilty of
homophobic behaviour? No; all he said was that same-sex marriage in a
church was an “equality too far”, and he put that on a
Facebook page. He said it on his private Facebook page, but a colleague
at work took umbrage. He raised it with his superiors at Trafford
Housing Trust and they pounced on it. They were up, I have to say, for
some new gay rights award—nothing wrong with that—and
clearly they wanted to burnish their PC credentials. They threw the

did not have the money to take the case to an employment tribunal

case law, lawyers said that he would not have won anyway, because of
the current state of employment and equality law. When there is a clash
between gay rights and religious freedom, I am afraid that gay rights
come first in our case law. Then an organisation came along that
offered to cover his legal bills and, with some expert creative legal

cases such as that of Adrian Smith can happen now, before the law is
changed, we can be absolutely certain that there will be many more in
the future. We cannot yet be sure what will happen in churches and
elsewhere, but we can be sure that there will be more such cases if the
Bill is passed unamended. Equality law is meant to protect all beliefs,
religious and otherwise. Some people believe in man-woman marriage for
religious reasons, and they have a right to that belief. Others believe
in it for non-religious reasons. Both ought to be protected, but case
law so far suggests that neither is. Apart from Adrian, no traditional
marriage supporter who has been on either end of a legal action has
ever won.</hs_Para>

have already said that Adrian’s victory was somewhat pyrrhic.
Equality law was no help to him. He won an old-fashioned contract law
claim. New clause 6 would address the obvious inequality in the law by
ensuring that a belief in traditional marriage was protected on the
“religion or belief” ground. It would not, of course,
guarantee that a person with traditional views would win in every case.
I am not suggesting that. All other considerations of equality law
would still apply, as would all the other discrimination grounds. The
new clause would not guarantee that a person with traditional views
would win the race; it would simply get them a place on the starting
blocks. That is all we are trying to

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T17:28:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Gainsborough (Mr Leigh), to put on record that there are many
religious people who do not recognise the caricature that he has put
before the House today. They understand that the House is deliberating
on what will become law if the Bill passes through another place, and
that, at other points in its history, Members have had to make similar
difficult determinations about what should become law. Once this
measure becomes law, there will be an obligation on public servants
such as registrars, and certainly on teachers, to understand this
matter and to teach it as the law. We should therefore draw a
distinction between the promotion or endorsement of a personal view and
what is the law.</hs_Para>

say gently that Members will recognise that not that long ago, in
deliberating on matters of race, this House made changes to its
position and sought to end the discrimination of minority people, many
of whom had arrived in this country in the Windrush generation. My
father was one of those people, and he certainly recollected a period
in his lifetime when it was commonplace for those applying for a job or
housing or meeting certain public officials to encounter either the
attitude or the sign of “No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs”.
We moved to say that that behaviour was not right. It remained racist
and people had strong views on it, but legally we arrived at a position
where this House declared that it was wrong.</hs_Para>

soon any illusions that they may have. I also feel strongly that
however they are taught about relationships, it should be done in an

large, it is accepted by the religious institutions that they will not
be forced to conduct same-sex marriages, which is of fundamental
importance to those who, in conscience, object to the Bill,

The substance of the amendments tabled goes beyond the direct effect of
whether religious organisations should be required to conduct same-sex

institution should be forced to conduct such a marriage, and that is
what the Bill achieves.</hs_Para>

amendments relate to the fear that my hon. Friends have expressed about
whether there will be what they describe as a chilling effect, or
interference with the reasonable exercise of conscience when people set
out their views. Free speech is, of course, curtailed by legislation in
all sorts of areas in this country. In the main, we would all agree on
the areas in which it should be curtailed. We do not accept that people
have the right to exercise free speech in a way that is inflammatory in
respect of race relations—that is outlawed—or that is
hateful. The House of Commons has passed successive measures to ensure
that incitement to hatred—whether racial hatred or, most
recently, hatred on grounds of sexual orientation—is outlawed,
but the bar that we rightly set in that legislation was high. Members
on all sides of the House of Commons felt at the time that it was
perfectly proper that hatred towards gay people should be outlawed, but
that reasonable comment and free speech, which may be unwelcome to
people, should not be outlawed unless it actually incited hatred and
violence in a way that properly brought in the province of the criminal
law.</hs_Para>

have given rise to a concern that the criminal law, or legislation, may
be used in a way that steps further than the intention of Parliament. A
number of cases have been cited in which public authorities have
behaved in a way that hon. Friends—I think with some
cause—fear has been heavy-handed, and in a way that interferes
with the reasonable expression of views that may not be welcome to
particular communities, but should not be classified as amounting to a
criminal offence. That is my hon. Friends’ concern, and I
understand it. So often, this amounts to a question of the sensible
application of the law by the public authorities—for instance,
by the police. If it turns out that arrests can be made, or
investigations pursued, that were not merited—and one of my hon.
Friends gave an example of such a case—it is not necessarily
that the law has drawn the line in the wrong place; it is that the
application of the law has been unfortunate.</hs_Para>

delivering a public service and the principle that this House has

it should be applied in an even-handed way. One has only to think
through the implications of licensing an individual to exercise his or

that would be allowed. A stronger free-speech threshold was

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T18:10:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Gainsborough (Mr Leigh) was in the least bit silly. If the argument
is that a person can exercise religious conscience by teaching in any

were the get-out clause to be introduced, for a science teacher to
teach creationism. I can think of a dozen more examples where that

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T18:12:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Aldershot made. He chose to introduce into his speech the old
chestnut of political correctness. Political correctness, as far as he
is concerned, seems to be anything he does not agree with. If someone
does not agree with him, it is because they are pursuing political
correctness. He referred to conversations he has had with constituents.
I accept that his constituency is dramatically different from mine, but
I must say—I am sure that other right hon. and hon. Members will
agree—that it is very rare that constituents ever complain to me
about political correctness. In the handful of conversations I have had
on that, usually at election time and in heated conversations in the
town centre or on a doorstep, I have asked, “What exactly do you
mean by political correctness?” I will not quote some of the
responses I have had, but I must tell the hon. Gentleman that when
people use the term as a defence, it usually means they are
unable to use inflammatory or incendiary language when discussing some
subjects. It is a very easy phrase to use as a defence, but I find that
it is often applied to protect people from being penalised for holding
grotesque
views.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052044000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0002.htm#13052044000134">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T18:15:08"></hs_TimeCode>

have three relevant interests. First, I have struggled with the issue
of sexuality since I was a teenager, like my hon. Friend the Member for
Bristol West (Stephen Williams). I remember that at school it was not
an easy issue in the slightest. Everybody knew that there were gay
people at school, but it was never taught or spoken about formally.
Secondly, I am chair of the board of governors of a Church of England
primary school. Thirdly, I am a trustee of a Church of England
secondary school. We have excellent teachers who do their jobs very
well, but I have to say that there is still some
nervousness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052044000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0002.htm#13052044000137">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T18:16:19"></hs_TimeCode>

yet sufficient, and that nervousness is still felt by the Church of
England formally and by the Roman Catholic Church. I think my right
hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs was very fair when
he said that he, too, is looking for some reassurance that teachers
will have the protection of being able to get the balance right and to
teach that God loves everybody irrespective of their sexuality, whether
they are 11, 14 or 17, but that the Church should be able to say not
that homosexuals are sinners but that it takes a different view on who
should be married and that civil partnerships or unions are fine but
same-sex marriage is not.</hs_Para>

church in my constituency told me that anyone who is gay is defective.
We still have to challenge that sort of prejudice, which thinks than an
individual can do something about being gay and that it is easy
to deal with. I am just asking for a little reassurance—or
perhaps more than a little—from the Minister on the issue of
guidance for schools. The churches do not yet think that we have the
necessary protection, so I am sympathetic to the amendments, although I

<?notus-xml column=954?>Berwickshire, now Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope. We opposed it and spoke and
voted against it. I understand exactly that hope. It is absolutely

registrar, having taken the job not knowing that there would ever be

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T18:22:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

similar changes to the law in lands across the whole of Europe and,
indeed, all over the world, so precedents have been set. In Holland,
protection of the religious views of registrars on same-sex marriage is
enshrined in the law. The Dutch courts recently ruled that registrars
should not be compelled to solemnise same-sex marriages against their
conscience if they were employed as registrars before the law was
introduced. A month or two ago,

marriage registrars 
<?notus-xml column=955?>would not be covered by the new law, while the other two people said
that they are covered. We are very conscious of the Ladele case. The

want to talk about the importance of freedom of speech for all. Unless
an amendment such as new clause 4 is made, freedom of speech
could be unduly restricted. It is difficult to be comprehensive about
the circumstances that may give rise to a breach of freedom of
expression as a result of such detrimental treatment. However, there is
a real danger that a teacher, for example, might be accused of
discriminating against a person because he or she has expressed a view
against same-sex marriage. There is a risk that employees might be
limited in their freedom of expression inside and outside the workplace
because their criticism of same-sex marriage could be considered to be
unlawful discrimination based on sexual orientation under the Equality
Act 2010. This is a particular danger in the context of education,
where a teacher may criticise same-sex marriage inside or outside the
classroom and be found to have discriminated as a result. These

going too far. This is no different from many of the issues that

marriage in its new legally redefined form. However, there is
uncertainty about how that will interact with the continuing need for
schools to reflect their religious ethos in their sex and relationship
education. All we are suggesting—there should not be a great
divide on this—is that in order to ensure that schools can
continue to teach an understanding of marriage that is consistent with
their religious foundations, this Bill should amend the Education Act
1996 to ensure that any guidance issued by the Secretary of State must
take account of the religious character of the school. That is not

Government have sought to reassure religious individuals and

conduct same-sex marriages if they object to them. Clause 2 provides
one of the main ways in which the Government have sought to make good
on that reassurance by giving protection from compulsion. The term
“compulsion” is, therefore, central to the protection
provided by the Bill for religious individuals and organisations, and

first sight, the term might appear wide-ranging and comprehensive,
which is what the Government would have us believe. However, in
reality, the protection may be very narrow in scope, because there is
no definition of “compelled” in the Bill. This omission
creates uncertainty and potentially limits the scope of the protection
afforded by the clause. Although the recognition that protections are
necessary is welcome, the Bill does not adequately address the problem.

the word was not borrowed from the 1965 Act, perhaps we should consider
other sources from which it may have been borrowed. According to case

are protected from being compelled not to

themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T18:35:41"></hs_TimeCode>.
Clause 2 as drafted, therefore, may not provide protection to religious
individuals and organisations from civil legal penalties; may not
prevent public bodies from treating religious organisations less
favourably if they decide not to opt in to providing same-sex marriage;
and may not protect religious organisations from the threat of other
legal actions, such as judicial review, if they decide not to opt into
same-sex marriage.
For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T18:36:03"></hs_TimeCode> example, a
religious organisation could be refused contracts, denied the use of
spaces such as halls or denied funding in an attempt to compel it to

women in marriage 100 years ago, compared with its views
today. For those who have a strong a religious bent, I note that the

I say simply that if they look around the world and listen to the

that hateful speech is alive and well. That is why a gay or lesbian
child is six times more likely to commit suicide than a heterosexual
child. We need to take seriously the fact that the language that people
use merely because they oppose same-sex marriage adds to that sense of
hatred and unpleasantness. To make the point, one has only to mention
the names of Stuart Walker, who was burned to death only a few years

the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr Burrowes) wants to speak at the

that have been raised.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T18:49:11"></hs_TimeCode> ought to start
by speaking to Government amendment 23, which will provide
further protection for chaplains, such as hospital and university
chaplains, who are employed by secular organisations. We made a
commitment in Committee to look at that matter again and we have
accepted that something further can be done. If the possibility of a
marriage conducted by a chaplain is a benefit to employees offered in
the context of that employment, a refusal to conduct such a service by
a chaplain for an employee could conceivably fall foul of provisions in
part 5 of the Equality Act 2010. We have therefore tabled amendment 23,
which I believe puts the issue beyond doubt.</hs_Para>

24 addresses a point raised by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T18:50:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) about the Church in Wales and places a
statutory duty on the Lord Chancellor. Once he or she is satisfied that
the governing body of the Church in Wales has resolved that the law
should be changed to allow for the marriage of same-sex couples
according to its rites, he or she “must” by order 
<?notus-xml column=963?>make such a provision. That meets a commitment made

grateful to my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T18:53:00"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate for his speech, and hope
to provide him with some reassurance. As he knows from Committee, no
school or individual teacher is currently under a duty to promote or
endorse a particular understanding of marriage, or would be as a result
of the Bill or any revised future guidance. There are two clear reasons
for that. First, the guidance is to secure that
pupils</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13052045001029" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052045001029">“learn

to secure that teachers promote or endorse any particular view of
marriage—in a sense it is the difference between explaining and
promoting. Secondly, teaching in this area should always be balanced
and sensitive to pupils’ backgrounds, which for many will be
reflected in the school’s ethos. Guidance contrary to
that ethos would not meet those criteria.</hs_Para>

Members want further reassurance, I draw their attention to Lord
Pannick, who I think is universally recognised to be an expert in this
area. He said that it is “inconceivable” that a teacher
could be lawfully disciplined for explaining to a child of an
appropriate age that the law allows for same-sex marriage but
that many religions—or indeed the teacher—do not believe
in it. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T18:52:05"></hs_TimeCode>Finally,
I draw the House’s attention to evidence given to the Committee

it is clear from the number of hon. Members who have signed new clause
1 that many remain concerned about the level of protection for
teachers. Although I am confident that the existing protections are
sound, I am aware of concerns raised by the Church of England
and mentioned by many hon. Members. With that in mind, I commit to the
House that we will take the issue away and discuss it further with
religious groups with whom we have been engaging throughout this
process. We have been in close contact with all of them, and will
consider all available means—including an amendment if
necessary—to put the issue beyond any doubt in the other

the Member for Enfield, Southgate for tabling amendment 50, which
amends the Public Order Act 1986. We debated it at some length in
Committee, and since then we have been thinking further to try and meet
the concerns of many colleagues. Regrettably, the wording used in the
amendment could—no doubt entirely unintentionally—give
the impression that this aspect of criminal law is not to be applied
even-handedly, and for that reason I cannot accept it as it stands. The
provision is already there, however, and we fully understand the
concerns and will work to table an amendment in the other place to try
and satisfy them.</hs_Para>

briefly to marriage registrars, although the news is rather less
promising. We debated the issue at length in Committee and I am afraid
my views rather hardened as the debate went on. I do not believe it is
appropriate or right to allow marriage registrars to opt out of
conducting same-sex marriages either permanently or on a transitional
basis. Like it or not, they are public 
<?notus-xml column=964?>servants who should carry out the will of Parliament, and allowing
exemptions according to conscience in my view sets a difficult
precedent. Furthermore and crucially—this is
important—the consultation with the national panel
for registrars revealed absolutely no concerns whatsoever about
conscience, and it would be unusual for the House to pass a new clause
if the national representative body did not ask for such an
exemption.</hs_Para>

new clause 4, I know that some Members continue to have concerns that
employees and organisations will risk action being taken against them

only between a man and a woman. However, discriminating against someone
because they hold such a belief, whether for religious or philosophical
reasons, is unlawful under that Act, and I am happy to place that on
the record.</hs_Para>

clear that had Adrian Smith applied in time, there was every reason to

amendment 3 to new clause 5, the important thing about the public
sector equality duty is that it is a duty to think, rather than to
achieve, a particular outcome. It could not possibly be used to justify
an act of discrimination because of a belief by a public authority. New
clause 6 seeks to make it explicit that the belief that marriage should
be between a man and a woman may be a religious or philosophical
belief, and that is indeed protected by the Equality Act 2010.
Philosophical beliefs are protected if they are genuinely held, and we
are entirely confident that the belief that marriage should be only
between a man and a woman meets those criteria

is the bedrock of our society, providing a stable foundation for
families and communities. We want to ensure that people are not
prevented from marrying, simply because they love someone of the same
sex. But as a result of the Government’s determination to tackle
this unfairness, other arguments have been put forward, including the
idea of an extension of civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples. I
have listened carefully to the different views of hon. Members on that
issue, and I respect the strength of feeling of some Members.

Members will be aware that a large number of questions emerged when we
looked in more depth at the issue of extending civil partnerships.
After all, the Civil Partnerships Act 2004 contained more than 250
sections and 30 schedules and took more than two years to pass into
law. It is an enormously complex area and the legislation cannot simply
be transposed to opposite-sex couples.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady asked for particular examples of the proposal causing delay.
I can say to her directly that the Civil Partnership Act was designed
specifically for same-sex couples, and a number of policy areas would
have different applications to opposite-sex couples, especially areas
such as adultery and consummation. If opposite-sex civil partnerships
were to emerge, it is not clear whether pension rights would be in line
with same-sex civil partnerships or with opposite-sex marriages. So if
we were to go down this path now, a lot of fundamental policy questions
would need to be answered. There would be questions of policy, of

spouse pensions from the date the pension scheme was joined, not from

whether this is going to enhance the institution of marriage, and it is

Labour equalities team supports the principle of extending civil

some opposite-sex couples want to make not to marry but none the less
to formalise their relationship. As civil partnerships will rightly
continue for gay and lesbian people under this legislation, it would
ensure, too, that they are not perceived simply as some sort of
residual arrangement pending everyone moving to same-sex marriage. We

the face of it, the anxieties highlighted by the Secretary of State
today are not insignificant. On 14 May, her colleague the
Pensions Minister, the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb),
put a high potential price tag on the extension of civil partnerships
to opposite-sex couples: the sum was between £3 billion and
£4 billion. The Secretary of State has also suggested there may
be international and devolution implications. 
<?notus-xml column=987?>The predicted costs involve some big and untested assumptions, however.
We do not know how many opposite-sex civil partnerships will be formed.
There is uncertainty about the number of public sector pension schemes
that do not already allow a cohabiting partner to be a named recipient
for survivor benefits. There is also uncertainty about the assertion
that extending civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples will reopen
the whole question of widowers’ pension entitlements. Following
the Cockburn case, we might feel somewhat sceptical about

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:24:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Rhondda (Chris Bryant). Bizarrely, neither of them voted for it. In
our witness sessions, it was strongly supported by experts such as Lord
Pannick and Baroness Kennedy, who clearly said that they thought that
the addition of the extension of civil partnerships would greatly
improve the Bill. Supporters of the proposals have included those in
favour of the Bill, those against it and those who have abstained. They
have not just come out of nowhere.
Several<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:24:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Members have mentioned the Government’s consultation on the
original Bill. Many people responded and 61% said that they were in
favour of extending civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:25:26"></hs_TimeCode> is not an
idea that we have cooked up at the last minute to wreck the Bill; the
Government’s research shows that the public—our
constituents, our voters—are in favour of it. However, the
Government went into the subsequent production of the Bill completely
and utterly ignoring the clear wish of the people as shown by their own
consultation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:25:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000052">There
are two rationales, as far as I am concerned, for supporting the
amendments. First, they will correct what is, I am sure, an unintended
but glaring inequality that would result from the Bill in its current
form. If the Bill goes through, as I expect, same-sex couples will be
entitled to continue in a civil partnership, to take up a civil
partnership or to take up the new form of marriage. Opposite-sex
couples will have only the option of traditional marriage, albeit by a
larger range of religious institutions. That is not fair. It gives rise
to an inequality in what is intended to be a Bill about equalities.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:26:27"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly, a very
positive reason for pushing forward with the amendments is family
stability, and I will come to that in a minute.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:26:38"></hs_TimeCode>Highly divisive
as the Bill has been, particularly on the Government Benches, surely
that is one issue on which we can all agree and rally

acknowledge that the quadruple lock that the Government have put in the
Bill largely does the job that they intend it to do. That is why many
of the Church institutions have been reassured by the safeguards that
they have been given. Earlier, we also heard about amendments that
tried to give safeguards to people in public service who might fall
foul of the legislation.</hs_Para>

ComRes carried out an opinion poll among 159 Members of this
House—quite a large sample—and some 2,012 members of the
public. Interestingly, that recent opinion poll found that 73% of hon.
Members in this House support the amendments. Among Conservative
Members, there was 72% support; among Labour Members, 76%; and among
Liberal Democrats, 67%. If the amendments do not get the full backing
of 73% of hon. Members tonight, what has changed in the space of just a
few days, since that opinion poll was carried out in
private?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000055">In
2010, an Office for National Statistics report said that there were
almost 3 million—2,893,000, to be precise—cohabiting
opposite-sex couples in this country. That is almost double the figure
reported some 15 years earlier. Some 53% of all birth registrations are
to married parents, but 31% are to unmarried parents who are
living together, and 40% of unmarried couples living together choose to
have children. Indeed, cohabitation is the fastest-growing form of
family in this country, and we need to recognise that our society is
changing, whether or not we approve.</hs_Para>

not to get involved in the whole paraphernalia of formal marriage for a
variety of reasons: it is too much of an establishment thing to do; it
is too much of a religious institution for some, and even if done in a
register office, it has religious connotations; there is a patriarchal
side to it; it is a form of social control—there are a whole
load of complex motives as to why many of our constituents do not go
down the formal marriage route. They are mostly still in committed,
loving relationships, but they have no way of demonstrating that in the
eyes of the public and the law, if they do not want to go down the
traditional marriage route.</hs_Para>

the Member for Bristol West (Stephen Williams) made a very good point
about the common misconception that there is such a thing as a
common-law wife or husband, as a woman typically finds out abruptly on
the death of a partner, when there is a tax bill on the estate, and
potentially on the family home. Even a couple engaged to be married
have more rights than a cohabiting couple. I have received many e-mails
and letters in support of this proposal, and one summed up the
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:30:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:30:15"></hs_TimeCode>:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13052056000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000121">“I

boys ages 16 and 18 yrs. Neither of us wish to get married but we would
like to have the same rights as a married couple. We see the civil
partnership as discriminatory towards us as a couple, especially as we
have children. A great number of friends and acquaintances are in a
similar position to ourselves and do not wish to be married although we
are all in a lifelong family commitment. My other issue with this is
that, as I am much older than my partner, I will probably die before
her and she would not receive the same tax benefits as a married woman

towards our
children.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13052056000058" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000058">Why

hon. Friend the Member for Bristol West referred to equalising same-sex
and opposite-sex civil partnerships as achieving “parity of
esteem”. I agree. I do not regard 
<?notus-xml column=992?>my conventional marriage of 20 and a half
years’ standing to my wife as any more valid than a
civil partnership, be it gay or, potentially, heterosexual; it is just
different. However, there is a major plus to achieving equality of
civil partnerships, and opening them up to opposite-sex couples: family
stability, which the Government seem to have ignored completely,
although it is something that we Conservative Members strongly
support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000060">The
Prime Minister and supporters of the Bill say that they are huge fans
of marriage, partly because it helps to create sustainable families
and, particularly, stability for the children brought up in them. I
agree, so should we not do more to achieve that stability for families
who choose not to get married, but who might cement their relationship
through the civil partnership route, giving them public recognition
and, importantly, rights and responsibilities under the
law?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000061">In
2012, the Relationships Foundation calculated the cost to this country
of family breakdown at £44 billion—some £1,470 per
year to every taxpayer, or 1.8% of gross domestic product. That is a
big problem—a growing problem that is costly, financially and
socially, in our society. Fewer than one in 10 married parents have
split by the time a child reaches the age of five, compared with more
than one in three of those who are cohabiting but not married, and 75%
of family breakdowns involving children under five result from the
separation of unmarried parents. The Centre for Social Justice has
produced a raft of statistics showing that a child who is not
in a two-parent family is 75% more likely to fall out of school
and 70% more likely to be addicted to drugs, and is more likely to get
in trouble with the law, be homeless, and not be in employment,
education or training. We know that marriage works, but we also know
that civil partnerships are beginning to show empirical evidence of
greater stability for same-sex couples, including those who have
children, be it through adoption, surrogacy or whatever. There is a
strong case for believing that extending civil partnerships would
improve that stability for many more families in different

the idea in any part of the House, so there seems to be agreement that
it would be beneficial. The point of argument is when it can be

coming from. One thing she said was that when she is asked, “Are

because she is in a civil partnership, not what she regards as a
marriage. There is currently a problem with civil partnerships. If
someone fills in a form, goes for an interview or responds to a
question and says that they are in a civil partnership, they are
automatically admitting their sexuality which, for some people, is
uncomfortable. If civil partnerships were extended to everybody, people
could be in a civil partnership and their sexuality would not be
questioned or
questionable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:36:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000066">There
is a further application. Many people who have strong religious
beliefs, particularly if they are Catholics, and have ended up getting
divorced, which is in conflict with certain religious teachings, may
not be inclined to get married again if they meet a new partner,
because supposedly their Church believes they should be married for
life. They would, however, in many cases be able to square that
position by entering into a new formal commitment through an
opposite-sex civil partnership. So there are a number of practical
applications where civil partnerships for opposite-sex couples will
achieve something very positive—not wrecking, but achieving
something for which people have a
requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:36:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000067">Opposite-sex
civil partnerships are not something cooked up in this country. Let us
look at various overseas experiences. In South Africa the Civil Union
Act 2006 gave the option for some same-sex and opposite-sex couples to
register a civil union by way of a marriage or a civil partnership on
the same basis. In France, as has been mentioned, the pacte civil de
solidarité, or PACS, as it is known, was introduced in 1999 as a
form of civil union between two adults of the same sex or the opposite
sex, and now gay marriage has been added to that. Interestingly, 94% of
PACS that took place in 2012 were between opposite-sex couples. Even
more interestingly, in France one in 10 PACS has been dissolved,
against one in three marriages ending in divorce. There is evidence to
show that some of these civil partnerships have created greater
stability, whether those are opposite-sex or same-sex
partnerships.</hs_Para>

people would not want to do such a trade-off for religious reasons. We
need to recognise that society is changing. What does not change is the
desire to create as much stability as possible for couples and children
in those
families<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:38:03"></hs_TimeCode>. In the
Netherlands in 1998 registered partnerships were created for same-sex
and opposite-sex partners which provide the same rights and
responsibilities as married partners, except in relation to children,

asked for a Library note on the cost impact assessments done at the
time of the Civil Partnership Act 2004. Part of it says that the
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:41:41"></hs_TimeCode>cost to the
Government was divided between total one-off fixed costs of
£19.8 million for changes in administration and rising
annual costs each year in both low and high take-up scenarios. The
annual cost to the Government in 2010 was estimated at £1.5
million for the low take-up scenario and £3 million for the
high-take up scenario, and that that would rise to
£11.6 million and £22.2 million a year in each
scenario by 2050. The components of the annual costs were state
pensions for spouses and bereavement benefits for surviving civil
partners, and public funding for civil partnership dissolutions. The
note refers throughout to tens of millions of pounds, but nowhere near
the figure in the billions that has been plucked out of the air with
absolutely no empirical evidence and which was never intended as an
official impact assessment from the DWP when the Pensions Minister made

Field:</Member></B> Does my hon. Friend not see that the amendments
proposed tonight, particularly from those on the Opposition Front
Bench, would go a considerable way towards what he is trying to
achieve? I share some of his concerns about the spurious figures in the
billions that we all heard quoted on the radio this morning, which seem
to have been plucked from the sky, and 
<?notus-xml column=995?>about the talk of a massive delay, but does he not realise that the
urgency with which we are now looking at this, because of amendment
(a), means that in the House of Lords there will be a rapid sense of
trying to move ahead in the time frame he has in mind? I regret, as he
probably does, that these things often happen in the other place,
rather than here in the House of Commons, but does he not recognise
that he has won most of the battle? Instead of making the strong case
he is making, with which I think many of us agree, why does he not
recognise that he has won much of the battle and can happily withdraw
his new
clause<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:43:32"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000077"><B><Member ContinuationText="Tim Loughton" PimsId="1558" UID="13052056000168" xid="368" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000168">Tim

I would be delighted, but I think that what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:43:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stretford and Urmston said might have raised a few eyebrows on the
Government Front Bench. If she is saying that part of the deal is that
the review, which would be an added consultation on the back of the one
we had before the Bill was introduced, will take place and result in
concrete proposals coming forward that can be added to the Bill before
it completes its passage through both Houses, I would be perfectly
happy, but I do not think that will happen. I do not see how it can
happen given the complexities that the Secretary of State has claimed
still need to be addressed as regards all the legislative changes,
costs, and so on.</hs_Para>

Member for St Helens South and Whiston (Mr Woodward) would like to
repeat his question to the Minister in the wind-ups. If he gets the
answer, “Yes, we think this can be done during the progress of
this Bill”, I will be delighted to withdraw my amendment,
because that is what I am trying to achieve. I do not care whether it
happens tonight in this House or in a few months’ time in
another place or when the Bill comes back here; I just want it to
happen, because we all seem to agree that it should and that it is
right and fair in
principle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:45:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000079">When
we raised this subject with my right hon. Friend the Minister of
State<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:44:59"></hs_TimeCode> in
Committee, he gave five reasons explaining why, supposedly, it was not
necessary to act and that we were talking about an irrelevance. His
first reason was that the aim of the Civil Partnership Act 2004 was not
to provide an alternative to marriage but to give same-sex couples
broadly equivalent rights. Yet now opposite-sex couples will be denied
those broadly equivalent rights if they are not inclined to marry and
are unable to get such civil partnerships. His second reason was that
to get the legal rights, responsibilities and protections that marriage
brings, people should just marry. The Secretary of State Marriage has
described marriage as the gold standard, but the Government are
choosing to limit people’s
choices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000080">The
third contention by the Minister, whom I like greatly, was that the
Government were not convinced that there is a group of people
campaigning for opposite-sex civil partnerships. Well, I have quoted
the opinion poll. The Government cannot have it both ways. They are
scaremongering about the excessive cost of this measure and, at the
same time, saying that there is no real demand for it, in which case it
would not cost anything. They cannot have their cake and eat
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:46:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=996?><hs_Para UID="13052056000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000081">The fourth
reason that the Minister came up with was that in the
Government’s consultation 61% of those who answered an online
response form said that opposite-sex couples should be able to register
a civil partnership. I like and respect my right hon. Friend, who is
not in his place at the moment, and I recognise that he has been dealt
a pretty bum hand in having to steer this Bill through the House.
However, I think he will regret adding the rider that more than half
the people who answered the question identified themselves as lesbian,
gay or bisexual.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:47:04"></hs_TimeCode>So there we have
it: in a skewed voting system that would put Eurovision to shame, the
vote of someone who is gay sometimes does not count as much if the
Government say so. This needs
investigating<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:47:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000082">Another
example of inconsistency that came out in Committee concerned the
hierarchy of people who should be given exemptions if, on an issue of
conscience, they cannot carry out various public functions. However, I
do not wish to digress and will move swiftly on to the
Minister’s fifth reason: that we would need a raft of changes to
other legislative provisions that would involve other parts of the
United Kingdom. However, this is already being addressed in the Bill
and those provisions could be addressed in
parallel<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:47:53"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
afraid that this sort of mess and confusion is what happens when we
rush through a Bill with far-reaching consequences that have not been
properly thought through.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13052056000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000083"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:48:04"></hs_TimeCode>There
is no excuse not to do this now, or very urgently. The Government were
warned by 61% of people in the consultation but rushed ahead. They
should have looked at the wider issues. They could have said that they
wanted to abolish civil partnerships and just have marriage, but then
what would happen to the people in an existing civil
partnership—would they just be sidelined and wither away? It
would not be fair on them. That has not been thought through. Where are
the impact assessments and cost calculations on the numbers who are
supposedly going to convert from a civil partnership to a same-sex
marriage? In fact, the number of opposite-sex couples taking up a new
civil partnership could produce a saving if less money were spent on
family breakdown. We have no details about how the figures have been
worked out, about a start date when civil partnerships for opposite-sex
couples might be introduced, or about what level of retrospective
financial entitlements they may qualify for.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13052056000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000084">I want to be
helpful to the Government because I recognise that this has
become a bit of a pickle. As I said, I will be perfectly happy if the
Bill continues its progress on the timetable that the Government have
set. If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:49:37"></hs_TimeCode> the
Government agree to my proposed new clause in principle, they will have
time, during the later stages of the Bill, to announce specific details
about the start date, the commencement of entitlements and so on. I for
one would be perfectly favourable to delaying the implementation date
of opposite-sex civil partnerships if the Government agree to the
principle. If they needed two, three or four years to sort out the
detail before the measure would be able to commence, I would be happy
with that if the Bill addressed this inequality and we recognised that
opposite-sex civil partners have a place— I think it is
a growing place—in our
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:50:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000085">The
Government would have to acknowledge that, in the meantime, they were
creating an inequality, albeit a temporary one. They certainly cannot
delay this until 2019. A reviewing amendment represents the worst of 
<?notus-xml column=997?>all worlds if the issue is kicked into such long grass. Have the
Government learned nothing from recent experiences with Europe about
promising votes in the next Parliament? Apparently it is acceptable to
defer a decision on an equality issue for at least six years unless it
was not promised in a manifesto and has all of a sudden become
urgent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:50:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000086">There
are no complications involved in my proposal. I want opposite-sex civil
partnerships to be offered on exactly the same basis as same-sex civil
partnerships. It would not be possible for someone to become a civil
partner with a close family member or if they are already in
a union, and the partnership needs to be subject to the same
termination criteria. It is simple. Surely the case is
overwhelming<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:51:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000087">I
do not do wrecking. I have never voted against my party or my
Government in my 16 years in this House, and I do not want to start
now. I have been entirely open, transparent and consistent in my
opposition to the Bill. I am happy for it to progress on the
Government’s time scale, if that is the will of the House.
However, the House must respect the right of all Members to act
according to their conscience, and my objections to the Bill have not
been on primarily religious grounds. I have spent most of my time, like
other Back Benchers, scrutinising the Bill’s safeguards on the
likely basis that it will become law. The job of Back Benchers is to
scrutinise legislation, hold the Executive to account and draw
attention to anomalies, inconsistencies, injustices or, as in this
case, inequalities, and urge practical action, which is what new
clauses 10 and 11
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:52:24"></hs_TimeCode>. A clear
inequality is being created and I am sure that all fair-minded Members
will want to address it as a matter of urgency. My new clauses would
clearly achieve
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:52:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000088">We
are in danger of being party to a last-minute stitch-up between those
on the Front Benches, but this is a free vote, not on a conscience
issue, but on a simple matter of equality that Members can
support—indeed, from what has been said so far, many Members do
support it—whether they are whipped to support the Bill or
whether they defy the Whip to oppose it, and it has the added bonus of
improving family stability. The only chance to bring that about is
through these new clauses. A delay until 2019 or similar will not hold
water. A review without detail and the potential dragging on of
headlines until the election certainly will not do Government Members
any
favours<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:53:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000089">If
hon. Members believe that this principle is right, now is the time to

to the Government’s consultation last year, which found that a
majority of people were in favour of extending the principle of civil
partnerships to everyone in this country. He will know that the
Government’s response was to say simply, “We are not
convinced.” For some, there is a genuine worry that the
Government will launch into another review, take months if not years to
conduct it and, even if they find that the cost is not that great,
conclude that civil partnerships cannot be extended to everyone in this
country. Alternatively, they might give the old excuse that there is no

Mulholland</B> (Leeds North West) (LD):</Member> This is the first time
I have had the opportunity to speak on this subject, but I have been
working with others to deal with some of the obvious flaws in this
albeit well-intentioned Bill. I thank the Secretary of State and her
ministerial colleagues for the way in which they have engaged and
listened without question. As a result of that, however, I find
it disappointing that they have failed to make some of the
obvious—and in my opinion necessary—amendments to deal
with the Bill’s flaws.</hs_Para>

have been called anti-gay rights and anti-Christian; I have been called
homophobic and at the same time accused of not being a proper Catholic.
I have been accused of being worryingly conservative, yet at the same
time dangerously libertarian. I am none of those things. What I am,
very proudly, is a liberal, and I want to support a sensible, liberal
way of dealing with the inequities that we undoubtedly have in our
current system with regard to the recognition of adult couples in a
relationship. We have not gone about this Bill the right way, and many
of its flaws are because it has been pursued from a very conservative
perspective, rather than a radical liberal one.</hs_Para>

the avoidance of doubt, the role of the state, very simply, is to
decide how to recognise relationships between adult couples, and which
adult couple relationships to recognise in that way. That should be
entirely separate from any consideration of how religions and
belief-based 
<?notus-xml column=1000?>organisations recognise relationships in accordance with their own
beliefs. Instead of dealing with that point, however, the Bill has
sought to build on the confusion and conflate the two issues even
further. The result, I am afraid, is something of a
mess.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13052056000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000104"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:03:47"></hs_TimeCode>I
want to vote on, and will always support, the state giving equal right
to equal recognition of adult relationships, which then conveys equal
rights as a result of that equal legal recognition. However, not only
does the Bill not do that, it makes a complicated and unequal situation
worse. Let me be clear about what the Bill will produce if it is
passed, as it inevitably will be tomorrow. There will be two different
definitions of civil marriage for same-sex couples, and another
definition for opposite-sex couples. There will not be an equal
definition. The Bill will allow two different legal recognitions of a
relationship for some couples but not for others. It will fail to
equalise pension rights for some couples, which is one reason we are
having this debate and why legislation is needed. The Bill will
continue to allow ministers of some faiths to conduct a marriage in the
eyes of the law, and yet people of other religions and faith-based
systems will not be allowed to do so. The Bill is unequal on four
counts. As I have made clear, there is a better way. Any liberal would
suggest finally properly separating the civil and the religious rather
than building on what we have. I will speak about that more when we
debate another group of
amendments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000105">My
new clause 13 must be seen in the context of the amendment I have
tabled for debate tomorrow—both are part of dealing with the
situation properly. The measures are radical. They would
repeal—this might not make me popular with anyone—the
Marriage Act 1994 and the Civil Partnerships Act 2004 so that we end up
with a single definition for all couples. We are not at that point,
which I accept, but we cannot institutionalise a new inequality during
the passage of a Bill that is supposed to be about equalising marriage.
Hon. Members should remember that civil partnerships were introduced to
give same-sex couples another form of relationship. In many
people’s eyes, it is a lesser form of relationship. We must not
institutionalise that. If civil partnerships are worth having, we must
allow them to be a different form of legal recognition for all, or do
what I suggest in new clause 13 and abolish them altogether. Either
way, we would end up with proper
equality.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000106">Ministers
and shadow Ministers and others have suggested that the Bill is not the
measure with which to deal with that inequality. I am afraid that that
argument is simply absurd. Some say that we should not introduce that
equality because of the cost—the figure of £4
billion has been mentioned. That is entirely to fall into the trap of
those who oppose any change to traditional civil marriage. They argue
that we should not introduce any measure because of the cost. As a
liberal, let me be clear that we change civil rights and introduce
genuine equal legal recognition because it is the right thing to do,
not because it costs the state money. The argument that we should not
do something because it costs the state money is a slippery slope. I
should tell the Minister that whoever introduced that argument to the
debate made a huge
mistake.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000107">My
amendment 10 would be the genuine, liberal way of dealing with the
situation—properly redefining how the state recognises adult
relationships. The amendment would get rid of clearly Christian
concepts that come 
<?notus-xml column=1001?>directly from Church of England canon law and are shared by certain
other Christian faiths. It would mean that we would not count on the
statute book adult couples’ sexual practices with each other.
Currently, adultery is a reason to allow some couples but not others to
dissolve their civil marriage. Most absurdly of all, lawyers dictate
that certain couples and not others must consummate their marriage in a
certain
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052056000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0003.htm#13052056000108">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:09:49"></hs_TimeCode>
is embarrassing and ludicrous, when we are rightly dealing with the
inequities of the current civil partnership regime that does not bestow
the same rights, status or recognition on same-sex couples, that the
Bill will continue to enshrine ancient Christian concepts in the
statute book and apply them to some couples only. If there had been
more listening and more acting on that listening, new clause 10, which
has been discussed at some length, would not be necessary. It should
not be necessary. A clear part of any redefinition of how the state
defines and recognises adult relationships should have always been
either to keep civil partnerships and make them open to all adult
citizens, or wipe them away and have a single, equal definition for
all.</hs_Para>

all the sophistry and arguments from those on the Front Benches, in
their heart of hearts they know this to be true. That is why I urge
everyone in this House who regards themselves in any way as a liberal
and who wants to see equal rights and recognition to vote for new
clause 10. That is the only way people can have confidence that the
real motivation—I believe it is the real motivation, even though
it has been expressed badly—is to deal with the inequities
currently in the Bill. Even at this late stage, I urge the Secretary of
State to listen, disregard the cost of human rights and, either through
changing marriage or changing civil partnerships, ensure that all
adults can have their relationships recognised in one equal or two
equal ways.</hs_Para>

put my signature to those new clauses because I want to promote
equality. It is important to allow everyone—same-sex couples and
opposite-sex couples—to enjoy a civil partnership or marriage as
they choose. This is a question of equal love. It is not about asking
for special treatment for gay couples or straight couples; it is about
everyone enjoying the same rights regardless of their sexuality. It is
worth noting that equal rights are already enjoyed in countries such as
France, where many heterosexuals want and can get the legal security of
a civil union if they do not want to get married. I do not understand
why straight couples in Britain should not have that right, too. That
is why, for several years,  
<?notus-xml column=1002?>I have been writing to the Government—for
example, back in May 2011—and calling on them to support civil
partnerships for opposite-sex couples. I have done so on a number of
occasions, so this is not a new idea or one that has only just now come
on to the agenda.</hs_Para>

not now be using their failure to do so as an excuse for denying people
equality, especially when the projections on the pension costs are so
speculative—in the space of five days they have gone up from
£3 billion to £4 billion. One gets the sense that they
are being done on the back of a cigarette packet. If civil partnerships
for mixed-sex couples really would generate £4 billion of cost
liabilities and cause more than two years’ delay, let us see the

for the Bill to have less chance, perhaps, in the other place.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:14:58"></hs_TimeCode>My bottom line
is that I do not want the chance presented by the Bill being scuppered.
I do not want it delayed—I want it given a swift and safe
passage—and if that means that I need to abstain on the new

if the Government were really committed to equal marriage, they would
not be implying that their support for the Bill was conditional.
Ministers need to explain exactly why opening up civil partnerships
would delay the implementation of gay marriage and why, for example, it
is not possible to work on the basis set out in 2004, when some of the
essential consequentials were put in place for civil partnerships. Of
course, the issues for same-sex couples are different from those for
opposite-sex couples, but I struggle to see how it could take two years

the Bill does not allow employers and pension providers to award gay
spouses and civil partners the equivalent survivor benefits payable to

gay marriage couples, which we will be discussing tomorrow. That
substantive inequality remains in the Bill, but could be considered at

couples.</hs_Para>

believe that the proposals are being used to play political games, but
I do not think that my constituents want me to play such games; they
want equality fair and square and they expect a Government who have

the word “marriage” and its associations might prevent

dancing on the head of a pin, however, over the different legal

not be beyond the wit of the House or the Government to introduce

judgment is that where we have got to on this—the work done in

the way in which we have managed this whole process has not reflected
very well on any of us. Frankly, it does not reflect terribly well on
Opposition Front Benchers that they have undertaken this manoeuvre
right at the last moment. All this was predictable and was predicted,
not least by me. The conclusion is that we will have the opportunity to

marriage. We stopped at that point. We deliberately and intentionally
created something that was not as good as marriage, because politically
we did not feel we could get it at that time. We did so for the best
reasons possible and it was a huge step forward, not just for gay
couples but for the whole nation. I am extremely proud to have voted
for that legislation, but let us be honest about what civil
partnerships were. They fell short of marriage—they were second
best—because we could not get as far as marriage. That is why, a
decade later, we are debating this reform. In a perfect world, it would
have been delivered long before now. The case for allowing same-sex
couples to marry is not that they have been denied it so far; it is
that marriage is better than a civil

every other Member, I have received letters and e-mails warning me that
legislating for same-sex marriage will, in some undefined way,
undermine the institution of marriage. I take a very different view. I
believe that the real threat to marriage will come from the
continuation of civil partnerships and their extension to heterosexual
couples. As things stand today, the legal security and recognition
offered by marriage can be enjoyed only by straight couples. The legal
security and recognition offered by civil partnerships can be enjoyed
only by same-sex couples, although I hope that that is about to change.
Needlessly telling all couples that they can now opt for a second-best
arrangement that nevertheless offers all the same legal privileges and
protections as marriage would surely undermine marriage far more than
extending the qualification for marriage to same-sex couples.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:26:36"></hs_TimeCode>From the day the
Bill becomes law, the choice offered to all couples will be the same as
the choice that has up to now been offered to all straight couples:
either get married or don’t—it is your choice.</hs_Para>

we have indulged in this debate, we have failed to address anther
issue. Many individuals—mostly, but not always, women with
dependent children—need to be offered more security when they
are living with a partner and perhaps depending on him financially. But
if that partner is unwilling to commit to marriage, he will probably be
equally reluctant to enter an alternative arrangement that offers the
same level of legal and financial responsibilities. What those partners
and families need is some kind of passive legal recognition, perhaps
similar to what used to be known as common law marriage, a state that
used to prevail in Scotland but which, since 2006, no longer does so.
Moves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:27:34"></hs_TimeCode> to make

a progressive move, but they will do nothing to help those vulnerable

for those who have already entered into a civil partnership and who do
not wish to enter into the state of marriage as provided by this Bill,
I have to say that it should not be beyond the wit of the Government or
this House to frame legislation that would recognise each existing
civil partnership until it was dissolved either legally or by the death
of one partner, while preventing any more civil partnerships from being
entered into. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham
says<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:28:19"></hs_TimeCode> that he
wants full equality. I concede that making civil partnerships available

Leslie</B> (Bristol North West) (Con):</Member> I want to put on record
that I support new clause 10, because the Bill is fundamentally about
equality and, to some 
<?notus-xml column=1006?>extent, equality must mean symmetry. If we are going to make the
dramatic and historic move to exercise equality across marriage, we
must have symmetry. It is extraordinary that, despite the alarms that
have been raised and the warnings that have been given about the
failure to extend civil partnerships symmetrically to different-sex
couples, three amendments have been tabled on this subject only at the
eleventh hour. This does not seem to have been thought through before
now. That is a disappointing state of affairs for a Bill that so loudly
claims to have equality at the centre of everything it does.</hs_Para>

we are to be logically and intellectually consistent, I do not see how
we can pass a Bill that extends equality in marriage without extending
civil partnerships to different-sex couples.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:29:39"></hs_TimeCode>It is not as if
such symmetry was a surprise or not much covered in the debate. When
would the next opportunity be? We have already seen the amount of
controversy created by rearranging marriage, which is so connected with
the fundamental roots of our establishment and the relationship between
the state and the Church. It is unlikely, I think, that many
Governments will rush to introduce such legislation
again.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland), as I
believe that we have missed a fundamental opportunity
genuinely to modernise marriage in the world in which we live.
Some may say that that is a very difficult, complex and controversial
operation to undertake; I would agree. Some may say that it is not an
operation that should be undertaken lightly; I would agree. If we are
to undertake it, however, perhaps we should tackle one of the biggest
anomalies we face, which is the role of the Church of England in how we
see marriage in a multi-faith, often secular world.</hs_Para>

have we learned from this debate that has been so played out in the
newspapers over the past months? It is that the concept of marriage
is—we should hold our breath—controversial. People
believe different things. Some fervently believe—and, they would
say, with good reason—that marriage, by description, is a union
between a man and a woman. Others with equal fervour—and, they
would say, with equal reason—believe that it is a union
between two individuals who are committed and love each other very
much. As marriage is a social construct, it is difficult to say which
one of those should reign supreme. Certainly, since this is in the
realm of subjective individual attitudes towards people’s
relationship with each other, I as a Conservative do not think that the
state should be stepping into it and dictating with such
vigour.</hs_Para>

therefore support civil partnerships for same-sex and different-sex
couples and, if that does not come about, the removing of civil
partnerships for same-sex and different-sex couples for the reason of
symmetry. The state should take control of that which belongs to the
state—the objective and our tax and legal affairs—and the
genuine, subjective view of one person towards another and what their
relationship signifies in the eyes of any higher authority that they
choose to name should be in the realm of the subjective and the civic
arena.</hs_Para>

symmetry. Let me point out that no symmetry will be created even if the
Bill is passed, as I very much hope that it will be. If passed,
it will be a huge step forward in allowing marriage for same-sex
couples, but no symmetry will be created, because the principal
Churches will not allow marriage for same-sex couples. The Church of
England will not be allowed to do it, and the Catholic Church will
choose not to do it. It is a false argument to suggest that a symmetry
will be created, or that the Bill will create an asymmetry that it will
be possible to correct by extending civil partnerships to a completely
unquantified and unknown group of
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052060000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0004.htm#13052060000018"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:42:20"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Ian Paisley" PimsId="2246" UID="13052060000533" xid="1216" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0004.htm#13052060000533">Ian

any more strongly than that—if we add to the Bill an uncertain
and unquantified element for which there does not appear to be a
genuine demand. I believe the other place may then add greater
difficulty into the Bill than would otherwise be the case. It will have
two issues to deal with, rather than one. I therefore urge all
of  
<?notus-xml column=1009?>good faith who support marriage for same-sex couples to be very cautious
before supporting the amendment in question.
Indeed, I urge them to oppose it, and to do the straightforward thing
of agreeing to the review. I support the Opposition amendment to ensure
that the review is immediate. Given the complexity of these issues,

finger on it when he said that the gross unfairness is the fact that
same-sex couples cannot get married. That is what the House needs to
focus on today. By voting for new clause 16 and amendment (a) to it, we
can get to a position in which we can deal with the issue of extending
civil partnerships to heterosexual couples without it getting in the
way of making sure that the unfairness that he rightly identifies is
dealt with swiftly. He talked eloquently about the inequities in
pension provision. If that was a simple issue to rectify, presumably
his Government would have addressed the issue back in
2004.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052060000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0004.htm#13052060000047">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:53:30"></hs_TimeCode>

These are matters that have been decided in Northern Ireland and I
respect entirely the decisions that have been taken. I will continue to
work with colleagues in the Northern Ireland Assembly to make sure that
the will of that part of the United Kingdom is dealt with in the
appropriate way. What he rightly describes is the situation for civil
partnerships that take place in other parts of the world already. The
Northern Ireland Assembly recognises, as we would expect it to, a civil
partnership that took place, for example, in Canada or Spain. We are
simply asking for marriages of same-sex couples to be recognised in the
way that civil partnerships from other countries are recognised. I am
sure the hon. Gentleman would agree with
that<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:54:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052060000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0004.htm#13052060000052"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Peter Bone" PimsId="4750" UID="13052060000545" xid="903" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0004.htm#13052060000545"><B>Mr

as I said, but we need to make sure that we are prioritising now the
need for the choice for same-sex couples to be able to get married, not
further choice among heterosexual couples. That is an important measure

where they lie so that the industry, hand in hand with officials, can

statistical unit to DEFRA officials at the time we started questioning
the unreported overfishing state that the EC was not aware of the 2009
overfishing, for example—specifically, that the EC had not been
told—and admit that only a 95% uptake was reported, when in

questioned why nothing had happened. By then, towards the end of 2010,
DEFRA still did not act or, importantly, speak to the industry
properly. Through May and June 2011, officials had some meetings and
discussions with selected members of industry, but did not advertise,
publicise or engage with this fragmented industry of vessels and
processors—the people who did not belong to national
associations. By late August 2011, DEFRA had decided a closure was
likely. In early September it finally started to make that publicly
known and closed the fishery in October. Even the internal e-mails from
that period show that, behind the scenes, DEFRA was withholding its
full intentions from the industry and even discussing the necessity of
further consultation, if only for the appearance of consultation and to
avoid criticism later—at least that would be my view.</hs_Para>

by addressing the last point that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T22:47:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck) raised. That really is a very
serious allegation. To say that the work of my Department or a part of
the DEFRA family has resulted in the failure of a business is one of
the most serious accusations that she could possibly make, and it is
one that I would refute. I would refute it because the industry is
increasing its turnover, as I shall discuss in a moment. I regret that
anybody should find themselves in the circumstances that the hon. Lady
has described in talking about that business but, to use my words
carefully, if such a serious allegation were made outside this House, I
would have to seek advice on it.</hs_Para>

have looked closely into this issue, and as the hon. Lady rightly said,
I have met her and her constituent. I do not know whether another
individual has tied up more time and resources in my Department and the
Marine Management Organisation than Ms Portmann, but I can assure the
House that that is my impression from discussing this with officials. I
recognise the hon. Lady’s commitment and dedication to the
country’s fishing industry. She has been a good voice for her
constituents on many of these issues. In turn, I am committed to
preserving fishing opportunities for this generation and the next
through the reform of the common fisheries policy, and to protecting
the fish stocks in our
seas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T22:49:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305216000496" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0004.htm#1305216000496">This
matter needs to be set in context. We are undergoing a quiet revolution
in how we manage our seas, not only through the reform of the common
fisheries policy. Part of the uplift in the numbers that the hon. Lady

have a dramatic effect on her constituency and on many of the
businesses that function from it and off it, out at sea.</hs_Para>

changing and leading the way in which we deliver marine conservation in
Europe. There is great cause for pride in that, but it has huge
resource implications for my Department and the MMO.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T22:49:51"></hs_TimeCode> have created
new organisations to regulate and police our seas, not least the
inshore fisheries and conservation authorities and, yes, the Marine
Management Organisation. As the hon. Lady knows, the MMO was formed
three years ago, and it is the principal marine fisheries enforcement
body in England and acts as the UK authority to co-ordinate and control
activities across all four fishing administrations.</hs_Para>

have seen at first hand and take a great interest in how the MMO works.
It works with industry and other parts of the Government to achieve
pragmatic fisheries management and management of the marine
environment. The MMO, like any other regulator, relies on its ability
to collate and analyse data so that it can make sound management
decisions. It carries out statutory obligations for the UK, which
include reporting data to the European Commission on quota uptake and
fishing effort. This is a significant task. By working closely with UK
fishing administrations, the MMO has dealt with data covering
approximately 230,000 vessel landings a year.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T22:51:14"></hs_TimeCode> say with great
respect to the hon. Lady—it is sincere in this case, which it is
not always when that line is delivered from this Dispatch
Box—that she is receiving information on this issue from one
source, whereas I receive it from a lot of other organisations,
including businesses within this sector, and I get a very different
story.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1305216000499" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0004.htm#1305216000499"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T22:51:31"></hs_TimeCode>These
landings range from small boats that go out for only a few hours a day
to vessels that may be 20 times bigger and are at sea for weeks at a
time. Last year, the MMO had to deal with significant challenges to the
over-15-metre scallop fishery, one of the UK’s most valuable
fishing assets, under the western waters regime. Scalloping is highly
profitable for the UK fishing fleet and accounts for about 9% of the
total tonnage and value of fish landed by the UK fleet. Much of this
activity, as the hon. Lady is well aware, takes place in
ICES—International Council for the Exploration  
<?notus-xml column=1028?>of the Sea—area VII, an expanse of sea that extends westwards
from the channel around the Irish sea and an area where effort is
restricted under the western waters
regime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T22:52:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305216000500" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0004.htm#1305216000500">The
profitable nature of this fishery has been increasingly attractive to
vessels from all parts of the UK. However, for over-15-metre vessels,
the UK has exceeded the limits on fishing effort—that is, days
at sea—set under the western waters regime. Such overfishing
risks effort penalties, which would be a severe blow to one of the most
successful, productive and highest-earning fisheries found in our
waters. As a result, a management regime for the area VII fishery has
been agreed with the scallop industry and the four UK fisheries
administrations who are working together to ensure that activity
remains within our effort
limits<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305216000501" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0004.htm#1305216000501">On
my examination of this matter, I would say that DEFRA staff and MMO
staff have worked really hard to keep this fishery open in recent years
by helping to find swaps and in being successful in doing so. Yes, the
hon. Lady is right that it required us to close the fishery for one
period, but it has been a Herculean task to keep it open in the face of
the effort limitations that this area has faced.</hs_Para>

industry advisory group has been established, involving catchers and
processors of scallops from around the country. Those are key players
in this problem. That provides industry with a lead role in taking
responsibility for the management of the fishery. The MMO is an
important source of information. It provides advice on levels of uptake
in the fishery to inform management
discussions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305216000503" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0004.htm#1305216000503">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T22:54:11"></hs_TimeCode>
the same time as the management regime was being established,
over-15-metre UK vessels were moving from paper-based reporting to the
electronic logbook system, as the hon. Lady rightly stated. Vessel
operators have needed to install new on-board equipment and to revise
the way in which they record their fishing activity. All the fisheries
administrations have had to make corresponding changes in their systems
for handling data to deal with the new sources of information. That has
been a major change for UK fishermen, given that the paper-based
logbook has been largely unchanged for the past 30 years.</hs_Para>

fishermen still provide the same information, but the way in which they
provide it has changed completely. In respect of data management for
the western waters scallop fishery, the MMO has responded to the
challenges by working closely with the scalloping sector and other

data.</hs_Para>

Seabeck:</Member></B> I appreciate that this is a complex issue and
that change is always difficult, but does the Minister not share my
view that in many respects the MMO has not helped itself by
persistently insisting that everything must be done through a freedom

Commissioner? Will he please at least accept that when a member of the

here. There is no market-sensitive information, or at any rate very
little. I think the hon. Lady would admit, however, that the plethora
of FOI requests from 
<?notus-xml column=1029?>her constituent has reached confetti proportions. When they are
responded to—as they are—there is a follow-up, and
another and another. If that information were vital to the results of

true that sometimes it has been found that the MMO has not given
exactly the right detail. I am not complacent, and I want
everyone in my Department to provide information of a high standard at
all times, but let me suggest respectfully that the way in which
information has been applied for has rather given the impression that
the perfect is the enemy of the
good.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305216000508" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0004.htm#1305216000508">The
new data processes make use of a key benefit from the electronic
logbooks, allowing near real-time monitoring of scalloping effort, and
allowing each administration to monitor individual near real-time
vessel activity as part of the enforcement of days-at-sea limits.
Engagement with the industry has been a priority, and we have sought
for it to take responsibility for the management of the fishery. Over
the last 18 months, administrations have worked closely with the
scallop industry consultation group. A management system has been
agreed which sets quarterly days-at-sea limits for vessels affected by
the regime. Industry compliance has been strong, and improved
significantly throughout 2012 and into
2013.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305216000509" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0004.htm#1305216000509">The
use of the monitoring system, supported by a close working relationship
between MMO coastal staff and vessel operators, helped to produce
circumstances in which no English vessels exceeded their days-at-sea
limits for the first quarter of 2013. In 2012, that working
relationship allowed the fishery to stay open throughout the year, and
virtually all effort available to the UK was used. As I have said, that
involved a Herculean effort on the part of a great many
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305216000510" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/debtext/130520-0004.htm#1305216000510">Despite
effort restrictions, the scalloping sector remains profitable. That is
very important. Last year, sales of UK scallop landings reached almost
£70 million, an increase from £64 million in 2011 and
from £55 million in 2010. Furthermore, last year the
over-15-metre fleet fishing in ICES area VII landed more than
27,000 tonnes, worth £29 million, which was a
substantial increase on the 14,000 tonnes, worth £17
million, which were landed in 2008. We want this profitable industry to
continue to be the success that those figures have proved it to
be.</hs_Para>

MMO works collaboratively with the industry and the UK Administrations,
setting days-at-sea limits and organising industry-sourced

industry. This collaborative approach has helped ensure that the

am aware of the concerns raised by the scalloping sector about time
lags and the frustrations these can cause, and the hon. Lady also
rightly raised them. Data lags are caused by the need to validate data
and conduct quality checks required under European legislation before
data are reported to the Commission. The Commission acknowledges these
time lags are an inherent part of the control systems that all member
states are required to operate. They are caused by the nature and
extent of the validation processes that need to take place. Logbook
data need to be checked with satellite vehicle monitoring systems data
and with other notes. That cannot be done overnight.</hs_Para>

the House should note that these reports are not used to make
management decisions, or to monitor the fishery. As of 2013 and the
introduction of electronic logbooks, these decisions are based on
real-time data systems that have been developed since the introduction
of e-logbooks, which virtually eliminate the impact of data lag for
management purposes. I hope that reassures the hon. Lady about the way

analysis shows that financial services and banking sector employs
around 7% of the total Scottish workforce and contributes more than 8%
of onshore GDP to the Scottish economy. As part of the UK, Scotland
benefits from and contributes to the UK’s position as a global
leader in financial services. The UK is seen as having a strong tax and
regulatory environment which supports a competitive financial centre.
The size of the industry relative to the UK economy means the UK is
resilient to financial shocks and has in the Bank of England a
strong and credible lender of last resort. Consumers are in
turn protected by the UK’s financial services compensation
scheme which guarantees deposits in UK banks up to
£85,000.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1305205000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/wmstext/130520m0001.htm#1305205000029">In
the event of a vote for independence, there would be consequences for
the financial sector and for its customers, including all individuals

would create two separate financial jurisdictions: the continuing UK

framework.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1305205000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/wmstext/130520m0001.htm#1305205000030">An
independent Scotland would have an exceptionally large financial
services sector compared to the size of its economy, making it more
vulnerable to financial shocks than as part of the UK. The assets of
the whole UK banking sector around 492% of total UK GDP. By contrast,
Scottish banks have assets totalling around 1,254% of Scottish GDP,
assuming that firms did not make significant changes to their group

UK has established effective arrangements for protecting consumers of
financial services. These ensure that customers benefit from consistent
standards and fair treatment across the whole UK.
An independent Scottish state would need to establish its own financial

<?notus-xml column=52?>consumer protection because of EU requirements that
member states have their own schemes for protecting customers’
deposits. The paper also examines the implications of independence on

analysis concludes that Scotland has a strong and vibrant financial
services industry. As part of the UK, firms and individuals benefit
from a world-leading financial services sector and a large, integrated
domestic market for financial services with few barriers to business
conducted between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Consumers benefit
from clear and effective arrangements for protecting their savings and
deposits. This position would be put at risk if Scotland were to become
independent, fragmenting the market and the bodies that have been put
in place to protect customers, creating additional difficulties and

May 2012 we set out in our response to Alan Cook’s review of the
strategic road network in England, plans for a new smarter approach to
investment planning for this network, through route-based strategies.
As part of this we made clear that these documents would see greater
collaboration with local stakeholders through local authorities and
local enterprise partnerships to determine the nature, need and timing
of future investment that might be required on the network. Central to
this would be the need to understand local economic growth aspirations

needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1305205000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/wmstext/130520m0001.htm#1305205000064">We

strategies will be developed in two stages. In the first stage the
Highways Agency will work with local stakeholders to develop a uniform
set of route-based strategies for all routes on the network. The
strategies will identify performance issues on routes and future
challenges, taking account of local growth challenges and priorities.
The emphasis for this stage will be on establishing the evidence base
as opposed to identifying solutions, which will take place in the next
stage. It is intended that this first stage will be completed by spring
2014.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1305205000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/wmstext/130520m0001.htm#1305205000067">The
Highways Agency and the Department will then use this evidence to
prioritise and take forward a programme of work to identify indicative
solutions which will cover operational, maintenance and if appropriate,
road improvement schemes to inform investment plans for the next full
spending review in 2015 and beyond. The Highways Agency will ensure
they engage further with local stakeholders as the indicative solutions
are developed and it is anticipated that this second stage will

the next few months the Highways Agency will be talking to key
stakeholders to: seek further views and lessons learnt on the
production of the first three strategies; share their plans on delivery
of the wider programme; and to start to seek input to developing the

previously outlined, once the 2012 scheme has been opened to all
applicants and has been shown to be working well, the Government intend
to begin a gradual process of ending liabilities on cases in the

Government will also begin charging application, collection and
enforcement fees in the 2012 scheme. We have listened to concerns that

intend to carefully manage the process of ending liabilities on cases

ways.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1305205000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/wmstext/130520m0001.htm#1305205000077">First,
we will change the proposed order in which liability is ended on CSA
cases, starting with those CSA cases where a nil liability has been
calculated, and therefore there is no possibility of payment
disruption. We expect around 50,000 previously nil-assessed cases to be
positively assessed in the 2012 scheme, resulting in maintenance
flowing to these children for the first time; we will then end
liability on cases that are not currently compliant, again because
there is no current payment arrangement to disrupt; followed by any
cases that are compliant but not subject to enforcement action,
starting with those cases managed clerically. Finally, we will end
liability on CSA cases that are in legal enforcement—and where
money is flowing—or where money is only flowing as a result of
an enforced method of payment. We 
<?notus-xml column=59?>anticipate this process of ending liability in CSA

finish.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1305205000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/wmstext/130520m0001.htm#1305205000078">Children
living in lone parent families tend to be at greater risk of falling

we will take a firmer line on which non-resident parents will be given
the choice of paying the parent with care directly. We will offer a
“compliance opportunity” to those non-resident parents
who are subject to enforced methods of payment, such as deduction from
earnings orders. We will write to non-resident parents nine months
before their CSA maintenance liabilities are due to end, offering them
the opportunity to prove their compliance voluntarily by paying via an
unenforced method of payment such as direct debit for the final six
months of their CSA liability.</hs_Para>

non-resident parents who accept the invitation and then comply would
have access to the “direct pay” option and thereby avoid
the collection fee. Non-resident 
<?notus-xml column=60?>parents who refuse or fail this invitation will, if a case is opened on
the 2012 scheme, be placed on the same enforcement method that they
were subject to in the CSA schemes, thereby minimising the potential

although this statement concerns changes to the statutory scheme, our
reforms go wider than this. Our starting point is that children tend to
do better when they have a positive relationship with both parents, so
we are supporting both parents to play an active and positive
role in the life of their child through the help and support
for separated families (HSSF) programme. As part of this, we have
launched the sorting out separation web app; an HSSF mark; the HSSF

is where someone's broadband or telephone line is switched to another
provider without their consent. Ofcom is committed to tackling slamming
and has a number of rules in place to prevent it. Ofcom rules
explicitly prohibit all companies from engaging in dishonest,
misleading or deceptive conduct, and oblige providers to ensure
consumers fully understand and consent to a contract before it is
agreed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052042000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/text/130520w0001.htm#13052042000103">There
are also a number of safeguards built into the switching process which
are specifically designed to protect consumers from being slammed.
According to these rules, consumers must receive a letter informing
them of the imminent switch, with a 10-day switchover period during
which the order can be stopped. Typically, the consumer will receive
letters from both companies involved. This gives them the ability to
cancel any inadvertent transfer before it happens. Since the
introduction of these rules three years ago, the number of average
monthly mis-selling and slamming complaints has fallen from 845 per
month in the 12 months prior to these rules being introduced, to 460
complaints per month in the last 12
months.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052042000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/text/130520w0001.htm#13052042000104">Ofcom

Fallon:</Member></B> Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) involves the
partial in-situ combustion of deep underground coal seams to produce a
gas for use as an energy source. UCG is very much in its infancy at
this stage, but I am keen that we play our part in creating a
regulatory environment which helps rather than hinders those with
ambitions in the sector. Our NDPB, the Coal Authority, is very much in
the lead as the freehold owner of the coal resource and the licensing
body for the exploitation of coal. The authority has to date issued
some 14 conditional near offshore UCG licences to companies keen to
pursue the technology further in Great Britain. These enable
prospective operators to secure the rights to the coal while projects
are developed but importantly do not permit UCG operations to commence
until all other rights and permissions are in
place.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13052042000028" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/text/130520w0001.htm#13052042000028">Energy

for energy investment and is attracting interest from potential new
investors across renewables, nuclear and carbon capture and storage.
Ernst &amp; Young's most recent attractiveness indices rated the UK as
one of the top six worldwide destinations to invest in renewable energy
(February 2013). The UK has the most installed offshore wind capacity
in the world and we have the four largest offshore wind farms. We also
have more installed wave and tidal capacity than any other
country.</hs_Para>

Government's view is that contracts for difference (CfDs) will open up
new opportunities for independent generation developers and will
support the development of a more competitive market for power purchase
agreements. Government is working closely with industry to smooth the
transition to the new regime, and has included powers in the Energy
Bill to give it the flexibility to act to improve the route to market
for independents if it becomes necessary. Government is also
considering whether there is a case for further action to ensure that
the market is ready for the CfD and that independent generators are

provide support to authorities who experience a significant decline in

licence holder. The risk assessment is used to determine the frequency,

stay for more than 12 months are long-term migrants, according to the
UN definition. The ONS has recently changed its methodology so that in
future it will be possible to identify students in emigration as well
as immigration flows. This will begin to provide a more accurate

compliance schemes, acting on behalf of those that originally placed

local authorities to work together to ensure the safe collection and
recovery of CLFs. This would include compliance with the duty of care
for waste, which requires waste producers to use a registered waste

preparing and presenting cases offset through orders to pay costs made
by the court in successful cases. The evaluation of the police-led

Francois</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 14 May 2013]:</I> If a member
of the armed forces is killed in action, a convening authority must be
appointed to decide whether there is to be a service inquiry. The
convening authority is an officer of or above the rank of Naval
Captain, Colonel or Group Captain who is normally in the chain of
command of the ship/unit/establishment of the personnel involved in the
matter to be investigated.</hs_Para>

applied by the convening authority is laid down in the Armed Forces
(Service Inquiries) Regulations 2008. The regulations state that the
convening authority must cause a service inquiry to be held, if he/she
considers that anything of consequence to the armed forces which is not
apparent from the death may be learned by the armed forces by means of
a service inquiry. In making a decision the convening authority will no
doubt have regard to any recommendation made, or views expressed, by a
coroner. However, coroners do not have the authority to determine the
way in which their recommendations are taken forward, including
requesting a service inquiry. The convening authority will also take
into account other work connected to the incident, such as a wider
review of policy, processes and procedures to capture lessons and
implement measures to help prevent a
recurrence.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13052058000005" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/text/130520w0003.htm#13052058000005">Armed

of the participation age for all 16 and 17-year-olds accords well with
the armed forces approach to recruitment. Of the three options
available to 16 and 17-year-olds to meet this obligation, the Ministry
of 
<?notus-xml column=493?>Defence provides two, undertaking an apprenticeship and taking full-time
employment that includes structured training. The armed forces
recognise this and as the largest national deliverer of
apprenticeships, regard the continued participation of 16 and
17-year-olds in this way as central to the professional and personal
development of this cohort. Experience shows that, in general terms,
those who are recruited at 16 and 17 often become particularly
effective members of the armed

allegations of sexual offences listed in schedule 2 of the Armed Forces
Act 2006 to the service police, in accordance with the Act and the
Manual of Service Law. Where allegations are made relating to sexual
offences not listed in schedule 2, commanding officers still have a
duty to investigate these appropriately but they cannot deal with them
summarily. In practice it is likely they will be reported to the
service police. Investigations by the service police will comply with
the relevant provisions of Armed Forces Act 2006, subordinate
legislation under the Act and other applicable legislation (such as the

system is retrospective and based upon work already carried out and
reported upon; therefore, no guidance is required in relation to the
suspension or removal of a bonus. We do not have a process to claw
performance awards back and there is no record of this having occurred

others will see their normal pension age increase in 2015-16. It is not
possible to specify what the impact on contributions would be, if the
NPA were to be reduced to 60 for either DFRS or MDP personnel. This
would depend on how the additional costs, when they are known, would be

such is the responsibility of the Ascension Island Government. There
was no local assessment of fish stocks for target fish species in the
Ascension Island fishery prior to the issuing of licences on a trial
basis in 2010. The fishery must not exceed catch limits (quota)
available to each participating country, which are set and regulated at
an international level by the International Commission for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. Licensing this fishery has provided the
mechanism to ensure that catches are now reported on at a local level,
which is a key element of any future, more localised, fish stock
assessment. Ascension Island Government, along with the Foreign and

mechanisms to better police and regulate the

“foreign agents” NGO law. I raised this subject with
Deputy Foreign Minister Titov during my visit to Moscow in February. In
a statement in March, I urged the Russian authorities not to place
advocacy groups under special scrutiny. Senior officials also raised

claim for ‘actual’ expenditure necessarily incurred as
part of their duties. Actual expenses are either claimed back or
processed on Government Procurement Cards. This replaced the
‘subsistence’ fixed based system which was in use prior
to 2010. The current FCO policy ensures accountability and transparency
in all our travel claims as they are regularly audited, while all

money to a UN-administered election fund. I have recently been assured
by Yemeni Foreign Minister al-Qirbi that progress has been made on

aged 25 to 64), along with HPV test-of-cure for newly treated women
with normal or low grade abnormalities six months after treatment. In

cause, mental health problems. The mental health strategy, ‘No
Health Without Mental Health’, has several aims, one of which is
to improve quality of services and make the most of the resources that
we have. In pursuit of this aim, the Strategy recommends broadening the
approach taken to mental health in order to tackle the wider social
determinants and consequences of mental health problems. The Strategy
suggests that this could include face-to-face debt advice, which we
know can be cost-effective within five years. The initial cost of debt
advice can be offset by savings to the national health service, which
include legal aid and gains in terms of employment productivity, even
before taking into account the costs saved by
creditors.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052111000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/text/130520w0006.htm#13052111000225">I

Development (OECD) has published a number of reports that compare the
early years systems within member countries, including looking at the
different staffing and qualification requirements. The Department for
Education has engaged directly with the OECD to better understand their
research findings, and to see what their evidence suggests could
improve the English system. I have corresponded with Andreas
Schleicher, Special Adviser on Education Policy to the
Secretary-General of the OECD, who is supportive of improving staff
qualifications and says the best education systems prioritise quality
of staff over class sizes. He has acknowledged the importance of the

that the targets set in the Act, looked at in isolation, capture the
full reality of poverty in the United Kingdom. This is why we have
consulted on better measures of child poverty. The targets in the Act,
which are separate from the statistics used to monitor them, can drive
perverse policy decisions designed to move families above an arbitrary

low income and material deprivation child poverty target measures are
sourced from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) publication.
This publication has been designated as a National Statistic by the UK
Statistics Authority; this means it is fully compliant with the
principles in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics. These
principles include that the statistics be produced using sound methods,

statistics within the HBAI publication are largely based on data
collected through the Family Resources Survey (FRS) which are
considered to be robust and of good quality. Like all sample surveys of
this type they are subject to both sampling error as well as bias from
non-sampling error. However rigorous checks and analysis are carried
out to ensure that consistent valid and reliable results are produced
which are statistically fit for purpose against the targets set out in

in more than half of children being entitled to free school meals in
England, at a cost of up to an extra £1 billion per year. In the

credit will change the benefits by which children are entitled to free
school meals (FSM); but it will not change the process, in education
legislation, through which families become entitled. Under section
512ZB of the Education Act 1996, a child or his or her parents must
first make a request for free school meals to the school or local
authority to become eligible for free school meals. The Department for
Education aims to ensure that, as universal credit is introduced from
2013, the new FSM entitlement criteria are easily integrated into local
FSM administrative and delivery

71% of graduates undertaking initial teacher training (ITT) in 2012/13
have a 2:1 or higher degree, the highest proportion recorded. More
schools recruit and select their own trainees, work with the accredited
teacher training provider of their choice and also tailor courses to
suit their own needs. Over 9,400 places have been allocated to schools
under the School Direct programme in 2013/14. There are now 360
Teaching Schools representing 301 Teaching School alliances, working
together to ensure high quality school-led ITT and offering
professional development
opportunities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052112001165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/text/130520w0008.htm#13052112001165">New
Teachers' Standards and appraisal regulations came into force on 1
September 2012, making it easier for teachers and head teachers to
assess teachers' performance. Our reforms to teachers' pay, to be
implemented in schools from September 2013, will strengthen the link
between pay and performance, and provide head teachers with the
flexibility to target any school-level recruitment and retention
problems.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13052112000042" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/text/130520w0008.htm#13052112000042">Teachers:

Where a teacher has more than one post A level qualification in the

Confidence intervals have been calculated around the proportions as not
all schools were able to submit curriculum information, and not all
qualifications returns were complete. Qualifications information was
either not provided, or the subject field was missing for 12% of the
teachers in schools submitting curriculum data. The confidence
intervals show the statistical accuracy for the data, and give a range
within which we can be reasonably sure (95% certain) that the true

introduced in all 43 police force areas, in England and Wales in 2004,
under the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. Under
the scheme, the police are able to issue penalty notices to persons
aged 16 and over for a range of offences related to the misuse of
fireworks including throwing fireworks, breach of fireworks curfew (11
pm to 7 am), possession of a category 4 firework and possession by a
person under 18 of adult firework. All these offences attract the
higher tariff of £80. The aim of the PND scheme is to provide
operational officers a quick and effective alternative disposal option
for dealing with low-level, anti-social and nuisance
offending.</hs_Para>

Wright:</Member></B> The Government is currently consulting on a
proposed model of competitive tendering via the “Transforming
Legal Aid: delivering a more credible and efficient system”
consultation which closes on 4 June 2013. We have been clear we must
continue to bear down on the cost of legal aid, including the £1
billion of taxpayers’ money spent on criminal legal aid a year,
to ensure we are getting the best deal for the taxpayer. As we have
made clear on numerous occasions, we believe the single most effective
way of doing this is to move away from the current complex system of
administratively set fees, through the introduction of competitive
tendering, where providers compete to offer their services at the best
possible price. We are actively engaging with stakeholders on the
proposals and welcome all responses to the
consultation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052112002047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/text/130520w0008.htm#13052112002047">Under
the proposed model, a contract to deliver criminal legal aid defence
services in one procurement area would not permit a provider to deliver
services in 
<?notus-xml column=611?>another procurement area except where a case crossed procurement area
boundaries. This restriction would only apply to those classes of work
against which we propose to set the price by the competition. All other
services, for example, prison law services, would not be restricted to
delivery in the specific procurement area. However, every contractor
awarded a new contract following competitive tendering would be obliged
to deliver all services as prescribed under their
contract.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052112002048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/text/130520w0008.htm#13052112002048">The
proposed model would ensure that providers would be guaranteed a
specific share of the work available (and control of the case from
beginning to end). By awarding longer and larger contracts with greater
certainty of volumes, providers would have increased opportunities to
grow their businesses, become more efficient, and thereby reduce cost
to the
taxpayer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052112002049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/text/130520w0008.htm#13052112002049">The

Standard Crime and Standard Civil contracts, there is no 'value'
assigned and as such the Legal Aid Agency cannot provide this
information. This is because the contracts issued authorise
organisations to undertake work but do not guarantee income. For
criminal work, 
<?notus-xml column=612?>providers are allocated 'duty slots' in which they obtain clients whose
cases arise during that session. For civil face to face work, providers
are allocated a number of 'matter starts' which authorise them to
undertake initial advice for clients which attracts a fixed fee.
However, cases that subsequently require legal representation are
funded on a case by case basis with costs agreed accordingly. For CLA
contracts, the contract value in practice is determined by the number
of calls received
nationally.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052112002055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/text/130520w0008.htm#13052112002055">The
Legal Aid Agency does not record the number of individuals who receive
legal aid. Instead it records the number of 'acts of assistance'. One
individual may receive a number of separate acts of assistance if they
have a range of problems or need different levels of service eg advice
and representation at Court. Estimates are not made of the total number
of acts of assistance at a regional or individual firm level. Although
there is an estimation of the number of "matter starts" allocated at a
firm and procurement area level (which roughly corresponds to a local
authority area) there is no corresponding estimation of certificates
granted to individuals. This is because the number of legal aid
certificates granted is dependent on the number of applications that
satisfy the legal aid eligibility
criteria.</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13052112002141" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130520/text/130520w0008.htm#13052112002141"><Sup>1</Sup>

Short breaks (respite) for disabled children includes all provision for
short-breaks (respite) services for disabled children in need but not
looked after. This includes the costs of short breaks utilising a
residential setting—including overnight stays; day care and

short break services—including those provided through contract
and family link carers; sitting or sessional short break services in
the child's home; or supporting the child to access activities in the
community. The field excludes short breaks for looked after disabled
children; any break exceeding 28 days continuous care; costs associated
with providing disabled children's access to universal day services
such as formal childcare, youth clubs; or extended school
