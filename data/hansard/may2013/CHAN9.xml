is a critical check on the power of the state—and it will remain

the first time in recent history, every offender sentenced to less than
12 months in prison will receive statutory supervision and
rehabilitation in the community when they are released from custody.
Alongside that, we will open up the market to a diverse mix of
providers, freeing them to innovate and paying them by results, so that

manage risk will provide a simple means of transferring offenders from
a medium-risk category to a high-risk category if their situation
changes and if a risk assessment carried out by the public probation
service requires such a transfer. The public probation service will
always remain responsible for dealing with the highest-risk
offenders.</hs_Para>

design challenges with which we have had to wrestle in designing this

services should be rewarded for a complete stop in someone’s
offending. That is what the public are looking for here. However, we
also want to make sure that there are no perverse incentives and that
providers will continue to work with those who are difficult to manage
and those whose lives are difficult to turn around. We will have a
mechanism for payment by results that reflects not just a binary
“did they stop offending altogether or did they not”
measurement, but one of progress in respect of the number of times
someone offends. By combining those two, we think we will get to the
right
measurement.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13052151000018" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0001.htm#13052151000018">Employment

while they are still serving their sentences if that is possible, which
is why we seek to negotiate compulsory prisoner transfer agreements
such as the one that we signed with Albania in January. We are working
towards a similar arrangement with Nigeria. We want offenders to leave
our shores, during the currency of their sentences

that the voluntary and community sector can play a major role, and we
think it important for that role to begin while offenders are still
serving the custodial part of their sentences. The reforms that we have
in mind will enable those who are dealing with rehabilitation to make
contact with offenders early, and to see them through the prison gates
and out into the community. One of the main ways in which we expect
them to help offenders to go straight and stay straight is by finding
jobs for them to do, for, as we know, keeping a job is one of the best

range of different organisations have a significant part to play. I am
familiar with what National Grid does, and I know that it does an
extremely good job. One of the questions that it has raised with me is
whether there are better ways of enabling it to work with offenders in
a limited number of prisons. I think that the restructuring of the
prison estate that we have in mind, which will ensure that prisoners
can be released into the community from only a certain number of

significant part in what providers choose to do in order to turn lives
around. I also agree that involving ex-offenders is a good way to start
to find the mentors whom we will need. A great deal of very effective

a hugely important issue. Given his knowledge of the subject, he will
recognise that a consistent approach is also important. As I said a
moment ago, the work should start while prisoners are in custody and
continue as they go through the prison gates and out into the
community, so that supervision and support for those with drug or
alcohol problems can be maintained throughout the process to ensure
that they do not relapse and go back to their old ways. We will
certainly think about how we can engage with not just health service
providers but rehabilitation providers, and do so over a longer

Wright:</Member></B> As the hon. Lady says, this is a difficult and
faltering path for many people with serious drug addiction problems.
The system that we are designing, however, is based on the central
tenet that people should do what works to reduce reoffending, and that
those who do so will be rewarded for it. If someone has a major drug
problem, it will be necessary for providers to address that in order to
ensure that that person does not reoffend. I am confident that they
will focus on those issues, and will do what is necessary to turn
people’s lives around. If what is necessary in the case of a
particular individual is getting him off drugs and keeping him off
them, I am sure that that is what they will do, but we will need to
bring in a number of agencies to work with
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052151000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0001.htm#13052151000091"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T11:55:00"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Mr Gregory Campbell" PimsId="2448" UID="13052151000390" xid="95" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0001.htm#13052151000390"><B>Mr

there are good and bad reports on private prisons, just as there are
good and bad reports on public prisons. We will want to make sure that
we do everything we can to engage in rehabilitation while people are in

rightly expect that prisons should be a place of punishment and

keeping out of trouble. That is not just unfair at a time when the rest

That is why we have announced a major overhaul of our incentives and
earned privileges schemes in prisons. We want to see prisoners earning
their privileges by working hard to turn their lives around. We have
banned certificate-18 DVDs, subscription TV will be removed by the
summer, prisoners will in future have a longer working day, and if they
behave badly or do not engage with rehabilitation activities they will
be stripped of their privileges. That is designed to improve confidence
in our prison regime and to encourage positive rehabilitation

year compared with just three years ago—those are additional
numbers—and the simple fact is that if growth continues at that
rate it will be unsustainable. It also means that when there are

contract, we have seen a significant rise in attendances at
A and E—4 million more people are using
A and E every year than when the contract was

We have failed as an NHS to give the public confidence in there being

need other things, besides those two extremes, and to do a better job

England announced an important change a few weeks ago. Previously,
hospitals had no say over how the money that is withheld from them is
spent—it is meant to be used to reduce demand. We are now
setting up urgent care boards, and hospitals will have a seat round the

strikes me would make a huge difference to ambulance services is if
staff could access the GP records of someone they were picking up on a
999 call, so that they would know that the patient was a diabetic with
mild dementia and a heart condition, for instance. That kind of

answer to the question from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T13:17:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Edmonton (Mr Love) is that the changes in the 2004 GP contract are
not the only cause of pressure on A and Es, but
they are a significant cause. They set in train a process of declining
public confidence in GP out-of-hours care, which has fuelled the growth
in A and E attendances, and that growth has
continued so that in the three years since 2009, attendances have gone
up by more than 1 million. That is why those changes are having a
significant impact on A and E

is argued that that excludes the basis of the new clause, let me point
out that there are two exceptions: from the start, Jews and the Quakers

exceptions, in this instance for humanists. It introduces a third

I first received communications from humanists supporting this

from the humanism.org.uk website that there are wedding celebrants who
can take services now. It is recommended that people obtain a civil
marriage certificate at the register office and then hold the ceremony
wherever they want, perhaps in the open air: they are not limited by
buildings in any way. I understand that that applies to a number of

<?notus-xml column=1076?>Jews and Quakers are not. My contention is that we should recognise the
strong popular support for humanism, just as we recognise popular
support for other forms of marriage. Many organisations can perform
legal marriages in their own right, and do so for smaller numbers than
the humanists would and, indeed, than the humanists do now. While I
would not for one minute suggest that our marriage laws should be based
on some sort of numbers game—although I believe that some
Members sought to suggest as much in Committee, an approach that I
found somewhat offensive and regrettable—my contention is
supported, in this context, by the fact that not only is practice in
relation to humanist marriages already fairly widespread, but the
numbers are increasing. The popularity is
growing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0002.htm#13052156000040"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Attorney-General" PimsId="3566" UID="13052156000573" xid="239" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0002.htm#13052156000573">The

identifies a group that is not a religious group and gives it a special

secular groups would claim non-discrimination rights under article 14.

these weddings are somehow illegal under European law. However, the UK
is the signatory to European human rights treaties, so what he says is

and doubts have been expressed about the quality of the service, if I
may call it that, that humanists would offer, but the British Humanist
Association runs a long-established ceremony service. We have already
identified that many people, including many of us, have 
<?notus-xml column=1082?>already attended humanist weddings and some of us might have attended
humanist funerals or baby-naming ceremonies. There is a very long and
extensive experience in this country of participation in such
ceremonies and to my knowledge no adverse comment or criticism of them
has been made at all—indeed, quite the reverse.</hs_Para>

is also important to note that the British Humanist Association is
extremely concerned about maintaining the highest quality. It trains,
accredits, insures and provides a form of continuing professional
education for its hundreds of celebrants throughout the country.
Perhaps we should therefore not be surprised that the ceremonies
attract high satisfaction as a result; more than 95% of clients, if I
may call them that, give them a five-out-of-five rating. That is not an
experience that all people report from their registry office or other
wedding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T13:52:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0002.htm#13052156000097">Humanist
weddings, in particular—this is based on the testimony of those
couples who have had one—are greatly valued as reflecting those
couples’ beliefs and allowing the ceremony to be devised, in
collaboration with the celebrant, in a way that meets their own wishes.
I have read some letters over the course of the past few weeks from
couples who write eloquently about how much the ceremony has meant not
only to them but to their relatives and friends. I am sure that over
the past week or so, many right hon. and hon. Members will also have
heard from the 3,000-plus humanists in this country, including many
couples who have had a humanist wedding, about the importance of the
ceremony to them. It is clear that we already have in this country a
precious form of ceremony that is highly valued by many couples, and my
new clause would simply seek to recognise and acknowledge that in
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T13:53:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

established Church did not allow nonconformist Churches to hold burial

intervention. The Secretary of State has been extremely eloquent
throughout the passage of the Bill about the importance that she

with the grain of her position by seeking to extend marriage to more
couples precisely because they share that sense of its importance and
want to value it.</hs_Para>

whole Bill is about equality, although I recognise that it is
predominantly about equal marriage for lesbian, gay, transsexual and,
indeed, bisexual people. My new clause is also about equality; it is
about the equal recognition of humanist marriages. We should remember
that they are already legal in many countries, where they contribute to
an increase in the number of marriages, going with the grain of the
Secretary of State’s ambitions to strengthen and extend marriage
in our society. In Scotland, for example, the number of marriages has
been rising in recent years, with an increase of more than 1,500
between 2009 and 2011, more than half of which are accounted for by
humanist marriages.</hs_Para>

is plenty of evidence of public demand for reform. I believe that this
proposal is a reform that disadvantages no one and costs the public
purse close to zero. In an age of equality, it removes an unnecessary
injustice based on religion or belief, and it will strengthen the
institution of marriage, going with the grain of Ministers’
intentions for the Bill. I believe that today we need to move forward
to introduce legal humanist marriages in our country, as they have been
successfully introduced in other countries across a range of legal
jurisdictions. If the Government have concerns, we need to see a
written view from the Attorney-General about those objections, so that
they can be scrutinised not just by amateur Scottish lawyers such as
me, but by properly qualified expert human rights lawyers and others.

the House will know, when the Bill was introduced the Church of England
and other faith groups did not greet it with unalloyed joy. However, we
sought to engage constructively with Ministers and officials and they
constructively engaged with us. Ministers and the Government made it
clear at the outset that they wanted to ensure that faith groups that
did not wish to perform same-sex marriages would not be obliged to do
so. The legislation therefore has at its heart protections for faith
groups such as the Church of England, the Roman Catholic Church,
Muslims and others who do not wish to perform or celebrate same-sex
marriages. That is enshrined in the quadruple lock for the Church of
England, because of canon law, and in the other locks for other faith
groups. Those locks are essential to ensuring the freedoms that the
Government made clear at the outset would be there to protect faith
groups.</hs_Para>

was not praying in aid just faith groups. The hon. Lady has not
consulted anyone, but she might at least seek to consult those faith
groups for which there are protections enshrined in the
Bill—unless she is saying that she is not impressed by the
protections to ensure that faith groups are not compelled to perform
same-sex marriages if they do not wish to do so. When the debate first
started, many of the representations that I received were from people
of faith who were concerned that this was a slippery road which would
lead to their being obliged at some time in the future to undertake
same-sex marriages in churches even if they did not want to do so, and
I do not think it helps if the hon. Lady gives even a
scintilla of a suggestion that that might be the direction

protections are very important. There are historic reasons why Quakers
and Jews are treated differently, but they are faith groups. Indeed,
Quaker marriages are not celebrant-based, because there are no
celebrants in the society of friends. In a sense, the hon. Lady wants
to have it both ways. The new clause relates to non-religious
organisations, yet it seeks to apply the protections that refer to
religious organisations. We therefore have a sort of bolt-on, whereby
the hon. Lady is claiming for the humanists, who are clearly not in a
religious organisation, the protections in the legislation for
religious

case that the Church of England and other groups should be able to
produce ceremonies in their way. Can he explain why, while believing
that the Church of England should be protected and allowed to have its
ceremonies in its way, humanists should not be allowed to have their

possible to find at least one Bishop who will have a view contrary to
the other 43. Let me put it on record, lest there is any scintilla of
doubt, that the Church of England is strongly opposed to the new
clause, not because we do not love or like humanists, but simply
because it would unpick the locks in the Bill, which, when we started,

also because I was extremely fortunate in having the honour of being
best man at the wedding of two humanist friends, Derek and Louise, in
September 2007. It was an honour to play a role in that ceremony. I was

currently drafted is that we are allowing a situation to continue in
which some religions—to be more precise, some sects of some
religions—have access to a civil marriage ceremony while other
religions, sects of religions and belief-based systems do not. To me,
as a liberal, that is simply not justifiable. My opinion is simply that
each and every citizen of this country, of all belief systems and

the Member for Bristol North West (Charlotte Leslie), whose support and
common-sense approach on this I appreciate. The simple reality is that
if the Government had approached this matter in a more rational and
common-sense way, the debate we are having now would be entirely
unnecessary. Many Members on both sides of the
House—interestingly, they include many who have concerns about
the Bill and many who fully support it—believe that we should be
making a proper separation 
<?notus-xml column=1091?>of the belief-based recognition of a relationship, whether humanist or
religious, from the state’s right to confer legal rights and
legal recognition on individuals. The trouble is that the Bill, as
drafted, conflates and confuses the two. Even worse, it enshrines the
confusion we have heard about, such as the various marriage Acts
replacing each other, and adds even more layers of complexity, which
means legal confusion. At the same time, there is the absurd situation
in which the Bill is having to specify in law that some Churches may
not marry certain people and having to put in place protections for
other Churches so that they do not have to do so. Of course, if we had
a proper separation of civil and marriage, those things would simply
not be

certain people of some religions and, in the case of humanism, belief
systems, have the right to access a civil marriage ceremony according
to their beliefs while others do not. The Bill, as drafted, will
continue to allow that. I am afraid that, as with civil partnerships,
it will enshrine the existing inequality in the law, and that cannot be

As I said yesterday, the new clause cannot be seen in isolation; it has
to be seen with amendment 10, which sought the repeal of the Marriage
Act 1949. It must also be linked with the amendment that I tabled to
remove clauses in the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 and to repeal the

That is my whole point. I do not accept that some religions should have
the right to access a civil marriage ceremony but not others; as a

as do I and all right hon. and hon. Members, that marriage is being
redefined; the state has chosen, through its Parliament, to do that.

Friend’s question, and I am happy to address that. In order to
have the necessary separation between civil and religious ceremonies,
we would need to ensure that no religious minister was able to convey
the rights of legal marriage. Nevertheless, it is perfectly possible,
either through the presence of a registrar at a belief-based or
religious marriage ceremony, or by another process, to have that
conveyed at the same time. If my right hon. Friend
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T14:39:15"></hs_TimeCode> arguing
against that separation, he is defending the situation that the
Government are proposing, which will mean having to legislate on what
certain Churches may or may not do and needing a complex system of law
to ensure that other Churches, including the one he belongs to, are not
then forced to do things they do not want to do. If we have a proper
separation, none of those things is necessary, and surely that is the

The hon. Gentleman is clearly explaining that redefining marriage
raises lots of complications. Perhaps if we had gone back to first base
and had a longer, more considered consultation about the redefinition
of marriage, although perhaps not quite as long as the one we are about
to have on civil partnerships, we could have reached a more consensual
view about the state’s involvement in unions. Has he made any
representations to the Church of England? Would not his new clause have
an impact on the relationship between Church and state, particularly

the room, which is the establishment of the Church of England. That is
another matter that is worthy of debate. There will be different views,
and I hope that he is prepared to take part in that debate. I am trying
to show that it is possible to separate civil marriage and religious
and belief-based ceremonies without necessarily having the effect that
he suggests. This involves the constitution as well as the Church of
England. I suggest to him—I do not know if he would
agree—that the Church of England is now in a most odd and
uncomfortable position as a result of the way in which the Bill has
been drafted. Similarly, it is not a particularly happy situation for
other Churches. That would not necessarily be the case if we had the

Friend’s view that had we had a proper and fuller
consultation—this is not so much about the time period as about

seriously at sweeping away the current framework and coming up with one

are all aware of the political difficulties in the Conservative party
and the differences within the coalition and across the House. Same-sex
marriage is an important measure and it is imperative that we deal with
it now. If it does not happen now, political complexions may change as
we approach the 2015 election and we might miss the opportunity. People
may make the calculated gamble that if the issue is pushed into the
long grass, it will stay there.

that, but I was simply making the case that in practice, if that came
in now and we essentially abolished marriage, people would wake up in a
slightly different relationship from the one they anticipated when they
made their vows. In parallel, I was making a perhaps not very funny

right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. I say that because I am
suspicious when I cannot hear a single argument against the principle
of a proposal—there is agreement that it is absolutely
reasonable and a proper extension of rights to humanists—but we
get a barrow load of technical or legal difficulties and risks, and the
idea that there has not been time for consultation. The idea that we do
not have the opportunity during the passage of the Bill through both
Houses of Parliament to sit down and address the technical objections
to this suggestion and others, and to get the Bill right before it
finally hits the statute book, does not reflect terribly well on us as
legislators or on the advice that we can

hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Jane Ellison) said that the Bill
was not the right vehicle for addressing the matter, but I do not think
that we will see another marriage Bill coming down the track any time

after going through the joy of the past 18 months of
consultation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T14:55:57"></hs_TimeCode> and
processes, will be a little limited. That was why, yesterday, my right
hon. Friend the Secretary 
<?notus-xml column=1098?>of State suggested a five-year time bar before the issue would be
reconsidered. That was overturned at the insistence of the Opposition,
whose amendment she accepted.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T13:44:50"></hs_TimeCode> rather suspect
that that time-limitation arrangement was suggested because Ministers

there is a slight problem because existing laws are already
discriminatory in that respect and vulnerable to challenge by the
European Court of Human Rights. As I said earlier, it is preposterous
to make the point that 
<?notus-xml column=1099?>extending human rights and the right to marry to a group of people will
somehow fall foul of the European Court of Human Rights, if our

wants there to be same-sex marriages, which is its purpose. I am sure
that he also wants to ensure that no faith group that does not wish to
conduct same-sex marriages is obliged to do so. The Bill sets in place
a number of protections, and moving from a buildings-based system of
marriage to a celebrant-based system, which the new clause would
introduce, would simply unpick all the protections that have been built

for me a single lock ought to be perfectly satisfactory. He and I will
therefore differ on the practicalities of the protections that need to
be given to religious organisations. He does not object to the
principle that humanists ought to be allowed to carry out
marriages—I have not heard him say that—but he is

other religious groups to carry out marriages in the way that they

Durkan</B> (Foyle) (SDLP):</Member> Earlier in my political life I was
Minister of Finance and Personnel in the Northern Ireland Executive,
and in that capacity, bizarrely, I had responsibility for the Office of
Law Reform and for registration. I worked to bring forward measures
that were about changing how civil registration and civil law on
marriage related to the different religions in Northern Ireland,
because it related very differently. Unlike what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:06:39"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry) said in his description of the law on
marriage in England, which was that is entirely related to premises or
property, the situation in Northern Ireland meant that for Catholics,
as long as a marriage was conducted by an episcopally-ordained
priest—it did not matter where—the state recognised it.
For the Church of Ireland, only the premises mattered.</hs_Para>

powers that came from the old position of Lord Lieutenant General in
Ireland from the 17th century, I had to sign if a new Church of Ireland
church was created. There was a wonderful vellum scroll and illuminated
manuscript—so much so that I was able to tell my wife that I
felt like a lay bishop in the Church of Ireland. For Presbyterians it
was different again: the persons were recognised, for the conduct of
marriage, within the geography of a given presbytery, and marriage was
not confined to a particular building or anything else.</hs_Para>

brought forward measures to try to equalise things, and in many ways we
borrowed from changes made in Scotland. Some of the Churches were shaky
on it at the time, but the smaller Protestant Churches were glad of our
changes, because many that could conduct marriages on their only if a
civil registrar was also present to verify it, were then able to
conduct them under their own auspices and integrity of their rites and
rituals.</hs_Para>

that time I made it clear to my officials that if demand emerged in
relation to humanists or another belief system, we would have to
address that. It did not 
<?notus-xml column=1101?>emerge during the debates at the time, but I support the principle of
it. I have said about other aspects of the Bill that all equality
should be equal; the problem that some of us have with this Bill is
that it is not equal in all cases in its central
thrust of extending equality to same-sex couples. I supported the Bill
on Second Reading and continue to support it, but I appeal to
colleagues to stop jumping and hopping about here and there on the
issue of when they want equality, and when they support and respect
belief systems.</hs_Para>

belief system of humanism, and ensuring that people can achieve that.
That is happening with legislation in the south of Ireland. I represent
a border constituency. I am a Catholic who is part of a cross-border
diocese. As a result of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill which
passed the Oireachtas, later this year and certainly next year humanist
marriages will be conducted in Ireland just over the border from my
constituency. Just as many people who are married in church go over the
border for those weddings, so too will people from my city for humanist
weddings. I therefore have no principled opposition to new clause
15.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0002.htm#13052156000230">The
legislation in Ireland gives the registrar general the capacity to
recognise a secular body, which can in turn appoint people who would be
registered to solemnise marriages. Like new clause 15, the Irish

five years and as a charity. The body cannot have profit making as one
of its purposes. The legislation also describes such a body

Irish Attorney-General felt that that term would cover against any
allegation that the provision was so specific that it related to one
existing organisation only—the Humanist Association of Ireland.
The Irish Attorney-General therefore found a way around—there is
a specific and clear definition, but it is not open to the challenge
that it is exclusively defined, which seems to be what the UK
Attorney-General was saying. Those who support the principle of new
clause 15 might want to look at the Irish wording as things
progress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000232" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0002.htm#13052156000232">It
is right that hon. Members should be accommodating of a belief system
that is not properly recognised in our marriage system and that they
want such a belief system to be recognised in the Bill, but they should
think about the speed with which they rejected emblematic, conscience
amendments yesterday. People with other distinct belief systems feel a
wee bit under threat and are concerned about slippery slopes. There was
an attempt yesterday to make a concession and offer comfort by
recognising such belief systems, but hon. Members decided they would
not do so. Today, there is an opportunity to accommodate another belief
system. Many hon. Members who rejected the accommodation of

interesting perspective from his experience. Regardless of the many
different views—it is important to say that there are not just
two views—it is incredibly disappointing that the Government,
despite saying they would engage and listen, have accepted not a single
amendment in 
<?notus-xml column=1102?>Committee or on the Floor of the House. I am afraid that that is not an

Durkan:</Member></B> I absolutely share the hon. Gentleman’s
concern. That will be one of the difficulties. The fewer amendments
that are accepted in the House, the bigger the excuse for the other
place to take longer, and to go more deeply and more wide ranging with
amendments. People should be able to see that the House has given the
Bill due consideration and added to it in a number of respects. If
people wanted belt-and-braces protections in the Bill, and apps and
widgets, to make them feel more secure and comfortable, why not give
them? We should want people to feel more comfortable with the passage
of the Bill, no matter what their reservations about its provenance.
That is why I support amendments that make more people, such as
humanists, feel included in the equality that the Bill
extends.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0002.htm#13052156000235">Hon.
Members should remember that we had a choice yesterday on civil
partnerships for opposite-sex couples. The issue was ducked. We were
told that the matter could be complicated and that there could be a
review. I would like the people who supported that measure to feel
included in the effort to extend equality in the Bill. I hope that that
happens if the matter is raised in the other place. I do not believe
that this will be the last the House sees of the Bill. The Bill will
come back to us, because people are saying that we are being selective
in adding to the Bill and widening its
scope.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000236" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0002.htm#13052156000236">Some
hon. Members argued against the civil partnerships amendments yesterday
even though they support the principle of equality in civil
partnerships. They argued that such a measure was not germane to the
Bill, and that it took us beyond the Bill’s scope. However, the
same people want an extension for humanist marriage—I agree with
them—even though other hon. Members say that there is a risk and
that it could raise far more complicated issues. The Attorney-General
and the Government are not the only ones who must answer questions as
to the inconsistency or strength of their argument. I have noted a lot
of inconsistency in the House on how far we go to respect belief
systems.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13052156000547" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0002.htm#13052156000547">3.15

Bill have strong objections to how I have voted and how I will continue
to vote, but perhaps I am lucky, because none has been swivel-eyed and
none has argued with pious prejudice. There have been measured
objections. They wanted the protection clauses because they are
concerned that their faith and their sense of the love of God will be
the new love that dare not speak its name. That is what makes people
worried and discomfited. I want hon. Members to give full equality,
consideration and comfort to humanists, and full respect for their

course marriage is never only for the production of children. Many
people get married without that intention, and it might be impossible
for some. That is not the argument. In the theological tradition, one
purpose of marriage is to have children, and that is not possible,

faiths are licensed to carry out marriages—civil marriages
became possible. The position of registrar was set up and people are
able to have entirely civil marriages in a registry office. That is
still the case. Marriages can be held in a place that is entirely

the disestablishment of the Church of England. I am a member of the
Church, but I believe in its disestablishment. Just as the Church in
Wales has been disestablished, I have always believed that in England
we should separate as much as possible the activities of the Church and
the activities of the state. Marriage, therefore, between a man and a
woman in a Christian or religious sense is different from marriages,
partnerships or unions that are secular, or between people of the same

ordained of God and should be celebrated between a man and a woman.

people talk of equal marriage, and I understand that. People who are in

wives. We are not going to be able to put the clock back, which is why
new clause 18 talks about “civil marriage” and not civil
union. Many of my Christian friends say that that is an unacceptable
compromise, because the Christian view of marriage cannot be changed by
calling it civil marriage. We have to wrestle with that issue and sort
it

Hughes:</Member></B> That is a good question. The hon. Lady, as a
former Southwark councillor, knows well the communities I represent.
The short answer is that we could do it one of two ways. We could
either do what is done in many countries on the mainland of Europe,
which is to require everybody to have a civic ceremony first. In France
or Belgium, people go the town hall, have the civil ceremony and then
go to their church, mosque, temple or synagogue and have their faith
ceremony. Secondly, one could separate, in the place of
worship—the black-led church on the Old Kent road, my own church
or any other—the civic part of the ceremony from the faith part.
That is not done in the same way at the moment. In my church in
Bermondsey people do not see clearly the distinction between the two
parts. The couple going to the church on the Old Kent road would
believe they were being married in the eyes of God. They would also
want to be married in the eyes of the law. It could be done in either
of those ways.</hs_Para>

the volume of correspondence I received in the lead-up to Second
Reading, I would say that this Bill is the most controversial I have
been involved in since entering the House in 2011. When it was
presented on Second Reading, I was made very aware of my
constituents’ concerns, and like many Members I was inundated by
e-mails, letters and phone calls in which people overwhelmingly
expressed their fear that their beliefs, faith and religious freedoms
were being challenged. I have not received that level of correspondence

of the number of inquiries I received, I took time to scrutinise the
Bill, and I found cause for concern. The religious communities felt
vulnerable and at risk of having their faith and their freedom to
practise their faith threatened by the Bill. The Churches felt that
they would be legally bound to carry out same-sex ceremonies, even to
the point of being threatened with legal proceedings if they refused.
It would not have been fair to place the Churches in such a position,
so I concluded on Second Reading that I could not support the Bill. I
voted against it not because I was not committed to equality—I
most certainly am—but because I did not want the religious
communities put in that position. It was not an easy decision to
take.</hs_Para>

equal marriage rights, it seems logical that we should address the

about what humanism is. I did not know much about the definition either
until a few years ago. My father was diagnosed with cancer and was told
he had six months to live. He calmly set about putting his affairs in
order, which included his funeral arrangements. I was surprised when he
put down the details of the humanist funeral he wanted. He was an
exceptionally honest, hard-working man, well respected in the community
and living by what we all know as Christian values. He did not go to
church, but then again the majority of people do not.</hs_Para>

recorded history, there have been non-religious people who have
believed that this life is the only life we have, that the universe is
a natural phenomenon with no supernatural side and that we can live
ethical and fulfilling lives on the basis of reason and humanity. They
have trusted to the scientific method, evidence and reason to discover
truths about the universe and have placed human welfare and happiness
at the centre of their ethical decision making. Today, people who share
these beliefs and values are called humanists and this combination of
attitudes is called humanism. Many millions of people in Britain share
this way of living and of looking at the world, but many of them have

trusts the scientific method when it comes to understanding how the
universe works; rejects the idea of the supernatural, and is therefore
probably an atheist or agnostic; makes ethical decisions based on

believes that, in the absence of an afterlife and any discernible

rest of the letter, and I am happy for anybody to see it; I see that
her Parliamentary Private Secretary has copies of it. She is right that
it did not say that the Government supported the amendment or that they
had another way of delivering it; it does not say, “Here are
amendments that could make it work.” It says that the Government
do not support the change because it is the wrong mechanism; it does
not say, “We see you have now reduced the scope and we are very
worried about this because we think you should broaden it back out
again to be ECHR-compliant.” It is quite clear that the strong
impression formed by the BHA from the meetings—I am sure there
will be minutes—is that it was given strong advice to tighten
the amendment. If that is not the case, it is hard to understand why it
would choose to change the original version, which is obviously
available for anyone to read. There has been ample time for the
Attorney-General to consider the new clause, to be consulted on it and
to be asked for his ruling on whether it would accord with the European
convention on human rights. Strangely, however, that did not happen
until the very last moment.</hs_Para>

the Minister of State, Department for Culture,
Media and Sport, the right hon. Member for Faversham and Mid Kent (Hugh
Robertson), and I thank him for his time. As he will no doubt recall,
the objections that were expressed did not centre on the fact that the
new clause would make the whole Bill non-compliant with the convention,
but there was talk of the cost of updating the computer system to allow
an extra field for humanist weddings. He is nodding. A number of other
issues were raised: for example, concern was expressed about the
possibility that the measure would allow humanists to conduct weddings
out of doors, which members of other faiths are not allowed to do under
our marriage law unless they are Jews or
Quakers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000309" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0003.htm#13052156000309">I
find it truly bizarre that if there is concern about challenges with
regard to the proposals before us, there is not fundamental concern
about challenges to legislation under which the rules governing Jews
and Quakers differ from those governing any other group. We have plenty
of legislation that singles out the Church of England and the Church of
Wales, because they are, or were, connected to the state. I would be
grateful if the Minister, or anyone else, could tell me how many times
the fact that Jews and Quakers are listed, but not Hindus, Sikhs or any
other group, has been subject to a legal challenge. In fact, that

that the law could be constructive. The Government do not have to agree
with humanist weddings, and they do not have to agree that this is the
best way to legislate, but if they are acting in good faith in relation
to the concerns that are being raised, I hope that they will say not

My main point, however, is that the Hardwicke Act of 1753 tried to
rectify the situation that people did not need a Church of England
vicar, a minister of religion or a building in order to get married,
and that all they needed to do was plight their troth. That is why the
situation was tidied up. Unfortunately, a near-monopoly was then given

making such a fundamental change. For example, a move away from a

organisation that successfully applied could hold marriages wherever it

hon. Member for Luton North (Kelvin Hopkins) made several important
points about Scots law, the Council of Europe and whether there would

marriage in England and Wales that
couples —all couples, we hope, as a result of the

says and think that is what the Bill delivers. It delivers the ability
of civil marriage to accommodate same-sex couples and enables religious

not to if that is what they choose. That is an important and

this afternoon by the Attorney-General have come to us rather late in
the day. That does not mean that we do not take them extremely
seriously; of course we do, but it would have been helpful to know that
discussions were taking place with officials, whether or not they were
proactively suggesting that such changes to the original proposal would
help to strengthen it. The fact that discussions took place some weeks

Secretary of State said that my amendment and, I think, others in the

Yes, they can choose to have a civil marriage and a humanist ceremony,
but they do not have available to them a ceremony that they feel would
properly recognise them as marrying one another and making that public
commitment in front of family and friends. That is the discrimination
that we seek to address.

want to pick up on one or two of the objections that were raised not
only by Ministers but by other hon. Members around the Chamber,
suggesting that there are still genuine uncertainties about what is and
is not provided for in current law and what we now seek to achieve. If
the Secretary of State is willing to come forward with a statement of
the Government’s legal concerns, that would be extremely helpful
in properly facing off all the objections that have been raised in time
for them to be understood and considered before the Bill is debated in
the House of Lords. We do not want a re-run of objections arriving late
or being raised without justification. It is clear from what has been
said today that many hon. Members would like the Government’s

for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry) and the Secretary of State, have said
repeatedly that these proposals in some way undermine the quadruple
lock that has been put in place. The Secretary of State suggested that
that is because it is not clear whether the protections that it affords
would apply to humanists, and if so, that might undermine the
protections for religious organisations. If so, it would be extremely
helpful to understand exactly how that is. We would be grateful if the

misunderstanding has come up repeatedly this afternoon. We recognise
that the system in England is different from the system in Scotland,
which registers 
<?notus-xml column=1122?>celebrants. The system in England is not based only on the registration
of premises for Jews and Quakers, for example. There is no requirement
for them to hold their ceremonies in certain premises, but they are
required to hold ceremonies in accordance with their usages. What is
more, the amendment would not attach registration to celebrants. It is
about registering organisations, and one form of organisation in
particular—that which is a belief organisation, a charitable
organisation or a humanist organisation that secures the approval and
authorisation of the Registrar General. It is very clear which kind of
institution we are trying to
cover.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000371" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0003.htm#13052156000371"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:23:26"></hs_TimeCode>The
most serious objection is the human rights objection, which, sadly,
only emerged at the beginning of this afternoon. I would be grateful if
any hon. Member who participated during the earlier stages of the Bill
and who remembers differently could correct me, but I do not recall the
human rights objection being raised at any point before this afternoon.
Of course it is vital that we take account of the
Attorney-General’s concerns and advice on this matter; it would
be utterly irresponsible of us not to do so. However, even the
Attorney-General’s advice changed over the course of this
afternoon. At the beginning of the afternoon, he said that there was a
problem with the proposal because it could apply so widely that any
organisation, including a society for the promotion of tiddlywinks,
might potentially be discriminated against if it were not authorised to
carry out marriages as well. I think that he rowed back from that later
on and acknowledged that only belief organisations would be authorised.
He was right to say that the possibility of discrimination between
different belief organisations is the central human rights issue that
must be
addressed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:24:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000372" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0003.htm#13052156000372"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Attorney-General" PimsId="3566" UID="13052156000757" xid="239" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0003.htm#13052156000757">The

Huppert:</Member></B> We now move on to a rather different subject, but
it is still an important one that affects a number of people greatly. A
range of issues apply specifically to people who change their gender,
who transition between genders or who are transgender. There may not be
a huge number of people in that category and they may be a small
minority, but they have been subject to some of the worst

right hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon

people. I assume that it is clear that the Government’s
intention is that marriage will be equal and will not exclude those who

Under the current law, for somebody to transition, they have to end the
marriage. We, the state, say to people who still love each other,
“You must get a divorce and break your marriage.” They
were allowed a civil partnership when those were introduced, but they

Amendment 15 simply argues that when such couples convert back from a

of the amendments is quite perfect. One person in a same-sex couple in

to somebody and wish to transition and change my gender, they get to
veto whether that is fully legally recognised. Why should that

which case it is possibly heading towards divorce, but that may not be
so. The couple might not wish to go through that, yet one person is

many cases, of course, there is no problem, and there are technical
ways in which the issue has been resolved. It is already possible for
people to transition and the state manages to cope—income tax,
HMRC and other systems manage to cope and each have detailed
arrangements. I do not think that would pose a problem for somebody
transitioning to avoid their previous criminal record, but it would

shall provide the House with the case example that led the hon.
Gentleman to table the amendments. His constituents have been married
for 35 years as man and wife. The Gender Recognition Act 2004 forced
them to annul their marriage, which they did in 2007, so that the
male-to-female transsexual in the relationship could obtain a gender
recognition certificate in her acquired gender and get on with her
life. The legislation did not allow the couple to continue to be
married even though they wanted that. Both were extremely clear that
they wished to stay together and did not want a divorce. They had cared
for, supported and loved each other as a married couple for more than
30 years, and wanted the care and support they mutually offered each
other to continue in the years ahead. They wanted to keep their family
together for their own sake and for the sakes of their
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000418" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0003.htm#13052156000418">Since
being forced to annul their marriage, the couple have lived together as
two women in a civil partnership. They entered into a civil partnership
on the very same day their marriage ended and still live together, but
they should never have been made to annul their marriage, even if an
alternative legal mechanism was available in the form of a civil
partnership. They have lived together continuously for 44 years and it
is their marriage anniversary that they still celebrate. For many
couples, annulment was deeply distressing and not something of mere
technical and legal significance.</hs_Para>

I think we would all recognise, reasons for marrying and making a
public commitment are intensely personal and varied. For some, marriage
is not just about legal practicalities, and the blunt replacement of
one legal mechanism with another is not the end of the matter. Other
hon. Members will have similar cases. The number of people involved is
not large—a point I will come on to in a moment—but the
injustice done to them is real. We ought to take this opportunity to go
some way to righting the wrong done.</hs_Para>

can the Government do to make amends? Amendment 18 proposes to require
the Government to make a one-off compensation payment from public funds
to couples whose marriages were annulled, to permit a person to obtain
a gender recognition certificate and enter into or continue to maintain
a civil partnership; or to those who have continued to live together as
a couple in the same household since the annulment of their marriage,
but who did not choose to go down the route of a civil partnership. It
is a simple principle: married couples forced by the state to have an
annulment that they did not want should be compensated by the
Government by way of an apology for the distress and 
<?notus-xml column=1130?>cost incurred as a result of the annulment of their marriage. The
amendment proposes a nominal sum of £1,000. The public
expenditure implications would be negligible—we know the numbers
are small, as I will go on to explain in a moment. The £1,000
compensation payment would be far less than the cost for couples who
have had to pay for a divorce and a civil partnership
ceremony.</hs_Para>

have been quite conflicted over this entire subject. I am a godfather
to a lovely little boy who has been adopted. His parents are in a
partnership and they are both gay. I see myself very much as a
progressive Conservative, and I certainly recognise that
society’s attitudes have advanced, which is reflected in the
fact that we are debating the amendments in such detail today. Of
course we do not send children up chimneys any more, or allow only
privileged landowners to vote, and we got rid of slavery long
ago.</hs_Para>

that we are debating the final set of amendments to the

the details that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:00:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) mentioned. Where are the
demands to drive those changes? There is certainly a trajectory in
society that suggests that the amendments should be debated as part of
the wider Bill. Like other MPs, I have had a full postbag and inbox,
and I am grateful for the correspondence on these issues. Some of the

gay man in a civil partnership, I had no idea that my pension rights
could be curtailed until someone wrote to me about it. The reason my

that most gay people in a civil partnership have no idea that they are

Parliament have chosen to call Bournemouth “God’s waiting
room”—as well as a vibrant town centre with a huge gay
population. It is also a university town. So it has an elderly
population and a young generation, as well as a large gay community. I
have talked to members of the gay community about the Bill. I have also
made an effort to speak to religious groups, individuals and
organisations across the town, not only about pensions but about
matters such as gender recognition. We debated those matters in schools
as well. I have to say that I heard no significant call for these
proposals generally, and certainly not for the provision in amendment
15, tabled by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:02:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

the Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Mike Freer) has just pointed
out, certain aspects in life need to be corrected, and this debate has
been helpful in that regard. In general terms, however, most of the
people I spoke to said, “Go away and focus on the
economy.” They suggested that this was an important issue, but
wondered why we were dealing with it right now.</hs_Para>

Bill was not mentioned in any Queen’s Speech, and I believe that
the Government could have helped themselves by following the normal

particular legislative period. Given that backdrop, I take my hat off
to the Secretary of State and her Ministers for their stamina in
pursuing the amendments they have tabled. They must have known from the
start how controversial the amendments and the Bill as a whole would
be. I am grateful for the Secretary of State’s assurances,

Brine</B> (Winchester) (Con):</Member> I am listening carefully to my

controversial—it has divided the parties

tabled by the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:04:18"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), is not
controversial and should attract widespread support across the House

from the Civil Partnerships Act

Ellwood:</Member></B> I understand what my hon. Friend says, but I step
back and wonder whether all these amendments are required right now and
whether this is where society wants to go right now. Many Members have
been forced to make a decision, and there is naturally a tendency to
want to support the Bill and not to view it as out of place. My
question is why these issues are being brought to our attention at this
moment in time. As I say, I did not see the deluge of calls for this
measure, although the trajectory of society moving forward means that
this is very much how we would anticipate the Bill and its
amendments.</hs_Para>

am pleased that we have this opportunity to conduct this debate, which
has prompted us to think about the wider issues of the role, purpose
and values of marriage in our society. We are debating amendments
relating to gender recognition and so forth, which has educated us
about the historic role of the state in respect of the
Church.</hs_Para>

Bible is full of commands that are unknown or ignored by many
Christians today. That reflects how society is very much moving
forward. Wives used to be subject to their husbands; children arguing
with their parents used to be taken out and stoned to death; women used
to have to cover their heads in church. Those things are either unknown
by Christians today or simply ignored because they have no place in
modern society. The Church has changed its views over the
years—indeed, the Bill has changed as we have debated it over
these last few
months<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000455" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0003.htm#13052156000455">The
Church remains divided on many subjects: the burning of witches,
abortion, contraception, the status of illegitimate children and so
forth. On a wider perspective, it is the role of Parliament to
challenge the Church on these issues and through the Bill and
amendments, as we did on the grander issues in the past. Slavery was
indeed defended by many bishops because of the Bible; the Old Testament
regulated for slavery; divorce was clearly condemned by Jesus in the
Gospels, and those who had divorced were not permitted to remarry. In
the Church of England, marriage was “Till death us do
part”; it was long thought to be lifelong and indissoluble, yet
divorce was formally introduced in this place in 1857.</hs_Para>

then, are my thoughts on this Bill? I am absolutely supportive of the
concept, but, like many of the Government amendments, it is ahead of
its time. That puts many of us in an awkward position. Do we support
the Government amendments and the Bill, which I believe to be somewhat
messy and not well handled, albeit on a subject to which I do not
object. Should I vote against the Bill and the amendments for which
many of my constituents have called? A significant number of them were
moved enough to call me to make sure that I did not support specific
amendments or indeed the Bill as a whole. Then there is the final
option, which is to abstain on the amendments and the Bill, thus
honouring many of the calls not to support the Bill’s proposals
while ensuring that my vote is honest to
myself<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:07:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

conclude because I know others wish to participate in this important
Report debate. I hope I shall not digress too far from the subject
matter by mentioning that the FTSE 100 yesterday recorded its highest
value in 24 years; despite being a significant economic indicator, it
got no mention in this place. I hope that after Third Reading later
today, we can back to considering the economy. The subject of gay
marriage is significant and should be brought into law, but I remain to
be convinced that it should be a priority for now. Those who will
benefit from the change in the law are calling for the change
now.</hs_Para>

Shannon</B>:</Member> I am pleased to have the opportunity  to
speak to amendments 27 and 28. It will not be a surprise to you, Mr
Deputy Speaker, to hear that I am deeply unhappy about the Bill. I have
said that in Public Bill Committee and in this Chamber in the earlier

want to thank the Government for at least listening to me and my party
on one issue. The Bill proposes that same-sex marriages formed in
England and Wales should be recognised as civil partnerships in
Scotland and Northern Ireland. That is consistent with the way in which
overseas same-sex marriages are currently recognised in the
House.</hs_Para>

member of the Committee that scrutinised the Bill. When I say
“scrutinised”, I mean that the hon. Members for Enfield,
Southgate (Mr Burrowes) and for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim
Loughton) scrutinised it very thoroughly. Most of the
Committee’s members, however, sat in silence throughout the five
days of our debates on the clauses, and most of them tabled precious
few amendments. They seemed to see themselves as cheerleaders for the
Bill, rather than the scrutinisers that they should have been. Never
before, during my short time in the House of Commons, have I known
members of the official Opposition to abdicate their responsibility to
hold the Government to account quite so thoroughly.</hs_Para>

did table amendments, and took the time and the trouble to speak. I
pointed out to the Committee that Scottish Ministers were to be asked
to give their consent to legal changes allowing recognition of English
same-sex marriages, whereas Northern Ireland Ministers were merely to
be consulted. Amendments 27 and 28 give us an opportunity to align the
law with that in Scotland, which is good
news.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000463" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0003.htm#13052156000463">As

Shannon:</Member></B> Amendments 27 and 28 provide for
“consent”, Mr Deputy Speaker, and remove the reference to
consultation. Why is that important? It is important to the people whom
I represent in Northern Ireland because it introduces accountability to
the process. Some 1,700 of my constituents have contacted me about the 
<?notus-xml column=1137?>issue: members of the Church of Ireland, Presbyterians, Methodists,
members of the Elim Pentacostal Church, Baptist Brethren, evangelical
groups, Roman Catholics, Sikhs and Muslims. Members of faith groups
throughout Northern Ireland have asked us, as Members of Parliament, to
push for consent rather than consultation, and we have done
so.</hs_Para>

that when we convey opinions about the importance of faith and
religious persuasions, as we have in the House today and as we did in

by reassuring my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:14:57"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood) that building
a stable and cohesive society is one of the most fundamental roles of
Government, so to be doing that today through debating this Bill is a
highly appropriate use of parliamentary time. To those who ask whether
we should be doing something else, I say that I can, perhaps unusually
for a man, multi-task, so I think I can manage both to speak in this

specifically to the amendment, it is important to distinguish between
contracted-in and contracted-out pensions. This is quite a technical
change and it does not apply to contracted-out pensions; it applies
only to contracted-in pensions. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:15:45"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion said, two-thirds of pension schemes already
allow spousal survivors in civil partnerships equivalent widow or
widower benefits without having to be forced to do so by the law, but
one-third of them are discriminating. What is worse, that is an
optional discrimination; they are choosing to discriminate against
surviving civil partners in contracted-in pension
schemes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:16:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000477" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0003.htm#13052156000477">Let
me try to explain why that is so fundamentally wrong. The hon. Lady
gave the example of John Walker. Had he married a woman, she would have
got a pension on his death of £41,000, but his civil partner got
a pension of just £500 per annum. That diversity is the wrong
kind of diversity; that is pure discrimination. Let us assume two men
or two women join a pension scheme on the same day, and they both have
the same level of service, and they both enter into some form of
partnership, but one gets married and the other goes into a civil
partnership, and let us also assume that the day after they get married
or enter their civil partnership, they are both, by some quirk of fate,
killed in a car accident. The pension of the widow in marriage will be
go back to the date her former husband joined the pension scheme, let
us say some 20 years previously, but the civil partner only gets to go
as far back as when civil partnerships came into law. That cannot be
right by any stretch of the imagination.</hs_Para>

researching why the Government were resisting this amendment, I was
told that one of the issues is the cost factor. Everything we as a
Government do has a cost, so I thought there must be some huge
cost—perhaps £4 billion, which was a ready price-tag
yesterday. In fact, the cost of giving equal pension rights on
contracted-in pensions to civil partners is £18
million—not £80 million or £80 billion, but
£18 million. It is true that that is a lot of money, and I
certainly would not mind having £18 million in my
bank account, but let me put that into perspective. The assets under
management of the pension industry amount to £360 billion, so
the cost of removing this anomaly is 0.006% of assets under management.
I do not think that is a price we cannot
afford<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:18:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000479" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0003.htm#13052156000479">I
was also told that it is wrong to force pension providers to make
retrospective calculations on which they did not base their pension
actuarial decisions. That, too, is a flawed argument. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:19:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion said, the actuaries behind a pension scheme make
a whole variety of assumptions about longevity, how many of their
pensioners will die in service and how many of them will die as a
pensioner, and how long they will stay in the pension, and the accrual
rate will be based on an assumption that most of their members will get
married. It is complete nonsense 
<?notus-xml column=1139?>to suggest that pension providers cannot allow civil partners who
survive to get the same benefit as a widow or widower because
it has not been accrued, as there is absolutely no
evidence that the actuaries have not been able to make that
calculation. If they made the calculation that X% of their pensioners
would get married, they could simply make assumptions about a man in a
civil partnership. They will have had no knowledge of whether that man
or woman would have decided to get married or to enter a civil
partnership and there is no logical or financial reason why the anomaly
cannot be removed.</hs_Para>

the amendments. They will create no new liability for pension funds and
will remove for some couples the hideous decision about whether a

the process, remove the pension rights of a much-loved spouse. I know

the whole package of amendments on transgender issues proposed by the

deeply wrong injustices suffered by transgender couples. I invite

amendment 49, on pensions, I too recognise the anomaly that exists
between the treatment of pension rights for married couples and
same-sex civil partners. I also recognise that resolving this anomaly
is not without difficulty. We have always accepted the estimate of
£18 million potential additional cost to private
contracted-in occupational pension schemes, and I agree with hon.
Members who have already said that in the scheme of overall funds under
management for pension companies, that seems a very small amount
indeed, although I also accept the concern that extending pension
rights to civil partners could have a disproportionate impact in a very
small number of cases, particularly in small and often charity employer
schemes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:25:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000488" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0003.htm#13052156000488">In
relation to other schemes and the possible wider effect, for example on
contracted-out occupational pensions, where Ministers have suggested a
potential impact of £90 million, or in relation to public sector
schemes, I must say that I am still puzzled as to why we think there is
any further implication. In February I obtained a note from the House
of Commons Library which pointed out that civil partners are already
entitled to survivor benefits in contracted-out and public sector
schemes in relation to benefits going back to 1988. That is a result of
the Civil Partnership (Contracted-out and Appropriate Personal Pension
Schemes) (Surviving Civil Partners) Order 2005. The Library said that
the same was true of public sector schemes, as I say. So I am not clear
how the exemption would affect those contracted-out and public sector
schemes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:27:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052156000489" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0003.htm#13052156000489">Although
I have great sympathy for the amendment, the Government should come
forward with a full analysis in order for Parliament to take an
informed decision on what the cost implications would be. That is why I
tabled new clause 17, which was not selected for debate. I understand
the reasons for that, but it would have asked for the full report of
the pensions costs implications for all forms of occupational pension
and the impact on pension funds and pensioner poverty to be presented
to Parliament. Although the new clause has not been selected for
debate, I join

amendments 40 to 47 deal with pension entitlements. They amend part 6
of schedule 4, which provides for same-sex married couples to be
treated in the same manner and to be entitled to the same survivor
benefits as civil partners. As drafted, that includes couples in
same-sex marriages who have preserved their marriage following the
change of legal gender of one of the spouses, and it is designed to
ensure that all same-sex couples are treated alike for this purpose.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:40:15"></hs_TimeCode> recognise
that our policy of treating same-sex marriages in the same way as civil
partnerships for occupational pension survivor benefits may create a
problem in relation to survivor benefits for a very small group of
individuals whose spouses change gender during their marriage. We
understand that this could deter a transsexual person from seeking to
change their legal gender because of the financial impact on their
husband or wife. If the amendments are made, widows of marriages that
become same-sex as a result of the husband’s change of legal
gender during the marriage will still be treated as widows for the
purpose of calculating survivor benefits in a contracted-out
occupational pension scheme; and for schemes that are not contracted
out, in calculating any entitlement to survivor benefits, the marriage

the corresponding provision in the Civil Partnership Act 2004 provide
important protection for the non-trans spouse. If a non-trans person

me be clear that non-trans spouses will not be able to veto their
spouses obtaining gender recognition. I also understand that the
amendments are intended to deal with the problem of hostile or
obstructive non-trans spouses who deliberately seek to delay nullity
proceedings. I have not seen any evidence that that is a widespread
problem. If the grounds for the marriage being voidable are met, the
hostility or absence of the non-trans spouse should not delay a court

issues that matter intensely to a range of people. I am grateful for
the tone in which the debate has been conducted by almost everybody; it
has been productive. I know that people from the trans community and
other minority sexual communities who have been watching are impressed
that Parliament is able to discuss these

hon. Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood), who is no longer in his

I would quote comments sent to me by some of my transgender colleagues,
but I suspect the language would be rather unparliamentary. There is
certainly pent-up anger among people about their stolen
marriages.</hs_Para>

I am sure the Minister is aware, I disagree on some of the detail about
these amendments and I maintain that there are some concerns. I was
worried by some of the language about not fully consenting to a
marriage, although I am sure the Minister did not mean to imply 
<?notus-xml column=1147?>that people need to be protected from transgender spouses or transgender
people—I am sure that is not what was
intended. I was grateful to hear her say that the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:55:05"></hs_TimeCode> will
continue to listen carefully on such issues. I hope there will be
further discussion in another place and that the Government will
reflect on what more they are able to do.</hs_Para>

has been some progress and I acknowledge some of the Government
amendments. On stolen marriages, amendment 15 was always an ideal, and
I am well aware of the Government’s objection to backdating. It
would be wonderful if it were possible to do so, and I am sure the
Attorney-General is a good enough lawyer to find a way to do that. The
Minister highlighted the fact that couples will be able to backdate
their new marriage to the date on which their civil partnership was
formed, so there is some form of backdating, which is welcome. In many
cases, there will be a one-day gap between two otherwise identical
marriages, which is slightly odd, but I am grateful for that progress.
Amendment 15 was always somewhat optimistic, but I hope we can make
progress on some of the other issues.</hs_Para>

49, tabled by

that the current position gives rise to some truly odd anomalies. We
are introducing—quite correctly—protection for someone
who is transgender and transitions, so that they do not lose out on
pensions by virtue of that, but we are leaving in place a slightly
bizarre anomaly, mentioned by

for Finchley and Golders Green (Mike Freer), regarding people who have
a same-sex relationship, because we are not backdating that to before

case that a bisexual man or woman would pay at the same rate and would
get a different pension transferred depending who they happen to end up

communities throughout the country, so has the Bill. Over the past few

Miller:</Member></B> I understand my hon. Friend’s point. I am
not sure whether he puts me into the older generation —I
hope not. There are differences in views across the generations, and
differences in views in different parts of the country and different
communities. We must accept that people have different views for
whatever reason. The most important thing is that we maintain respect
for people’s different views. Such an open approach, which we
have taken throughout proceedings on the Bill, has meant that the
Government have been able to take action to improve the Bill, and to
reassure hon. Members on some of the issues they have raised.</hs_Para>

have throughout remained committed to the principle that people should
not be excluded from marriage simply because of who they love. The
institution of marriage underpins our society. Over the years, as
society has evolved, so has marriage. As such, it has remained our
bedrock. The values of love, commitment and stability underpin
marriage—they are the values on which our society is built.
Despite our differences in opinion, no hon. Member would dispute that
those are the values we should promote. If the values of marriage are
the values on which we want to build our society, they must be
available to all, and they must underpin an institution that is
available to all couples. Our country is renowned the world over for
its tolerance. We have a rich tapestry of faith, belief and culture.
That is unique—it is part of what makes us British. Those strong
traditions will enable same-sex couples to
marry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052168000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052168000085">In
no way will the measure undermine those who believe—for whatever
reason, whether religious or philosophical—that marriage should
be between a man and woman. They can continue to believe that. That is
their right. No religious organisation or individual minister will be
forced to conduct same-sex marriages if they choose not to do so, and
nor will religious organisations or individual ministers be forced to
have same-sex marriages conducted on their premises. The quadruple lock
that the Government have designed provides robust and effective
protections. The Government are also clear that the Bill does not
prevent people, whether at work or outside, from expressing their
belief that marriage should be between a man and a woman. That is their
right. Teachers will still be able to express their personal beliefs
about marriage as long as they do so sensitively and appropriately.
Employers will be unable to dismiss or discipline a person simply
because they say they do not believe in same-sex
marriage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052168000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052168000086">I

hon. Friend is right that this is complex. That is why I have been at 
<?notus-xml column=1154?>pains, particularly yesterday and today, to ensure that we do not
introduce new concepts into the Bill. We want to keep clarity and
focus, and ensure that we do the job. I believe that in the years ahead
we will look back on the passage of the Bill, as we now look back on
the introduction of civil partnerships: we will be in no doubt that
equal marriage is right and we will be proud that we made it

is important that we debated in detail some difficult and challenging
issues. Yesterday, we talked about civil partnership. Equal marriage
will correct something that is fundamentally unfair, and remove a
barrier that prevents a whole group of people from access to an
institution that underpins society. Civil partnerships were created to
give same-sex couples equivalent legal rights to marriage at a time
when society was not ready to give them access to marriage. Although I
am clear that taking a decision on the future of civil partnerships now
would not be a responsible thing to do, I have listened to
Members’ clear concerns, particularly in the comments expressed
yesterday. As such, we have agreed to undertake an immediate review of
civil partnerships. That will be an important way to ensure clarity on
how that aspect of legal recognition of relationships is taken
forward.</hs_Para>

Attorney-General, be a fundamental change to the current structure of
marriage. As has happened in Scotland, it would also open to the door
to a range of other belief organisations being able to conduct
marriages. Such decisions are a matter for Scotland—this is a
devolved matter—but if we are to discuss these matters it is
only right that Members are aware that the amendments tabled could not
preclude opening up the ability to conduct marriages to belief
organisations other than humanists.

might recall that I argued on Second Reading that marriage was about
the joy and the sorrow, about the excitement and the tragedy, and about
the romance of the wedding day as well as the deeper romance of growing
old and grey together, even once the party has faded. I gave the
example of an elderly couple, one of whom was caring for the other who
had dementia. I described the love, commitment and duty that that
showed, and said how powerful that was, whether it was between a man

Herbert</B> (Arundel and South Downs) (Con):</Member> Earlier today,
while the Health Secretary was responding to an urgent question on
accident and emergency departments, I had to take myself along to the A
and E department at St Thomas’s hospital because something was
wrong with my eyes. I am told that everything is fine, but I had some
drops put into my eyes and, as a result, I am now unable to see the
official Opposition. The only thing I can see, and have sought to
remark on, is the loud and proud and typically revolting tie of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:23:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Rhondda (Chris Bryant). However,  I notice that you are
wearing the same tie, Mr Speaker. I therefore unreservedly withdraw my
remark.</hs_Para>

most serious concern that has been advanced about the Bill relates to
ensuring that religious freedom is protected. The concerns expressed by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:23:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr Burrowes) are surely genuine, and
we were right to pay attention to them. I would not support any measure
in this House that would force a Church to conduct a same-sex marriage
against its will. That principle of religious liberty is immensely
important. The fact that the Bill protects Church organisations and
that the Church of England has expressed its confidence in the locks
that have been put into the Bill should give the House confidence that
we can proceed with this measure.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:24:17"></hs_TimeCode>Of course there
are other aspects of religious freedom that we need to protect. They
were discussed yesterday and will be the subject of further discussion
in the House of
Lords<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:20:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052186000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052186000011">The
essence is that no church will be forced to conduct a same-sex marriage
against its will. Religious freedom cuts both ways, and those who have
rightly spoken on behalf of religious freedom cannot ignore the cause
of religious freedom for Churches that do wish to conduct same-sex
marriages. What about the Quakers, the Unitarians or the liberal Jews;
what about their religious freedom? My argument is that the Bill
extends religious freedom and does not restrict it and that those who
are concerned about religious freedom should support it. Those
advancing these arguments need to say why they have not been interested
in Churches such as the Quakers and why they believe that the law of
the land should prevent those Churches from doing what they seek to
do.</hs_Para>

arguments have been put against this legislation—that it
redefines marriage for everyone, so that even if Churches are
protected, the concern remains that it changes the definition of
marriage for others, too. As has been said on a number of occasions
here, how exactly does it harm or affect those who enter into a
heterosexual marriage if a same-sex couple enter into  a
marriage, too? How does it devalue, change or alter the marriage they
have? The truth is that this is not a measure that can remotely be held
to do any harm to 
<?notus-xml column=1159?>people at all. Absolutely no harm is done by this measure and a very
great deal of good can be done  by it.</hs_Para>

impressive arguments have been advanced in respect of this legislation.
It has been said that because same-sex marriages cannot be consummated,
there is some problem or lack of equivalence, or that because adultery
provisions will not apply directly, there is a lack of equivalence.
Actually, most heterosexual marriages are, sadly, ended by the cause of
unreasonable behaviour, which could apply just as easily to same-sex
couples. I think there was an unfortunate implication behind that
criticism, which was that somehow same-sex couples were seeking a
licence to enter a marriage in respect of which they sought to escape
or avoid the vows undertaken. Of course, the absolute opposite is the
case. It is right to extend same-sex marriage to gay couples precisely
because it is a good thing if they enter into a loving and permanent
commitment to each other. That is a good thing for them, for society
and for families, and we should celebrate and support
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:27:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

was about to say that it has been suggested that the public are not
with this legislation. Of course an element of the public are concerned
about it. That much is clear, but it is also clear from all the
independently conducted opinion polls—not those conducted by the
pressure groups opposed to the Bill—that a majority of the
public support this legislation and that the majority is increasing, as
we have seen throughout the world. As for the idea of holding a
referendum on such measures at any time, apart from being a bad idea in
itself because the House of Commons decides these matters, such a
referendum would be likely to pass this measure in any case because the
public are in favour of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:28:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052186000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052186000017">When

believe that marriage is foundational, that it is for one man and one
woman, and that it ought not to be redefined. I believe that marriage
is universal and not just for Christians, although I am a Christian and
my stance on this issue, like that of my right hon. and hon. Friends,
is influenced by our Christian faith. I believe that marriage is for
everyone, man and woman, who wants to take up that right in law. I
believe that the definition of marriage as a relationship between one
man and one woman should stand. I believe that marriage is beneficial,
and that it is for the mutual help and support of husband and wife and
for the procreation of
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052186000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052186000020">Our
opposition to the redefinition of marriage is not born of prejudice. It
is not born of homophobia. It is born of a deep sense of our Christian
faith, and I hope that that can be respected. Our Christian faith is
important to us. It is what motivates us to take the stances that we
take on many issues. It is shared by many people in our native Northern
Ireland, where a high proportion of the population still go to church
and more than half our children attend faith schools.</hs_Para>

Ireland Assembly recently voted not to introduce same-sex marriage in

Minister has given to seek the consent of the Department for Finance

Ireland, before implementing any amendments that would have an impact
there. Notwithstanding that, however, we remain opposed to the
legislation in principle. I was a member of the Standing Committee that
dealt with the Bill that became the Civil Partnership Act 2004. I
remember pointing out at that time that civil partnerships would
inevitably lead to a demand for same-sex marriage and being told by the
then Government that that was nonsense, that we were scaremongering and
that it would not
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052186000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052186000022">The

be between a man and more than one woman. Will we not, in time, hear
another demand for equality—the demand that a man who wants to
be married to more than one woman should have that right enshrined in
law? If marriage is to change in the future, will not the House, in

equality for those who want to be married to more than one
partner?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052186000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052186000023">We

other members of his party did, but the case was made by some that the
introduction of civil partnerships would lead to the decline of society

inclusivity, when what it has done has caused division, not just in the
Conservative party—that is not the most relevant
point—but in the country. The settled, respected position on
supporting civil partnerships and the previously united concept of
marriage between Church and state have now had a wedge driven between
them by the Bill. Indeed, we had late resolutions to try to deal with
the inequalities that are still apparent. What unites the opposition to
the Bill is an unshakeable belief that will not accept the
state’s redefinition of marriage and will recognise only the
distinctive value of marriage as the bringing together of one man and
one woman.</hs_Para>

today on Third Reading is a time for celebration. For many hundreds of
constituents from Brighton, Pavilion who have written to me in support

their futures together. I have heard many stories about why this
legislation is important, including from one constituent who simply
said, “Everyone should have the right to marry the person they
are in love with.” Another told me that she hopes Brighton and
Hove will be the first city to perform a gay marriage. To her I say,

same-sex marriage. I know it is difficult for some to square the Bill

for gay couples to continue to pay the price for that by being denied
equality. Equality and justice must underpin everything else—a
principle and a priority, not just something tacked on to existing

partly because I think that the Bill is wrong; marriage is between a
man and a woman. My real motive for voting against Third Reading,
however, is the lack of parliamentary scrutiny of the Bill. We are yet
again dealing with an amazing piece of important legislation that owing
to the programme motion is going through without proper scrutiny in the
House. Yesterday, whole parts of the Bill could not be amended because
consideration of the amendments were not reached. I cannot even talk

have again to allow the other place to decide on the amendments to a

is one of our greatest foreign policy challenges, not least as it has
brought about a humanitarian crisis on a scale not seen in decades. The

my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has repeatedly made clear,
most recently in his statement to the House yesterday, our objective is
to achieve a political solution to the conflict in Syria and bring an
end to the terrible violence and human suffering. Sanctions are an
important tool in achieving that objective, but as with any tool, they
must be used intelligently to make maximum
impact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T19:19:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052186000641" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052186000641">Our
initial aim in imposing sanctions was to cut off the flow of funds and
arms to the Syrian regime, choking off its ability to continue to wage
war against 
<?notus-xml column=1176?>its people, and to increase pressure on individuals in the regime to end
the violence. Those sanctions have had a profound impact on the
regime’s financial flows and put it under increasing pressure,
but they have not proved decisive. The Syrian regime has continued to
receive material and financial support from its international backers
and been able to continue its brutality. I am proud of the leading role
that Britain has played in using sanctions to put pressure on the Assad
regime. We must now play a leading role in refining those sanctions to
ensure that they continue to support our overall goal of achieving a
political solution and ending the violence and
suffering.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052186000642" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052186000642">As
the conflict in Syria deteriorated, it became clear earlier this year
that elements of the existing sanctions package had become an obstacle
to our efforts to help the opposition National Coalition to deliver
life-saving support to civilians inside Syria, and an obstacle to our
efforts to increase the pressure on the regime to end the violence. The
Syrian regime has shown no remorse in targeting civilians, including
those involved in distributing essential assistance. That is why we
pushed to achieve an amendment to the EU arms embargo in February to
allow the opposition to receive much-needed technical advice and
assistance in addition to a greater range of non-lethal
equipment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052186000643" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052186000643">The

are faults on all sides, but all the evidence collected so far by the
UN indicates that a greater degree of atrocities have been committed by
the regime than by elements of those opposed to it. He is correct to
draw attention to the latter, as the Government do. Abuse of
human rights is incompatible with our values and we condemn it
everywhere. However, the opposition is divided into different elements.
We wish to support and are supporting those that we believe are
moderate, and those that have declared their adherence to democratic
principles, most recently in April. They are under pressure from the
more extreme elements, but we condemn atrocities 
<?notus-xml column=1177?>on either side. We are working with those who we believe have

to seek that political solution. That is why my right hon. Friend the
Foreign Secretary is on his way to Jordan today to take part in talks.
The UK has made no decision on the release of any arms or any lethal

to al-Qaeda, which is one of the reasons why the United Kingdom has no
contact with it. From what we know, there are a variety of different
groups opposed to the regime and there are loose links between many of
them. However, those in the National Council, with which we are working
most closely—it has evolved in the past two years—do not
want to be connected with those who have an allegiance elsewhere. They
have declared their principles and values, which is why we wish to work
with them. It is true that a variety of forces are now ranged against
the Assad regime, but in seeking to support some of them, the House
should recognise that there are those with good values who deserve to

who were resisting them were supplied with a great deal of weapons.

take military action in Afghanistan, many of those same weapons were

something that is not before the House. No decision has been made to

work has been to support the elements in the National Coalition who
adhere to the values they have declared, and to provide non-lethal
support and encourage them in looking after civilian areas. The dangers
are real, as he makes clear. However, the point is not that no weapons
are currently going in and that a change in the arms embargo would

Burt:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman raises two separate points.
First, I seek to make it clear that there is no support going to
al-Qaeda elements in Syria from the United Kingdom. All our support is
channelled through the National Coalition, which does not have a
contact to supply any matériel to forces aligned with al-Qaeda.
It is precisely to encourage and support moderate elements that the
United Kingdom has been working so hard, with others, in the past
couple of years to ensure that those elements have the means to protect
the population they are looking after.</hs_Para>

securing any chemical weapons that may be there is a live issue today
that concerns all the nations surrounding Syria. The responsibility for
securing chemical weapon stocks lies squarely with the regime. My point
is that these issues are already ongoing; there are already risks and
nothing we are seeking to do will add to those risks. The most
important thing is to continue the work on political transition, and to
take advantage of the opportunity that has been created in recent days
and of the efforts that my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary is
now engaged in. That is what needs to happen. Risks in relation to
weapons are already there no matter what happens to the lifting of the
arms embargo that we are
discussing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052186000656" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052186000656"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T19:29:16"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Robert Halfon" PimsId="5571" UID="13052186001260" xid="1075" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052186001260"><B>Robert

the Foreign Secretary said yesterday, and I have repeated today, that
we have plausible evidence of their use, but we have not yet got
definitive evidence of where they have been used or who might have used
them. That

is absolutely right. I hope that the House can be proud of the part
that the UK has already played, not only in making it clear that there
will be that accountability, but in providing the means to ensure that

collecting material, instructing people on what evidence to look for

that we are not discussing whether the UK is providing weaponry. That
point has been well made. The question of air cover has been discussed
before. As the House knows, the Syrian air defences are not weak, and
up till now no one has considered there to be a practical way of
dealing with them, but part of what I will say is about all options
being open. Lifting the arms embargo will increase the flexibility
available to those who might need to protect civilians, or supply those
who are protecting them, in the future. It offers that necessary
flexibility, but no such decision has been
taken.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052190000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052190000004"><Member ContinuationText="Jim Shannon" PimsId="650" UID="13052190000081" xid="1218" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052190000081"><B>Jim

that remains a matter of the utmost priority to us. As my right hon.
Friend the Foreign Secretary said yesterday, the situation is immensely
complex. There is a humanitarian disaster not only within Syria but
outside, with, it is reckoned, 1.5 million refugees scattered
throughout Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and surrounding areas, and we
are working to provide support both outside and inside the country.
Some 71% of the latest UN plea for support has been provided, but the
rest is urgently needed. We have fulfilled our pledges, but the hon.

those being hospitable to people in their homes is
dire.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052190000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0004.htm#13052190000006">The
hospitality being given in people’s homes is important—we
think of this going on in Lebanon, Jordan and other places. It creates

let me again make it clear that the efforts of the United Kingdom
Government—this should not be left unsaid—are directed to
supporting those who do not have the ideology and the declared aims of
al-Qaeda. It is very important that that distinction is made, because
those moderate forces are looking for recognition. They want to be able
to say that they can hold areas and provide support to civilian
populations, because they want to be able to provide a contrast with
those who might not have Syria’s long-term interests at heart.

Burt:</Member></B> If there were a realistic assumption on either side
that the balance of arms could change sufficiently to give one side an
advantage over the other so that there was a point to continuing the
slaughter, the hon. Gentleman’s point would be well made, but
the assessment that more and more people are making, on the ground and
outside, is that a military solution is not possible. As my right hon.
Friend the Foreign Secretary said yesterday, there are only two
scenarios here: one is long drawn-out killing and humanitarian
suffering on a massive scale, with no decisive result; the other is the
peace opportunity that is now before us. I entirely take the hon.
Gentleman’s point, but our argument is that, because of that
assessment that there can be no military victory, let us give the
moderates the sense of support and
protection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T19:44:29"></hs_TimeCode> they
might need to be flexible if conditions change. The important point is
to press both sides to negotiations and talks, because that must be

make no mistake: the regime is trying to change the balance of forces
on the ground even as we talk, and will do so even as negotiators meet
in Geneva. Lifting the embargo for the opposition will give us the
flexibility to protect civilians, save lives and respond to a major
escalation in the conflict, such as the use of chemical weapons. Even
if the embargo were to be lifted, we are clear that lethal supplies
would be considered only if they were a necessary, proportionate and
lawful response to extreme humanitarian suffering and there was no
practicable alternative. Any supplies would be carefully calibrated and
monitored, as well as legal; they would be aimed at saving lives,
alleviating the human catastrophe and supporting moderate groups. Our

urgent; that is why the Foreign Secretary has gone to Jordan; that is

timely, given that the EU-wide embargo is due for renewal at the
meeting of the Council of Ministers next week. As a result of the
Council’s agreement in February, the Foreign Secretary announced
to the House on 6 March that the British Government would increase
their support for the Syrian opposition and that that would include
equipment that had previously been banned under the EU embargo. The
change in both the scale and the type of material support from the
United Kingdom clearly marked a new stage in the Government’s

Government’s position from the Minister. Will he tell us
precisely what the Government will be calling for with respect to any
alteration in the embargo next week? It has been suggested that they
are considering two options. The first is to seek an exemption from the
embargo for the national coalition of Syrian and opposition forces, and
the second is to remove the “non-lethal” language to
allow lethal equipment. That would effectively render the embargo null

the Government have spoken of the need to tip the balance in favour of
the opposition. Can the Minister give us his assessment of the amount

taking into account the support that we believe that he continues to

that the weapons supplied do not fall into the hands of extremists
groups such as al-Nusra, which is aligned with al-Qaeda? Thirdly, given
that the Foreign Secretary said that he could only offer his
“best endeavours” to prevent British-supplied material
from going to groups in Syria for which it is not intended, will the
Minister tell us whether the Government would be willing to supply arms
without any end-use guarantees? I am sure that the whole House would be
cautious—several Members have demonstrated their concern
today—about any step towards arming Syria’s opposition
without a range of solid assessments and analyses from the Minister and
his colleagues in the Foreign Office in regard to the end users of any

Syrian crisis is entering its third year, and while we hope for a
political solution, a humanitarian tragedy continues to unfold before
our eyes. The situation for Syrians is desperate. Life for those caught
up in the spiralling violence is unbearable. As ordinary civilians fall
into ever deeper despair, the humanitarian need is growing more urgent
by the day. According to the United Nations’ estimates, the
death toll is now 80,000; 8 million people are in need of humanitarian
assistance; and more than 4.25 million people have been driven from
their homes by the fighting to other areas of Syria, with now well over
1.3 million refugees in neighbouring countries. The majority of these
refugees are women, children and the elderly, more than half of whom
are children below the age of 11, suffering first and foremost from
psychological trauma. These figures are alarming, but from my own
experience having visited two camps in Turkey, I can say that they do
not capture or convey the full extent of the

the conflict would get as a result. Anyone who doubts the leakage of
arms should think carefully about the way the USA raced to supply any
amount of arms to any opposition in Afghanistan in 1979, which gave
birth to the Taliban and, ultimately, al-Qaeda. We should 
<?notus-xml column=1192?>think very seriously before doing that. I hope that we do not end up

That is not to say, however, that there are not huge internal conflicts
within Syria or that the Assad regime has not committed enormous human
rights abuses, but the west has a very selective memory on this. There
was a time when western Governments were happy to co-operate with
President Assad on many issues. The Assad regime received very large
numbers of refugees from Iraq—mainly Palestinians driven out of
Iraq after the US invasion. One thinks of the plight of Palestinian
people who have been driven from country to country for the past 60
years. The anger in those refugee camps will be the start of the
conflicts and wars of tomorrow. There has to be a recognition of human

this war is becoming a proxy war for all kinds of interests. Let us
just think of the countries and organisations already involved, by
supplying arms, funding or what is euphemistically called non-lethal
assistance. The European Union is clearly very involved, as is the
United States, and Russia is clearly involved in supplying arms to the
Assad Government and protecting its own base there. The Gulf
Co-operation Council countries, particularly Saudi Arabia and Qatar,
are supplying vast amounts of money and arms to the area. Iran feels
under threat and thinks that it is next on the western
countries’ hit list, so it is presumably helping the Assad
regime in some form. Turkey is a neighbouring country that is both
receiving refugees and supplying some weaponry and assistance. Israel
has now got involved, with reports of the bombing that took place last
week. In today’s edition of <I>The Guardian</I> there is a
report of a land incursion near the Golan Heights that was beaten off
by certain forces, we know not which.</hs_Para>

is a time, surely, to reflect on the western strategy in dealing with
all the issues with which we have been confronted since 2001. In
Afghanistan, we have spent a lot of money and lost a lot of soldiers.
Lots of civilians have died, and the country remains poor, corrupt and
divided. Iraq is a place that can hardly be called at peace. In Libya,
we went in with the no-fly zone and spent an awful lot of money and
time bombing large numbers of people, and one could hardly say that
there is a western-style liberal democracy there at present.

criticism that relates not to our policy on Syria but to the scrutiny
of European documents in this place. The Council decision was taken on
28 February and referred to this Chamber by the European Scrutiny
Committee back in March. It is now nearly June; in fact, the
three-month arms embargo to which the decision referred has nearly
finished. This is not a criticism of the Minister, and certainly not of
the Chair. I am afraid that Government business managers must address

strongly welcome much of what the Minister said, particularly his
strong emphasis on the main focus of British policy being the
achievement of a peaceful political solution. That has to be right, and
it has to be our main objective in every decision we take. The Geneva

at one stage whether it would be legal for us to intervene in the
dispute in Syria, yet I have not heard anyone on the Government Benches
saying that we should intervene. We are, in the end, talking only about
the possible partial lifting or changing of an arms embargo in a
country in which there is no universal arms embargo. In fact, arms are
flowing into the country, funded, in the case of the regime, by Russia,
supported by Iran and by Hezbollah. The arms that are flowing to the
jihadi elements such as Jabhat al-Nusra and possibly al-Qaeda are, by
all accounts, funded from within the Gulf. Those arms are flowing in
completely legally because of the lack of a UN arms
embargo<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T20:23:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305223000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0005.htm#1305223000037">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T20:23:45"></hs_TimeCode>

fuelled any more—there is already an inferno. In effect, the EU
arms embargo is a little like a sticking plaster floating in a flood.
The country is already awash with arms. The most sophisticated arms are

one after another, the peoples of those continents and regions have

<?notus-xml column=1194?>that they are capable of fighting for freedom and democracy without

I have said, the most important thing is that we do everything we can

am not sure whether it is practical to have those two countries at the
Geneva peace conference because it might end up as more of a

political and diplomatic duty, but a moral obligation to ensure that
the peace process works. Provided that they have not been annihilated

the Member for North Dorset (Mr Walter). I have spent seven years
travelling to Syria and have had the opportunity to meet Bashar Assad
and other members of the regime several times. The tragedy that is
unfolding for the silent middle in Syria is terrible to behold. It is a

is the situation today? On one side is the Assad regime, which is
responsible, as we have heard, for more than 80,000 deaths, more than 1
million refugees and more than 4 million internally displaced people.
The regime has 300,000 soldiers plus the dreaded Shabiha, 16,000 pieces
of heavy artillery and an air force. It has 
<?notus-xml column=1195?>the Russians on its side, who are providing hardware such as S300s,
Yakhont surface-to-ship missiles and the most robust air defence system
in the middle east other than Israel’s, as well as military
advisers who are increasing in number day by day. It also has the
Iranians on its side, who are providing the Revolutionary Guard and
strategic advice, and it has Hezbollah on its side. It has electronic
intelligence, money and arms provided by the Iranians, and it even has
the Shabiha being formed into a national defence brigade by the
Iranians, who are giving

does the opposition side have? Simply, it has two groups that are
highly fragmented—the FSA, which has about 30,000 people, led by
General Idris, who essentially have just small arms at their disposal;
and on the other side, as many colleagues have said, the Salafis, who
have about 3,000 to 5,000 people and are themselves fragmented. We have
heard about Jabhat al-Nusra, but there is also Liwa al-Islam, Liwa
Saqour and Kata’ib Ahrar al-Sham, among other Islamist groups
that are fighting

we have an asymmetric war in which Bashar Assad has no incentive
whatever to negotiate seriously. What are our options? They are
fourfold. One is a containment strategy that would prevent the conflict
from spreading, but unfortunately it would merely lead to more death.
Another is a no-fly zone, as proposed by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T20:30:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

it would put the lives of our Air Force pilots at risk, and I do not

the Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron) will also make this
point when he gets his opportunity to speak—there is a risk that

final option is a radical diplomatic engagement strategy. In that
regard, we have two opportunities before us. One is the fact that the
UK holds the presidency of the UN Security Council next month, and the
other is that there are Iranian elections next month, which may provide
an opportunity for us to press the reset button regarding engagement
with Iran. As

because we have done nothing over the past two years—I am

my hon. Friend the Minister that Syria is a melting pot for a proxy war
that is being fought out

versus Shi’a Muslims; the west versus China or Russia; concerned
minorities within the country, such as Alawites and Christians, against
what could follow; or Iran versus Saudi Arabia. It is a crossing point
for conflict, and I urge the Minister and the coalition Government to
think carefully before they pour more arms into a conflict that could
not only escalate the violence within the civil war, but lead to an
escalation of an arms race beyond Syria’s borders which, at the
end of the day, could be a mistake of historic proportions.</hs_Para>

is very important. Our track record of arming groups or individuals is
not good, no matter what anybody says. We armed the mujaheddin, and
there is a fair chance that a good number of those weapons were used
against us. We armed Saddam Hussein and supported him in his war
against Iran—again, some of those weapons were probably pointed
at us. History is important because it teaches us that if we support,
arm and intervene in regimes, civil wars and conflicts, often what we
are trying to remove or put right becomes embedded even
further.</hs_Para>

at our efforts since the second world war to take on communist regimes
around the world—in Korea, China or Vietnam. Despite western
interventions, those regimes are essentially still in place. If our
goal is to create a sort of stability and liberal democracy of our
making, we have only to look at what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan,
where democracy is not flourishing, despite the high cost in lives and
treasure. It is flourishing in north Africa and other regions of the

narrow debate we are having tonight, but he must accept that we are
debating an EU Council decision made on 28 February which is up for
renewal—or certainly revisiting—on 1 June, and he cannot
deny that the Government have been flying kites on this issue. We are
therefore right to raise it on the Floor of the House tonight,

ask the Minister to consider one or two other points. We do not know
much about the rebel forces, but we do know that some are linked to
al-Qaeda and some have committed atrocities. Tracking and tracing
weaponry that we put into Syria because we would deal only with the
moderate elements is beyond the capability of any western Government,

action.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305223000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0005.htm#1305223000063">There
can be little doubt that the more weapons we put into a conflict, the
more the violence escalates. The idea that we can put weapons into a

Oxfam and a number of charities that have people on the ground have
come out publicly in the past week or two to say, “Do not do it.
Do not go down that road, because bad things will happen.” There

the Members for Croydon South (Richard Ottaway) and for Braintree (Mr

flexibility, assists the moderates against the extremists, assists the

almost impossible. Decisions after that will be of enormous complexity

want briefly to set out what seems to be the particularly worrying
pattern of behaviour that the proposal to demolish the Porcupine public
house in Mottingham in my constituency highlights. It is obviously of
great concern to residents of Mottingham, which, it is worth saying, is
not an amorphous part of London suburbia, but a genuine village with a
real sense of identity, and the Porcupine pub is a central part of that
village community. It is also worrying because the behaviour of the two
substantial companies involved has potential impacts beyond this
case.</hs_Para>

I can put that into some
context<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T20:51:16"></hs_TimeCode>. There
has been an inn on the site of the Porcupine public house since 1688.
It is not, I accept, locally or statutorily listed, but it is steeped
in history. There has always been a pub there in the middle of the
village, and it is virtually the one remaining bit of community space
left in the village, so it is of real significance to the people of the
Mottingham area.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T20:51:49"></hs_TimeCode>It has a long
local history. I am told that Tom Cribb, the 19th century world
bare-knuckle boxing champion, trained in the Porcupine inn and that it
has been called that since the days when a spiked machine was used to
crush oats and barley in alehouses, so it has a long heritage and, as I
say, is dearly loved by people in the Mottingham area.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T20:52:17"></hs_TimeCode>We have seen,
however, a shabby and underhand means of closing this public house
against the community’s wishes.</hs_Para>

am delighted to see my hon. Friend the Minister here to respond to the
debate and I want to thank him personally for the trouble that he took
to come down to Mottingham, visit the site and meet some of its
residents—more of that in a moment. First, however, I want to
thank some other people, because the campaign to save the Porcupine
public house has seen many people doing a lot of hard work. It is worth
mentioning Liz Keable and all the other committee officers of the
Mottingham residents association, who have worked very hard; Emily
Bailey, who started an online petition that has gathered more than
1,600 signatures; the local councillors, including my Conservative
colleagues Charles Rideout and Roger Charsley, who represent the
Mottingham ward of the London borough of Bromley, and Councillor John
Hills, who represents the adjoining ward in the neighbouring London
borough of Greenwich, just the other side of the road from the public
house; hundreds of residents who have written in and e-mailed to
support the campaign; and the 250-plus people who turned out when the
Minister came to visit last week.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T20:53:37"></hs_TimeCode>I also wish to
say special thank you to David Bingley, who started the campaign.
Sadly, his ongoing hospital treatment means 
<?notus-xml column=1203?>that he cannot be here to watch the debate from the Gallery, but I know
he will be watching from his hospital bed, and I am sure that you will

is the history of this public house and the strength of feeling
surrounding it. The Porcupine was knocked down once before, in 1922,
and on that occasion the brewery provided a temporary pub for people to
use while it was rebuilt, but I am afraid that a very different
attitude has been adopted
now.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T20:59:06"></hs_TimeCode>
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T20:55:49"></hs_TimeCode> essence, the
owner of the Porcupine pub, Enterprise Inns, has in my judgment
deliberately let the pub run down and then sought to dispose of it for
development. I am afraid Enterprise Inns has a bad track record in that
regard. It is becoming frankly notorious for such behaviour. Its four
annual reports show an alarming decline in the total number of pubs it
operates, from 7,399 in September 2009 down to 5,902 in September 2012.
Enterprise Inns seems to have a deliberate policy of running down its
estate. It is quite clear from its annual report that, having disposed
of more than 400 pubs in the last year, Enterprise Inns is disposing of
assets to pay down debt. It is a company that, frankly, has not had
good trading results. To my mind, it seems to be behaving more like a
property company than a brewing company.</hs_Para>

Enterprise Inns has done in
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T20:55:24"></hs_TimeCode>this case adds
insult to injury. Not only did it dispose of the site, but it did so
without giving any notice to the population. The site was never
advertised. There was no sign that this public house was going to be
closed. It closed literally overnight, having been sold through a
commercial deal to Lidl supermarket, with no notice given to anyone.
Lidl UK now proposes to demolish the public house and erect a
non-descript supermarket on the site. It is reprehensible that this
pattern of conduct by Enterprise Inns seems to be designed to
circumvent the Government’s work to give greater protection to
public houses. The Government have taken important steps, by creating
the ability to list places such as the Porcupine as assets of community
value and by giving greater protections in the national planning policy

said, the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T21:00:13"></hs_TimeCode>
situation has been made worse by Lidl’s behaviour.
Representatives of the company came to a public meeting organised by
the Mottingham residents association and, to put it charitably, gave
misleading information about the status of the planning application.
They claimed that they already had permission to demolish the public
house, when in fact they had not even made an application. Since then,
although they claim that they wish to consult the community, they have
done no more than board up the public house. They want to demolish it
so that, in effect, the pass will have been sold 
<?notus-xml column=1205?>and it will be impossible to rebuild a pub on the site, but I am pleased

poor behaviour did not stop there, however. Until I secured this
debate—as well as earning a rebuke from you, Mr Speaker, for
making an intervention on the matter at business questions that was
perhaps a little less crisp than I try to be—Lidl had refused to
engage at senior level with me or any other elected representative.
Lidl is a privately owned, German-based company, and it is now buying
up pubs around London and turning them into supermarkets. Ironically,
there is a Lidl just 10 minutes away from this site, in Eltham, as well

application, then forgot to pay the fee for about seven days, which
says something about the company. When I sought a meeting with a Lidl
board director, the company refused to give my office the names of its
directors. We had to go to Companies House to find out who they were.
It refused to give me the names, and refused to meet me until it heard

message to anyone with a pub owned by Enterprise Inns in their

is not the only occasion on which Lidl has behaved in this way. In
Warlingham, it destroyed the former Good Companions public house. It
knocked it down, but it has yet to submit an application to redevelop
the site. It demolished a former police station in Dartford as soon as
it acquired it, and the residents of Dartford have had to live with a
derelict site for the subsequent 15 months. That is
predatory behaviour. It is unacceptable and unbecoming of a public
company. I hope that the directors on the board of Lidl will realise
the reputational damage that their conduct is doing. I say that more in

course, an onus on the owner who seeks compensation for article 4

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T21:07:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) on securing this
important debate. It is important to the people of Mottingham and the
Porcupine pub, but it also gives us a chance—as we have heard
from the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T21:07:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland), the chairman of the
all-party parliamentary save the pub group and from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T21:07:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Eltham (Clive Efford), the member for the Dutch House—to
outline some of the rules affecting pubs and their acquisition by some
of the companies
mentioned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T21:07:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305223000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0005.htm#1305223000117">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T21:07:35"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is aware that on 29
April, Lidl UK submitted a part 31 notification to the London borough
of Bromley council of its intention to demolish the Porcupine pub. I
know that my hon. Friend has expressed his concerns directly 
<?notus-xml column=1207?>to the council about the implications of the notification, so that his
views and those of his constituents can rightly be taken into account
when the council considers the case, which it has to do before 28 May.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T21:08:07"></hs_TimeCode> also know that
local residents recently submitted, as my hon. Friend has said, a
request to the council for an article 4 direction for the removal of
permitted development rights for both demolition and change of use on
the site, which I am advised is still being considered by the council.
The council will need to notify the Secretary of State if and when a
direction has been
drafted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T21:08:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305223000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0005.htm#1305223000118">As
my hon. Friend has outlined, the Porcupine pub ceased trading in March
and the site was sold to Lidl UK at around the same time. It is still
the case that no formal planning application has been submitted to the
council regarding the proposals. I know that my hon. Friend knows from
his time in the Department for Communities and Local Government that it
would be inappropriate for me to comment on the merits or otherwise of
the notification or the proposed article 4 direction, or indeed on the
possible success or otherwise of any planning application for the
erection of a retail unit on the site, as I would not wish to prejudice
the Secretary of State’s position, should any of these matters
come before him. I nevertheless note one of my hon. Friend’s
closing comments about the value of guidelines for councils’ use
of article 4 directions, which might provide councillors with greater
knowledge.</hs_Para>

I visited the Porcupine with my hon. Friend, councillors asked me about
the article 4 direction and about the compensation issue. I think that
we need to look into just how guarded council officers are being about
the advice that they are giving members about the risk of compensation.
We need to ensure that there is a proper understanding of the risk and
that it is not overstated, so that councils do not overestimate it and
fail to take an opportunity that could be used in many cases to protect
pubs under article
4.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305223000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0005.htm#1305223000120">I
know that my hon. Friend is well versed in the planning system, to
which he has referred in detail this evening. However, for the record,
I will explain the position relating to, in particular, part 31
notifications and article 4.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1305223000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0005.htm#1305223000121">The demolition
of most buildings is permitted development, which means that specific
planning permission is not required. However, that is subject to a
requirement to notify the local planning authority concerned through a
part 31 notification, so it can decide whether to prescribe the method
of demolition and restoration of the site. That often gives a community
a brief opportunity to become aware of an issue and do something about
it, as has happened in the case of the Porcupine.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1305223000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0005.htm#1305223000122">As for article
4 directions under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted
Development) Order 1995, public houses and shops are classed as
separate uses under the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order
1987. That recognises the different land use impacts of their
particular uses, and would ordinarily mean that planning permission
would be required to change from one class to another. When issues
arise, however, local authorities, working with their communities, can
restrict the use of permitted development rights by means of an article
4 direction, and, as my hon. Friend said, that is being considered in
this case.</hs_Para>  
<?notus-xml column=1208?><hs_Para UID="1305223000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0005.htm#1305223000123">As soon as the
direction has been drafted, notice is served locally
for 21 days, and the Secretary of State  is
notified at the same time. Having considered the local consultation
responses, the local authority then considers whether to confirm the
direction. It can do that by serving a further notice locally and
notifying the Secretary of State.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1305223000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0005.htm#1305223000124">There have
been calls in the House recently for the removal of permitted
development rights that allow pubs to convert to other uses at a
national level. The hon. Member for Leeds North West, representing the
save the pub group, has spoken about that on a number of occasions.
However, the Government are clear about the fact that localism should
be at the heart of planning. We need to avoid any disproportionate
restrictions on change of use that might result in more empty
buildings, spoiling the local environment and holding back economic
development. However, that does not prevent us from doing what we can
to protect our community pubs.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1305223000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0005.htm#1305223000125">As my hon.
Friend said, we should encourage communities to ensure that their
locals are listed as community assets. CAMRA is running a fantastic
campaign, and I urge Members to look at its website, which gives clear
and simple directions about how to list a pub. It is good to hear that
the people of Mottingham are adopting that route while there is still a
building to protect. I sensed the public feeling there the other day,
when at least 200 of them turned out. Listing a pub is a simple
process. It is necessary to be on the electoral roll, but I noted my
hon. Friend’s comments on that requirement, and I will look into
it. Only 21 people in the area need to propose the listing, and I
encourage people to do
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305223000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0005.htm#1305223000126"><B><Member ContinuationText="Greg Mulholland" PimsId="4826" UID="1305223000201" xid="861" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0005.htm#1305223000201">Greg

Mulholland:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for listening to what has
been said about this issue. However, he is now a CAMRA member—I
am delighted about that—and he knows that CAMRA does not agree
with him and believes that we need more protection. It is great that he
visited the pub, but, having heard the case, does he honestly think
that it is in the interests of localism or pubs to retain a national
planning framework that allows the conversion of wanted, full, busy,
profitable pubs to branches of McDonald’s, supermarkets or flats
without the community’s having a say? That is not in the
interests of localism. It is undermining what the Minister and I both
believe in.</hs_Para>

Lewis:</Member></B> I was about to say something about that. There is
sometimes a gap when a company buys a property that was not already
listed and does not need to demolish it. The first a resident may know
about it is when the boarding goes up advertising whichever company
that happens to be. That may be the first indication that Enterprise
Inns, or whoever, has sold it off.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1305223000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0005.htm#1305223000130">As I have
said, we do not intend to change planning laws per se, but we do need
to ensure that whatever we do is proportionate. The listing of a
community asset is a simple, light-touch, but effective way of
protecting a pub. However, I accept that there may be an opportunity to
take that a step further in order to prevent circumstances in which a
resident does not know that a property has been sold or has become a
Tesco, a Lidl or a McDonald’s until the store opens or the
boarding goes up. I am prepared to look at that, but I must make it
clear that, 
<?notus-xml column=1209?>as I have outlined, we are not going to make any substantive changes to
change of use and general planning that are disproportionate.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1305223000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/debtext/130521-0005.htm#1305223000131"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T21:14:46"></hs_TimeCode>I
want to stress again that communities that value their pubs should do
what they can to have them listed. The Government have done a great
deal to help to protect pubs through our work on planning, under the
national planning framework, and through providing the ability to list
a pub as a community asset. That has had a great impact. We have also
helped to protect pubs by developing the Plunkett Foundation so our
communities can buy pubs, and we have put funding into Pub is the Hub.
There is also the Chancellor’s fantastic move to cut the beer
duty escalator and beer duty itself.</hs_Para>

the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst on the fantastic work he is

benefits are slightly more measurable.  At a conservative
estimate, Derry/Londonderry expects 600,000 extra visitors to the city
over the course of 2013. Three thousand new jobs have been created in
the city, and £100 million has been invested in its
infrastructure. I am advised that for every £1 invested, the
city of culture is expected to generate £5. Those facts are all
the more staggering given its relatively small area. The competition is
not a joke, but a prize that is well worth winning for each of our
constituencies or areas.
Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T09:43:42"></hs_TimeCode> the
analogy with Liverpool is less perfect, because it

is an important economic driver not just of the Scottish economy but of
the British one, too. We have a thriving offshore oil and gas industry,
which is doing extremely well and is now moving into renewables. We
like to call ourselves the “energy capital of Europe”.
Aberdeen is a vibrant city that is full of life and energy, so why on
earth do we want it to become the city of culture? It is because the
one thing that is missing in our city is a strong cultural identity.
Unfortunately, the participation rate in cultural activities by the
people of Aberdeen is lower than the national average—both in
Scotland and in the UK as a whole. We want to use the bid to build up
the part of our community that has perhaps not always got the attention
that it deserves because we have been too busy making money and running
the energy sector.</hs_Para>

emphasis has always been on the economic side of Aberdeen and not so
much on the cultural side or on making the city a much more attractive
place to live. Many agencies say that it is difficult to attract staff
to Aberdeen because everyone thinks that it is much too far
north—it is quite far north—and too cold. They come up
with all the negative things about Aberdeen. Indeed, it is also said
that the locals themselves take after the grey granite of the
buildings. However, when people move and make a life in Aberdeen, they
discover what a wonderful place it is, and it is then difficult to move
them somewhere else if their job demands

we want to build on and what we want to use the bid for is the cultural
offer that will be there for the people of Aberdeen. Although Aberdeen
is far north, it is not too far north, and that is another reason why
the city of culture bid would be so great for the city; it would bring
us more into the centre of the UK. Hopefully, it would help us to
create a centre that people would be prepared to travel to in order to
take up the cultural
offer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T09:54:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052145000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052145000059">Aberdeen
already has great buildings that deliver aspects of culture. His
Majesty’s theatre, for example, is incredibly grand. It was only
when I went to theatres in London that I discovered just how grand it
is, because the ones in London are quite pathetic in comparison. We
have an art gallery on which we are about to spend a few million
pounds, refurbishing and extending it. We have Peacock Visual Arts,
which has a world-famous print works, the Gray’s School of Arts,
the Scott Sutherland School of Architecture and two universities that
also do cultural things. Indeed the Aberdeen university festival is
just finishing at the moment. It is perhaps worth pointing out here
that we had two universities in Aberdeen at the same time as there were
only two universities in the whole of England—in Oxford and
Cambridge.</hs_Para>

vibrant city, the wealth does not always trickle down to the poorer
areas. We hope the culture bid might be able to reach the parts of our
communities in Aberdeen that the oil wealth has not necessarily
reached, and we are keen to build up localised events that will involve
people more than the local galleries. We know that there is an appetite
there and that people want to be involved, but we need
something

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:07:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Southend West  (Mr Amess) for securing this
debate, and it is fantastic to hear from so many Members about the
benefits of their own constituencies. I know from conversations with
colleagues that for many people Hastings summons up three things.
First, there is our famous battle—I am happy to say that there
is no historical confusion about that—as well as the Norman
conquest and the castle on the hill, which was built just four years
after the conquest. Secondly, there is the fishing port, which is still
a major issue economically in the town and in terms of fairness; we are
always campaigning to get higher quotas for our fishermen and I hope
that this Government will be able to deliver them. Thirdly, there is
our famous seaside, which attracts so many visitors.</hs_Para>

Hastings has recently become a cultural storm of
activity in art, music and literature. We have both a history of
culture and modern cultural initiatives being established in the town.
Historically, we have had the International Chess Congress, which has
been going since 1920, and to bring us right up to date we now have the
Jerwood gallery, which has recently been built and which has a
fantastic exhibition of modern art. Also, it has recently been
announced that our pier, which sadly burned down just over two years
ago, is to receive £13.5 million of lottery grant,
and during the next few years it will rise like the phoenix to
invigorate the
town<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:08:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052145000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052145000084">However,
the strongest cultural base that Hastings has is its events. It seems
that every other weekend, particularly during the summer, there is some
fabulous event, which is inclusive and open to everybody, to liven up
the weekend and to attract tourism and investment. We have just had the
May day bank holiday, including the Jack in the Green event. There was
also marching, drums and our famous Morris dancers. Incidentally, two
years ago our Morris dancers came up to London to protest against the
proposed changing of the May day bank holiday; they performed outside
Parliament and were fantastic. In August, Hastings has old town week,
which includes parades, bike races, street races and—perhaps
more unusually—a pram race.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:07:33"></hs_TimeCode>In September, we
have a month-long arts festival, Coastal Currents, and a seafood and
wine festival that now runs for two days. In October, in common with
local tradition, at the end of a week’s events the Hastings
Borough Bonfire Society burns an effigy of someone it really
dislikes. That always causes nervous tremors in elected
officials
locally.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052145000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052145000085">My
favourite event is the recently introduced pirate day, which has been
going for four years. It was set up to beat the “Guinness Book
of Records” entry for the largest number of pirates to
congregate on a beach. It has to be taken seriously: a cutlass and an
eye patch will not do. This time last year 14,231 people were there. I

debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:17:14"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
delighted that he did not try to rubbish Plymouth during the past few
months and delighted, too, that Plymouth did not appear in “The
Hitchhikers’ Guide to the Galaxy”, in which Arthur Dent,
as my hon. Friend may recall, thought he had died and gone to hell, but
in reality had gone to Southend. Ford Prefect, another character in
that story, said that he was surprised about Southend, because although
the sea remained where it was, the buildings and the rocks went up and

support Plymouth’s city of culture bid. I am looking forward to
my hon. Friend visiting Plymouth in the next few weeks. Our bid for the
city of culture in 2017 will help regenerate parts of our city,
including our inner city. In the Efford ward, during the past 10 years,
the local community, through the Heart of Efford and the city council,
has used grants and the arts to regenerate a council estate, built
immediately after the last war in an area previously decimated during
the
blitz.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052146000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052146000003">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:18:52"></hs_TimeCode>

Plymouth the city of culture in 2017, the authorities will build on its
cultural heritage and reputation. Plymouth has the Theatre Royal, one
of the five UK production companies; the Drum theatre, often used by
Plymouth’s vibrant amateur dramatic societies; TR2, which
manufactures many of the sets for theatrical productions throughout the
country; Plymouth university’s Peninsula Arts; Plymouth College
of Arts, one of the UK’s five independent arts schools; and a
proposed new arts free school, which is to be sponsored by the college

was also home to the late Robert Lenkiewicz, Beryl Cook and Joshua
Reynolds. We have some of the UK’s finest post-war architecture,
following the devastation of the blitz. In addition, we have a large
number of 
<?notus-xml column=64?>Georgian buildings, including Admiralty house, which was the home of
Nelson’s deputy, Lord Collingwood; the royal naval hospital; the
home of Captain Hardy—also of Nelson fame; and Conan
Doyle’s home, where he wrote “The Hounds of the
Baskervilles”. Furthermore, we have the Barbican theatre, a

for Southend West (Mr Amess), who put in a tremendous

at the betting odds, and the bookies have Southend second from bottom,

the Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall) and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:21:31"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz), as well as the

was pleased to see
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:21:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

have heard much about the history of different cities and towns this
morning, and Leicester, too, has a great history. We can trace our
origins back to the iron age. We have Roman settlements, as well as
Saxon and Norman influences. We have tremendous architecture and
historical buildings, such as the Roman Jewry wall and the
Guildhall. We hosted Shakespeare’s company, and there are
suggestions that Shakespeare himself may have been in
Leicester.</hs_Para>

recent years, of course, we have found and dug up Richard III. He was
buried in Leicester for 500 years, and we recently found him in a
Leicester city council social services car park. We therefore have
royalty in Leicester, and I say to hon. Friends from Yorkshire,
“We are holding on to him. Keep your hands
off<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:22:32"></hs_TimeCode>!”
Cardinal Wolsey is also buried somewhere in Abbey park, and it is
perhaps time we dug him up, too.</hs_Para>

the benefit of Opposition colleagues, I should say that Leicester has a
history of radical politics. As Members might expect from a city that
was built on textiles in the past 200 years or so, we had a luddite
tradition. At one point, of course, Ramsay MacDonald also sat for a
Leicester constituency—may he be a reminder to any Liberal
Democrats of the fate of leaders who go into coalitions.</hs_Para>

is a city of tremendous diversity. Forty years ago, families from
Uganda made their home in Leicester. They were followed by families
from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. We have many Hindu temples,
gurdwaras and mosques, all within yards of each other. 
<?notus-xml column=65?>We had the first Jain temple in Europe. In Leicester, Members could be
greeted with the words, “Assalamu alaikum”,
“Namaste”, “Sat sri akaal” or, more simply,
“Alreet, ma duck.” That is very much part of Leicester.
We all celebrate our faiths, and we all come together to celebrate
Diwali, in the biggest such celebration outside India. We all celebrate
Vaisakhi and Eid, and we all join in the lighting of the Hannukkah
candles in Victoria park, as well as celebrating all the Christian
festivals.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:23:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Leicester West would have said had she been here, we
have the biggest comedy festival in Europe after that in Edinburgh.
After his performance today, I hope we can book
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:23:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Southend West for our comedy festival.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:24:08"></hs_TimeCode> also have
lots of community festivals. Last week,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:24:05"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Leicester East organised a mango festival. Ours
is therefore the only bid that can guarantee that it will have the
Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee handing out mangoes to those who
come to the city to celebrate.</hs_Para>

the city, we have different community events. ITV did a documentary
saying that crime and antisocial behaviour on one of our estates was
terrible. People on the estate came together and put on a tremendous
summer community event, showing that they were  not prepared to
take what an outside TV documentary was saying about them. That is our
trump card: the people of Leicester coming together, whether to support
our football team and Leicester Tigers or to join in  the
various religious festivals we organise. That is  what
Leicester is about, and that is why our case  is
overwhelming—we have the best
people.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:24:57"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

serve under your chairmanship, Mr Weir. The fact that you chose to

have heard wonderful presentations from different Members of Parliament
about the cultural and creative merits of their areas. Surely, the
purpose of the UK city of culture year is not just to change
perceptions in the community about the importance of culture and art
and the incredible contribution they make to economic regeneration, but
to change perceptions about the cultural offer among people outside our
home areas, across the UK. One of the great successes of the
Derry/Londonderry city of culture year must surely be that it has not
only inspired people in Northern Ireland, but brought in many new
visitors to the city who had not previously had the chance to
experience its delights.</hs_Para>

is very much at the heart of the east Kent bid, which is about what the
city of culture year has to offer not only east Kent, but the rest of
the UK. Kent is on the frontier of the UK, facing our European
neighbours, so we have a chance not only to bring in people from the
UK, but to show the rest of Europe what the UK has  to offer in
a new, challenging, surprising and creative location.</hs_Para>

Kent’s is a unique bid, because it is not based on one city.
Instead, as the bid says, it is based on “a city
imagined”—a city drawn from a diverse collection of
communities and towns, as well as the city of Canterbury, all of which
make up the east Kent area. From Whitstable and Margate, around the
coast to Dover, Folkestone and Romney marsh, and inland to Ashford, we
have a new creative area, which is at heart of the east Kent
bid.</hs_Para>

area has a terrific cultural heritage. We have a King, in the form of
Henry IV; he is not under a car park, but buried safely in Canterbury
cathedral. In the early days of English literature, Chaucer wrote the
tales of the pilgrims making their journey to Canterbury. The area was
the inspiration for many of Charles Dickens’s books. He wrote
“Little Dorrit” while staying in Folkestone. Many will be
familiar with the dramatic scene from the recent dramatisation of
“Great Expectations”, when Pip meets Magwitch on the
coast, which is set in Romney marsh, in my constituency.</hs_Para>

area is also a vibrant centre for the cotemporary arts, with the Turner
Contemporary gallery in Margate the home of that great international
artist Tracey Emin. The Folkestone Triennial arts festival is one of
Europe’s leading festivals of sculpture and contemporary art,
and the last festival was opened by the Minister. He has seen first
hand the impressive work of Roger De Haan and the Creative Foundation
in Folkestone. They hold fantastic creative events, making creative
regeneration part of the economy. By making east Kent the centre of the
UK creative world in 2017, we are seeking to acknowledge what has been
done so far, to build on the important work of creative regeneration in
the economy and to celebrate the work of local artists.</hs_Para>

ambassadors, drawn from the sons and daughters of east Kent. We have

for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport (Oliver Colvile) has touched on
some  of them; but I want to consider it from the
perspective  of its maritime history, and use that as a
starting point, to whet people’s appetites. It was important in
Tudor times. Francis Drake of course set off from Plymouth to
circumnavigate the globe. The church where he was married is in St
Budeaux in Plymouth. There is a wealth of archive material that would
certainly be brought out and displayed during a city of culture year.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:30:36"></hs_TimeCode>The pilgrim
fathers left England for a place that they named Plymouth. They did not
name it Southampton, or after anywhere in Essex; so Plymouth is known
globally. Charles Darwin, in HMS Beagle, left from Plymouth. Captain
Cook is also associated with it; and Francis Chichester returned to
Plymouth in Gipsy Moth. Napoleon spent time on board a British warship
in Plymouth harbour.</hs_Para>

course, there is also wartime history. At the time of the D-day
landings many troops, particularly Americans, left for Normandy from
Plymouth. The civilian history of those dark days is also interesting,
and many memories and much history could be brought out during a city
of culture year. Jill Craigie’s film “The Way We
Live”, about the post-war reconstruction of Plymouth, stands
out. It set out the Watson-Abercrombie plan for rebuilding the city
centre, which was so special architecturally. Jill Craigie was of
course the wife of Michael Foot—politician, journalist and

Duddridge</B> (Rochford and Southend East) (Con):</Member> In many ways
this debate is wrongly named. As I have listened I have felt it should
clearly be named “Cities of Culture” as it is not about a
single city of culture. I urge the Minister to consider the possibility
that, although there will be only one city of culture, some of the
other bids should be recognised additionally. The Southend bid, rather
like the Kent one, has considered not just 
<?notus-xml column=68?>Southend-on-Sea but the region as a whole, in the country as a whole. In
fact, the front page of the bid documentation positioning Southend for
city of culture in 2017 states that it would explore the heritage,
landscape and character not just of Southend but of the Thames estuary,
and the way it has defined the culture of the whole United Kingdom.
Perhaps the status of city of culture would be used not just to
showcase a city or town, and a region and county, but all our
constituencies. If people flood in from overseas to visit Southend I am
sure they will also have time to visit one or two of the other places
mentioned by hon. Members

congratulate Southend council, and particularly Rob Tinlin, the chief
executive, as well as the leader of the council, on pulling the bid

movement within the town; that movement, and the enthusiasm about the
culture, are building. It feels almost embarrassing that we have been
given three opportunities in relation to the bid. Not only has

are a few things to do with Southend that I want to talk
about—specifically education and its role in culture. I went to
the Colchester campus of the university of Essex in the 1990s, and now
we have a campus in Southend. We have a wonderful college with many
cultural programmes and degrees, which add to the fabric of society.
All too often in the past, young, talented people moved away and did
not come back. Now they want to stay in Southend. There are truly many
opportunities. It may be that when people think of Southend they think
of the pier—the longest pleasure pier in the world—Rossi
ice cream, and the sea front; but perhaps we should also recognise the
art galleries with fabulous Constable paintings, and the history that
goes far beyond the town’s boom time of the 18th and 19th
centuries. There is a monastery built in the 11th century,
with 45 acres of park land, right in the middle of the town. That is a
wonderful resource. We have Porters, a 16th century house that is the
mayoral residence, which was visited by Disraeli, and by Churchill
during the war, on his way to Shoebury ranges. In fact it was Disraeli
who called Southend the riviera of

delighted that so many towns and cities from regions across Britain are
competing for that important title. It is a testament to what culture
means to our country and the value it brings to our communities, but
importantly it also means that each of those communities will place

Last year’s Olympic opening ceremony and the Cultural Olympiad
reminded people across the world that Britain is a cultural world
leader—that our artistic traditions are strong and we are
rightly proud of them. However, that success happened not by chance but
by choice. The previous Labour Government invested in the arts, and
that investment enabled culture to revitalise some of our previously
grey city and town centres. As the cultural scene has developed, so too
have jobs, growth and the social well-being of the people who live
there. Labour introduced free access to museums and galleries, ensuring

The effect in Liverpool in 2008 was striking. In that year alone,
visitors voted with their feet, ensuring that the city had almost 15
million cultural visits. Some 67,000 schoolchildren in the city were
involved. There was an £800 million economic benefit, and the
number of residents who visited a city attraction was 10% above the

we are debating the UK city of culture bid for 2017. In our country we
have the appetite, the skills, the talent and the tradition, but many
organisations within the cultural sector exist on a complex funding
stream of public investment, commercial revenue and private giving.

innovation and, in good times, stability, but some decisions currently

2010, the Government have cut the budget of Arts Council England by
more than 30%. Local councils across the country are dealing with
devastating cuts to their funding streams. They are struggling to
balance those cuts, and the Local Government Association has warned
that, by 2019-20, 90% of discretionary funding streams, such as
culture, leisure and libraries, may be

is not all bad news. Many local authorities are innovatively working in
partnership to minimise the damage caused by the funding crisis, but
that is a result of new thinking from councils. The cuts come without
any real Government guidance for local community arts organisations or

important work in these challenging times. It has recently published a
significant report that clearly articulates and reflects on the
economic benefit of the arts within our

report states that 0.1% of Government funding is spent on the arts, yet
the arts make up 0.4% of the economy. That, of course, does not account
for the creative industries or for tourism. The arts provide 0.5% of
total UK employment, and at least £856 million a year of
spending by tourists visiting this country can be attributed directly
to the arts and to culture. Those points were recently made in the
important report of Arts Council England, and I join the hon. Gentleman

problem is that national planning policies are allowing inappropriate
housing development to take place in the village of Broughton. For
those who are unfamiliar with Kettering, it is middle England at its
very best. Geographically situated in the heart of England, it
represents all the best that middle England has to offer. Broughton has
about 2,500 people, making it one of the largest villages in the
borough of Kettering; it is located in the south-west of the borough,
just off the A43 which links Kettering to Northampton. Before the
completion and approval of a neighbourhood plan for the village,
however, building developers are able to use national planning policy
guidelines and the lack of a demonstrable rolling five-year housing
delivery target from Kettering borough council to submit planning
applications for housing developments around the village, confident
that the applications will meet with approval from the borough council
or be won on appeal to the Planning
Inspectorate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052148000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052148000056">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T11:03:26"></hs_TimeCode>
developments are in unsuitable locations that are unlikely to be
included as preferred development sites in the village’s
neighbourhood plan, once it has been produced, and as a result there
will be unacceptable pressure on the local infrastructure used by
existing residents. Broughton parish council is firmly committed to the
development of a neighbourhood plan for the village, but before such a
plan is signed off, there is in effect carte blanche for developers to
choose sites around the village, put in a planning application for
housing development and get it

Cransley Hill in Broughton. There are to be 46 homes, 19 affordable
homes and a substation. On 12 February, the

site in question is to the north-west of the village, on a parcel of
land between the built-up part and the A43. It is adjacent to but
outside the village envelope and on a greenfield site. Objections
included: the site is greenfield and good farmland; sewerage and
electricity supply are at capacity; there is a problem with water
pressure in the village; there is pressure on school places; the
village does not have a doctor, dentist or chemist’s; there will
be traffic congestion as a result of the development, on top of the
existing parking problems in the village; there is not enough local
public transport, and the bus service is often inadequate; many of the
local footpaths are unlit; lanes in the village are unsuitable for
construction traffic, and the density of the development is too great.

simple—the Council has to be able to demonstrate that there are
enough housing sites with a realistic prospect of being built out to
satisfy the targets in the Core Spatial Strategy over the coming five
years, and if we cannot do that, then there is a presumption in the
national planning framework that consents will be given to new
applications, unless there are sound planning reasons for refusal.

borough council cannot be accused of developing its planning policies
slowly. Indeed, Kettering is part of the north Northamptonshire core
spatial strategy, which was adopted in June 2008. It was the first core
spatial strategy of its type in the whole of the country. That was as a
result of the planning policies of the previous Government, but
Kettering was not slow in coming forward—it ticked all the boxes
and in pretty smart fashion. In policy 10 of the core spatial strategy,
there is a housing requirement of 1,640 new dwellings in the rural area
of Kettering during 2001 to 2021. Just over half way through, in March
2012, there had been 1,421 housing completions in the rural area, with
a further 41 soon to be constructed. That left an outstanding
requirement of just 178 dwellings over the best part of 10 years. The
council cannot be accused of not building houses in the local area, and
it seems extremely punitive that, as a result of the
Government’s planning policies, this application for 65 houses
in Broughton was approved. I am not blaming Kettering borough council
for that. It is doing only what it has been told to do by the national
Government, but I blame the national Government’s
policies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052148000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052148000066">Redrow

sums up the position well. I invite the Minister to come to Broughton,
to speak to and listen to local residents who are worried about the
future of their lovely village. Broughton is not against any
development, but it does not want inappropriately large development on
inappropriate sites, especially when Kettering borough council has a
very good record of working with central Government to provide local
homes for local people. Indeed, it approved 5,500 homes under the
previous Government on the outskirts of Kettering at Kettering East.
Those homes cannot be included in the rolling five-year housing
delivery target because, for the development to go ahead on that site,
the Highways Agency must approve a new junction—junction
10a—on the A14.</hs_Para>

starts are waiting to happen, dependent on a Government decision on
highways. Kettering borough council is doing its best to unblock that
blockage, but while it is in place, those houses cannot be counted

development. Developers know that, which is why they are coming
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052148000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052148000078">Through

council is trying to be helpful, but it is in a difficult position with
the Government’s national planning policy framework on rolling
five-year targets. I appeal to the Minister on behalf of my
constituents in Broughton and all those who live in rural communities
in Kettering. He is welcome to come and listen to local concerns, but
will he please use his authority to allow authorities such as Kettering
to say no to such development when neighbourhood plans are being worked

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Nick Boles):</Member></B> I congratulate my hon. Friend on
securing this debate on an important local issue. He is, as you know,
Mr Weir, the living embodiment of localism, being a representative of
his constituents not just in this Parliament as a Member of Parliament
but as a borough councillor. I am in awe of his work ethic in taking on
two such testing
roles.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052148000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052148000080">I
strongly welcome Broughton’s interest in pursuing a
neighbourhood plan. It is probably the most transformative of the
Government’s planning innovations, and I am delighted that it is
making particularly good progress with the first three referendums on
neighbourhood plans, which were passed with overwhelming majorities.
Thame in Oxfordshire secured a higher turnout than 
<?notus-xml column=80?>the county council elections that took place on the same day. People
went to the polls to vote for the neighbourhood plan, but did not vote
for a county council candidate. There is a huge amount of popular
interest in neighbourhood planning, and I strongly welcome any
community that wants to pursue one.</hs_Para>

Friend will understand that I cannot discuss individual applications,
past or prospective, but I hope that I can explain to him how the
balance of planning policy works and offer to engage with him and
Broughton’s residents in future. At the heart of the Localism
Act 2011 and the national planning policy framework that it
introduced is our wish to devolve to local communities responsibility
for making provision for future development as well as the power to
plan how those development needs should be met. It is important to
understand the combination of the power and the
responsibility.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052148000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052148000082">This
country has an intense housing need; that is true in Northamptonshire,
in my county of Lincolnshire and certainly to the south of both. Every
year, the country has built many fewer houses than we need just to meet
the growth in our population as a result of ageing and other social
changes. That is why we placed at the heart of the framework the idea
that discharging responsibility to the local community involves
providing sufficient sites to meet the five-year land supply need. That
means having sites that are available for development now that could
satisfy the area’s housing needs over the next five years.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T11:19:53"></hs_TimeCode>The framework
then says that if a local authority does not have the five-year land
supply in place, its housing policies will not be considered robust,
and applications for housing developments will therefore have to be
judged against the national framework policies, which cover a wide
range of planning issues, and the presumption in favour of sustainable
development.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13052148000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052148000083"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T11:20:23"></hs_TimeCode>To
reassure my hon. Friend, it is important to understand that it is not a
presumption in favour of all development—it is not a
free-for-all. The presumption is in favour of sustainable development.
The sustainability policies, which are clearly set out in the national
planning policy framework, relate to environmental protections and to
the importance of sufficient infrastructure. Sustainability captures
not only environmental concerns, but economic sustainability and
physical sustainability, in terms of the infrastructure supporting
development. I am well aware of other decisions by inspectors. They
regularly turn down proposals for development when authorities do not
have a five-year land supply, because they accept that those
development proposals are not sustainable and would conflict with
important policies in the framework.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13052148000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052148000084"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T11:21:22"></hs_TimeCode>The
presumption kicks in when there is no five-year land supply. As my hon.
Friend has accepted, that is unfortunately, at the moment, the case for
Kettering borough council, although he makes a good argument about why
that is, in part, a result of problems with the A14 and its new
junction. I would like to reassure him that, as somebody served
indirectly by the A14, I am very keen for the A14 improvements to be
brought forward. Just yesterday, I met the Minister in the Treasury
with responsibility for infrastructure, Lord Deighton, to discuss major
national infrastructure projects, and  I know that improvements
to the A14 are absolutely  at the top of the
Government’s list of priorities for  such
projects.</hs_Para>

hope that together we can work to try and accelerate those improvements
and the creation of the junction, which my hon. Friend supports. I
hope, however, that he also accepts that national policy must be made
to apply equally everywhere. Having a policy that requires boroughs to
have a five-year land supply means that his borough then needs to find
alternative sites while the sites off the A14 are not available,
knowing that there will continue to be development needs, and perhaps
at the back end of the 15-year plan, those sites will come on stream
and other sites will not need to be provided, once the A14 development
is complete.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13052148000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052148000086"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T11:23:02"></hs_TimeCode>My
hon. Friend quoted Councillor Jim Hakewill’s eloquent letter,
which I read and replied to on the Prime Minister’s behalf, and
which asked, importantly, whether it would be possible to call some
kind of moratorium on development applications while neighbourhood
plans are under way. That case has been made by other Members of
Parliament and by a number of organisations, including the Campaign to
Protect Rural England.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T11:24:15"></hs_TimeCode> difficulty
with that proposal is that, first—of course, Parliament could
change this—there is no legal basis for introducing a moratorium
on development applications while plans are under way.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13052148000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052148000087">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T10:20:28"></hs_TimeCode>,
and perhaps more importantly—because we can change the law any
time if we are persuaded of the merits of doing so—it would,
unfortunately, create a perverse incentive that I fear communities less
responsible and less proactive than my hon. Friend’s would be
inclined to abuse. If we said that once work had started on a
neighbourhood plan, there would then be a moratorium on all development
applications until the plan process was complete, every single
community in the country that wanted to stop development would have a
clear incentive to start a neighbourhood plan and take their own sweet
time to conclude it, as they would know that they could see off any
application in the
meantime.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T11:24:35"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

therefore, we need to have, embedded in the system, a dynamic incentive
for communities to get a move on and put their plans in place, whether
at neighbourhood or local level. The fact is that only through having a
robust plan can the community make decisions about speculative
applications and know that they will stick. That provides the incentive
to take the difficult decisions involved in drawing up a plan, and for
the borough council, of which my hon. Friend is a member, to put in
place its five-year land supply. That same incentive puts a tiger in
the tank of people working as volunteers in neighbourhoods to do their
community plan, because they will then know that if they want to
control the future development of their community, the plan is urgent,
important, and worth getting on with.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13052148000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052148000089"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T11:25:42"></hs_TimeCode>In
the meantime, I accept that a few applications may be made that will
ultimately be accepted, either by the planning authority or by a
planning inspector on appeal, that the community would rather not see
happen. I completely understand that, but planning is a long game. My
hon. Friend has been representing his constituents and residents for a
very long time at different levels, and 
<?notus-xml column=82?>I hope that he will carry on doing so for an even longer time in future.
Even if an application that a community does not like gets through in
the next year or two, the game is over the next 10 or 20 years. If, 15
years ago, there was the possibility of having neighbourhood plans in
all those communities, they would have been able to shape such
developments in a way that they were never able to.</hs_Para>

hope that the community of Broughton, which my hon. Friend is
representing so well today, will see that even if they cannot control
the application that he referred to, they have the possibility, through
plan making, of controlling developments for the next 15 years. That
applies not only to housing developments, but to the development of
community facilities, green spaces and design codes, and to lots of
other issues that are vital to people growing up and living in a
community.</hs_Para>

Hakewill and I would be pleased to arrange, so that he could listen to

more than getting out of Westminster and talking to people. I was in
Worcestershire and Shropshire last week, and next week I am in Devon

is not that there are no frustrations—there are. It  is
not that there are no disappointments—there are. It is not that
it is easy or quick—it is not. It is a long, painful process
that requires volunteers and local councillors to undertake exhaustive
efforts on behalf of the common interest, which is a thoroughly
admirable thing that I applaud. However, we have a support contract in
place to offer communities such as Broughton direct support. There is
the possibility of securing a grant of £7,000 towards the
out-of-pocket costs of organising a neighbourhood plan. I would be
happy to explain that to them, and hopefully, to share the experience
of other communities that have done neighbourhood plans successfully.
Neighbourhood plans, such as that in Thame, have had to wrestle with
substantial development. A plan has been backed that includes plans for
775 additional houses in Thame; nevertheless, it secured the support of
more than 70% of the people who voted.</hs_Para>

Danczuk</B> (Rochdale) (Lab):</Member> I am pleased to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr Davies, and delighted to have the opportunity to
introduce this debate on the future of our high streets. Let me start
by saying that, as it is a widely recognised barometer for the
performance of our economy, it is especially worrying to have seen more
retail chains go into insolvency in the past 12 months than
ever before. Yesterday’s British Retail Consortium report,
showing that the number of empty shops has reached a new high, adds to
a growing sense that our high streets are experiencing a short and
painful decline, which the Government, I will argue, are not doing
enough to address. First, however, I want to put into context the value
of our high
streets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T14:30:57"></hs_TimeCode> in terms
of retail, as a focal point for communities and as a generator of
social capital and civic
pride<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T14:31:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052163000004">As
retail is the traditional home of Britain’s biggest private
sector employer, it is worth noting that the latest figures from the
House of Commons Library show that the retail sector employs 4.2
million people—more than 15% of our work force. It accounts for
34% of all turnover in the UK and, according to the British Retail
Consortium, employs 40% of all those aged under 20. UK retail sector
sales were worth more than £311 billion in 2012. It
is a massive sector and an important rung on the employment ladder for
young
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T14:31:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052163000005">However,
high streets are more than just a place of commerce. They are dynamic
hubs of social activity where enduring social bonds are formed that
help to create strong and vibrant communities. Local high streets are
also a strong source of civic pride; they can help shape a keen sense
of local identity, common heritage and local
values<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T14:32:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0001.htm#13052163000006">If
we take all that into account, it is hard to imagine a future in
Britain without the high street playing a substantive role in community
life, but as we all know, high streets currently face enormous
challenges and many local high streets are fighting for their lives.
Faced with that threat to such an important economic and social driver,
it is incumbent on Government to act. In the early days of the
coalition, Ministers at least gave the impression that they recognised
that. The Minister responsible for high
streets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T14:33:24"></hs_TimeCode>—the

colleagues and I are committed to tackling these challenges head on.

we move towards the

and a half years later, those words have a distinctly hollow ring.
Instead of commitment to tackling the problems, Ministers have shown
indifference. Indeed, their actions have made things worse. They have
not only failed even to give a full response to Mary Portas’s
2011 review, but, year after year, they continue to ignore calls from
business groups for some respite on business rates. Every year, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer keeps piling millions of pounds on to the
bills of retailers, which is causing insolvencies
everywhere<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T14:33:34"></hs_TimeCode>. And
whereas Mary Portas, the Government’s high street tsar, said in

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T14:33:41"></hs_TimeCode> Secretary of
State for Business, Innovation and

some areas, have to pay the top-of-the-market 2008 rates until 2017. We
end up with the absurd scenario of Burnley effectively subsidising Bond
street, and Rochdale subsidising Regent street. Business rates for an
Amazon fulfilment centre in Doncaster are calculated at £44 per
square metre, yet for an out-of-town Comet store in Rochdale, which as
we know subsequently closed, they were £125 per square metre.
Even worse, the rates for one unit in a Rochdale shopping centre are
calculated at £1,080 per square metre—24 times more
expensive than the rates Amazon pay in
Doncaster.</hs_Para>

Sunday I had a very optimistic experience. I was in a small street in

some time, blighted by shops not being filled and worries about custom.
They have done a great deal for themselves, including painting their
shops in contrasting vibrant colours. On Sunday they had organised a
festival. They had put a green swathe down the middle of the street and
a series of events was taking place. The place was absolutely buzzing.

high street must, in a sense, reinvent itself. Certain pressures are
not due just to the coalition Government, as might be supposed from the
opening contribution. They are due to fairly long-term things, such as
changes in shopping and working habits, the fact that we are living in
an age of austerity and there is generally less money around and less
profit for companies, and the fact that the drift out of town
continues. Overwhelmingly, they are due to the threat of the internet
and the fact 
<?notus-xml column=90?>that people can now shop at any time of the day or night. In some

a big out-of-town shopping centre, and Tesco made an unsuccessful bid

practice. If they find that something works in Stockport or Rochdale,
they should tell the world about it so that other local authorities and
communities can follow suit. They can encourage the reinvention of the
high street, through the promotion of business improvement district
projects and the like. In my constituency, we hope soon to have a BID

understand that, during the pre-Budget negotiations, the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills thought it reasonable to investigate
whether something might be done about retail business rates, but that
the difficulty is how to advantage the people we want to be given an
advantage—the small shopkeepers—not the big players, some
of whom need no financial support whatever. I could refer again to
Tesco<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:01:25"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:01:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000065">Where
we want to do something about business rates, that is currently more
complex than it need be, which I want the Minister to investigate. I
have heard reports from small business sources that when they want a
downward valuation of their business rates and have a serious
case—and when business rates are out of kilter with rents, as
the hon. Member for Rochdale suggested—it takes far too long to
get a result. By the time that it has all been sorted out, they will be

fundamental point is that retailers must adjust  to the shock
of the new. They need to see their shops not as antagonistic to the
internet, but must play along with it and be portals for it, because
they have certain 
<?notus-xml column=92?>advantages. The current system, with white vans constantly going up and
down the country and leaving brown parcels in the porches of people who
are out, is not frightfully efficient. There is no capacity within
internet marketing or sales for much to be done about repair or return,
at least not without additional expense. Very little quality control
can be exercised when people deal with an internet retailer, as opposed
to one whose shop they can walk into to complain about the
product<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:02:38"></hs_TimeCode>. The
interesting point—this is why I think that the hon. Gentleman is
really on to something—is that some big stores, such as John
Lewis, which have used the internet very well, have found that that has
not corrupted or reduced their in-store sales, but has enhanced and
developed them, so antagonism need not
exist<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:02:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000067">In

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:03:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Rochdale (Simon Danczuk) began it very well by pointing
to the sharp and painful decline of the high street, and by drawing
attention to the importance of the retail sector for the employment of
young people in particular, and for the vibrancy of our communities and
culture. As he said, local high streets are now fighting for their
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000071">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:03:48"></hs_TimeCode>
am pleased to follow
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:03:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Southport (John Pugh), who has reminded us of the obligation on
high streets to reinvent themselves. That is something that they have
done over the ages. In the 1950s, Scunthorpe high street was dominated
by the Co-op. Every store up and down the high street, from the
butcher’s and the baker’s to the carpet maker’s,
was the Co-op. It has since gone through many changes, and now faces
more
challenges<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:04:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000072">The
challenges have been clearly spelled out in this debate. High streets
are operating in the worst recession since the 1930s, with people
understandably not spending money. My hon. Friend the Member for
Rochdale covered the issue of the rigidity of business rates, which,
still set at pre-2008 boom-time levels, act as corsets round the high
street in this time of challenge. The Government should have the
imagination and ingenuity to
respond<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:05:01"></hs_TimeCode> to that.
The predilection for online shopping, which is not going to go away, is
also changing habits on the high street. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:05:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer) said, it is
important to have a level playing field between online retailers and
those on the high
street.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000073">Car
parking is an issue in Scunthorpe in relation to how the high street
manages to compete against out-of-town shopping. Scunthorpe has two
high streets: one in Ashby, which is a small market centre, and the
main one in Scunthorpe itself. Scunthorpe is being challenged by a big
development proposal led by a developer called 
<?notus-xml column=93?>Simons, with an anchor store for Marks &amp; Spencer, which is of course
attractive to the area. There is plenty of space in the town centre
that would be good for a Marks &amp; Spencer store, but we
unfortunately live in a world where the business model is to develop
out-of-town retail. If local people had any purchase on the decision
making, they would encourage Marks &amp; Spencer to come to the area,
but to a town centre retail position.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13052163000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000074">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:06:17"></hs_TimeCode>
Members have said, incentives encourage retailers to go out of town
rather than to the high street, which is part of the challenge that we
face. The Government might reflect on how best to
respond<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:06:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
Planning permission has been agreed for the out-of-town development
that I have mentioned, but the developers now want to alter it to allow
them to have coffee shops on the site as well, which would further
disadvantage the town centre, despite its being made clear in the
original application to the planning committee that that was unlikely.
Retailers feel that the advantage is moving against
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:07:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000075">What
do retailers in Scunthorpe and Ashby say that they need to equalise the
playing field? They say, “Give us two hours’ free car
parking.” That is the key to the equalisation of the playing
field. To be fair to Conservative-controlled North Lincolnshire
council, it has gradually moved on that point. There has been a bit of
kicking and fighting. I produced a 2,000-person petition in favour of
two hours’ free car parking in Scunthorpe and Ashby. Retailers
have made it very clear that they need it to transform their chances of
staying alive through these difficult times. The Scunthorpe town team,
led by Eddie Lodge and colleagues, has done an excellent job in
highlighting its value for the Scunthorpe retailer and shopper, as has
Keep Scunthorpe Alive, which is led by Des Comerford and town-centre
retailers. Two hours’ free car parking is needed to equalise the
playing field through these difficult times. It would be helpful if the
Government came up with a bag of cash, but I suspect that that will not
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000076">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:08:40"></hs_TimeCode>
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:08:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Southport pointed out, council budgets face very difficult
challenges, and North Lincolnshire council is no different, but it has
gradually moved towards creating two hours’ free parking. It is
obvious to anybody who understands the area that if the Parishes
multi-storey car park in the centre of Scunthorpe, which is not heavily
utilised, had two hours’ free car parking throughout the day,
with payment still being on exit, that would transform opportunities.
Perversely,<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:09:39"></hs_TimeCode> the
Conservative-controlled council is flirting with the idea of changing
it to a pay-and-display car park, and having two hours’ free car
parking from about 2 pm, but that would vitiate the dwell time. When
people go into town centres, we want them to spend time there and, if
they bump into my colleague,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:09:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy), to have a coffee with him, without
worrying about getting a ticket on leaving the pay-and-display car
park—unfortunately, we have very vigilant car park attendants.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:09:42"></hs_TimeCode>I am using the
debate to spell out the case for two hours’ free car parking in
the Parishes multi-storey in Scunthorpe. That would be a shot in the

Worst of all, however, is our convenience culture: our innate desire to
take the easy path or the soft option, and that leads us to the
one-stop shop. All of us, in this room and in life, are guilty of
taking that option, but if we do not use our high street, we will

“In Hexham, For Hexham”. It sets out six key objectives
for restoring the town to its former glory. It takes on some of the
good ideas from the Portas review, such as free parking. It looks to
employ town centre managers to co-ordinate everything on behalf of
retailers. It is transforming sites that welcome visitors, such as the

painting the town and planting the town. In those three aspects, there

want to focus particularly on the plans for Mare street and the Narrow
way, but we also have Dalston shopping centre, which is a little tired,
although there are plans to revamp it, and it is a busy, active level B
shopping centre. We have the wonderful Broadway market, which was
improved as a result of residents and retailers joining forces, and it
has very much become a destination 
<?notus-xml column=96?>where people meet up. We also have Victoria park, and estate agents have
dubbed the surrounding area Victoria Park village. The local food
retailers, particularly the Ginger Pig butchers and the local
fishmongers, act as anchor stores, helping to attract shoppers who will
browse in other shops in the area, such as the excellent Victoria Park

is also Chatsworth road, which is still on the turn from being a high
street with many challenges to one where there are now some quite
expensive shops and a nice market with expensive goods. There are still
some of the lower-end, cheaper goods, and there is a challenge to make
sure the local community is served by having affordable, as well as
destination shops. Then there is Well street, which has faced many
challenges, and which still has some way to go, partly because one
local charity owns a lot of the premises, and it has been difficult to
turn them over to new retailers, for reasons I do not have time to go
into. Finally, there is Hoxton Street market, which is very old and
famous. Again, it is being revamped, as part of an attempt to improve
our markets.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman) summed up Hexham in his own way,
and I would sum up Hackney in terms of its three main markets. There is
Broadway market, where it costs about £2.50 for a loaf of bread,
but people have a great time sitting watching the world go by. There is
Ridley Road market, where people can buy traditional fruit and veg, and
where retailers have been known to sell bush meat and cane rat, which
the council clearly clamped down on very quickly. Parts of the Ridley
Road feel very much like a Nigerian market. There is also Hoxton Street
market, where you can get three pairs of knickers for a pound—I
see you are very interested in that, Mr Davies. However, that sums up
the many differences in my constituency, which covers a wide range of
people. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:18:45"></hs_TimeCode>We then
have Kingsland Waste market, which is a sad shadow of its former
itself, although there are plans to improve the markets
generally.</hs_Para>

want to touch particularly on Mare street and the Narrow way. The
council is looking at trying to improve the high street. A recent
survey measured the footfall and conducted face-to-face interviews with
478 individuals. It showed that the area is popular for shopping,
particularly with people who live nearby, but only 5% of those surveyed
planned to meet friends there. That is one of the challenges: this is
not a destination that people go to do things other than their basic
shopping.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13052163000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000097">Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:19:28"></hs_TimeCode>
of the overall strengths and weaknesses highlighted were quite
interesting, and they perhaps sum up the challenges facing high streets
up and down the country. The strengths were that there was an
established local catchment—so people went there because it was
convenient —and great good will and loyalty. It is the main
local centre for more than 140,000 consumers—so friendly, not
frenzy, Mr Davies, is what you get in Hackney shopping streets. There
are many reasons to visit. There are still banks and useful shops.
Buses are a key strength: people can get there easily by public
transport<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:19:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000098">On
the negative side, customer numbers appear to be in decline—not
just in Mare street and the Narrow way; there are few new customers. We
are not getting the destination shoppers we need to increase the
footfall. There is little new development. The shop fronts are tired,
and the area has been left behind for a long time. 
<?notus-xml column=97?>Trading is down, which is a sign of the times for all of us on our high
streets, and the retailers’ offer is limited—particularly
on food and beverages, where provision is particularly poor. The study
by the Retail Group for Hackney council concluded that people need more
reasons to visit, and more trip generators.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13052163000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000099"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:20:31"></hs_TimeCode>What,
then, has the council done to try to improve things? The balance
between the roles of the council and Government, and of retailers, is
interesting. The Manhattan Loft Corporation has been brought in by the
council and is investing significant amounts of money in a fashion
outlet retail centre, close to Mare street and the Narrow way. We have
had a Burberry outlet store for many years. The way to tell a Hackney
councillor was by their smart mac and fold-up Brompton bicycle; but we
now have Aquascutum and Pringle outlet stores recruiting
local unemployed people—so that is a boost to jobs, and there
are great plans for redevelopment there. Anyone who wants cheap,
high-end fashion can come to the new outlet store in Hackney when it is
fully developed. There will be a range of developments in the railway
arches nearby, and they will entice in local designers for pop-up
stores. We are a fashion hub, with some top designers interested in
coming to the
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:21:29"></hs_TimeCode>. That must
all filter through to the old Mare street and the Narrow way, however,
to ensure that there is change.</hs_Para>

have two key pleas to make to the Minister. The first is about bookies
and change of use—and we have the planning Minister here. I am
not against high street bookies, but we have 65 in Hackney and five, I
think, in that one high street, so they are too concentrated, and the
ease of change of use makes it far too easy for them to open next door
to each other. Secondly, we need the Government to think seriously
about business rates. I shall not repeat the points that my colleagues
have made, but it is a big issue. When businesses tell me that they pay
more in business rates than in rent, it is a real issue. No wonder high
streets are

one on which I am passionate, because my parents ran shops, so after
school I often played behind the shop counter. We had wool

shops, which were ultimately wasted on me. I am also the vice-chair of
the all-party groups on town centres and on retail. I am unashamedly a

centre regeneration on the high street is a major issue in Swindon. We
were on the cusp of major regeneration when the 2008 economy crashed,
and the developers, as they did across the country, went out of
business. However, thankfully, the diggers are now in place. We have a
brand new cinema, restaurants and all sorts of regeneration, and it is
a huge relief to the town—a town with 300,000 people within 20
minutes of its town centre and 3 million within an hour. It is no 
<?notus-xml column=98?>coincidence that a £65 million rebuild has just been confirmed
for our Oasis leisure centre, because it is so easy to get to
Swindon.</hs_Para>

have a McArthurGlen outlet village, which is a model of the retail
world. It has been hugely successful and continues to expand at an
incredible rate. That is the basis of some of the points I want to
make: what works so well for the McArthurGlen outlet village is that it
is one centre and one point of contact, so a retailer needs to talk to
only one person—not the local authority, or so-and-so the
landlord. There is one point of contact, with one set of marketing,
employing all the staff and ensuring that customer service is good. If
any of the retailers fail to conform, they are out. That improves the
customer experience. We have the potential, with the proposals for
super-BIDs, to give an organisation such as a BID all the powers in a
town centre, treating it a bit like one big shopping centre, making it
easier for retailers, and consolidating marketing and
promotion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:24:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000104">Several
hon. Members have rightly highlighted the importance of parking.
Probably the biggest disaster under the previous Government was the
obsession with green travel plans, under which councils built on car
parks, hiked up parking charges and forced shoppers to use buses. Buses
have their place but that decimated town centres. Thankfully my local
authority recognised that, and after a 22% fall in footfall in five
years, car parking charges were cut. There was praise for that in the
Mary Portas review. The charge is now £2 for 4 hours,
and, unsurprisingly, there has been an 11% increase in footfall.
Crucially, the dwell time has also increased. Over time, reversing that
policy has meant collecting more income. Flexibility is vital. From a
planning perspective, town centres need to change, so local authorities
must accept—this will be music to the Minister’s
ears—that they need to be absolutely flexible. In Swindon,
whenever developers came along and said, “Look, we want to flip
the town centre on a 5° axis,” the local authority said,
“No problem at all.” That is why we will get major town
centre
regeneration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:25:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000105">Several
hon. Members have highlighted the problem with business rates. I do not
want to repeat arguments, but I know that the British Retail Consortium
has done fantastic research on that, and it is true that something is
terribly wrong when business rates are higher than rent. Landlords are
being flexible and lowering costs. In my constituency I think the cost
has gone from £180 to £140 per square foot; but business
rates are rigid. I know that in theory local authorities can be
flexible, but they do not necessarily have the funding for that. I
propose that either we need a system linked to the rent being paid, so
that if a landlord is flexible, the business rates would be flexible,
or—and this will upset

There should be some form of internet consumer tax, with the revenue

case. It will not be popular with Amazon. I met its chief executive and

want to focus on what local authorities can do, because they can play a
really positive role. Indeed, the local authorities in my
constituency—North Lincolnshire council and East Riding of
Yorkshire council—are currently playing positive roles.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:33:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin) made an excellent speech.
Scunthorpe’s is probably the most challenging high 
<?notus-xml column=101?>street in our area in terms of regeneration, and its difficulties are
much more complex. He said that the local Conservative council was
edging towards free parking, which is slightly disingenuous given that
it was the previous Labour administration that scrapped free parking
and imposed charges across north Lincolnshire. It was the Conservative
council, when it took control in 2011, that scrapped the charges in
Brigg and introduced free parking periods in Scunthorpe, which had
never been done before. The hon. Gentleman did at least acknowledge
that it was the Conservative council that was behind those
measures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:34:33"></hs_TimeCode>. The
introduction of free parking has made a huge difference in Brigg. Talk
to retailers and they will say that the two-hour free-parking period
has had a massive impact on the number of people coming into the town.
In Epworth, the council has worked incredibly hard to provide 40 extra
parking spaces, which was a big boost to its town
centre<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:34:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000121">Councils
need to get a bit smarter about their resources. The council in Brigg
has tied together its vision for the high street with its vision for
tourism, leisure and heritage and has created a new heritage centre.
The library has been moved closer to the town centre, which is now
becoming a hive of activity that people want to visit for a whole range
of reasons. The previous Labour council was going to close the tourist
information centre—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> It was
consulted on. We have not only refurbished it, but have developed that
service even further. There is much that councils can

scheme that should be considered across the country is the creation of
wi-fi hotspots in our town centres, something that North Lincolnshire
council is committed to funding. Across in the East Riding of
Yorkshire, I have managed to get a local company to offer the service
for free in Goole town centre. It is another way of drawing people in
with a USP that says, “This is a modern centre.” Shops
and cafes can also make use of it. They can have a shop front, but they
can also generate online sales and promote themselves that
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000123">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:36:23"></hs_TimeCode>

on free parking and on trying to put services back into our town

Vickers</B> (Cleethorpes) (Con):</Member> It is a great pleasure to
have the opportunity to speak in this debate as the third member of the
north Lincolnshire trio. This debate provides an opportunity for us all
to showcase our high streets, and I will be no exception to that.
First, however, I want to touch on the Portas review, as mentioned by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:37:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Rochdale (Simon Danczuk) and others.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=102?><hs_Para UID="13052163000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000126">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:37:30"></hs_TimeCode>
I have said in previous debates, I do not regard the Portas review as a
panacea for the revival of our high streets. I do not want to pour cold
water on it, but as a former member of a town team for many years, I
can assure hon. Members that virtually every idea in the review has
been discussed, debated and tried not only on the Grimsby town team, on
which I was representing the local authority—like this
Government, it was at the time a successful Conservative-Liberal
Democrat coalition —<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> I take
the applause of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:38:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin). My point is that we cannot just assume that
reducing parking charges, for example, is the absolute answer. I say
that not because I am against it—I would have free parking
wherever possible—but the reality is that we at North East
Lincolnshire council wrestled with how we were going to deal with the
£1 million income that we get from parking charges and set that
against the obvious attractions of trying to provide cheaper or free
parking. As we heard from the other two north Lincolnshire Members,
North Lincolnshire council has come up with a good scheme that
contributes considerably towards that, but it is not the absolute
panacea<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:38:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000127">There
is a danger that such debates can turn into a round of “knock
the supermarkets,” but let us not forget that, as we heard
earlier, supermarkets such as Marks and Spencer and Tesco actually grew
from market stalls. Meeting the demands of the consumer is the key
here. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:39:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Scunthorpe mentioned the Co-op, and I can remember being
dragged down Grimsby’s Freeman street by my mother to the Co-op,
which was an enormous department store in those days. It dominated the
whole shopping centre and was the Tesco of its day. So there has always
been a department
store<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:39:28"></hs_TimeCode>, as it
were, with everything under one roof, but the independent retailers
must be able to compete with that.</hs_Para>

me turn to Cleethorpes, the pre-eminent resort on the east coast. It
has a very successful high street, St Peter’s avenue, which is
only a mile and a half from Tesco’s out-of-town development.
However, having a mix of shops, including independent shops, that meet
consumer demand is the key. Those shops in Cleethorpes are thriving and
successful.</hs_Para>

I close, I have one point to put to the Minister. We all
recognise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:39:55"></hs_TimeCode> that,
with changing consumer patterns, there are too many retail units, or
former retail units, in every high street and every parade of shops in
every town up and down the country. I appreciate that the Government
are doing some things in terms of planning to help with the
reclassification—change of use, and so on—but what is
needed is a scheme to regenerate those properties, to bring them back
into use and to prevent the dereliction that plagues so many of our
high
streets.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_21_PT_1/7FBCB18C81132928193A0F8D2AE7925F3EDFAD2C" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="21 May 2013">Tuesday

had a focus on the high street and I do not blame Mary Portas for being

that was what was in the Government’s mind last week when they
announced changes to use class orders. Members could be forgiven for
not noticing that announcement, because this huge change to our policy
for the high street was sneaked out in a written ministerial statement,
accompanied by regulations that the Government are currently proposing
to put through by use of the negative procedure. However, what these
changes to use classes could do is to allow virtually any class of
commercial premises on our high streets to become any type of shop,
fast food restaurant or shop in the euphemistically called
“financial and professional services” sector, which,
alongside banks and estate agents, includes payday lenders or legal
loan sharks and betting shops.</hs_Para>

that the Minister who is here today has responsibility for, I hope he

struggling high streets need is to make it easier to have more bookies

the rationale for that decision today.</hs_Para>

there are now 20% more payday loan shops and 3.3% more betting shops

out there in any of our communities to have any more of those shops; we
want fewer of them. They are taking the place of independent retailers,
clothes shops and health food shops. There are now more than twice as
many betting shops on British high streets as all the cinemas, bingo
halls, museums, bowling alleys, arcades, galleries and snooker halls
combined. I am sure that the owners of the payday loan companies were
jumping for joy when they learned that this year they could accelerate
the growth of their businesses without even having to ask permission

start-ups<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:48:40"></hs_TimeCode>, which
are hampered—as we know—by the lack of available credit.
Somewhat belatedly, the Chancellor seems to have recognised that, in
that he has set up a new fund to support small and medium-sized
businesses to gain access to credit. However, we also know that the
current use class system allows a change of use for a premises in the A
class from another type of use to use as a shop. So there are already
ample 
<?notus-xml column=105?>opportunities for empty shops to be used in other ways, or for pop-up
shops to be created in empty buildings. The Government should be
encouraging that process, rather than the creation of yet more payday
loan companies.</hs_Para>

authority to all our debates in the House because of his particular
life experience and honest common sense. He is a forensic member of the

can start with some common ground—there may not have been a huge
amount of it, but there is some—which is that the importance of
our high streets is greater than purely economic. They are not simply
businesses; they play a role in our communities as the hub of the
social and cultural life of our
towns<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:50:57"></hs_TimeCode>. It is,
therefore, important for all of us to find ways to help them adjust to

have heard from all hon. Members who participated in the debate a wide
range of stories about many situations, including the fact that people
can buy three pairs of knickers for a pound in Hoxton market—I
shall be taking up that offer soon, though for which purpose we will
not describe now—and that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:51:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman) is cuter than a puppy’s

description<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:51:35"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:51:54"></hs_TimeCode> is
interesting that, despite the variety of communities, economic
circumstances and geographical locations that have been discussed, a
number of common
themes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:51:47"></hs_TimeCode> have
emerged. That is because the changes taking place in our high streets
and town centres are not just a reflection of the recent recession,
devastating though that has been for some businesses, or of particular
Government policies, though those policies over the years have had
positive and negative effects, which I will go into, but are a result
of some dramatic technological and behavioural changes taking place in
society, of which I suspect we have seen only the
beginning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:52:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000149">My
starting proposition to all hon. Members who have taken part in this
debate is that we cannot stand Canute-like and command the waves of
technological and social change to turn back. That has been the
approach of past Labour Governments in response to industrial changes.
That has always been a disaster and has always cost the taxpayer a huge
amount of money, and it has never saved anybody their jobs or their
livelihoods<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:53:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:53:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North Swindon (Justin Tomlinson) spoke about how his
town is exploring interesting approaches to tempt new retailers, with

can the Government control and what can they not control? We need to
mention business rates. The business rates system is simple. A single
amount is raised that is uprated every year by inflation, but by no
more, and the increase in a business rate on one business has to be
matched by the decrease elsewhere on another business, because the
total contribution to the Exchequer is the same and simply increases by
inflation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:54:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000152">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:54:28"></hs_TimeCode>
say to the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:54:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Rochdale that in the five years of the Labour
Government’s last term, the total take from business rates went
up by £4 billion and in the five years of this
Government’s term it has increased by a bit more than £2
billion, so there has not been the swingeing increase in business rates
that he tried to show. In the meantime, we have introduced a doubling
of small business rate relief, which is extended until
2014<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:54:51"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
benefiting a huge number of small retailers. Although business rates
will need to be taken into account with regard to the changes that we
have been talking about—I do not suggest that the business rates
system will not need to change over the medium term—there has
been no shift under this Government that might explain the problems
faced by our high
streets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:55:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000153">Parking
is a slightly more relevant issue, in terms of changes that have
happened. When it is possible for people to buy whatever they need from
their sofa, it needs to be easy and comfortable for them to buy
something from a shop. I detected from the physical movements of
Opposition Members that even they recognised that the last Labour
Government’s policies on parking charges were entirely
counterproductive. In backing a rise in parking charges to try to drive
people out of their cars, they succeeded. People got out of their cars
and got on to their laptops, on their sofas, and bought stuff that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:56:03"></hs_TimeCode>. I am glad
to hear many examples of far-sighted Conservative authorities cutting
parking charges introduced by Labour authorities, thereby benefiting
north Lincolnshire, in Brigg, Scunthorpe and other places, and tempting
people back into town centres. That is a constructive
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:56:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052163000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052163000154">Ultimately,
central Government, and sometimes even local government, cannot pretend
to themselves that they have within their gift the power to conjure a
renaissance in our high streets. This Government believe that all we
can do is try to anticipate what is happening and try to liberate, so
that people can try out new ways of doing business, and back
innovation. Through anticipation we can try to understand how the
technological sea change that is taking place will affect people in
future. My hon. Friend the Minister responsible for this area has set
up the future high streets
forum<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:57:05"></hs_TimeCode> to explore
the longer-term changes—perhaps slightly longer term than those

in this position—and no other Minister can possibly determine
what is the right use for a particular property. I would even go so far
as to suggest that some local authorities are too slow to adapt to
change. They would love, as in France, to declare that particular
premises had to be preserved for ever for a baker or a butcher, but
unfortunately this is not realistic. It does not work and the state of
the French economy is proof enough of that

brings me to the various ways in which this Government are backing
innovation, through the Portas pilots, the town team partners, the high
street innovation fund and the high street renewal awards. All these
measures are helping to back innovative ideas. It is no surprise to
hear, yet again, from Labour Front Benchers that they consider the best
way of measuring the success of a policy to be how quickly public money
has been spent. We do not consider that a measure of success. We
consider it prudent of those Portas pilots that have received grant
from this Government but have not yet convinced themselves that they
have a worthwhile investment to wait until they have worked out
something that they think will make an

is simply not good enough to persist with the approach of the last

people know that the armed services in Britain can recruit from the age

many have never really considered what it means to enlist 16 and
17-year-olds and whether the needs of the military really justify that
position. It strikes me as amazing that in the 21st century we have
16-year-olds deciding to sign up for the UK’s armed

is correct that recruits do not take part in armed conflict until they

commitment to duty is often made when the recruit is 16 years old, with
no obligation proactively to reconfirm their enlistment once adulthood
is reached and they can be deployed. We ask an awful lot of our
recruits. Teenagers are significantly less mature emotionally,
psychologically and socially, and young people from deprived
backgrounds, who form the majority of under-age recruits, are
particularly vulnerable. It can be no coincidence that recruits who
sign up as minors suffer higher rates of alcoholism, self-harm and
suicide than those who enlist as
adults.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052171000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052171000025">Aside<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:08:17"></hs_TimeCode>
from the moral rights and wrongs of tying children to service at a
later date, there is a compelling fiscal case for an all-adult
military. Based on data from the MOD compiled by ForcesWatch, the cost
of recruiting and successfully training those aged 16 to 17-and-a-half
is between 75% and 95% higher than for adults. The longer period of
initial training, at 23 weeks or 50 weeks, is enormous

to the latest report of Child Soldiers International, “One Step
Forward,” the annual saving of increasing the armed services
recruitment age could be up to £94 million, which is enough to
fund more than 24,000 civilian apprenticeships. I doubt the MOD wants
to surrender even more of its budget, so that cash could instead be
used elsewhere to offset the cuts that will see it reduce its regular

do not want to make my case on the basis of cost savings, but I hope
that those who are more motivated by fiscal concerns will see the scope

the Minister’s representative is not convinced by my argument,
or interested in the substantial savings, he may be motivated to make
changes because of their political appeal. In March 2013, ICM asked
respondents what they thought the minimum age should be to join the 
<?notus-xml column=111?>forces. Some 70% of those who expressed an opinion said it should be 18,

also issues of long-term social mobility and employability to consider.
I have no doubt the Minister’s representative will rehearse the
well-worn argument that the Department uses of giving employment and
training opportunities to young people who may otherwise be unemployed.
The fact is, however, that most 16-year-olds are not in the market for
work. In 2009-10, 94% of 16-year-olds stayed on in education. Others
may argue that the armed forces provide for young people who come from
difficult home circumstances, from a background of suffering abuse or
simply because they have been thrown out on the streets. As
I argued during the Armed Forces Bill Committee nearly three years ago,
the armed forces must not be seen as some kind of escape route from
abuse or unemployment. As a nation, we need to develop the support and
services young people need, rather than holding up the armed forces as
an easy option so early in life.</hs_Para>

pleased that the Army continues to set targets for functional skills
qualifications in literacy and numeracy, the case can be made that
young recruits would be much better served by the state education
system in developing those skills. A higher minimum recruitment age

of post-16 education and armed service.</hs_Para>

would be better served by an all-adult military. Is it right that many
soldiers serving in Afghanistan find themselves there due to a decision
they took when they were still children? It is a decision that many
would have reversed in adult life, had they been given the chance. We
should listen to what the United Nations and the Joint Committee on
Human Rights are saying, and join with the overwhelming majority of
nations worldwide, which have stopped recruiting children—that
is what they are: children—and have raised the age to
18 and upwards. We could do it because it would save the
Government money or because it would be popular, according to the
polls, but I hope we do it because it is the right thing to do and so
that we can leave the military to
adults.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_21_PT_1/D4836B193C4508FC4FC6AC6726442B1AAC22BFBE" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="21 May 2013">Tuesday

North (Alex Cunningham) on securing it. I acknowledge his genuine
concern about the recruitment age for armed forces personnel and, in

me begin, however, by reminding the House that there is no compulsory
recruitment into the armed forces. All those under the age of 18 are
volunteers and the Ministry of Defence takes pride in the fact that our
armed forces provide challenging and constructive education, training

Sandhurst until shortly after my 18th birthday—albeit a short
course for the type of commission I was undertaking—I recall my
time in the regular Army while I was a teenager with great pride and a

thought it would be useful for the House if I set out our recruitment

Education and Skills Act 2008 are being progressively introduced
between 2013 and 2015, the minimum statutory school leaving age will
remain at 16. Participation in education or structured training will be
mandatory until 18. In the services, all recruits who enlist as minors
and do not hold full level 3 qualifications are enrolled on an
apprenticeship scheme unless their trade training attracts higher level
qualifications. All undertake structured professional education as part
of their initial military training and therefore automatically fulfil
their duty to participate under the new regulations. No change in

fully recognise the special duty of care that we owe to under-18s, and
commanding officers have had that made clear to them. Our recruiting
policy is absolutely clear. No-one under the age of 18 can join the
armed forces without formal parental consent, which is checked twice
during the application process. In addition, parents and guardians are
positively encouraged to engage with the recruiting staff during the
process. Once accepted into service, under-18s have the right to
automatic discharge as of right at any time until their 18th birthday,
as the hon. Member for Stockton North said. All new recruits who are
under the age of 18 and have completed 28 days’ service have a
right to discharge within their first three to six months of service if
they decide that the armed forces is not a career for them. All service
personnel under the age of 18 have the right to leave the armed forces
before their 18th birthday, following an appropriate cooling-off
period. It is not in the interests of either the individual or the
services to force them to stay where they are not happy.</hs_Para>

not to deploy personnel under the age of 18 on operations. Service
personnel under the age of 18 are not deployed on any operation outside
the UK, except where the operation does not involve them becoming
engaged in or exposed to hostilities. I am aware of instances where
minors have inadvertently entered operations, but on those occasions we
have taken immediate action to correct any breach of policy as soon as
it has been discovered.</hs_Para>

number of armed forces personnel under the age of 18 was 3,130 in
2011-12. The majority of them were in training. That figure breaks down
to 90 in the Navy, 2,930 in the Army and 110 in the Royal Air Force.
There is evidence to suggest that those joining at a younger age remain
in service for longer and that under-18s in the Army achieve higher
performance based on their earlier promotion. For example, when we
looked at the 2001 intake of junior entrants, we found that the number
still serving after six years was 44%, compared with only 33% of those
who joined when they were over the age of 18. For the same intake, 23%
of junior entrants reached the rank of lance-corporal or corporal,
compared with 16% of the standard entry cohort. Figures for other
cohorts reinforce that
picture<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:20:05"></hs_TimeCode>.
Evidence clearly shows that junior entrants are likely to serve longer
and to achieve higher rank than some senior entrants, so the additional
costs incurred in their training reap considerable benefits for the
service, the individual and society as a whole. As the hon. Gentleman
said, that additional cost is recouped because, generally, the
individual remains in service for longer: an additional three years for
the infantry, four years for Royal Engineers, Royal Signals and Army
Air Corps, and 10 years for the Intelligence Corps and the Corps of

am sure that some Members are aware that the services are among the
largest training providers in the UK, with excellent completion and
achievement rates. Armed forces personnel are offered genuine
progression routes, which allow them to develop, gain qualifications 
<?notus-xml column=114?>and play a fuller part in society, whether in the armed forces or in the
civilian world. In the naval service and the Royal Air Force, initial
military training is conducted on single sites and, because of the
smaller scale, no distinction need be made in the training provided to
those under age 18. In the Army, phase 1 training for under-18s, the
basic military training course, is completed at the Army foundation
college, where the facilities have been specifically designed for this
age group. The training courses last either 23 or 49 weeks, both of
which are longer than the basic over-18s course, dependent on the
length of subsequent specialist training. Since junior entrants are
likely to serve longer and achieve higher rank than some senior
entrants, as discussed, the additional costs incurred can reap
long-term

duty-of-care policy for under-18 entrants is laid down in a defence

responsibility for addressing the particular issues that can affect
those under the age of 18. It makes clear that the care and welfare of
under-18s require particular attention by the chain of command. It
refers to the supervisory care directive, through which commanders are
to set out for their environment, based on risk assessments, the
processes that are to apply in caring for the particular vulnerability
of young recruits. Commanders are to ensure that they comply with the
wider legislation, which prohibits under-18s from purchasing or
consuming alcohol, from gambling or from purchasing cigarettes and
tobacco. Commanders are to ensure that they maintain appropriate
contact with parents and guardians, and not only when there is the
possibility that the recruit wishes to leave the service. The policy is

complete the apprenticeship varies according to the programme being
followed, but completion rates are high. There are two levels of
apprenticeship: intermediate, which is equivalent to GCSEs at grades A
to C; or advanced, which is equivalent to A-level. Additionally, while
in service, all armed forces personnel, subject to meeting certain
qualifying criteria, can claim financial support for education under

some recruits leave the armed forces after a relatively short period.
All service leavers, regardless of their length of service, can attend
housing and financial management briefings to assist their transition
to civilian life. In addition, those with less than four years’
service are entitled to advice on the type of state and voluntary and
community sector assistance available to them post-discharge. I am
aware of the criticism made of the support available to armed forces
personnel who decide to leave. In recognition that we can do more for
early service leavers, an enhanced package of resettlement for those
having served less than four years has been trialled. Those trials have
recently ended and the results are being evaluated. The evaluation will
help to decide what resettlement provision for early service

conclusion, it is important to state that under-18s who choose to join
the armed forces are an important and valuable cohort among those
starting their military career. We invest strongly in them and they
repay that investment with longer service and high achievement. The
duty of care for that cohort is paramount, and we are regularly
inspected by Ofsted. Their training and education are clearly first
class, and our policies on under-18s in service are robust and comply
with national and international law. We remain fully committed to
meeting our obligations under the UN convention on the rights of the
child optional protocol on the involvement of children in armed
conflict. The armed forces provide prestigious and respected career
opportunities for young men and women who may not have achieved the
same in civilian life. We shall not deny them that
opportunity.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_21_PT_1/62FB625982767F9650C71B4BEE7B7A404ABE26C1" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="21 May 2013">Tuesday

has an interest in a sustainable fishing industry, which can support
many generations for decades to come, fishermen most of all, because
they require a sustainable industry for their families and themselves
to work in. That applies in particular to fishermen who work in areas
such as Hythe bay, which is operated by the inshore fishing fleet of
boats of less than 10 metres long. They are largely family businesses,
and in Hythe bay we have a number of them along the 20 miles or so of
the shore, in Dungeness, Hythe and Folkestone. Not only do they employ
people directly in the fishing industry—catching in the boats
and at sea—but onshore businesses rely on their work as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052171000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052171000050">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:29:43"></hs_TimeCode>

bay has been fished for thousands of years, probably for as long as men
have been at sea in boats. Hythe and New Romney, both cinque port
towns, have been represented continuously in Parliament since the first
Parliament was called in the 13th century. Fishing is not only an
industry for Hythe bay, but an important part of its culture and
heritage, which is why I and others throughout the constituency who do
not work directly in the fishing industry take the issue incredibly
seriously and are as one in support of the fishermen in their

concerns have been brought about by the proposals published by the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the consultation
on the marine conservation zones and where they are to be established
around the country. A particular concern is that the proposed Hythe bay
marine conservation zone is to be set at a “recover”,
rather than a “maintain” level. The fishermen do not have
any objection to strong environmental standards to maintain the
important habitat in the bay, but they think that that is being done
successfully already. They would be happy with a marine conservation
zone set at a level of “maintain”, but not
“recover”, which suggests that there is a problem at the
moment, and would prevent direct commercial fishing in that area. That
applies not only to commercial fishing, but to fishing by many of the
individuals who sea fish as a pastime, which is popular in Hythe bay
and a source of considerable inbound tourism to the area.</hs_Para>

purpose of the marine conservative zone, as set out as part of the
consultation, is to preserve the spoonworm, which lives in the sand in
Hythe bay. It is very small and many of those who have fished in those
waters all their lives have never seen one, but this is the habitat
that Natural England is seeking to protect and was the object of its
concern in the consultation on marine conservative zones. However,
recent surveys commissioned by the Government show that there has been
a near 100% increase in the local spoonworm population over the past
decade, and that numbers in sand samples have increased from 800 per
square metre to 1,400 per square metre. That suggests a conservation
success story in Hythe bay: the fishermen understand that the delicate
balance of creatures living in the waters is important to the fish and
shellfish they catch, and it is being properly
maintained.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052171000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052171000054">Folkestone
Trawlers showed me the equipment that the fishermen use to fish in
Hythe bay, which is not heavy dredging trawlers and nets. The
relatively small boats use light nets that skim across the surface.
They have no interest in churning up the sea bed. The association
pointed out that movement of the sea bed is perfectly natural. This
area of water in the English channel was heavily defended during the
first and second world wars and it is not unusual, particularly during
storms at sea, for ordinance or even old mines from those wars to come
up to the surface undetected because of the natural movement of the sea
bed. There seems to be little evidence at the moment that disturbance
of the spoonworm, which Natural England is seeking to protect, should
give rise to
concern.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052171000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052171000055">A
second concern that is incredibly important to the geography of Hythe
bay, which is the coast that guards Romney marshes, is that a large
area of the marshes is below sea level. They are important for sea and
coastal defences. Some are maintained by major sea walls, such as that
at Dungeness, but many are maintained by management of the high water
mark shore, which is largely shingle. The shingle banks are moved and
replenished as part of the natural work of sea defence that the
Environment Agency conducts throughout the

is proposed that the landward boundary of the marine conservation zone
being set at the high water mark would be within the area that needs to
be maintained, and is considered to be part of the one-in-200-years
risk that is maintained along that part of the coast. It could mean
that special licences are required for that basic work of rebuilding
the shingle sea defences along that part of the coast, or even that
that work could be prohibited. If so, new flood defences would be
required at perhaps much greater cost to the Environment Agency or the
Government or, worse, homes that are currently protected by the work
may be in jeopardy. Clearly, that would not be acceptable to residents

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:41:11"></hs_TimeCode>people generally
agree that it is important to protect our seas.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:41:14"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Folkestone and Hythe was discussing the importance of
his fishing community. My own fishing community has been part of
aspects of the Greenpeace and the Fish Fight campaign about protecting
diversity. However, in my constituency, there has been local uproar in
Aldeburgh, Orford and surrounding areas about the potential designation
of the Alde and Ore estuary. That, again, as my hon. Friend referred
to, is based on flawed evidence.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13052171000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052171000079">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:42:06"></hs_TimeCode>
are different examples—the Alde and Ore has three or four
characteristics, one of which relates to smelt. However, there has only
been one sighting of smelt in eight surveys over five years, and partly
that is because it is not a freshwater river. Smelt is normally found
in those areas, and although local fishermen have seen it once, that
was deemed to be because it was chasing its food stock. The issue of
being a rocky habitat beggars belief locally. It is believed that the
rocky habitat now deemed so special was ballast tossed off barges about
40 years ago—they are, literally, big circular discs. There is
astonishment that that can now be treated as something special on which
to curtail activity. In terms of muddy gravels, no evidence has been
supplied. More work is going on in that area.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13052171000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052171000080">With all that
is happening, the Marine Management Organisation is getting in on the
act and causing quite a lot of concern for local
activities—whether it is painting the lines for racing, or
repairing a patch on the slipway. We were promised by DEFRA—and
the Department has delivered—that some deregulation would be
undertaken by the MMO, but not if the area is in a designated MCZ. Some
small activities are being hampered or cost a lot of money to fulfil. I
also refer to the larger one in the Stour and Orwell
estuaries.</hs_Para>

is no doubt that my constituency—about 40% is designated as
areas of outstanding natural beauty—has almost any designation
that we can think of. There are Ramsar sites and special protection
areas, and all those 
<?notus-xml column=121?>different things. The port of Felixstowe has been able to work alongside
precious habitat nearby to ensure that that is preserved. At the same
time, while trying to continue as a commercial port, the marine
conservation zone suggested for the area throws blanket coverage over
the entire estuary, which is causing great consternation among the
Harwich Haven Authority and the port about future activity. At the
moment, certain areas where there is special designation are protected,
and that should be respected, but I am very concerned that some
unintended consequences of what is notably a good policy—trying
to restore and conserve parts of our seas—may cause big problems
for my constituents and their businesses in
future.</hs_Para>

the interests of his constituents and their economic future, and the
need for effective ecological support. I understand that. I am also
well aware of the concerns that are being expressed in relation to the
proposed site at Hythe bay and the “recover” conservation
objective. An official from my Department attended a local meeting
during the consultation to hear those concerns. Officials are currently
reviewing the responses to the consultation, including considering
evidence provided, and we will respond to the consultation in the

me go back to the overall picture. The four regional stakeholder
projects did some very good work to provide an initial list of
proposals. We do not think it appropriate to designate all 127 site
recommendations straight away, because of weaknesses in the evidence 
<?notus-xml column=123?>base for many of the sites noted by the DEFRA-appointed science advisory
panel in its review of the recommendations. However, we have since
committed additional resources to plugging those gaps and, in the
consultation, we proposed pressing ahead with the first 31 sites that
we considered suitable for
designation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:50:56"></hs_TimeCode>.

are aware of the concerns that some people have raised about evidence
standards. Adequate evidence is vital. Without it, it is impossible to
define the management measures necessary and take effective
conservation action. We want to see that happen quickly after
designation. There will be no prospect of securing agreement from other
member states to regulate the activities of their fishermen where this
is required in waters beyond our 6-mile limits. We would also lack a
proper justification for the regulatory burden placed on business or
the enforcement and monitoring costs that fall on the taxpayer. That is
why the evidence is
essential<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:51:43"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:52:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052171000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/halltext/130521h0002.htm#13052171000097">The
impact assessment that accompanied the consultation gave an indication
of the costs and benefits of possible management measures for all the
sites and provided a good indication of what might be expected. The
management measures noted in the impact assessment were provided for
illustrative purposes and to allow for the calculation of a range of
potential cost implications for each site. Consultees were invited to
comment on those in responding to the consultation and provide
additional information to facilitate a better understanding of the
possible implications of site designation and to help to refine
associated costs. Management measures were not being consulted on at
that stage. When an MCZ is designated, that does not automatically mean
that economic or recreational activities on that site will be
restricted. Restrictions on an activity will depend on the sensitivity
of the species and habitats for which a site is designated to the
activities taking place in that area and on the conservation objectives
for those

do the reverse—that we should up the level of designation until

sensitive to the information that we receive from the hon.
Gentleman’s local fishermen, among others, who will have a deep
interest in and knowledge of the seas with which they are familiar. We
need to look at that, along with all the scientific evidence, and then
make a subsequent assessment of how to manage the site. That will be

review has examined all current guidance material and has recommended
rationalising advice and making it easier to use. Existing guidance is
unwieldy in its current form and the review has recommended that it be
shorter but retain key elements, and be more accessible to be useful to
everyone using the planning
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13052150000248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/wmstext/130521m0001.htm#13052150000248">We
accept that the existing guidance suite needs reform and consolidation.
In the light of the positive response to this consultation, we are
carefully considering the implementation of the review group’s
recommendations. As set out in the Budget, we will publish
significantly reduced planning guidance, providing much needed
simplicity and clarity in line with Lord Taylor’s
recommendations. We accept the majority of the report’s
recommendations, with the exception of those on signposting best
practice material produced by the sector and the immediate cancellation
of out-of-date
guidance.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13052150000249" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/wmstext/130521m0001.htm#13052150000249">The

for sport in this country for people in every community. I would like
to update the House on progress with the delivery of the
Government’s 10-point sports legacy action plan (my statement of

games maker database to Sport England working in partnership with UK
Sport and London Partners and Join In. The consortium partners are now
reaching out to the 5.3 million people currently on the database, with
information about volunteering opportunities across the UK. This
includes advice on how to volunteer at major sporting events such as
the international cricket champions trophy in June and the rugby league
world cup in November to ensure that we build on the success of the
London 2012 games makers at future
events.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13052150000251" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/wmstext/130521m0001.htm#13052150000251">On

that might be expected to occur naturally. The analysis concludes that
when broken down by the mothers’ country of birth, no group is
statistically different from the range that we would expect to see
naturally occurring. However, there are significant limitations in what
these data can show. As there are small numbers of births for most
groups, large differences in birth rates would be needed to identify
ratios outside the normal
range.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13052150000302" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/wmstext/130521m0001.htm#13052150000302">The

suggests that a number of factors can influence the sex of a child.
These include paternal and maternal age, coital rates, number of
children and sex of previous children. However, ratios above 108 and
below 103 are unlikely to occur naturally other than as a product of
the random variability associated with small numbers of
births.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13052150000304" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/wmstext/130521m0001.htm#13052150000304">Recorded
birth ratios vary widely by mothers’ country of birth. Initial
analysis identified a small number of countries for which there were
indications that birth ratios may differ from the UK as a whole and
potentially

possible that this was the product of natural variation and that

further analysis was quality assured by the methodology team at the
Office for National Statistics and identified 10 countries which over
the period 2007 to 2011 had over 10,000 births and recorded gender
ratios either lower than 103 (seven countries) or higher than 108
(three countries). However, the tests undertaken indicate a strong
probability that this is occurring by chance. Only one country, Sri
Lanka, was found to have a birth ratio significantly different from the
figure of 105.1 for the UK as a whole. Mothers born in Sri Lanka have a
birth ratio of 99.2 or 99 male children for every 100 female children.
However, this is not statistically significantly lower than the 103
threshold and again is likely to be the result of random variation,

the OFT. They are taking strong action against the leading 50 payday
lenders after uncovering evidence of widespread irresponsible lending.

Webb:</Member></B> Occupational pension schemes that were contracted
out of the state additional pension on a defined benefit (DB) basis
between 1978 and 1997 are required to provide a scheme pension. That
pension, as a minimum, must be a pension broadly equivalent to the
state earnings-related pension scheme (SERPS), so should not leave
those people worse off in retirement as a result of being contracted
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052197000635" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/text/130521w0002.htm#13052197000635">The
requirements for contracting out on a DB basis were changed in April
1997, and schemes now have to satisfy an overall test, which was
designed broadly to match the 1997 value of the state earning-related
pension scheme (SERPS). This meant that the scheme pension must be
broadly equivalent to or better than a pension based on 1/80th x
average earnings in the last three years x years of service with a
normal pension age of 65. From 1997, no state additional pension was
earned if a person contracted out on a DB basis. But when the second
state pension (S2P) was introduced in 2002, it became possible for a
low to moderate earner to earn some state additional pension. Again,
those who contracted out on a DB basis after 1997 should not be worse
off in retirement as a result of doing so. Contracting out will cease
for DB in
2016.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052197000636" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/text/130521w0002.htm#13052197000636">Under
contracting out on a defined contribution basis, which was abolished in
April 2012, the contracting-out rebate rates (the reduction in the
amount of national insurance paid by the individual and an age-related
rebate paid to the scheme at the end of the tax year) were recommended
and set based on the Government Actuary's best estimates about the
expected cost of replacing the state additional pension given up
through contracting-out. There was always a known risk that the reality
would turn out to be different from the assumptions, and individuals
chose to enter these terms on a voluntary basis accepting that risk.

pension to take account of any worse than expected investment

maintained flood defence assets, protecting high consequence systems,

help protect approximately 50% of the agricultural land in England that
is at risk of flooding from main rivers and the sea, including the vast
majority of the most productive Grade 1 and 2 land. The other 50% of
agricultural land at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea is
protected by defences in what the EA describe as low and medium
consequence systems, where more than 95% of agency-managed assets are

Heath:</Member></B> The Government believes that food production must
remain the primary goal of agriculture and the production of biofuel
must not undermine food security, in the UK or internationally.
Modelling analysis published as part of the Bioenergy Strategy suggests
that increased EU demand for biofuels has led to global crop prices
being around 3% to 5% higher than they would otherwise have been and
that this would correspond to only a modest rise in food prices, since
crops represent a small share of the cost of food production. As set
out in that strategy, it is nevertheless essential that we continue to
monitor the volume and all types of bioenergy demand and their links
with food prices and production. To this end, we will continue to work
with the European Commission in its ongoing evaluation of the economic,
social and environmental impacts of the EU’s biofuels
policies.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13052197000098" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/text/130521w0002.htm#13052197000098">Bovine

Benyon:</Member></B> The potential impact of flooding on agricultural
production is already used by the Environment Agency when planning
flood protection work. The case for maintaining or improving defences
of agricultural land is assessed in a similar way to other assets,
based on potential damages avoided to agricultural land, crops and
productivity, together with impacts on infrastructure and other assets
which play a role in growing food and making it available to consumers.
DEFRA's policy statement on the appraisal of flood and erosion risk
management underlines the need to value agricultural land and the
damages that could be caused by flooding and erosion. DEFRA provided
specific guidance in 2008 based on HM Treasury Green Book appraisal
principles.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052197000930" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/text/130521w0002.htm#13052197000930">Agriculture
continues to be a major beneficiary of the Environment Agency's flood
risk management work. Capital projects completed during 2011-12
provided an improved standard of flood protection for more than 74,000

maintenance programme also continues to provide substantial benefits

high consequence systems are in the required target condition. These
systems help protect approximately 50% of the agricultural land in
England that is at risk of flooding from main rivers and the sea,

Estimated average annual damages avoided to agriculture in these areas
is £73 million. The other 50% of agricultural land at risk of
flooding from rivers and the sea is protected by defences in what the
Environment Agency describes as low and medium consequence systems,

Benyon:</Member></B> We are aware of the Consumer Goods Forum's
commitment to start phasing out the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in
new refrigeration equipment from 2015. It is encouraging to hear that
large consumer goods manufacturers and retailers are taking steps to
address their .use of HFC refrigerants and are looking for ways to
introduce alternative systems to replace HFCs. Officials have met with
members of the Consumer Goods Forum to discuss the initiative and
understand more about the strategies they are adopting to achieve their
objectives. We believe this is a useful example of how voluntary
agreements can help deliver a reduction in HFC use in certain
refrigeration
systems.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13052197000112" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/text/130521w0002.htm#13052197000112">Slaughterhouses:

stunned before slaughter but recognises the right of members of
religious communities to eat meat prepared in accordance with their
religious beliefs. The Government has therefore confirmed that it does
not intend to ban religious slaughter without stunning at this stage.
Nonetheless, it intends to continue discussions on possible further
improvements in animal welfare with members of the Jewish and Muslim
communities once the new EU Regulation 1099/2009 on the protection of
animals at the time of killing has been implemented.</hs_Para>

Vaizey:</Member></B> We recognise the importance of removing the
barriers deaf people face in accessing services. The Equality Act 2010
provides the protection which ensures disabled people can access goods,
facilities and services, by requiring those with duties under the Act,
including Government Departments, to make a reasonable adjustment so
that their services and functions are accessible. For example,
installing perimeter loops in museum
galleries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052197001202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/text/130521w0002.htm#13052197001202">We
also recognise that technology has a vital role to play in assisting
disabled people to access information, advice and services especially
as public services increasingly go online. That is why DCMS is
encouraging organisations to explore how they can meet the needs of BSL
customers, through developing a mix of accessible contact strategies
for their disabled and older customers via e-mail, SMS, instant
messenger, text relay and Video Relay Services (VRS). This will assist
many people who are deaf and hearing
impaired.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13052197001203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130521/text/130521w0002.htm#13052197001203">More
generally, the cross-Government strategy 'Fulfilling Potential' aims to

of prisoners who have access to television, games consoles or newspaper

announced changes to the incentives and earned privileges (IEP) scheme,
under which prisoners earn access to privileges, including TV, games
consoles and newspapers. The changes, which will come into effect from
1 November 2013, will ensure that prisoners will now have to actively
contribute to their own rehabilitation, help others and continue to
behave well to earn privileges. Prisoners who refuse to work or engage
in their own rehabilitation will not earn privileges. The revised IEP
system will support what this Government is seeking to achieve in
improving rehabilitation and reducing reoffending.</hs_Para>

in-cell television is available to prisoners at the standard and
enhanced levels of the scheme. In addition, television can be provided
in other circumstances, such as within health care facilities or for
those at risk of self-harm if judged to be appropriate. In both public

self-financing; the money comes from payments made by
prisoners.</hs_Para>

games consoles is restricted to prisoners who are on the enhanced level
of the IEP scheme. Each prison will have decided locally whether or not
to offer access to games consoles as part of the local IEP scheme. All
games consoles are purchased at prisoners’ own expense and no
public funds must be used to purchase games consoles and equipment. 18
rated games are not permitted for any prisoner, no matter what their
age is. Individual access to games consoles in the young people's
estate is only available to those on the enhanced level of the rewards
and sanctions scheme which operates in the same way as the IEP scheme
in adult prisons. Young people may also access games consoles in
communal areas. They are only permitted to purchase computer games and
a games console for their own use and from a pre-determined list of
approved consoles.</hs_Para>

federations and their composition. Since September 2009 there has been
a duty to inform the Department of the establishment of a formal or

it includes neither federations established prior to September 2009 nor
less formal federations that have been established under section 26 of
