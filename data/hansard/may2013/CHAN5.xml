housing, but I note that during Labour’s 13 years in office the
amount of social housing fell by 421,000. This Government’s
policies will increase the amount of social housing by 200,000—a
record on which she should compliment us. On the mortgage indemnity
guarantee, offering support to many households who cannot afford the
large deposits now required is a thoroughly good thing, and by

completions are 19% above the trough of 2010, numbers of housing starts
are 58% above the trough of 2009, and she should welcome that
improvement. In the Budget, we announced a £5 billion package to
help the construction sector through the Help to Buy shared equity
scheme, which will support the construction of 76,000 properties, as
well as a massive expansion of the Build to Rent programme. It is

in transport infrastructure in this Parliament than his Government

term in government, when he saw unemployment in his constituency rise
substantially, with youth unemployment going up by more than 100%. He
will know that paid work is the best way to raise earnings. As I said
earlier, this Government have helped to create 1.25 million jobs over
the last three years—more jobs in the private sector than at any

have come through the personal allowance are for the lowest

I would like to pay tribute to Corporal William Thomas Savage and
Fusilier Samuel Flint, both from 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of
Scotland, and Private Robert Murray Hetherington, a reservist from 7th
Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, who were tragically killed in
action in Afghanistan on 30 April when their Mastiff vehicle
was struck by an improvised explosive device on route 611. Their deaths
are a stark reminder of the continued dangers our soldiers, sailors,
airmen and marines face as they manage the transition of security
responsibility to the Afghan national security forces. My thoughts are
with their families and loved ones as they come to terms
with their
loss.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051438000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0001.htm#13051438000007">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T12:34:45"></hs_TimeCode>
security in Helmand is steadily improving, with Afghan forces already
responsible for the bulk of the province, the environment in which our
troops operate remains dangerous. IEDs remain one of the greatest
threats and present risks even to the very best-protected vehicles
available, of which Mastiff is one.</hs_Para>

the House will be aware, at the height of operations we had around
9,500 military personnel in Afghanistan. Our troop numbers will be at
7,900 by the end of this month and, as the Prime Minister announced
last December, they will reduce further to around 5,200 by the end of
this year. This is a clear reflection of the international security
assistance force campaign drawing to a close and the Afghan national
security forces taking on increasing responsibility for their own
security. Already the ANSF lead 80% of all security operations,
covering nearly 90% of the Afghan population. By the summer, that
figure will reach 100%. So after more than a decade in which fighting
the insurgency has been a primary focus of the ISAF coalition, the
campaign  is changing and the UK’s military role in
Afghanistan is evolving from combat to one of training, advising and
assisting the Afghans; and, as the Prime Minister has made clear, UK
forces will no longer be in a combat role by the end of
2014.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051438000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0001.htm#13051438000009">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T12:36:18"></hs_TimeCode>
the light of this, and of the changing nature of the operation, we have
looked at how we can best deploy what will be declining numbers of
troops and smaller amounts of equipment between now and then to deliver
the best possible protection to our people while continuing to provide
the Afghans with the support they need during this critical transition
period. Brigades deploying to Afghanistan on Operation Herrick have
routinely done so on a six-monthly cycle, with a relief-in-place
occurring in spring and autumn each year. The phased nature of the
rotation and the overlap of deploying and redeploying forces has meant
individual tours of between six months and six and a half months for
the vast majority of personnel. That pattern of rotation has worked
well for the enduring deployment, but is judged not to be sustainable
during the final months of the draw-down period.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T12:37:18"></hs_TimeCode> Army has
therefore decided that the brigade deploying in October on Herrick 19
will deploy for eight months from October this year until June 2014.
The subsequent brigade, Herrick 20, 
<?notus-xml column=500?>will deploy for six months from June 2014 to December 2014 when the ISAF
campaign concludes, but the deployment could extend to up to nine
months for a relatively small number of individuals who may be needed
to support final redeployment activity post-December
2014.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051438000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0001.htm#13051438000010">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T12:37:54"></hs_TimeCode>
rationale for this decision is clear and is based on advice from
military commanders. First, it will better align the final tours with
key milestones in the transition process such as the Afghan
presidential elections in spring 2014. Secondly, it will help to
maintain continuity in posts where we work closely with our Afghan
partners at a time when retaining and bolstering Afghan confidence is
critical, both for mission success and to ensure our own force
protection. Thirdly, it removes the need to train and deploy another
brigade at greatly reduced scale to cover the final couple of months of
2014. It will therefore minimise the total number of service personnel
who deploy to Afghanistan over the next 18 months. That will allow
personnel to focus on post-Afghanistan training, improving the general
readiness of the Army as it reverts to a contingent posture for the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051438000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0001.htm#13051438000011">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T12:38:52"></hs_TimeCode>
Chief of the Defence Staff and I believe that extending Op Herrick 19
to eight months and allowing the possibility of some personnel on Op
Herrick 20 deploying for up to nine months is the most effective way of
maintaining force protection, meeting our commitment to the NATO ISAF
mission, and supporting the Afghans until the end of 2014. Of course,
as we have already made clear, the UK’s commitment as part of
the international community’s assistance to Afghanistan will
continue well into the future, beyond 2014, in terms of significant
investment in development assistance and support to the ANSF, as well
as UK-led military
training.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051438000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0001.htm#13051438000012"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T12:39:38"></hs_TimeCode>The
changed pattern of brigade rotations does not mean that all those
deploying will do so for a longer time. I should emphasise
to the House that, because of the expected steady reduction in numbers
during Herrick 19 and 20, we expect that most personnel will
continue to serve no longer than the standard six or
six-and-a-half-month tour, while significant numbers will serve less
than six months. At the same time, the amended tour rotations mean that
some personnel will deploy for up to eight months, with a much smaller
number potentially deploying for up to nine months. At this stage it is
not possible to be precise about the total numbers of personnel who
will be affected, although current estimates suggest that between 2,200
and 3,700 overall may deploy for more than six and a half
months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T12:40:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051438000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0001.htm#13051438000013">We
have considered carefully how best to compensate affected personnel who
serve extended tours and face increased uncertainty about their pattern
of deployment and relatively more austere conditions which may be
expected towards the end of the Herrick campaign as the redeployment of
assets continues. Her Majesty’s Treasury has agreed the
recommendation of the defence chiefs that a bespoke allowance should be
paid to eligible personnel who serve more than seven and a half months
in Afghanistan from September 2013. This Herrick draw-down allowance
will be paid at the rate of £50 per day before tax and is
payable on top of the standard operational allowance package. The new
allowance will not apply to those personnel in the small number of
established longer-term posts who are already compensated by the
campaign continuity
allowance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T12:41:33"></hs_TimeCode>.
Service personnel  
<?notus-xml column=501?>who may serve longer terms and who may therefore be eligible for the new
allowance have already been notified by their commanding
officers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T12:41:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051438000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0001.htm#13051438000014">As
I said at the beginning of this statement, the campaign and the
UK’s military role in Afghanistan are changing. During this
period, it is critical that we retain the ability properly to protect
our forces, as well as to maintain the confidence of the Afghans as our
combat operations draw to a close and they take on full security
responsibility. The number of UK forces in Afghanistan may be reducing,
but they still have a vital job to do, and this initiative is the most
effective way for them to do it successfully, while remaining as safe
as possible. I commend the statement to the

the longer period of duty, the uncertainty and the austerity that may
exist in the final part of the Herrick campaign. Normal allowances will
be payable throughout the deployment. The Herrick draw-down allowance
is an additional allowance payable from the seven-and-a-half-month

who voted against the operation but those who fully supported it are
pleased that we are now drawing down and bringing our combat commitment
to an end. He is absolutely right that the draw-down period is a
critical phase of the operation with its own risks. One reason for the
decision to change the rotation pattern is the importance of
maintaining relationships with key Afghans as we have fewer of those
relationships. Historically, we have been mentoring and partnering at
battalion and company level, but we will not be doing that any more, so
we will have fewer relationships with the Afghans. It is important for
our own force protection and situational awareness that we maintain and
build those relationships.</hs_Para>

Members, from a sedentary position, say that the number of those facing
fuel poverty is going up. Indeed, with global gas prices going up we
have a challenge to keep bearing down on fuel poverty, but we are
completely committed to doing that. Later this year we will produce a
fuel poverty strategy, the first to be produced for more than a dozen
years. One reason why he can quote the Hills review is that the
Government commissioned that review to look into the exact nature of
fuel poverty to ensure that it is being measured correctly. It shows
that the previous Government could not even measure fuel poverty
correctly. We will ensure that we measure it correctly, so that our
policies can be targeted far more effectively to help the fuel poor.
Opposition Members are not the only people in this House who are
compassionate about the fuel poor.</hs_Para>

two parts: it tries to measure overall fuel poverty in terms of energy
efficiency; and, most importantly—it

If we consider not just fuel poverty statistics, but income poverty
statistics too, we should be most concerned about those in poverty year
in, year out—the grinding fuel and income poverty. Unless we
have measures that show what is happening to deep fuel poverty and

provides incentives and signals to the markets for investment in low

the EU. I regret that the vote in the European Parliament on the

the reform of the EU ETS. We need to do a lot better. I hope that the

us take a closer look at the real lives of hard-working Britain. On
energy bills, the facts speak for themselves. In just three years,
bills have risen by more than £300, and, despite falling between
1997 and 2010, fuel poverty 
<?notus-xml column=520?>is now increasing sharply. There has been a doubling in the number of
pensioners dying from hypothermia compared with five years ago. What
have the Government done about it? The Secretary of State mentioned the
energy company obligation, the ECO. But less than half the budget of
that will go to people in fuel poverty. He has tried to claim credit
for the warm home discount, but he will not want to talk about the
hundreds of thousands of low-income families with children that are
missing out on help. He mentions the green deal, which is going so well
that the Government still will not tell us how many people have taken
out a package.</hs_Para>

tariffs the energy companies are allowed to offer will be limited and
that those tariffs may have to be standardised, and that customers will
have to be provided with more information about cheaper deals. If the
Secretary of State disagrees, I am more than happy to let him intervene
to tell us that all energy companies will be required by law—as
the Prime Minister promised—to put everyone on the cheapest

the costs of energy for Britain’s households is very important,
but the Government have introduced an energy market reform Bill that
does nothing to reform the energy market. They have cut winter fuel

to the cold weather and most at risk of fuel poverty, are among the
least likely to be able to access the cheapest online deals or to
switch supplier. We would put that right and put all those over 75 on
the cheapest tariff for their gas and electricity. If we did that, as
many as 4 million pensioners—including nearly 8,000
in the Secretary of State’s own constituency—could save
as much as £200 a year off their bills.

hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker), might like to
listen, as I am offering him this policy to put in the Energy Bill. The

also want everyone to benefit from a competitive and more responsible
energy market. That means wholesale reform of the way in which energy
is bought and sold. At the moment, no one really knows what the true
cost of energy is. If energy companies were forced to sell the power
they generate into an open and transparent pool, anyone could bid to
retail energy.</hs_Para>

not stop with energy prices. Let us look at another basic need on which
every household relies; water. Ofwat estimates that some 2.2 million
households—one in 10—spend more than 5 per cent of their
income on water and sewage. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield
(Mary Creagh) has pointed out, despite Labour’s legislation,
which allowed for new social tariffs to help people squeezed by rising
water bills, the Government have washed their hands of any
responsibility and are leaving it to water companies to decide whether
to introduce social tariffs. We think that that is a responsibility

of our other proposals is to deal with Ofgem. When Ofgem removed price
controls a decade ago, it did so in the belief that competition had
developed sufficiently and that privatisation had delivered a
functioning competitive market. I believe it is clear now that that was
a mistake. We need to create a tough new regulator that people can
trust and ensure that the regulator has the power it needs to protect
consumers. That is why we would abolish Ofgem and create a tough new
regulator with a statutory duty to monitor the relationship between the
prices that energy companies pay for their energy and the bills the
public pay and the power to force them to cut prices when wholesale
costs fall. We believe that that is very
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051440000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0002.htm#13051440000052"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Davey" PimsId="2851" UID="13051440000493" xid="154" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0002.htm#13051440000493">Mr

On my local line—the east coast line—the operator has
done a remarkable job. Unlike some of the other operators, it has paid
premium payments back into the Government’s coffers to spend on

rising cost of global energy that has had such a huge knock-on effect
on household bills, not least the cost of travel to work. I therefore
wish to speak about the proposed investment in high-speed rail, which
will run through my constituency. We will get both the pain and the
gain, as the first stop outside London will be Birmingham
International, just 38 minutes from Euston. High Speed 2 throws a
lifeline to the west midlands, which has been held back by a lack of
transport investment down the years.</hs_Para>

behind high-speed rail is the lack of capacity on the existing
railways. There is already a lack of capacity, which is why freight has
had to be moved off the west coast main line, on to the Chiltern line
or the congested west midlands road network. That lack of capacity
means that I frequently have to stand when travelling at peak times to
and from my constituency. Indeed, the right hon. Member for Birmingham,
Hodge Hill (Mr Byrne) teased me as I read the contents of my red box
standing up when I was a Minister, but I reminded him about his note to
the effect that there was “no money left” for us when we

Opposition claim that the Queen’s Speech does nothing to tackle
rail fares, but we are about to make a huge investment in rail
infrastructure that will create jobs and growth. Without that extra
capacity, the fundamental tool to meet rising demand will not exist.
With a renaissance in west midlands manufacturing and the success of
companies such as Jaguar Land Rover, demand for rail will only
increase, so we must have a transport network to match the needs of the
21st century as we compete in the global race for
jobs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051440000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0002.htm#13051440000078"><Member ContinuationText="Jake Berry" PimsId="5576" UID="13051440000510" xid="1147" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0002.htm#13051440000510"><B>Jake

home up the M40, I frequently see transporter loads of newly made cars
from Solihull, representing our export-led recovery, but would it not
be so much better if there was capacity on our railways to take that
freight straight to Southampton for export? Frequently, the motorway
link between the M42, the M40 and the M6 is heavily congested, even
with the innovative active traffic management system. There are
strategic assets along the length of the M42—the Blythe and
Birmingham business parks, Birmingham airport and the national
exhibition centre—but what we need is connectivity. The evidence
from France is that the towns that really benefited from high-speed
rail were those that managed to put such connectivity in place,

optimise the under-utilised runway capacity at Birmingham airport,
which would make the travel time competitive with London’s
airports. The runway at Birmingham is being extended to accommodate
long-haul traffic, which reflects the preferred destinations in the
Indian subcontinent of west midlands manufacturers and exporters and,
of course, those of the region’s residents, many of whom have
their origins there.</hs_Para>

outline the potential gains of HS2 without touching on the real pain
suffered by my constituents whose homes will be blighted by the route.
Properties have lost approximately 20% of their value. I say
“approximately” because it is actually hard to sell a
property at all, given the level of uncertainty. There is  a
hardship fund, and I have helped many constituents to apply to it, but
very few have received help. The blight compensation is to be
calculated on a set distance from the rails, which can be harsh on
those who are just beyond the eligible
distance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T14:09:51"></hs_TimeCode>. This
is why I introduced a ten-minute rule Bill calling for the use of noise
contours, which might more accurately reflect noise nuisance.

paving Bill proposed in the Queen’s Speech will contain
significant improvements to the compensation package.</hs_Para>

urge the Government to look again at a property bond scheme of the type
proposed by Birmingham airport when a second runway was on the cards. A
property bond would enable people blighted by HS2 to move on with their
lives. The evidence from HS1 is that, if the Government were to buy up
their property today, most of it would not lose value once construction
was completed and the perceived blight had lifted. There might even be
an uplift in value from the proximity to an improved transport network.
I urge the Government to continue their efforts to improve and mitigate
the impact of HS2.

House would expect me, as a former Environment Secretary, to give
consideration to the environmental impact of HS2, and of course there
will be a loss of green space, but it is also possible to do something
really beneficial to the environment through biodiversity offsetting.
During my time at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs, we introduced a tool that allowed us to calculate what had to
be done to compensate for the loss of nature where development
occurred. With such credits, a big scheme for the restoration of the
environment can be achieved either near to or where the loss occurs.
For example, the university of Birmingham, in conjunction with the
engineers Arup, has come up with a proposal to restore the Tame river
valley, which was badly polluted by the industrial heritage of the west
midlands. Biodiversity offsetting was one of the key tools in the
natural environment White Paper, and the HS2 project provides a good

have larger premises that they can no longer manage. But we will not
move them, will we? We will not tax winter fuel or assumed benefits for
older people because older people vote in very much greater numbers
than younger people. My message today is that
politics—democratic politics—can be our solution and that
people should engage with it as citizens in their community. They
should engage with it through voting, but they should not be misled by

there, but in my view his resistance is well founded. The objections
are many, including the emergence of Islamist Jabhat al-Nusra as an
increasingly influential part of the rebel forces, which raises the
question of who would inherit any arms that we might deliver. The risk
of a proxy war between the United States and Russia is another example,

military action in other theatres, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, and I
even supported such action—albeit with considerable
reluctance—in the case of Libya, given Gaddafi’s explicit
threat to the citizens of Benghazi. We must, however, consider two
aspects when thinking about undertaking military intervention. One is
the humanitarian consideration, but the other is the question of who
will take over if that military intervention is successful. What
concerns me is the possibility that the people who take over will
become dominated by a group allied to al-Qaeda who are even worse than

to be working with the Russians not for a transition but for a cease

will pave the way for a referendum on our relationship with the
European Union. I fully understand, although some appear not to, why
such a Bill cannot be a Government Bill. We have to appreciate that we
are in the most unfortunate situation of being in a coalition, and one
part of that coalition does not want a referendum on or a renegotiation
of the terms of our membership. However, many of us do want those
things. We need a renegotiation and then a referendum for the simple
reason that there is a silent majority of people out there who get on
with their everyday lives, work hard, look after their families,
contribute to their communities and look to this Parliament to hear
their voice and give them the freedom to do the best for their
country.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13051440000450" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0002.htm#13051440000450">2.58

Macleod</B> (Brentford and Isleworth) (Con):</Member> The Gracious
Speech by Her Majesty the Queen gives us a programme for the year ahead
in Parliament, and today’s motion on the cost of living is
immensely important and integral to the world we live in
today—especially, I would argue, in the wonderful, creative
capital city of London. The UK is ranked 18th in the world for the cost
of living. Norway tops the ranking followed by Switzerland and
Australia, and Japan and France are also above the UK. Real household
income has almost doubled in the past 55 years, and living standards
have been transformed. In 1970, fewer than one in three houses had
central heating, but that is now 96%; just one third of people had a
telephone, but that is now 87%; and 65% of people had a washing
machine, which is now 96%.</hs_Para>

right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) could not answer the
question about borrowing, and nor did she apologise for leaving the
country in the state she left it when the current Government took over
in 2010. What are this Government doing? First, they are dealing with
the budget deficit to ensure low interest rates and stability. Interest
rates are at an historic low, benefiting all those who pay a mortgage.

the Government are taking action on the things that impact most on the
cost of living. On energy bills, they are ensuring that providers let
consumers know the best tariff by simplifying bills to make them easier
for people to understand. The Government have cut fuel duty. Fuel is
13p cheaper than it would have been under the Opposition. It will cost
the average family in my constituency £159 less to fill up the
car.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051440000284" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0002.htm#13051440000284">I
mentioned child care, which has been one of the main barriers to women
in the workplace and in creating new businesses. The changes will make
an impact on helping women to set up new businesses and to create
growth and jobs in the years ahead. The Government are extending free
child care to women who work fewer than 16 hours a week, and increasing
entitlement to free education and care for three and four-year-olds to
15 hours a week. We have also increased the free entitlement
to early education to two-year-olds from lower-income households, which
is helping the poorest in society. From 2015, the Government will meet
20% of the first £6,000 in child care costs per child for
working families with children under
12.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051440000285" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0002.htm#13051440000285">On
housing, I welcome the Help to Buy package—a £5.4 billion
package to tackle long-term housing market problems. I also welcome the
mortgage guarantee scheme to help first-time buyers and the funding for
lending scheme. Genworth Financial in my constituency proposes private
sector involvement in the scheme. I look forward to working with it and
the Treasury to see whether we can make the scheme a
success.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051440000286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0002.htm#13051440000286">Fourthly
and importantly, the Government are boosting business and encouraging
aspiration. Ultimately, building growth in the economy by encouraging
aspiration and supporting business to grow is how to address the cost
of living. What have we done? We have lowered corporation tax so that
it is the lowest in the G20. We have national insurance breaks for
businesses. We have deregulation of businesses and less red tape. We
have scrapped the beer duty escalator. Fuller, Smith and Turner, which
is based in my constituency in Chiswick, says that scrapping the
escalator is excellent for British brewing, British farming, British
pubs and British
jobs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051440000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0002.htm#13051440000287">Nearly

statistics from her constituency. I am not sure which
statistics  she was looking at. Her constituency is next door
to mine and has the same London borough of Hounslow. Jobseeker’s

<?notus-xml column=552?>claimants fell by 10% in the past year. Youth unemployment in my

Nick Raynsford</B> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab):</Member> I intend to
focus, as many other hon. Members have done, not on what is in the
Queen’s Speech, which is one of the thinnest in recent memory,
but on one of the most serious omissions. I refer not to Europe, but to
the absence of adequate measures to stimulate growth and improve
housing output, and by doing so improve people’s living
standards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051440000291" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0002.htm#13051440000291">As

figures speak for themselves. Housing starts last year totalled just
98,000, 11% down on the already hopelessly inadequate level of 111,000
the year before. Those two years, 2011 and 2012, represent the worst
output figures from any Government since the 1920s. Why has this
happened? Clearly, the financial crisis which erupted in 2008 had a
huge impact. Before that, housing starts totalled 183,000 in
2007—a level that was not sufficient, because a larger output
was necessary to meet the forecasts, but it was massively ahead of
anything we have seen
since.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051440000293" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0002.htm#13051440000293">With
the impact of the global meltdown, starts fell  to just 85,000
in 2009, the nadir, and then recovered to some 110,000 in 2010. Since
then, housing starts, like the economy, have been flatlining. We have
seen no growth and no further recovery. The telling figure is that new
starts in the second quarter of 2010—the quarter in which the
Government changed hands—were the highest that have recently
been achieved. No quarter since then has matched the level of output in
that second quarter of 2010. That reinforces the point about the
housing market flatlining, like the economy.</hs_Para>

doing something about the level of new starts is not just about meeting
housing needs—although that is a powerful case. It is also about
the economy, 
<?notus-xml column=553?>because the housing sector has a huge economic benefit. Not only is it
labour intensive, but there is a considerable multiplier effect. It has
a long supply chain, with all the manufacturers and material suppliers
who contribute to house building, and all the firms involved in
manufacturing the white goods, furnishings and fittings that go into
finished homes. Stimulating house building has real scope to create new
jobs and create growth in the economy. So why are we not doing
it?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051440000295" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0002.htm#13051440000295">To
be fair to the Government, they have been almost obsessive about trying
to find ways in the past year to get the house building market going
again. We have had endless announcements and proposals, some of which
have been reasonably, if modestly, effective. Schemes such as NewBuy
and First Buy, which were of course modifications of the previous
Government’s homebuy schemes—I may have got the names
wrong, because they change all the time, but the Minister knows what I
am talking about—have made a modest but useful contribution.
Others, however, have not. I am afraid that the new homes bonus has
proved to be an extraordinarily expensive and ineffective measure, as
the National Audit Office report devastatingly reveals. There has been
no measurable sign of real advances in stimulating local authorities to
grant planning consents.</hs_Para>

the Government seem to be tinkering obsessively and endlessly with the
planning system to no demonstrable benefit whatsoever. The level of
planning consents for new housing in the past two years has been the
lowest on record for a very long time. That has not been successful,
and nor is it likely that the mortgage support scheme announced in the
Budget will be of great benefit. Acting to help to support demand when
supply is absolutely inadequate is, as the Treasury Committee has
highlighted, likely to stimulate house price inflation. We need to act
on supply.</hs_Para>

Government need to focus on two areas, the first of which is the
private house building sector. The big house builders are doing pretty
well at the moment, but are doing so on the back of very low volume.
They are seeing their balance sheets recover and their stock market
valuations rise, but they are not building many new houses. Their model
is very much geared towards high-value, low-volume development. The
small and medium-sized house builders are suffering desperately, yet
they are the people capable of providing greater volume and meeting the
middle market.</hs_Para>

affordable and social housing sector is an even greater priority. The
Government were responsible, with their ill-judged 60% cut in
investment at the very start of their time in office, for undermining
disastrously the affordable and social housing programme. Reversing
that and investing in building new homes is a key priority. I regret
that that is not in the Queen’s Speech, but I hope the
Government change their mind and recognise its importance.</hs_Para>

theory is pretty simple: ever since we started industrialising at the
end of the 1700s, we started pouring CO<Sub>2</Sub> into the
atmosphere. As a result, the temperature across the world has warmed up
and we must do something about it—that is the basic theory our
energy policy follows. There are various flaws in that argument. The
earth has always gone through cycles of warming and cooling.
Coincidentally, at a time when we started to industrialise, we were
coming out of a very cool period—a time referred to as a little
ice age—when even the Thames used to freeze over.
What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T15:53:24"></hs_TimeCode> is the
total increase in temperature on which we are basing our policies and
fears about climate change? According to all the statistics, it is just
0.7° C, yet some of that is clearly due to the fact that the
earth was coming out of that cool period. Nobody can answer this simple
question: how much of that 0.7° C is not down to CO<Sub>2</Sub>,
but down to the natural warming that would have taken place
anyway?</hs_Para>

there is a problem with correlating CO<Sub>2 </Sub>levels with
temperature increases in the past 300 years or so, because there is no
straight line between the amount of CO<Sub>2</Sub> in the atmosphere
and temperatures going up. Between 1940 and 1970, temperatures were
going down, and that was at a time when we were putting enormous
amounts of CO<Sub>2 </Sub>into the atmosphere. Nobody can explain why
that is. Since 1998, there has been no increase in average global
temperatures—it has completely tailed off. Again, nobody can
come up with a convincing explanation for that. Yet despite all that,
and many other queries too, we are embarking on policies that will put
up costs for householders, through the use of subsidies for solar and
wind-powered energy, and put up costs for manufacturers, through the
various taxes on carbon that we are levying.</hs_Para>

there is a lot that we can do to generate electricity without CO<Sub>2
</Sub>and one would think that the Greens would be the first to support
it. We had a proposal recently for a Severn barrage that could generate
20% of Britain’s electricity. It was an interesting proposal and
one for which I would want to see more costings, but it was totally
opposed by the environmentalists. We know that we can generate large
amounts of electricity on demand and relatively cheaply from nuclear
power without emitting CO<Sub>2</Sub>, but where do the
environmentalists stand on it? They are totally against it.</hs_Para>

Government, however, not a shovel hit the ground. Nothing was done. All
Governments like to announce things, but the delivery mechanisms and
speeding up the ability to get things done are what matter. The
planning system takes far too long to achieve finality and get results
in this country. We also need to look into the matter of judicial
reviews. In 1998, there were 4,500 judicial reviews, but the number
trebled over the following decade. It is absolutely right that the
Prime Minister and the Secretary of State are looking at those issues
to ensure that we can get things done more quickly.</hs_Para>

unable to get past first base. Others might be hoping for a more
reasonable approach by the

to town rather than go to the centre that they could walk to in an

discriminated against because they are over 50 and, having worked all
their life, now find themselves unemployed and having to compete with

Rees-Mogg:</Member></B> The important thing for the Government to do is
to lift the living standards of everybody, but we do not improve the
standard of living of the poor by impoverishing the rich. That is what
Labour tried when in government before and it singularly failed. If
everybody gets richer, the whole standard of living of this country
improves, and Government revenues increase when rates of taxation are
reduced. It is thought that the ideal rate to maximise the amount of
revenue for the Treasury would be 37%, so I would be keen for the
Government to do this. It is a great error, for those on all sides, to
put short-term political advantage or debating points above the
economic benefit of this country. Therefore, we should be bold about
rates to make sure that we get the revenue we need for the Government
to be able to afford to do what they want to do, to keep taxation
overall as low as possible, to pay down the deficit and, ultimately, to
reduce the national
debt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T16:26:03"></hs_TimeCode>. So on the
fiscal side, the Government have got it
right.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051440000368" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051440000368">The
other aspect of prices is the monetary side, primarily handed over to
the Bank of England, but none the less with a Government target set in
relation to inflation. If the monetary side were to get out of control,
as we have seen historically that it can, the cost of living increases
because of the monetary effect on prices. So there is a careful balance
for the Government to have. This Government, unlike our continental
partners, have got it right by having a tight fiscal policy and a loose
monetary policy, so that liquidity is available within the economic
system, but the Government part of it is bearing down on the
Government’s deficit and, ultimately, on the debt. That is the
right balance, and it will encourage price stability. If we did things
the other way around—with tight fiscal and monetary
policies—we would have a degree of austerity that is
unsustainable, as our continental friends have. If we have both loose
money and loose fiscal policy, we will end up with inflation that has
pretty much disastrous consequences for the cost of
living<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T16:27:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051440000369" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051440000369"><B><Member ContinuationText="Catherine McKinnell" PimsId="5703" UID="13051440000622" xid="1212" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051440000622">Catherine

managed to do it a good deal quicker had we not been tied in to the

about the cost of living, which is what we are talking about, is that
the bottom 10% of people in Britain spend 37% of their money on food,
energy and housing costs, whereas for the top 10% it is less than half
that proportion at 17%. As basic costs escalate, benefits are squeezed
and the overall amount of money that people have is crushed, including
their working tax credit and the like, and the people right at the
bottom can barely survive while the people at the top are laughing. It
is all very well saying that the rich are paying more, but the wages of
the top 10% have gone up by 11% in the past two

am not even talking about the 5% tax giveaway, but what a laugh that
is, with the Government saying, “Oh, we’ll raise more
from a 45p rate than a 50p rate.” People on the top incomes can
move their income between tax years, so that is why there will be a
lower take. There will be a behavioural change. If the 50p rate was
ongoing, we would raise more. Indeed, some people already pay 50%,
because those who pay 40% also pay 12% in national insurance, so their
marginal rate is already 52%. The only difference is that they do not
have accountants. It

customers on the cheapest tariff to meet their needs. When the Prime
Minister announced that the Government would ensure that energy
consumers were put on the cheapest available tariff, the
Opposition’s reaction was that it could not be done, presumably
because they knew that when they were in government they had lacked the
political will to make it possible. They then changed to arguing that
it would not be done—presumably because they knew they would not

a humble Back Bencher, I hesitate to pick faults in the way Ministers
choose to communicate the Government’s achievements, but the
message that a series of freezes in fuel duty represents help for

most obvious direct beneficiaries of getting fuel costs under
control, and drivers in my constituency will, on average, be
£170 better off than they would have been had the
Government gone ahead with the increase in fuel duty planned by the
Labour party. However, I cannot help but think that that message sells
the Government short. Transport costs are a significant part of the
cost that families pay in shops, particularly for food, and they have a
real impact on the cost of living for motorists and non-motorists
alike. Poor grain and fruit harvests last autumn have created
significant pressures on food prices globally, and the
Government’s action to prevent fuel costs from needlessly rising
and adding to those pressures will help to stop spiralling food prices

housing, which hon. Members on both sides of the House must start to
take seriously. In 2012, the Institute for Public Policy Research
showed that, in  the current spending review, nearly £95
billion will be spent on housing benefit compared with just £4.5
billion on building affordable housing. That means that for every
£1 spent on affordable housing, £19 will be spent on
housing benefit. We should therefore not be surprised that the housing
benefit bill has been rising. We accept that, but the problem is that
the Government have not analysed the reasons for it, and have decided
to address housing benefit spending by trimming bits of money off
recipients of housing benefit here and there. For those individuals,
those bits of money are not insubstantial. For somebody on
£71.70 a week, losing £12 a week because they have to pay
it towards their rent is extremely significant in their cost of living.

a fairly average wage—as she would have to pay on a council

issue that has not been addressed in this debate is the Labour

reluctant to be drawn on this, but it should be drawn on it, especially
in a debate on the cost of living, because of the consequences it would
have. The country direly needs to live within its means and reduce its
debts and deficit. If it deviates from that track because of the Labour
party’s desire to spend more money—money that it does not
have—we have to wonder how the money will be raised. Will it be
raised in taxation—by asking people to pay higher
taxes—or by higher borrowing, which will be passed on to
consumers in higher mortgage rates? We have been down this track before

point, because it provides a neat segue for what I want to talk about
next. Of course, the Government welcome investment in major
infrastructure projects that improve the competitiveness and underlying
strength of the economy, and of course that is something to be welcomed
and there are numerous schemes where that is taking place. If I look at
investment in jobs in my own area through the work of the regional
growth funds, I see that £35 million is being spent in east Kent
to create new jobs. Businesses such as Wooding in Hythe in my
constituency have already received £1 million and they are
hiring people on the basis of that investment. Of course we welcome
that type of investment, but we are hearing from the Labour party a
desire for a short-term, temporary cut in tax to act as a stimulus to
the economy, with no real sense of where that money will come from or
how it will be costed and paid for. My concern in this debate on the
cost of living is that the people who will end up paying for those
policies will be the consumers. People will pay through higher taxes,
and higher interest rates on their mortgages if they are
homeowners.</hs_Para>

touches on the speech made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T17:11:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore) on the housing sector. One of the
biggest elements of the cost of living is housing. Rent, servicing a
mortgage or finding the money in the household budget to try to save
and buy one’s first home are all significant costs. I am
attracted to schemes where local authorities seek to work with
institutional investors to fund the building of new homes that will be
run by arm’s length management associations and councils,
effectively producing a private partnership with a local authority to
build new council houses and to borrow money from an institution over a
40-year to 50-year period. That is a sensible thing to do, and what any
organisation would do. If it is ultimately responsible for paying the
rent through housing benefit, why would it not seek to control the end
product too? That will give us more opportunities not only to provide
people with lower cost homes to rent, but, in time, for even more
people to benefit from the right to buy scheme, and for the money to be
reinvested back into providing new, high-quality homes. That would a

probably find that it is the rogue landlords who are happy to take the

people who are here illegally, but from some of the poorest people in
our society. We should clamp down on that, because it is public money,
paid out through housing benefit, that they are profiting from, and we

Margaret Ritchie</B> (South Down) (SDLP):</Member> At the heart of this
debate are two fundamental questions: what is the economy delivering
for people and why does it seem to be delivering more for some than for
others? A functioning economy needs to work not just for those at the
top but for all those who contribute to our businesses, industries and
public services. We should all be concerned by the income gap and the
disparity between those at the bottom and those at the top, and we have
a responsibility towards those who put in so much but currently get
little of the reward.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T17:17:03"></hs_TimeCode>Since the 1970s,

inequality is not just an abstract economic problem; it fosters
division and can be linked to several serious social problems. This
should elicit not some glib response about the politics of envy, but a
realisation of interdependence in our economy. The Government’s
proposed consumer rights Bill is to be welcomed, and I await the
details with interest, but there is little in this sparse legislative
agenda to tackle the fundamental economic problems we are facing. What
message is being sent out when remuneration is clearly no longer
tethered to economic worth and input, and what message are the
Government sending out when they cut the top rate of tax while
introducing a 1% cap on benefits that will hurt children and

people are having to work longer hours, pay more at the pump, pay more
for their weekly shopping and struggle to budget for the increased cost
of keeping the heating on. Every day can become a struggle. We have an
economy with high inflation and record fuel, food and energy prices,
combined with high unemployment and wage stagnation. That is the real
pain that people are feeling in Northern Ireland. Growth has been
non-existent under the coalition Government, which again is not an
abstract consideration, but is being felt by people on a daily basis. A
recent poll by the Consumer Council for Northern Ireland found that
nearly 50% of people were extremely concerned about their ability to
make ends meet and that people in their 30s and 40s were most concerned
that they might lose their job, while those in their 20s were concerned
that they could not find one. This paints a picture of a population
that has lost faith in the economy and no longer believes that it will
meet their aspirations.</hs_Para>

have today discussed the pressing problems of rising fuel, food and
heating costs, and this is especially the case in Northern Ireland
where we have experienced the highest fuel prices in the UK and Ireland
every month in 2013. The latest AA report for April 2013 indicates that
Northern Ireland is the second most expensive place to buy diesel in
the EU. The cost of filling up an average saloon car with a 50 litre
engine is now £75, and 90% of customers report that they are
spending more than they did two years ago, despite consciously trying
to use their cars less.</hs_Para>

similar with energy costs. The cost of gas has risen by 38% and the
cost of heating oil by over 68% since 2009, meaning that consumers face
annual bills that are over £600 more expensive than five years
ago. Many of those people are also facing deepening levels of fuel
poverty. In the supermarket, consumers are faced with a £20 rise
in their weekly food shop. These factors—filling a car to drive
to work, paying energy bills and feeding a family for a week—are
all compounded, leaving people constantly feeling under
pressure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051449000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051449000030">I
see very little evidence from the Queen’s Speech that the

sectorally targeted VAT reduction on tourism and hospitality products,
which has been successful in other European countries. I also call on
the Government to deliver on the peace dividend that was promised for
Northern Ireland back in 2007 in order to pump-prime devolutionary
measures, as well as to ensure that our standard of living and rising
unemployment no longer create those social divisions that have been
relevant for some time. In that regard, I urge Cabinet Ministers to sit

Halfon</B> (Harlow) (Con):</Member> I welcome this debate because I
believe that the Government’s record should be welcomed for a
number of reasons. First, despite a number of factors outside their
control, they have taken measures to help families—for example,
with the cost of fuel and utilities. Secondly, the Government have
recognised that tax is the biggest brake on the cost of living and have
cut tax for low earners. Thirdly, the Government have realised that,
besides tax, the best way to reduce the cost of living is to encourage
people to move from welfare to work by increasing their
skills.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051449000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051449000033">Before
I look at these things, however, we should look at how Labour has
undermined the cost of living. As some Members have commented, the
right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr Byrne) has said that
the wages of our constituents have fallen by £1,700 a year since
the election and that our constituents are getting poorer. But as the
Resolution Foundation made clear, median real wages stopped rising in
2003, a full seven years before the coalition came to power. We should
not forget that Labour left office with 2.5 million people
unemployed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051449000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051449000034">I
believe that the Government are listening and I welcome the action they
have taken to ease the cost of living, particularly the cost of fuel:
they have frozen fuel duty for three years and cut it by 1%. All these
measures were opposed by Labour. Yet 800,000 families still lose a
quarter of their income at the petrol pump, and the average cost of
unleaded petrol has risen by 60% since January 2009. Fuel duty is not
just a tax on fuel; it is a tax on everything. It pushes up the cost of
public transport and of food. With 71% of us still driving to work,
fuel is an essential.</hs_Para>

right that we should have transparency. I have argued that the
Government should make it compulsory for receipts to display how much
of what the customer pays for fuel is tax. That would show that,
despite the fuel duty freezes and the decrease in the cost of oil
internationally, oil companies continue to increase the cost of fuel.
News is emerging today to suggest that major oil companies have rigged
the oil market. This is being investigated by the European Commission,
and if it is true, I believe—I argued this last year in a debate
in this House—the Government should not only fine the oil
companies but consider imposing a windfall tax on them and passing
those tax receipts back to the consumer through lower fuel
duty.</hs_Para>

that there is a water Bill in the Queen’s Speech. Water
companies are making big profits. In 2011, they paid out £28
million in bonuses, yet for families feeling the squeeze, water bills
have risen by 82% over the last 10 years. I asked the Government to
take further action to break the monopolies and to increase competition
between water companies, which would allow for reinvestment in the
water system that would keep bills low in the long term. A windfall tax
should also be considered so that money could be handed back to
consumers.</hs_Para>

fact that the Government recognise that the biggest brake on the cost
of living is taxation. I am pleased that they are making progress in
reducing taxation, including taking 3,000 lower earners out of tax
altogether in my constituency of Harlow. I have urged the Government to
reintroduce the 10p tax band that Labour scrapped in 2008 for those
earning up to £12,500, which is the level of the minimum wage.
That would give a cash boost to minimum wage workers of £250 a
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051449000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051449000038">One
of the biggest problems in meeting the cost of living is the bill for
the taxpayer from the welfare state. The average taxpayer on lower
earnings pays £1,220 a year on welfare from the tax they pay.
The Government are right to build an economy in which those who work
are rewarded. It is right that the welfare bill is reduced. The reality
of Labour’s policy to increase the welfare bill is that it would
increase the tax bills of millions of lower earners across the
country.</hs_Para>

to address the cost of living is to deal with the skills problem. It is
no accident that those with the lowest skills are those with the lowest
pay. The Government are tackling that by investing in half a million
apprentices—the number of apprentices in Harlow has increased by
78% in the past year alone—and the building of 24 university
technical colleges. We have also talked about the technical
baccalaureate and other measures that the Government are making to
improve vocational training. These are all the kind of things that will
help with the cost of living in the long
term.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051449000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051449000040">I

rise to support the Gracious Speech, and I am pleased to be able to
make a short speech on the cost of living and people’s ability
to save for their retirement. When we consider the nature of our roles
in this place, it is extraordinary to look at our society now and in
the future, as no real reform to pensions has been made in generations.
The world around us has changed so much and our expectations of living
standards and life expectancy exceed anything that could have been
imagined when the first state pension of five shillings for those over
70 was introduced in 1909—in the famous
“People’s Budget” introduced by the then Liberal
Government. The pension age remained at 70 until 1928, when the
Conservative Government under Stanley Baldwin reduced it to 65.
Conservative Governments have always been reforming Governments,
particularly when it comes to pensions. Back then, there were limits on
what one’s private income could be and having too much furniture
could prevent people from being eligible for the state
pension.</hs_Para>

House has tried time and again to keep pace with changes to the average
person’s working life, but instead of there being a clear,
logical plan to make sure that every person in this country can look to
a retirement where there is certainty and continuity, the issue has
become complicated and confusing. As the relative worth of the basic
state pension has dropped, additional payments have been tacked on,
which have led to a generation heading to retirement age without
knowing what to expect from their pensions, how they need to save or
what the cost of living will be.</hs_Para>

increased dependence on means testing, with all the complications that
result from it, has meant that a third of pensioners do not claim the
pension credit to which they are entitled because they have not
received the information they need. That is not to say that Governments
have not tried to take steps to reach them, 
<?notus-xml column=582?>but the confusing nature of eligibility means that many people simply
have no idea of what they are entitled to receive. Some of the criteria
for eligibility may seem just as odd as the furniture requirement of
the 1909 state pension. What is clear, however, is that when the safety
net fails to support the most vulnerable, we know something must be
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051449000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051449000054">Equally,
there is no such thing as a job for life. I remember growing up in a
south Manchester council estate in the 1970s. My neighbourhood had
three industries—the textile industry, the aerospace industry
and the growing pharmaceutical industry—and most people worked
within them. Forty years later, there is no textile industry, there is
no aerospace industry and the pharmaceutical industry is consolidating
by moving abroad. That means communities have to reinvent themselves,
just as we as individuals have to reinvent ourselves and just as our
country has to reinvent itself to compete in a highly competitive 21st
century
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051449000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051449000055">With

future. We are setting up a system whereby this country’s
under-25s will have the security of knowing exactly what to expect from
their state pension. They are safe in the knowledge that the new,
single-tier pension will be uprated in accordance with higher earnings
and will always be above the escalating cost of living. Government
Members are safe in the knowledge that we acted in the national
interest, took the long-term view and are making the big changes
necessary to secure our children’s future. That is why I welcome

It is an utter scandal. We did not crack down sufficiently on the abuse

share with the House some of the journey that my city has gone through
in the past few years. During new Labour’s time in government,
6,000 business jobs were wiped out in my city of Gloucester. The symbol
of the city’s failure were the many hectares of wasteland at its
entrance, known as the railway triangle. Cheltenham and Gloucester, a
well known and respected former building society, was a casualty of the
disastrous Lloyds-HBOS merger, which was encouraged, if not engineered,
by the previous Government. One of our secondary schools, Bishops
college, sunk to having the second worst GCSE results in the country.
Our specialist engineering training company was on its knees, with only
25 apprentices a year. Perhaps saddest of all was the closure of the
profitable Kingsholm post office, which meant that 500 pensioners had
to walk one and a half miles to collect their pensions.</hs_Para>

businesses are in much better shape. The independent Dupont survey
shows that in 2012 Gloucester was having its fastest ever growth in new
businesses. Our manufacturers are thriving and expanding.
Gloucestershire Engineering Training is in new premises, with four
times as many apprentices, and the new railway triangle light
industrial park is on schedule to provide up to 1,000 new jobs, with
half starting later this
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051449000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051449000088">Most
important of all, perhaps, is the new Gloucester academy, a merger of
two underperforming schools improving every term and later this year
moving into new buildings funded by a £15 million Government
grant. That demonstrates what investment in education, our young and
aspiration, and giving everyone the chance to succeed, can
achieve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051449000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051449000089">Let
me not pretend that everything in the country or my city of Gloucester
is rosy. There is much regeneration left to carry out, especially in
the city centre and Blackfriars. However, we have exciting plans and
ideas to take forward. I would like our social housing manager,
Gloucester City Homes, to play a role in housing regeneration and to
fund new social housing. The  help of the Department for
Communities and Local Government and the Treasury in debt write-off is
critical. We have traffic issues at the C and G roundabout off Barnett
way and our application to the Department for Transport for pinch-point
funding is vital. Above all, we have to continue to help people get
into jobs. That is the crucial task that we are focused on. As I

Thursday.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051449000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051449000090">It
is true that some good things happened under new Labour. But one that
was disastrous for many of my constituents was the doubling of council
tax. They are now paying more than £700 more than in 1997. We
have frozen council tax for three years, yet at the end of the process
the Leader of the Opposition has said simply that freezing council tax
involves a small amount of money that will not make a huge amount of
difference. A £700 increase represents a huge amount of money to
my constituents.

businesses to create jobs, cutting back Labour’s fuel duty by
£5 a tank, lowering the income tax for 44,000 of my constituents

those objectives. It fails to put in place safeguards to prevent energy
companies from manipulating the market to achieve massive profits at
the expense of consumers. In fact, the Bill’s proposed energy
auction gives yet more opportunities for energy companies to manipulate
the market by decommissioning and mothballing stock, holding it back to
create shortages and then demanding greater prices at future auctions.

attempted to defend its massive prices increases by saying that the
bills were driven up because 50% of its energy is bought on the
international wholesale market and it had been selling it at a loss to
consumers in this country. That is simply not true. We all accept that
capital has to make a fair return on its investment, but this is not a

Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change was unwilling to make
a causal link between Government policies and food banks, but I will
make that case and underpin it with evidence. Food banks in Wales
trebled in the past year, and their use has increased by 118%. A survey
by the Trussell Trust, which asked people why they accessed food banks,
revealed that 45% did so because of benefit changes and delays; nearly
20% did so because they were on a low income; and one in 10 did so
because they were in debt. My hon. Friend the Member for Swansea West
(Geraint Davies) spoke earlier of the terrible increase in the use of
payday loans. In Wales, from 2007 to 2012, payday loans rose from
17,000 to 30,000. What a sorry

shall conclude on one other disappointment with the Queen’s
Speech. In 2010, the Prime Minister promised that he would not balance
the books on the backs of the poor. Thousands of campaigners up and
down the country are looking to him to hold to that promise. Rob Green,
from my constituency, works with Results. He makes the case forcefully
for the Government continuing their investment in tackling hunger and
under-nutrition in the poorest countries of our world. Where is the
0.7% Bill in the Queen’s Speech? Why has the Department for
International Development underspent by 8% this year? Why is No. 10
briefing sweet words to disgruntled Back Benchers via the <I>Daily
Mail</I> that the aid promise will be met, but only through a cash-grab
by other Departments? What do the Liberal Democrats have to say for
themselves? They back the Government, but that was a key promise of
theirs. Hollow promises, smoke and illusions are just not good enough.

Oppositions often say that the Queen’s Speech is a missed
opportunity. As has been said many times in the debate, there is not a
huge amount, or a huge amount of legislation, in the Queen’s

Government Members are resistant to the state having a role in solving
the challenges we face. They often say that they wish to roll back the
state, but the challenges that we face are so massive that only state
intervention can get us out of our economic predicament. Anyone
listening to speeches by Government Members would think that we do not
have many problems, but the Office for Budget Responsibility has
downgraded the growth figures in every Budget that the Chancellor has
given, and we have appalling growth figures—if we have any
growth at all. We are seeing real cuts in living standards, with real
wages down £1,700 since the election. We are living through the
longest lasting slump since the 19th century. The economy is flatlining
and we have a real problem, particularly in constituencies such as the
one I represent, with youth unemployment and long-term
unemployment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051449000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051449000145">In
the past year, pay has gone up by 1.2% while prices have increased by
2.8%. I am pleased that so many speeches by my hon. Friends have
focused on the real challenges that ordinary people face. For example,
over the past five years the cost of food has increased by 30%. Energy
bills have increased by more than £300 since the Government came
to power—and I use the words “came to power”
rather than elected, because neither coalition party was elected with a
mandate to do what the coalition Government have been doing over the
past three years. Bus fares have gone up by 32% in the past five years,
while the operating profits of bus companies have increased by more
than 7% each year. I wish the Queen’s Speech had contained
legislation to address some of those issues. We should regulate bus
services and bring them back under public ownership, because the
current model simply is not working. Train fares have also risen nearly
three times faster than wages since the recession. All those factors
are having a major effect on the
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051449000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0003.htm#13051449000146">Britain

sleeping rough has gone up by more than 30% in the past two years and
75,000 children were homeless last Christmas. The Queen’s Speech

the political debate is dominated by an internal political squabble in

more about that tomorrow. Many of us will remember stock markets
tumbling and the near collapse of the banking system in 2008. Few in
this country would have thought at that time that the response to that
challenge, and  the real predicament we face now, would be to
make  the rich richer and to attack the living standards of the
poorest in the country. These policies of austerity are not restricted

Government’s so-called welfare reforms. There is no doubt that

work, and living standards are plummeting. Government Members say that
they want to see people stand on their own two feet, but to do that
people have to have jobs to go to, with pay that they can live on. If

Government Members seem already to be regretting it. They say that
success has many parents, but failure is an orphan. Given the number of

the continued failure of the Government to deliver on living standards

was reported this week that when policy advisers in No. 10 were asked
what was keeping them awake at night they said, “School
fees.” Now, I know what keeps far too many people in Newcastle
awake at night: the cost of living. The TUC recently compared actual
wages in 2012 with what they would have been had they increased in line
with inflation, to discover a localised pay gap. In the north-east, it
is more than £1,100 a year, or £23 a week. In Newcastle,
it is £7 a week. Not much, some might think—a couple of
café lattes, and nothing 
<?notus-xml column=597?>in comparison with the private school fees keeping the Ministers’
advisers awake. However, for those getting by it makes all the
difference between security and despair. That is something the
Government do not understand. Indeed, the Prime Minister’s
adviser on enterprise thinks that this is an excellent time for
businesses to boost their profits on the back of falling wages. Such
crass comments highlight that the Government are a narrow clique with
no idea of the real issues facing real people.</hs_Para>

poverty crushes creativity, as I know both from my own childhood and

borrowing to buy food—as one in 10 people in Newcastle have had

the bus to the library to e-mail CVs to prospective employers; when the

four classed as major housing launches. If we look at the record,

both are down. The rate of homeownership is falling and, as we have
heard—particularly from my hon. Friends the Members for Hackney
South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) and for Hammersmith (Mr
Slaughter)—private rents have continued their relentless rise,
made worse by some letting agents charging very high fees. On lettings
agents, a redress scheme is welcome. I suppose that in the end the
Minister for Housing realised that he could not argue with himself and

and the bedroom tax. We talked about the estimated 41,000 people in
Leeds who will be affected. There are eight constituencies in Leeds,
but 30% of those 41,000 people live in one constituency, Leeds
Central—12,600 of the least well-off families struggling to get
by. What are the Government doing to help them? They are sending them
letters telling them that they have to pay more council tax and letters

the consequences for those people? They will have less money to spend
on food and heating and they will be at greater risk of ending up in
debt to payday lenders or, even worse, loan sharks. There will also be
rising council tax and rent arrears because, as the workers in the
advice centre know better than almost anybody else, a lot of these
people are desperate because they do not have the money. The Secretary

the Government were about protecting the vulnerable, but those are

them, “These are tough times; we have to make tough

Nick Harvey</B> (North Devon) (LD):</Member> I rise to present a
petition on behalf of the sufferers of atypical haemolytic uraemic
syndrome, known as aHUS, a rare disease that causes irreversible kidney
failure. Until recently there was no effective treatment for this
condition, which has 139 known patients in England, of whom 20 live in
Devon. I am presenting the petition to press for aHUS sufferers’
access to
Eculizumab<B><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T19:15:00"></hs_TimeCode></B>,
a new drug that has been proven to cause a dramatic improvement in
kidney function and, indeed, in the quality of life of patients
diagnosed with aHUS. The petition has received almost 30,000 signatures
nationally and is presented on behalf of the national group, aHUS
Action. It was brought to me by one of my constituents, Elena Lilley,
who suffers from aHUS. She received
Eculizumab<B><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T19:15:00"></hs_TimeCode></B>
as part of a clinical trial three years ago and it has transformed her
life, avoiding the need for her to be put back on dialysis and enabling

Leslie</B> (Bristol North West) (Con):</Member> I want to raise the
issue of councils inflicting an enforced monopoly, run by a private
sector provider, on the community, often crushing successful and
voluntary provision. The specific case that I will discuss relates to
sport—specifically swimming—which is relevant to my
constituency and others, including that of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T19:21:34"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband). I would be interested to
hear of any other such cases. The Minister responded to
yesterday’s Adjournment debate, so I am particularly grateful to
him for his presence for the second day running. I reassure him that
this debate is not about sport as such—although the subject has
a powerful impact on sport—but is far more about procurement and
tendering
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T19:22:02"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T19:22:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051452000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0004.htm#13051452000005">I
declare an informal interest in this subject, which centres on the
crushing of swimming club provision, in that I used to be a swimmer,
but sadly I am not as fit any more. As a youngster I ploughed up and
down swimming pools at silly o’clock in the morning for four
hours a day—and sometimes 10 times a week— in my
unfortunately thwarted hope of becoming an Olympian. My skin would
smell of chlorine when it rained and I had perpetual goggle marks. For
many years I swam under the excellent supervision of one of
Bristol’s finest coaches, Eric

to swim and making progress with clubs is not for everyone, but it is a
vital part of a choice of provision. It is particularly vital for
producing our next generation of competitive swimmers, and it is also

What is so sad about this case is that, as he said, when clubs,
councils and private providers work together, they can become more than
the sum of their parts and there can be huge success stories. All
parties should have the interests of children and swimming, or whatever
sport it is, at their centre. What is so tragic about this case is that
for some reason that I am yet to fathom, Bristol city council has been
stubbornly determined to stifle good provision and not to work in
partnership with clubs. When any objection is raised, it says that the
clubs should know better and that it does work in partnership. However,
as we know, partnership is not just a word in a report, but involves
communication, liaising and understanding from both sides. This

council and SLM set about ensuring that even clubs that had been
providing a successful and valued Learn to Swim programme, with high
demand and waiting lists, no longer did so in council-run pools. That
has led to an extraordinary situation at swimming clubs such as Portway
in my constituency that hire an agreed amount of pool time from SLM in
which intermediate and Learn to Swim swimmers both train. Following the
ruling that came into force on 1 April, the club is forced to vacate
the area of the pool that is used for Learn to Swim. The children, many
of whom have older siblings in the more advanced swimming lessons, are
forced to sit on the side and not enter the water because they cannot
be taught to swim, even though the qualified volunteer teachers are
present and the pool space is not being used by anyone else. If the
young children were doing another activity, such as attending a
children’s party, and were not being taught to swim, it would be
okay for them to use the pool. That does not seem very
sensible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051452000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0004.htm#13051452000015">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T19:28:05"></hs_TimeCode>

slightly less perverse  
<?notus-xml column=613?>and draconian attitude towards Learn to Swim. That means an extra
journey for parents to a pool that is much further away, which is very
difficult for single parents. That may also clash with the commitments
of other siblings, swimming or otherwise, and many parents are forced
to choose which of their children’s commitments to

key thing to note is that the small number of children who are being
taught to swim in a club environment, which cannot be replicated by a
private provider in terms of the continuity and focus that are provided
by the teachers, does not impact on SLM’s market share of Learn
to Swim children. The number of children in Bristol is increasing and
there are certainly more than enough children who need to be taught to
swim to go
around.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051452000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0004.htm#13051452000017">Nobody<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T19:28:57"></hs_TimeCode>
is suggesting that clubs should have a monopoly on provision or even
preferential treatment, only that they should be allowed to meet the
significant demand for their services, which they have hitherto met
very successfully. The result is that children are denied the choice of
the benefits that club swimming at an early level provides, such as
community and continuity of teaching. One club coach put it well in
saying that the two lessons a week at the club not only give children
the ability to swim, but inspire them to become a
swimmer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051452000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0004.htm#13051452000018"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T19:29:29"></hs_TimeCode>Of
course, the impact on competitive swimming will be significant, too. To
put it in perspective, in a recent Bristol schools competition, it was
estimated that despite there being about 3,000 children who were taught
by SLM compared with only 200 who were taught in clubs, club swimmers
made up about 50% of the finalists. In other words, if my maths is
correct, club swimmers were about seven times more likely to be
finalists than non-club swimmers, which is
significant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T19:29:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051452000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0004.htm#13051452000019">There
are other impacts. Many coaches come through a club system and then go
on to coach either in their parent club or in other clubs, or with
private providers such as SLM. Clubs are also vital social and
community hubs, raising money for charity and, as I have said,
providing youngsters with a sense of special identity and pride, as
Thornbury, Southwold and City of Bristol swimming clubs did for
me<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T19:30:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051452000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0004.htm#13051452000020">However,
the Minister will be pleased to hear that this debate is not
specifically about sport. It serves to demonstrate to him the possible
perversity of a council monopoly that is imposed with such odd
determination. Indeed, the clubs, the provider, a representative of
Gloucester ASA and the councillor with the relevant cabinet brief had a
meeting about the matter, at which the councillor, Simon Cook, was
extremely good. He brokered a proper, common-sense solution to allow
one of the clubs to keep offering Learn to Swim in a council pool until
some kind of common-sense compromise had been reached. I was alarmed
that his decision was completely ignored, which shows us something
about the accountability there. It was ridden roughshod over,
particularly by one council officer, Colleen Bevan, who I understand
has now gone off to work for a private leisure provider. The private
providers told the club that contrary to what had been agreed in the
meeting, it could not continue with its pool
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T19:31:20"></hs_TimeCode>. I should

this case demonstrates some of the perverse behaviour

understand that guidance on who should teach Learn to Swim lessons has
been issued by the ASA, and that it is recommended that clubs seek

understand that my hon. Friend also has more general concerns about how
local authorities use their procurement practices to create monopolies
of service provision with private providers. My Department holds policy
responsibility for local government, including promoting best practice
on commissioning and procurement processes and strategies. I would
expect any procurement exercise to engage effectively with and examine
the impact on community groups and the voluntary sector. Indeed, the
best value guidance published in September 2011 set out clearly how
councils should work with the voluntary sector when facing difficult
funding decisions.</hs_Para>

guidance states that local authorities should actively engage with
organisations in the community on the future of a service and any
knock-on effect on assets, and allow them to put forward options on how

local authorities are having to reduce costs and we encourage them to
follow the example of leading councils that are taking the opportunity
to think creatively, 
<?notus-xml column=615?>re-design their services, and commission intelligently and
co-operatively with all sectors of their local community, not just
large private providers. Local areas need the freedom and flexibility
to innovate and commission services that best fit the needs of their
communities. We cannot, and will not, prescribe from Whitehall how
individual local authorities should conduct each procurement exercise,
because it is not a one-size-fits-all situation. Neither will we
intervene in local issues or specific contracts, which, as I am sure
hon. Members will appreciate, is simply not appropriate.</hs_Para>

believe that local authorities can and should use their procurement
processes to improve efficiency while also achieving better outcomes
for service users. We know that poor practices and long-held myths can
slow down the procurement process and lead to bad decisions, costing
taxpayers money and affecting the standard of service. Councils such as
Bristol must be sure that they are doing everything they can to remove
those barriers, in consultation with local providers. I am pleased to
hear that the new mayor is going down the road of working with the
community, as my hon. Friend outlined. In my meetings with him he has
been keen to do that, which is a good sign for Bristol in the future,
and probably a real endorsement of how the local accountability of a
directly elected mayor can work for a city.</hs_Para>

up procurement practices to all local providers can make a massive
difference, and councils have a duty to their residents to act now.
Councils should publish their tenders and contracts online, which would
allow everyone to see clearly the procurement opportunities available
and helps councils to get better deals with taxpayers’ money.
Contracts Finder is one way of doing that, and as a secure, central and
well-recognised website it is already accessed by hundreds of thousands
of businesses and organisations. Bristol city council uses an
e-procurement portal, Twitter, and a blog to advertise contracts and
engagement opportunities. That is a positive step and I encourage more
councils to be as open and transparent as possible with all data and
procurement
decisions.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T19:37:21"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

surround European Union procurement rules, but those rules apply only
once a contracting authority has made a decision to procure goods or
services. Such rules are often used or misunderstood to prevent any
form of communication, but they do not and should not. Council officers
can still work with all sectors and providers prior to the bidding
process, and support diversity in the supply chain by skilling-up and
improving potential tenders. The Government would always encourage
local authorities to procure wherever they can and wherever is
appropriate locally. That can create new jobs and sustain existing
ones, support the creation of new businesses and clubs, help to tackle
worklessness and low skills by supporting apprenticeships, and boost
spending locally, as well as help develop and build a community through
its clubs and organisations.</hs_Para>

would always encourage local authorities to hire  the
best—not necessarily the biggest—firms, and they should
assess organisations on their ability to get the job done for the
benefit of the community, rather than on their turnover. Markets can be
narrowed, as my hon. Friend outlined, by contracting only with big
organisations, because that puts those organisations in control, rather
than the council. A diverse supply side promotes competition between
suppliers and gives the council and—importantly—its
residents, more
choice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T19:39:13"></hs_TimeCode>. Breaking
up contracts into smaller bite-sized chunks, or sub-contracting, can
open up procurement by introducing more competition on price and
attracting smaller firms. That can lead to even more local job
creation, specialisation and innovation in service delivery.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend giving me the chance to outline general aspects of
procurement and what councils can do to involve local community
organisations and small businesses. However, I want to be clear that
localism means doing everything at the most direct possible
level, with residents fully involved in making decisions about their
areas. Central Government should be involved only when absolutely
necessary. The Government’s approach to localism is to pass
power down to citizens—greater power to hold local authorities
to account and to help them to make a difference in and for their
communities. As we have seen recently, local communities hold their
councils to account ultimately through their voting power in local
elections. In voting for a directly elected mayor, the community in
Bristol has hopefully made a decision that will mean Bristol has a
better future, with direct, clear local
accountability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051452000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/debtext/130514-0004.htm#13051452000035">The
Localism Act 2011 introduced the community right to challenge, which
enables communities and the voluntary sector to question how services
are provided, to have the ambition to challenge that, and to make plans
to take services over. As my hon. Friend will realise, I am unable to
comment on the specifics of a contract—as she has said, I have
not seen the specific details. Hopefully, I have taken this chance to
set out the Government’s approach. I hope I have outlined how
local authorities can act to ensure that such situations do not happen.
I support her concern. Local authorities should embrace local community
groups and the voluntary sector during any procurement process, and in
their policy on sports provision and access. I congratulate her on

expect the Irish presidency to give a presentation on the progress made
in the “trilogue negotiations” following an informal
trilogue meeting which took place on Monday 13 May. The Irish
presidency represents the European Council in these negotiations, which
are between the European Council, the European Commission and the
European Parliament. The President of the European Parliament, Martin
Schulz, has made clear that they see the MFF as linked to discussion of
the large, €11.2 billion draft amending budget for
2013. I will emphasise that we see the two as distinct issues and
progress on the MFF should not be hindered by the separate discussions
on the draft amending budgets. There is no evidence at this early stage
in the annual budget cycle that extra funding is needed or justified. I
will continue to argue, along with our like-minded allies, that this is
far too large and there is insufficient evidence to justify these
requests. On the MFF we will continue to encourage the European
Parliament to consent to the deal as soon as possible, and that the
ceilings from the February European Council agreement must be
respected.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13051437000067" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/wmstext/130514m0001.htm#13051437000067"><I>22

Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has spent £210,701 with G4S
group companies since 2008. During this time G4S have supplied security
services such as key holding, guarding and maintenance of building
control systems. In August 2012 the department awarded a new facilities
management contract with Europa Facilities Services Ltd and the
majority of services previously supplied by G4S are now delivered under
this contract. G4S remain under contract at a small number of sites and
as these agreements expire or if it is cost effective to do so earlier,
these services will also be added to the Europa contract. Current
expenditure with G4S Group companies is approximately £2,500 per
month. The following table summarises total expenditure with G4S group

Prosecutors are asked, under the revised Code for Crown Prosecutors, to
consider whether a prosecution is proportionate. The cost to the CPS
and the wider criminal justice system is taken into account where it
could be regarded as excessive when weighed against any likely penalty
but prosecutors must also consider other factors in accordance with The

does not drop cases pre-charge; rather prosecutors decide in the most
serious and sensitive cases, whether or not a person should be charged
with a criminal offence. This decision is made in accordance with the
Code for Crown Prosecutors in relation to whether there is sufficient
evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that such a
prosecution is in the public interest. The number of cases where the
CPS has decided to take no further action is provided for the last
eight financial years. During this period the category of cases in
which the CPS advised on charge has changed so that now 72% of CPS

Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that up to 70% of people
entering and registering in refugee camps in Eastern Sudan leave
shortly afterwards, for a range of reasons. UNHCR's assessment is that
a high percentage of those leaving the camp do so voluntarily and
travel either within or outside of Sudan in search of employment and
livelihood opportunities. Some however do become victims of
trafficking.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051448000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/text/130514w0001.htm#13051448000029">The

other donors, has provided support to the awareness raising and
protection activities of humanitarian agencies through the Common
Humanitarian Fund (CHF). We are working closely with the lead agencies.
UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). and we
have raised concerns about trafficking in discussions with the Sudanese
Government. The British embassy in Khartoum also convened a meeting in

Eastern Sudan, in which the question of trafficking was a central

new official measures of inflation - CPIH and RPIJ - were introduced in

owner occupiers' housing costs. These are the costs associated with
owning, maintaining and living in one's own home. RPIJ is an improved
variant of the Retail Prices Index which is calculated using formulae
that meet international standards. ONS currently classifies these new
series as experimental statistics and they are being assessed by the
assessment team of the UK Statistics Authority to determine whether
they should be awarded National Statistics status. Since they have only

is, additionally, a family of indices behind the headline measures that
is used for a variety of official purposes. For example, CPIY is the
CPI excluding price changes which are directly due to changes in

inflation at times when the headline CPI is directly influenced by

against Chalara of various chemical treatments submitted by a number of
producers is covered in the Chalara Management Plan, published on 26
March. Based on scientific advice and other European countries'
experience of Chalara we are advised against expecting to find a
treatment that can be widely applied to protect woodland or treat an
infected wood or forest. However, in some circumstances treatments may
have a role in protecting individual trees or groups of trees, or
reducing production of spores, level of damage and rate of

IC seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid
data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations
providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve
data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is
assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not
changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant
analyses.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">5.
As from 21 July 2010 the IC has published provisional monthly NHS
workforce data. As expected with provisional statistics, some figures
may be revised from month to month as issues are uncovered and
resolved. The monthly workforce data is not directly comparable with
the annual workforce census; it only includes those staff on the
Electronic Staff Record (i.e. it does not include primary care staff or
bank staff). There are also new methods of presenting data (headcount
methodology is different and there is now a role count). This

announcement on Rail Passenger franchising on 26 March 2013 setting out
the Government’s future franchising programme including the
proposals for Direct Awards. At that time, the Department made it clear
that the Government’s preference is to negotiate direct awards
with the current operators but that Directly Operated Railways will be
readied in case agreement cannot be reached. This remains the case and
the company has plans in place to ensure that it can take over any

under the Railways Act 1993 as amended, to maintain the continuity of
passenger rail services. Under Section 30 of the Act the Secretary of
State has the power to transfer the operation of services to an
"operator of last resort." Directly Operated Railways fulfil the
function of that "operator of last resort." In the event that the
Department is unable to successfully conclude negotiations for a Direct

Featherstone:</Member></B> The Statistical Directives issued by the
Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) set out what spending can be
recorded as Official Development Assistance (ODA). The costs of Common
Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions are funded as part of our
assessed contributions to the European Union (EU). In accordance with
these Directives, the costs of CSDP civilian led EU missions are
recorded as ODA. Civilian CSDP missions have played, and continue to
play, an important role in areas such as supporting Rule of Law, Border
Management, and Justice Sector Reform. The costs of Military CSDP
operations are mostly recorded as non-ODA due to the nature of the
activities undertaken. Identified ODA eligible activities are scored as
such.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305151000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/text/130514w0003.htm#1305151000046">These

more than five years, as is the number of cautions issued to those who
have a previous criminal record. However, the public and victims have a
right to expect that people who commit serious crimes should be brought
before a court. On 3 April 2013 we launched a review into the use of
cautions which will focus on the use of cautions for serious offences
and persistent offenders. Among other things, the review will examine
whether there are some offences for which the use of simple cautions is
generally inappropriate, the reasons why multiple cautions are given to
some criminals and the difference in the use of cautions by police
force areas. The review is a significant step to ensuring that cautions
are used correctly, in the interests of justice, and command the
confidence of the
public.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305151000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/text/130514w0003.htm#1305151000150">The
decision whether to offer a caution is an operational matter for the
police and in some circumstances the CPS depending on the circumstances

serious and contested cases and those involving prolific offenders.
However, there will always be exceptional cases in which a prosecution
for what appears to be a relatively serious offence is not in the
public or the victim's interest. While we should not remove police
officer discretion, the public have a right to expect that people who

The service is proving stable, and initial feedback from the early

evaluation report includes an analysis of match rates by population
groups and while no specific analysis was undertaken of seaside towns
the results did suggest that match rates were lower in areas with high
student populations. However, anyone who cannot be confirmed will still
be invited to register individually and will retain their ability to
vote in the 2015 general election. By using confirmation to simplify
the process for the majority of electors it means resources can be
focused on maximising registration among those people who cannot be
confirmed, including individuals who are not currently registered. We
are also currently running a separate set of pilots exploring whether
data matching against DWP and other trusted national data sets can be
used to find potential electors who are not currently registered but
may be eligible to do so, in order to invite them to register. The
results of the pilots, which are specifically targeted at boosting
registrations among students, attainers and home-movers, will be

from publishers directly. Instead a subscription agent and content
aggregators are used to achieve economies of scale. Content aggregators
provide full text database access to a large number of journals, thus
achieving efficiency savings and rendering significant amounts of
individual subscriptions unnecessary. Due to the aggregation process
and the use of a single agent it is not possible to differentiate the
cost by

for the current state pension scheme, and our proposals for changes in
the future are set out in the Pension Bill published on 10 May 2013.
After the implementation of the single-tier pension entitlement to a
state pension will be based on an individual's contribution record only
and the facility to inherit or derive any part of entitlement to state
pension based on the national insurance contributions of another
individual will end, with some transitional arrangements. Under these
arrangements it will not be possible to transfer any extra state
pension entitlement that may have been built up by the deceased from
the deferral of their single tier pension. The detailed mechanics of
the process are laid out in a policy paper entitled state pension
entitlements derived from a current or former spouse’s or civil
partner’s national insurance contributions, published on
GOV.uk.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1305154000014" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130514/text/130514w0004.htm#1305154000014">Universal
