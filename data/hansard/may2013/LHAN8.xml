for government, Parliament, civil society and industry. The treaty

team at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for their skill and
perseverance in achieving a more robust treaty than might at one time
have been anticipated, and to the Foreign Secretaries, from Jack Straw
onwards, who gave them their full support. Can the Minister say who is
going to sign on behalf of the UK on 3 June? It is surely important
that the signature be at a level that indicates the importance that we
attach to it. Can she also say what consideration will be given in
future, when granting an arms export licence, to the status of the
importing country under the arms trade treaty—whether it has
signed and ratified and is implementing the treaty? Would not that be a
more effective way of encouraging the widest possible acceptance of its

I can absolutely add my support and congratulations to all the Foreign
Secretaries, and indeed all Ministers, many from the Opposition, who
have worked over seven years to make this happen. Of course, my
congratulations go to my right honourable friend Mr Burt, who handled
this towards the end, and to Alan Duncan. Negotiations went on long

The treaty will be effective only when 50 countries join; thereafter,

even for those countries which do not sign the treaty initially, and
are not supportive of it fully at this stage, political pressure will
build off the back of this saying this is what the international
community sees as the standard—you may not have signed up to it
but it is how we expect you to conduct yourselves. That will be an
important lever in trying to move those countries in the right

Popat:</Member></B> My Lords, the UK’s current trade balance
with the rest of the EU reflects a range of factors. The recent rise in
the deficit reflects the shrinking EU market, not a loss of UK market
share. The UK is pursuing a range of policies—supporting
measures to stabilise and revitalise the EU as well as encouraging
firms to internationalise—which will boost UK trade with the
EU<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T14:45:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000021"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Vinson" PimsId="4454" UID="13052162000294" xid="1478" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000294">Lord

reply. Indeed, we must all try harder to export. Does he agree that our
relationship with the EU is changing and that the strength of our
trading position would be a key factor in any future negotiations?
Should it not be widely known that while 3 million of our jobs are
reciprocal with our trade with the EU, the continuing £46
billion a year trade imbalance means that overall 4 million of its jobs
rely on us? We are indeed its biggest

the deficit of £46 billion, is counterbalanced by our surplus on
invisible trade. Our membership of the EU is still in the best
interests of the UK. It provides tariff-free access to a market that is
worth around £11 trillion and has half a billion customers, and

well, but do the Government agree that to tackle our overall trade
deficit we should be encouraging exports to countries such as India? I

export to India, only a handful of hands go up in an audience of 300.

emerging markets, including India, which the noble Lord mentioned. This

friend. There is no other country in the world with which we have such
a huge trade deficit. We have it with the European Union, but we have a
large number of benefits as well. The £7 billion contribution
that we pay to it gives us the benefit of free trade and a free market
to other parts of the world. However, some of the huge deficit that we
are talking about is offset by the invisible trade that we do with it.

important issues could be put on the G8 agenda. We feel that what is
important is to discuss the political and economic challenges of the
day—as they always are. However, it is also important for the G8
to look at ways in which it can get its house in order and agree on
those things that would make a real difference to developing
countries—such as tax, transparency and trade. This
allows developing nations to have much more transparent, open systems,
so that countries know when developed nations go into their country,
what they are paying for those contracts, what those governments are

much on the alert. However, we are in effect looking back and trying to
recover a situation that should never have got to this point. The
intention of government should be to ensure that this does not happen
again. Anyone whose job involves the protection of children should be
alert to this fact. That includes local authorities, the police and
those who are responsible for care homes, health agencies, schools, the
probation service and housing. All these elements must come together.
We have a statutory body—the local safeguarding children
boards—in every local authority in this country. What are they
doing if not seeking to protect the young children who are their
responsibility? The Government are very alert to this and I hope that I

that one of the themes that underpins the reporting of the child abuse
scandals of the past is that the victims have failed to come forward

that the authorities charged with looking after these children did not

the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice, Damian Green, has set
up a group designed to ensure that this is the case and that the police
forces themselves are aware of the difficulties and the need to lend a
positive ear to complaints from young children. My noble friend makes a
very good point—that the point of failure in the system is that

abuse has shocked the nation. Perhaps I may refer back to the Question
from my noble and learned friend Lord Morris. Can the Minister confirm
the number of serious, larger-scale sex abuse cases involving groups
and gangs that have been investigated? My noble and learned friend
suggested that there are about 54 such cases. The number is clearly
over 30, which could mean that hundreds if not thousands of young
people are suffering abuse at this moment. I listened carefully to the
Minister’s answer and he was absolutely right about
co-ordination. However, is he really confident that the Government have
now got to grips with the matter and that the co-ordinated strategy
which he spoke of deals with all aspects of these wicked crimes,
including the reporting of them and the court
proceedings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:06:46"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000057"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="13052162000331" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000331">Lord

and it is a dramatic one: 2,409 children and young people were
confirmed victims of sexual exploitation by either gangs or groups
during the 14-month period from August 2010 to October 2011. Those
figures speak for themselves and to the scale of what is being dealt
with. I assure noble Lords that this Government are focusing their

certainly right about one thing: that the health and social care system
is under huge pressure. Hospitals are full to bursting, discharge is
becoming ever more difficult, and social care and the voluntary sector
are struggling to fulfil the demands being placed upon them. However,
from the Statement made by the Secretary of State in the other place,

he agree that the real causes of the crisis are the Government-induced

saying that family doctors should necessarily go back to being on call
in the evenings and at weekends. They work hard and have families, and
they need a life too, but we must take a serious look at how
out-of-hours NHS care is provided. My right honourable friend the

situation extremely well. I am sure he knows that Sir Bruce Keogh, the
NHS medical director, is currently looking at how NHS services across
the piece can be provided seven days a week in a much fuller way than
they are at the moment. Access to GPs 
<?notus-xml column=745?>out of hours is part of that wider consideration and
NHS England is working with the royal colleges and professional
organisations to develop a set of standards that will apply to
seven-day services. Some trusts are already thinking about treating

Reid of Cardowan:</Member></B> My Lords, can I correct a serious
misrepresentation and misconception that is constantly made regarding
the GPs’ contract, and which has been made in the past few
moments? The GPs’ contract for 2003-04 did not remove the
requirement of a doctor to work out of hours. That was
removed a decade earlier under the previous Conservative
Government; indeed, by 2000 a huge percentage of doctors had already
opted out. The GPs’ contract was to try and make sure that GPs
were not spending part of their normal day bureaucratically chasing up
a replacement doctor to take their place. It removed that bureaucratic
imperative but it did not remove the right of a doctor to refuse to
work out of hours. That was the case with some 70 to 80% by the end of
the previous Conservative Government, before the GPs’ contract.
That is a very important
distinction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:16:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000070"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13052162000341" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000341">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I certainly did not mean to mislead the
House and if I have done so in any way I apologise. The summary given
by the noble Lord is broadly right. Under the old general medical
services contract, GPs had a 24-hour responsibility for their patients,
although most GPs delegated responsibility to GP co-operatives or
commercial providers. At the beginning of 2004, as I recall, only a
small proportion of GPs actually provided out-of-hours services
themselves. However, 24-hour responsibility continued to be unpopular
with GPs as they felt it was discriminatory, which is why the contract
was renegotiated at that time. It has brought about a growth in GP
co-ops, with more use of telephone triage and more patients offered
emergency consultation with a primary care centre. But that has
resulted in fewer home visits and I think that point in
particular is one that is exercising many

experience at some point in their lives, whether they need it
themselves, know a family member or a friend who does, or provide care

good experiences, the system can often be confusing, disempowering and

Wheeler:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his very thorough and
comprehensive introduction to the Bill. When the Care Bill was
discussed last week in our debates on the Queen’s Speech, there
were six overarching themes in the contributions from noble
Lords.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052162000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000093">First,
there was a general welcome for the reform and consolidation of social
care law, which we on these Benches initiated and strongly support in
so far as it achieves a fairer, simpler and more sustainable
system—three factors against which we will be closely testing
the Bill through scrutiny and
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000094">Secondly,
there was deep concern that this would be at best a partial solution
unless a new legal framework is introduced in the context of addressing
current and future social care funding needs. Given the scale of this
Government’s cuts to local authority budgets, the Bill’s
measures put forward in this context risk raising expectations that
cannot possibly be
met.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000095">Thirdly,
the Government’s proposals in the Bill on social care funding do
not meet the Dilnot commission’s fairness criteria. Many in care
homes will die before the cap at this level is reached; houses will
still need to be sold; the cap will not in fact limit the costs that
elderly people actually pay for their residential care; and the Bill
will not mean that pensioners get their care for free if they have
income or assets worth up to £123,000. The squeezed
middle—those pensioners on average incomes who have worked hard,
proudly invested in a home and tried to save for their older
age—risk missing
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000096">Fourthly,
the Bill offers only a partial response to the recommendations of the
Francis report to address failures in hospital and care support. What
happened at Stafford Hospital was terrible and lessons must be learnt.
Last week Jeremy Hunt referred to Part 2 of the Bill as,</hs_para>
<hs_quotefo UID="13052162000242" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000242">“a vital
element of our response to the Francis
report”.—[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 13/5/13; col.

in reality the Government have been disappointingly limited in their
response to those vital issues identified by Francis. Where is the
Government’s response to his 
<?notus-xml column=750?>concerns over safe staffing levels and the risks to safety and care?
Where are Francis’s full proposals on the statutory duty of
candour? Where is the regulation of healthcare
assistants?</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13052162000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000097">Fifthly,
there were concerns that once again, like the Health and Social Care
Act, this Bill will not in practice lead to better integration of
health and social care. How will the Bill translate this into practice?
How will the work of the Government’s consultation on integrated
care, launched last week, inform our consideration of the Bill? Will it
report in time for any legislative steps to be adopted? How will the
institutions of the Health and Social Care Act—the health and
well-being boards and Healthwatch England—link in with the care
requirements placed local authorities? How will the marketisation and
fragmentation of that Act align with any integrating intention in this
Bill?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000098">Sixthly,
there was deep concern and dismay across the House that the Government
have backtracked on vital commitments on public health, particularly on
standardised packaging for cigarettes. The care crisis facing this
country is not simply one of an ageing population but also one of
co-morbidities and many more people living with long-term health needs.
Public health plays an essential part in our response to those
demographic changes, and is hugely relevant to issues dealt with under
Clause 2<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:34:48"></hs_TimeCode> and to
maintaining
well-being.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000099">So,
the good news: the Bill is welcomed by Labour as an important first
step towards providing a consolidated legislative framework for our
social care system based on the excellent report of the Law Commission
inquiry set up by Labour in 2009 to streamline and unify social care
law. It implements 66 of the commission’s 76 recommendations,
refocusing care and support on more patient-centred services better
suited to people’s lives and needs, improving access to
information and advice, strengthening the legal rights of
carers, standardising eligibility criteria and establishing well-being
as the guiding
principle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:35:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000100">We
strongly support that. It takes our work on patient choice and control
forward. It builds on the progress that Labour made on key areas such
as prevention, personalisation of services and carer recognition and
support in our landmark National Carers Strategy. It also addresses
much of the unfinished business in our pre-election White Paper on a
national care
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000101">Like
other noble Lords, I commend the pre-legislative scrutiny work of the
Joint Committee. The Bill enjoys support among patient and carer
organisations, staff, and service users and providers, but with the
proviso that key improvements are needed to address what the committee
itself identified as gaps and risks of unintended consequences. For
completeness, we also welcome the proposals on Health Education England
and the Health Research Authority, albeit with some significant issues
to explore as we progress the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:36:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000102">Now
for the not-so-good news. On its own, the Bill will not go anywhere
near far enough to tackle the crisis that is engulfing health and
social care today. In addition to the crisis in A&amp;E, now
acknowledged by the Secretary of State, we have hospitals full to
bursting, the discharging of patients becoming ever more difficult,
handovers to social care services slower and subject to 
<?notus-xml column=751?>more disputes and a social care sector struggling to fulfil the demands
placed on it. On the front line, thousands of nursing posts have been
lost and many services are under pressure. In social care, the recent
report of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services lays
bare the scale and severity of the financial squeeze on councils, who,
by the end of this spending round, will have been stripped of
£2.7 billion from their adult social care services, equivalent
to 20% of their care budgets, as demand for services
increases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000103">New
rights to services and support risk being meaningless as council
budgets are cut to the bone and people are faced with spiralling
charges. Will the noble Earl tell the House whether the resources for
local authorities to deal with the additional responsibilities placed
on them by the Bill, including carrying out the extra assessments of
the estimated 450,000 self-funders, will be made available, and whether
it will be new money? Is it accounted for in the impact assessment? Is
he confident that councils will have the trained staff to complete
those assessments on

welcome the delayed consideration of Part 1 until completion of the
spending review, but can the Minister reassure the House today that his

that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13052162000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000243">“without

he also give a commitment to the House that the regulations associated
with Part 1 will be available in draft by the time of our

eligibility criteria will be severely

Dilnot, it is disappointing that the Government have watered down the
commission’s proposals, proposals which Labour believes
represent an important step forward in beginning to address social care
funding. When he announced the Government’s response to Dilnot,
the Secretary of State made great play and emphasis that the plans were
“radical” and
would,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13052162000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000244">“transform
the funding of care and support in England—bringing a new degree

age”.—[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/2/13; col.

matched that with a promise that that would guard against
someone’s property being sold and their savings wiped out.
However, a £72,000 cap—£140,000 for a
couple— will not be enough to stop many people with modest
properties, especially in the north of England, selling their homes to
pay for care. Under the deferred payment scheme, councils loan people
money to cover their care costs, which now has to be paid back with
interest, most likely by selling the family home after the elderly
person has died. Nor will the Bill cap the costs that elderly people
actually pay for social care unless differing local authority care
charges are addressed, which could make a difference to care now. The
cap introduced by this Bill will be based on the standard rate that
local councils pay for residential care, which on average is
£480 a week; but 125,000 self-funders face weekly bills that on
average are £50 to £140 more 
<?notus-xml column=752?>than this average council rate and in some areas far higher. This extra
amount will still have to be paid and not count towards the
cap.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13052162000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000106">The
Bill will not mean that pensioners get care for free if they have
income or assets worth up to £123,000. People will still get
free care only if they have income or assets under the lower
means-tested limit that is not being increased and will still be
£17,500 in 2017. Those with incomes or assets between this
figure and £123,000 will get a sliding scale of support from
councils as they do now. Can the Minister confirm that this is the
case?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000107">On these
Benches we remain to be convinced that the Government can provide
answers on these fundamental aspects. Can the Minister not recognise
that the Government are overselling what the impact of the
Bill’s current provisions will be, particularly bearing in mind
that nobody will be benefiting at all until 2020 at the
earliest?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000108">Finally,
I turn to the some of the other questions that noble Lords will no
doubt raise during the Bill’s passage, and I look forward to the
Minister’s response to them. Will the change in the legal
language around the continuing care and social care boundary of the
NHS, shifted by the Bill, result in the possibility of more people
having to be means tested for residential care? What are the
Minister’s estimates of the number of people who will fall out
of the system and become ineligible for support under these proposals?
Have the Government assessed the overall impact on disabled users of
social care also hit by cuts in their benefit entitlement and support?
What consultation have the Government had with the insurance industry
and pension providers about the likelihood of markets developing to
help self-funders bridge the gap up to the £72,000
cap?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000109">We
welcome the introduction of well-being as the guiding principle but
should this duty not also be placed on the Secretary of State? On
integration and prevention, why does housing still get only limited
consideration and mention throughout the Bill? On young carers, when
will the Government make their position clear in addressing via this
Bill the gap in the law? His colleagues have resisted attempts to amend
the Children and Families Bill to this effect. Why have the Government
reintroduced the issue of after-care services for people with mental
health problems leaving hospital after a period of detention? We
thought that this issue was settled under the last health Bill, but it
seems
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000110">Lurking
in the background as we speak today is the reality of a social care
system on the edge of collapse. Social care is being left to decline.
Labour supports the principle of capping care costs, but we stress that
a bigger and bolder response is needed by Government to meet the
challenges of our ageing population. Whole-person care is our vision
for a 21st-century health and care system that brings together physical
and mental health, and social care, into a single service to meet all
of a person’s care needs. Our independent commission has already
started its work on looking at how health and social care services
budgets can be brought together. “Integrated services”
means not just a series of area or service specific initiatives, but a
way of working for a whole service.</hs_para>

explaining the parts of the Bill so clearly in his introduction to this

the Minister has already explained, this Bill brings all previous
legislation together for the first time, and is based on the well-being
principle but also on the funding cap to protect those from
catastrophic costs, the higher means test, the inclusion of rights for
carers assessments, the portability of care and the mechanism to
protect the care
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000114">The
decision to manage this Bill differently from the Health and Social
Care Bill was wise. Not only was there extensive consultation on the
White Paper, but the Bill was based on the Law Commission report that
itself had consulted widely. It is worth mentioning that we on
the scrutiny committee looked at Part 1 so that the new Part 2 and the
sections added to Part 1 should get close scrutiny in
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000115">The
committee had members who are hugely experienced in the world of care,
and was chaired by the previous Care Minister, my right honourable
friend Paul Burstow. We took evidence from a wide range of
stakeholders, and without exception they were full of admiration for
the work of the Bill. However, as noble Lords would expect, they had
areas in their own field that necessitated extra work. When we looked
at what the report should say, we had a strong evidence base and
deliberated long and hard about any deletions, omissions or just plain
amendments to the draft Bill. Those recommendations, which were
included in the report that was published, were to make a good draft
Bill better. I therefore really welcome the Bill, but there are some
areas where more work needs to be done. There are some unintended
consequences, and some minority groups need assurance that the Bill
will meet their needs.</hs_para>

for detail, but areas that have received full coverage and early
attention are young carers, adults caring for children, and the
transition in service provision. The Law Commission felt that this Bill
is the vehicle to place legislation for the assessment and meeting of
their needs, but in winding up on the third day of debate on the humble
Address the Minister was very clear that there is no place in this Bill
for young people: that it is an adult Bill. Will he explain how the
Government intend to meet this real need? If he does not have the

third of the adult population who receive care are of working age. Many

that their needs will not be met, resulting in failure to cope, leaving
employment and subsequent isolation and depression. This was

intention of this Bill is to rationalise a confusing morass of Bills

around the well-being principle in Clause 1 and the cap on funding to
give assurance about catastrophic care costs. Both the cared-for and
the carer will be entitled to an assessment and a care plan, whether
they are a self-funder or not, and there will be a requirement to

Campbell of Surbiton:</Member></B> My Lords, in welcoming this Bill I
first declare an interest as someone who benefits from a whole range of
care services, without which I would not be in your Lordships’
House. I hope that my professional knowledge, combined with my personal
experience, will give added value to the debate over the coming

Bill is the culmination of five years’ complex and challenging
work to modernise the legal framework for adult social care. Much work
has been done by the Law Commission, but the Government have also
understood that they needed expertise that can come only from those who
use care and support services. They conducted a lengthy and broad
consultation. I have been impressed by the Department of
Health’s efforts to get this right. Much credit for this must go
to the fine leadership of its former director-general, David Behan. He
recently left to take the helm of the CQC, which is very
lucky<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:52:13"></hs_TimeCode>. The Bill
also benefits from the experience of Members of this House. A number of
your Lordships served on the Joint Committee that considered the draft
Bill and recommended improvements to it. The Government have listened,
and the Bill is better for it.</hs_para>

the culmination of more than 25 years’ work by the
Independent Living Movement of disabled people. I consider myself very
privileged to have played an active part in this social movement to
radically change the way that care and support are designed and
delivered. Since the mid-1980s we have fought to ensure that disabled
people of all ages have the same opportunities that everyone else takes
for granted. This has involved challenging entrenched professional
attitudes, political assumptions and public misconceptions about what
disabled people can and cannot do. The struggle continues today. Many
people believe, as I do, that disabled people have lost ground
recently. As someone once observed, “The price of liberty is
eternal
vigilance”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000129">However,
this Bill shows how far we have come since the passing of the Community
Care (Direct Payments) Act 1996—in my view, the most
emancipatory care and support legislation in my lifetime. That Act was
passed because a group of disabled people was able to persuade the
Government of the day that they could be trusted to take control of the
cash needed to pay for their personal care support. That was my
first memorable experience of the House of Lords.

your Lordships will be aware, there has been much progress since that
landmark statute. Further legislation has widened access to direct
payments. Personalisation policies have developed other ways for people
to have more say and control over their support and care. Personal
budgets offer another way for people to decide how funds should be used
to support them. Even the NHS has caught on, by introducing personal
health budgets for people with long-term conditions, so they, too, can
have more say over their healthcare. A process that started among
working-age disabled people has broadened out to benefit other groups:
people with learning disabilities, older people and people
with mental health problems. They are all using direct payments and
personal budgets—and so, too, are parents of disabled children,
giving them both more control and allowing enough flexibility for many
to pursue their
dreams<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:57:06"></hs_TimeCode>. Policy
guidance has encouraged local authorities to work with people and their
families as equal partners. By working together, many are coming up
with solutions that best fit their individual circumstances, using
public services to complement their own resources, personal assets and
community
links.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000133">All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:57:37"></hs_TimeCode>
these positive trends, many of them with roots in the user and carer
movements, come together in Part 1 of the Bill. It represents a sea
change in the values and attitudes embodied in the legislative
framework for adult social care. It treats people requiring support as
citizens first and foremost, with rights and entitlements stemming not
only from this Bill but from the Human Rights Act, the Equality Act,
and international agreements, such as the UN Convention on the Rights

me to tell them that this Bill is perfect. It sets out many of the
right goals, but we will need to question the Government very closely
on some of the means by which they intend to achieve them. For
instance, we are promised first sight of the regulations on assessment
and eligibility towards the end of June. This will coincide with
announcements about the public spending

heavily on the qualifying criteria for public support. Much also

any of your Lordships have difficulty understanding what I am saying
today, please come to my office for clarification. On a more serious
note, the reassessment of my ability to communicate could mean the
difference between a social care direct payment and NHS-funded care.
That might be fine if support would not change for the worse as a
consequence. It is no secret that some local authorities cannot wait to
offload clients onto NHS continuing care. I am hopeful that health
budgets will eventually mirror social care direct payments. However,
this is not yet the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:04:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13052162000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000136">Last
year, the JCHR investigated independent living. The resulting report
was dedicated to a 22 year-old disabled man. This young man had been in
part-time employment and living independently, supported by social care
direct payments. However, after being admitted to hospital with a chest
infection, it was decided that he would be safer with a tracheostomy.
Tracheostomy care is not rocket science. It does not take long to train
a sensible person. However, the local authority decided that this man
was now “the problem” of the NHS. As a result, his direct
payment was withdrawn. It took health commissioners six months to
decide how he would be cared for, leaving him in a hospital critical
care unit for three months longer than was
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:01:45"></hs_TimeCode>. This
severely disabled independent man lost his job, his loyal PAs and his
dignity. The cost to the taxpayer was £36,000 in hospital fees,
double what it would have cost had he been allowed to keep control of
his cash and care, with an enhanced payment from the NHS to
pay for the extra PA hours needed during the

it any wonder that disabled people fear the future? They do not just
fear the consequences of inadequate funding, they dread past ways of
working creeping back in the name of austerity. Those of us who use
care services must be given more control to enable us to survive these
difficult financial times. Services need to adapt to enable the
recipients to create their own budgeted support and to seek work,
wherever that may be. This nicely leads me to return to an issue I have
been raising in your Lordships’ House for the past four years.
Noble Lords will know that I have a particular concern about
portability of care and support. I will push for the
Government’s proposals on portability in this Bill to match the
outcomes set out in my Private Member’s
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:03:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000138">The
Minister for Social Care in another place has indicated his desire to
work closely with those of us campaigning for total portability of care
and support. 
<?notus-xml column=758?>I have consulted on the subject for more than five years with
disabled people and their organisations, carers, lawyers and
professionals in social care. My Private Member’s Bill is the
culmination of that work. My Social Care Portability Bill has been
recognised by the Department of Health. The greater part of it has been
subsumed into the Care Bill before us today. However, there is one
crucial difference. My Bill ensures that disabled people can move to
another area, confident that they will receive the support they need to
enable them to continue to play an active role in society. The manner
in which the council meets those needs may be different because of the
different configuration of local community and care services but it
should not reduce choice and control, and the ability to achieve the
outcomes they need. I believe that the Care Bill has the same intention
but I would welcome confirmation that this is indeed the case. There
are questions about bureaucracy and enforceability but the detail can
be fleshed out in
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000139">There
is one other matter I want to flag up today. Those who receive their
care not from a public authority but from a private body lack the full
protection of the Human Rights Act. The Joint Committee recommended an
amendment to the Bill to put this right but the Government have not
addressed it. It is a loophole that must be closed. I will be
interested to hear the Minister reflect upon that
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000140">I have
great expectations of this Bill’s capacity to change the way
that care and support are delivered in the future. We have waited for
this a very long time. We must not let the opportunity slip through our
hands. We are all interdependent. We all need to feel safe and valued.
We all need our dignity respected. We must take heed of those
“experts by experience”, of which I am proud to be one.
We have much to offer the debate on how we create care and support
services which maximise the well-being of those who need them. I am
sorry if I have taken longer than many other noble Lords may for the
rest of this debate but I feel so strongly about this issue. We have
much work to do and I am happy to do my

The Joint Committee recommended that this should be dealt with in the
Bill. The answer is that it is inappropriate that children should
receive adult care. However, that was not the point the Joint Committee
sought to make. Its point was that the Joint Committee considered that
there can be a relationship between the care provided for the adult and
the child providing that care.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052162000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000152">One of the important
factors is that the child’s obligations of care, which are often
undertaken cheerfully and voluntarily, do not cause damage to the
child. The imposition and undertaking of undue burdens of care
for adults, which may be given out of love, affection and loyalty to
the adult, may be damaging to the child. I—and I think the Joint
Committee as a whole—believe that this is an important factor to
be put into this Bill. The regulations and legislation about
care of children are contained in five different statutory provisions,
starting with the Children Act 1989. There have been others since and I
gather that there are about six different provisions of
guidance on these matters. The children are surely entitled to
some degree of simplification, just as the adults are, by this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000153">Another
point I shall touch on is the question of guidance. The Joint Committee
recommended that guidance should be by way of a code, which should be
available and endorsed by Parliament. However, the Government have
said: “This is not really necessary. It is not quick enough;
things change so quickly that we need to change them all the time,
therefore it is not appropriate in this situation to have a
code”. We expect a lot of social workers and often they are the
people who take the burden of complaint when something goes wrong. It
cannot be right to have a lot of different pieces of paper for social
workers to know what the guidance is—and when the guidance
changes the pieces of paper just increase. They do not always seem to
destroy the previous pieces of paper, so the difficulties for people
trying to carry out this work are increased by that system.</hs_para>

remain of the view—which we can discuss in Committee—that
guidance should not be ad hoc pieces of paper, but a code, which can
last for a reasonable time. After all, the statutory provisions have
lasted some time. There are many other matters that one could raise,
but I do not want to find myself shortening the time available for

Lordships will many times have heard me and others—whom I have a
habit of referring to as the usual suspects—detail how
inadequate social care systems are for meeting the needs of the
increasing numbers who need them. “The system is not fit for

and “a lottery”—all those are familiar phrases to
your Lordships’ House. So it is a great pleasure to welcome a
Bill which attempts to address some, though by no means all, of the
problems. Importantly, it addresses the issue of the law relating to
social care. It encapsulates proposals made by the Law Commission
report in May 2011. The Law Commission pointed out that the law
relating to adult social care stretched back to the Beveridge
reforms of the 1940s and included a plethora of other Acts,
including the National Assistance Act 1948, parts of which are still in
force. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:19:53"></hs_TimeCode> law

Law Commission originally proposed that there should be a tightly
defined process for determining the scope of adult social care. But
when it consulted very widely, it decided instead to define the purpose
of adult social care as promoting or contributing to the well-being of
the individual. That recommendation was accepted by the Government and
is central to the new policy. The whole of the new policy structure is
shaped by the well-being provision, although I share with the noble and

Secretary of State for Health in this regard.</hs_para>

very important change that has been made for carers is with regard to
finance. The draft Bill did not make it clear that, as in the case of
the person with care needs, a carer’s need for support should be

draft legislation could have meant that carers could be wrongly charged

said that this was not their intention and they have made it clear that
carers must not be charged. However, what is a carers’ service

other areas about carers will need careful scrutiny as the Bill goes
through and I hope that the Minister will comment on these. The first
is the issue of young carers, as has already been mentioned. The Joint
Committee that scrutinised the legislation called for amendments to
ensure that young carers get equal rights to assessments and support in
law, both in this Bill and the Children and Families Bill currently
before Parliament. The Government have made some limited changes that
mean that where a young person receiving care is in transition between
children's and adult services, the circumstances where they or a young
carer would be covered by provisions in the Bill would ease this
transition.</hs_para>

positive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:25:10"></hs_TimeCode>. Parent

no doubt that the Care Bill has the potential to make major
improvements to how social care is delivered. However, we shall have to
focus very carefully on several issues, apart from those I have
mentioned already, if it is to achieve that potential. I will just list
them now. The first is national eligibility criteria and where they are
to be set: there is a great deal of anxiety about that. The second is
the role of advocacy in helping people negotiate a system which, by the
Government’s own admission, is complex and difficult to
understand. The Joint Committee thought that advocacy ought to be part
of the element of information and advice, but the Government have not
accepted that. There is also, of course, the old issue of integration
of health and social care, which we all know is so vital; the
Government have recently made renewed commitments to such
integration. Also under this heading, we need to look at the
role of prevention, which is similarly such a vital part of
integrated
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:26:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:26:57"></hs_TimeCode>.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:27:09"></hs_TimeCode> is also
the vexed issue of funding, on which I look forward to spending many
happy hours. In order to make the vision encapsulated in this Bill a
reality, the Government and the nation simply have to make resources
available. Not to do so is a false economy and will store up many
more problems for the future.</hs_para>

hope our debates will enable us to look at a broader vision too, such
as that encapsulated in the <I>Ready for
Ag</I><I>e</I><I>ing</I><I>?</I> report from the committee chaired by
my noble friend Lord Filkin. If anyone imagines that the Bill before us
today provides a long-term solution to all the problems in social care,
they are very much mistaken. I hope the Minister will be able to
acknowledge this. Recently I gave a lecture at King’s College
entitled, “Social Care: Our Biggest Problem or Greatest
Opportunity?”. My conclusion was that it was both. My noble
friend Lord Filkin’s report is the clearest call yet that we
have had for a new vision for social care—a different settlement
for the older people we will all become. This is not just a matter for
health and social care, but for whole communities, the whole of
government and all political parties. This Bill is a welcome first step
towards that new vision—or new settlement—but we must
never lose sight of the fact that it is only a first
step<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:28:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_21_PT_1/BB7AC0C2F24A1318746F82B57624248EAA35F7A7" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 May 2013">Tuesday,

Tyler of Enfield:</Member></B> My Lords, I start by saying how very
strongly I welcome this Bill, which I also see as a landmark piece of
legislation, addressing 
<?notus-xml column=764?>one of the key social policy issues of our time. After decades of
putting this issue in the “too difficult to deal with”
box, and with earlier reports gathering dust on shelves, this
Government, in very difficult economic times, are finally establishing
the architecture which will allow for the capping of catastrophic
social care costs—something that has created fear for many
families up and down the country. Many people deserve credit for
getting the Bill to this stage—including, of course, my noble
friend the Minister—but I, too, particularly want to pay tribute
to the outstanding work and tenacity of my honourable friends Paul
Burstow and Norman Lamb in getting both the policy and the legislation
to this stage.</hs_para>

better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:29:20"></hs_TimeCode>. All my
other remarks will be made within this context and reflect my wish to
strengthen the Bill still
further<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:29:31"></hs_TimeCode>. Also, I
will focus in particular on issues affecting carers, who contribute so
much to their loved ones, families and to society, but who too often go
unnoticed and unvalued. However, I do not claim to do so with anything
like the same degree of expertise as that of the noble Baroness, Lady

welcome in the Bill and the recent changes which have been made as a
result of the excellent pre-legislative scrutiny undertaken by the
Joint Committee mean that it offers an ambitious and positive vision
for the future of social care. It is also an important consolidation of
the existing social care law. It introduces for the first time new
rights for carers, giving them the same rights to assessment and care
services from local authorities as those they care for, which is
something that I welcome. However, as so many others have said both in
this House and outside, much of this will hang on the amount of funding
that is available for social care, a matter that I suspect we will
return to time and
again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:30:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

highlight the following key provisions. I turn first to the new
well-being principle, which is something that I strongly support, in
particular the fact that carers are now covered by this important duty.
Secondly, the new requirement on local authorities to ensure that there
are sufficient care and support services to meet current and future
needs is absolutely critical. Thirdly, we have the introduction of a
national eligibility threshold for care services, alongside a new
assessment process and eligibility criteria. This will make the way
people are treated when they apply for care more equitable and easy to
understand, including when they move away to different parts of the
country. Fourthly, at the heart of the Bill are paving clauses to allow
for the introduction of regulations setting out the level of the cap on
social care costs and changes to the care means test. This is of course
the architecture, and there will be plenty of debate to come on the
appropriate level of that cap. While I very much welcome the increased
level of the care means test, which has already been announced, I hope
that as the economy improves and more resources become available, it
will be possible to reduce the level of the cap to something more akin
to that suggested by Andrew Dilnot. Finally, there is to be a duty on
local authorities to provide information and advice, again with the 
<?notus-xml column=765?>explicit inclusion of carers. This is important as currently far too
many carers feel that they have missed out on financial support as a
result of not getting the right information and advice early
enough.</hs_para>

the Bill I will want to focus on four particular areas, and I shall say
something briefly about them now. I turn first to well-being. As I say,
I am a strong supporter of the well-being principle underpinning
everything that happens in social care, but like the Joint Committee
and other noble Lords who have already spoken, I would like to see it
extended to the Secretary of State so that the whole pack of cards is
fully aligned. We hear much, quite rightly, about the importance of
horizontal integration between health, social care, housing and other
services. In my view, what I would call vertical integration within the
care system is equally important, and I will be pressing for this to be
incorporated in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000175">The
second area is that of dignity. In recent times, we have seen and heard
of shocking failures in the care of older people across both the health
and the social care sectors. Moving forward, we need to see a major
cultural shift to ensure that dignity is embedded in everything that
happens, along with a positive attitude to ageing and working with
older people, a point that the recent report on ageing from the Lords
Select Committee on Public Service and Demographic Change, of which I
had the privilege and pleasure to be a member, made loud and clear.
Public confidence in the current social care sector’s ability to
treat people with dignity is very low. A recent survey showed that only
26% of the public are confident that older people receiving social care
are treated with dignity. We have a great opportunity here. The Care
Bill could, for the first time, embed dignity in legislation as a core
element of the well-being principle, thus placing it alongside other
crucial aspects of well-being such as physical and mental health, and
family and personal
relationships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:34:10"></hs_TimeCode>.

to add my voice to a pressing issue that unfortunately has gone largely
unnoticed in recent legislation and to which others have already
referred. Both the Care Bill and the Children and Families Bill
represent commendable and critical efforts to improve the lives and
enhance the rights of many people, but sadly, a particularly vulnerable
group appears to have slipped through the gap between these two Bills.
It remains mired in complex legislation and disadvantaged by limited
rights. This group is young
carers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000177">The
2011 census identified 178,000 young carers in England and Wales alone
and a further survey taken by the BBC in 2010 estimated the number to
be more like 700,000, with as many as 8% of secondary-school children
providing moderate to extensive care. As a group, young carers are
infamously hard to identify and evidence suggests that in many cases
the carer tries to keep this part of their life secret. But although
they may often be invisible, young carers and their rights are in
serious need of attention. Evidence suggests that young carers are
often rightfully proud of their roles and the invaluable contributions
they make to their families and the lives of those close to them, but
that does not mean that they do not encounter serious difficulties and
disadvantages—a point made so eloquently by my noble and learned
friend Lord Mackay of 
<?notus-xml column=766?>Clashfern. So while young carers work to look after the needs of another

certain cases young carers will be required to establish that they are
providing regular and substantial care with higher thresholds than for
adult carers. In other cases young carers will have to demonstrate that
they are in a household that is receiving services, and even then will
have only a discretionary entitlement to support. When scrutinising the
legislation, the Joint Committee called for amendments to ensure that
young carers get equal rights to assessments and support in law, both
in this Bill and the Children and Families Bill currently before
Parliament. In response the Government have made some limited changes
aimed at easing the transition between adult and children services,
both for young people receiving care and for young carers, and they are
welcome. But these changes do not change the fact that young carers
will have lesser rights to assessment and support than adult carers
caring for adults. Nor does it go far enough in placing a
responsibility on adult social care services to prevent inappropriate
caring by children—something which I would like to see clearly
included in the

Rix:</Member></B> My Lords, the introduction of the Care Bill is to be
welcomed. It provides the opportunity to fundamentally improve the
lives of disabled people and the legal framework for the social care
and support system. Social care is vital for people with a learning
disability. Good social care and support empowers them to live
independently and within the community. It means that they can be
valued members of our society and not marginalised and hidden out of
sight in institutions such as Winterbourne
View.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000182">The
system, however, is in crisis. Social care for working-age adults is
under-funded by at least £1.2 billion and thousands
are being excluded from services as local authorities tighten
eligibility criteria. It is a situation that the learning disability
charity of which I am president is only too well aware. Mencap research
has shown that the vast majority of councils have tightened 
<?notus-xml column=767?>criteria from “moderate” to
“substantial”, which is now by far the most common level.
Put simply, people with a learning disability are being left without
any care and support for basic needs, such as help with getting out of
bed in the morning, making a home-cooked meal, communicating with
friends and family and even getting out of the
house.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000183">The
report, <I>The Other Care Crisis</I>, produced by Mencap, the National
Autistic Society, Scope, Leonard Cheshire Disability and Sense, and
supported by economic modelling by Deloitte, highlighted that alongside
the moral imperative for action, investing in support for people with
moderate needs will ultimately lead to savings for the taxpayer. Well,
Clause 13 gives the Government the ability to set a national
eligibility threshold in regulations; however, setting the threshold at
“substantial” rather then “moderate” will
result in more than 100,000 people being denied the support that they
need. To prevent us going backwards, the Bill must be underpinned by an
appropriate funding settlement in June’s comprehensive spending
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000184">I wish
now to move on to safeguarding. Time after time, we have seen how
agencies have not taken safeguarding seriously, with horrific
consequences for people with a learning disability. There have been the
deaths of Francesca Hardwick and her mother Fiona Pilkington, the
murder of Steven Hoskin and, more recently, the abuse scandal at
Winterbourne View Hospital, where it took a whistleblower and
“Panorama” to expose the abuse meted out by
staff.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000185">The
Bill does much to clarify and strengthen the law, and address the
widespread concern that current procedures for safeguarding adults at
risk of abuse or neglect are inadequate. Putting adult safeguarding
boards on a statutory footing will better equip them to prevent
abuse and respond to it when it occurs. Nevertheless, it must be made
absolutely clear when safeguarding investigations are to be carried
out, their threshold and the process. However, the Bill also introduces
a welcome duty on local authorities to make inquiries when it suspects
that an adult is at risk of, or experiencing abuse or neglect, but
there is no duty on providers or other relevant partners to inform the
local authority when they suspect that an adult is at risk. This
appears to be an oversight that I hope will be addressed by the
Minister.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000186">I
should like also to touch on the cross-over between the Care Bill and
the Children and Families Bill, currently on Report in the other place.
We all know the difficulties that disabled young people and their
families face in transition to adulthood and how often young people
fall through the gaps as they move from children’s to adult
services. These two pieces of legislation offer a unique opportunity to
make this
better.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000187">The
Children and Families Bill will introduce education, health and care
plans, potentially up to the age of 25—something to be widely
welcomed. At the same time, the Care Bill introduces care and support
plans for disabled adults over 18. Young people aged between 18 and 25
could therefore have two different plans. It seems to make sense that
when a young person is eligible for both, they be brought together to
create a consistent approach. I hope that the Minister and officials
will work with interested parties, including 
<?notus-xml column=768?>Mencap and the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign to ensure that
these plans are complementary and do not result in separate processes
and
plans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000188">Clause
55 of this Bill gives local authorities the power to assess children

to undertake an assessment, it must give a written explanation for the
decision. The clause is welcome and will allow young people better to
plan their future because they know their entitlements. However, local
authorities will have to assess children and young carers in advance of
their 18th birthday only if they judge it will be of
“significant benefit” and,</hs_para>

request the assessment. If a parent or child is not told of their right

3 of the Bill focuses on health, specifically on the establishment of
Health Education England, which will be responsible for the planning
and delivery of education and training for the NHS and health
workforce. It is absolutely critical that the NHS meets the needs of
people with a learning disability. This is simply not the case at the
moment. The three-year confidential inquiry into the premature deaths
of people with a learning disability published its final report in
March of this year. The inquiry looked at the deaths of 233
adults and 14 children with a learning disability in the south-west. It
found that 37% of deaths would have been potentially avoidable if good
quality healthcare had been provided. As if to underline this, today
there was a report by the NHS Ombudsman, Dame Julia Mellor, on how
mistakes by an out-of-hours GP service and Basildon University Hospital
in Essex contributed to the death of a young woman with both physical
and learning
disabilities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000192">Unfortunately<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>,
this is no surprise to many families, who feel that blunders, poorly
trained staff and indifference are to blame for the deaths of their
loved ones. We await the Government’s response to the
confidential inquiry’s findings, and its recommendations on how
to prevent the needless deaths of people with a learning disability.
Clearly, the training of healthcare professionals is vital. I trust
that appropriate and acceptable amendments will be made during the
passage of the Bill through your Lordships’ House.</hs_para>

legislation. However, I cannot stress enough that if we are to meet the
aspirations of disabled people we will need to ensure that the

Bakewell:</Member></B> My Lords, there is no doubt that this is indeed
a momentous Bill. It will affect the lives of many who are already old,
and the many millions whom medical progress and judicious lifestyles
will bring to a multiplicity of years. It attempts to deal with what is
not simply an immediate domestic crisis, although of course it is that.
It is about a change in human society on a Darwinian scale: for the
first time in history the human race will be living substantially
longer than ever before. In Japan, there are already 50,000 people who
are more than 100 years of
age.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000195">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:49:19"></hs_TimeCode>
have to realise the scale of the change that is under way. When
Beveridge wrote his 1940s report he confronted five challenges: the
evils of squalor, ignorance, want, idleness and disease. Today there
are just as great evils stalking the old in this country: they are
fear, ignorance, need, loneliness and neglect. In dealing with the
problems that this creates, society has a mountain to climb. This Bill,
which is much needed, deals merely—and deals well—with
the immediate foothills. In doing so, it endorses two important
priorities, which I welcome. Part 1 defines the central concern of the
legislation as being the well-being of the individual. Later, the Bill
shifts the emphasis of legislation
towards,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13052162000249" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000249">“preventing

the first place. This is an honourable objective but there are many
obstacles that the Bill does not resolve. In examining and improving
this Bill, we must bear in mind the scale of the problems as they
already exist and the expectations that such problems will vastly
increase in
future.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13052162000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000196">Considered
as a “foothills” measure, the Bill may be judged a very
good one. It now includes many of the recommendations made by the Joint
Committee on the draft Bill, and I pay tribute to the
committee’s efforts. But there are many issues that we still
have to address more thoroughly so, on behalf of older people, I will
address the five evils I
enumerated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000197">The
first is fear: old people are haunted by what will happen as they age.
They fear having to give up their home to move into strange places
among strange people. The Bill goes some way in the implementation of
the Dilnot report recommendations to assure them on this account.
However, Dilnot had suggested a cap of between £25,000 and
£60,000; the Government have set the cap at £72,000. This
will clearly be of greater benefit to the wealthiest. It is not yet
clear what types of insurance packages might be offered to the less
well-off to cover their costs. It is obvious that with average earnings
currently at £26,500, many people will not be buying such
insurance at all. At the same time, the funding cap could create a new
form of regional inequality due to the wide variation in average house
prices in different areas of the country. In 
<?notus-xml column=770?>addition, with the increase to £123,000 as
the upper threshold for receiving means-tested support, the
King’s Fund estimates that the result will be an additional
100,000 older people in need of public funding. The fear will
persist.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000198">The
second is ignorance: many old people long ago took to heart the phrase
“from the cradle to the grave” and are still in shock
when you explain to them that the NHS comes free but that social
care—however it is defined—must be paid for. Confusion
about the difference between medical and social exists in the system
and the Bill makes a gallant attempt for care provision to integrate
the two. However, the difference remains: one is a free service and the
other must be paid for, either by the state responding to precise
criteria or by the individual. Given that no one would have conceived
things this way when the NHS was created, the dilemmas persist about
how to inform those who implement the system as well as its
beneficiaries about exactly how it works.</hs_para>

issues come to a head can be seen when an individual is discharged from
NHS care—a hospital—into social care. Caroline Charles,
the director of external affairs at Age UK, tells us that 6% of
hospital beds are occupied by people readmitted to hospital within a
week of discharge because their care arrangements have not been worked
out satisfactorily. The Bill tasks local authorities with integrating
care and health provision—a hugely costly and convoluted
undertaking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000200">I
will round up my final three concerns into one. Need, loneliness and
neglect all afflict far too many of our old people. The Bill’s
answer to these issues is to define need. The noble Lord, Lord Rix,
referred to this concern as it affects the disabled. Levels of need
were introduced and defined in 2003 as critical, substantial, moderate
and low. Different local authorities applied different criteria, but
the Nuffield Trust cites a recent survey that found that 82% of
councils now provide care only to those with substantial or critical
needs, an increase from 62% in 2005-06. The trend towards setting
higher needs thresholds is driven remorselessly by funding pressures on
local authority budgets. The Bill moves the responsibility for
eligibility to a central, nationally consistent measure—an
important and welcome step forward. However, whether it will succeed
in setting the criteria back to moderate, as so many of us
wish, depends very much on a substantial increase in
spending.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000201">So
we come remorselessly to the issue of money. With appropriate judgment,
the Bill loads local authorities with many of the tasks of meeting the
needs of older people, but without strong commitment to central
government spending, many of those changes will be unworkable.
According to Age UK, since the Government came to power, £710
million in real terms has been cut from social care spending, mostly as
a result of cutting local authority budgets at the very time when needs
are rising. ADASS reports that more than a third of local authorities
anticipate having to reduce services and a fifth expect to have to
increase charges. All of this is moving in the wrong direction and
towards further disasters and tragedies. The implementation of the
legislation calls for a commitment in the coming spending review to a
major increase in spending on social care.</hs_para>

as we contemplate the mountain peak of need from the foothills of
reform, let me reaffirm my suggestion: I believe that it is time for
England to have its own commissioner for the old. That would be
a unique role that would give such a commissioner access to
planning across different government departments. The life of the old
is influenced by housing, transport, justice, and now, with
the encouragement of David Willetts, education; each department should
have a strategy for the old linked across departments. Of course, a
commissioner for older people would be a new cost. In Wales and
Northern Ireland, where such appointments already exist, each
commissioner has a budget and an office, but it is already proving
money well spent in keeping people informed on the available options,
and keeping all departments immediately aware of needs and impending
crises. In the long term, that will represent major and consistent
savings. Such an appointment would help both the needy and their
providers to find their way around this confused and confusing system.

our health and social care systems can many of the issues recognised by
Dilnot be fully addressed. Nor would anybody suggest that the proposed
new funding arrangements will be a panacea, but they provide at least a

hypertension—many I suspect in this Chamber at the
moment—which is up 11% since 2006-07; 2.5 million 
<?notus-xml column=772?>are treated for diabetes, which is up 25%; 1.8 million have chronic
kidney disease, which is up 45% since 2007; 800,000 have long-term
cancers, which is up 79% since 2007; and 270,000 have long-term
dementia, which is a rise of 25% over that six-year

we seek better ways of preventing the onset of chronic conditions and
managing them more effectively in the community, or even better finding
cures, many of the worthy reforms in this Bill will merely provide
respite care. This is why I am so supportive of Part 3, the setting up
of Health Education England and the Health Research Authority as
arm’s-length bodies. The way we will transform the health and
care landscapes radically is by improving the education and training of
the workforce, and by giving it the tools to transform patient care by
using our outstanding research

Education England has already made a hugely positive start under the
excellent leadership of Sir Keith Pearson, but the need to move swiftly
to NDPB status to make sure that we align workforce planning with
education and training is essential. What is missing from the
legislation is a duty to future proof workforce supply into the NHS and
social care system. There should not be a three-year plan for LETBs but
a 10-year rolling target so that we avoid the feast and famine often
associated with kneejerk reactions from government Ministers as
problems of nurse, doctor and consultant shortages
appear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000209" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000209">We
cannot allow a return to local, short-term self-interest that is the
real danger for the LETBs; nor must we exclude the private and
voluntary sectors, the key role that they must play in workforce
planning, and—crucially—the contribution that they must
make to training and education. When he replies I hope the Minister
will say how the private and voluntary sectors will be brought in.
Incidentally, I am delighted that in Clause 82 there is now a duty for
Health Education England to promote research. I congratulate the draft
Bill committee for getting that into the Bill, but why does this duty
not extend to the LETBs? Improvements will come about only if all the
workforce recognises the value of research and puts it at the heart of
its daily routines. LETBs are crucial to this agenda. Perhaps the
Minister can explain why they have been excluded from that
duty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000210">There
are many other issues that need to be raised over Health Education
England, but one requires an urgent response. The damning criticism in
the Francis report about the role of healthcare workers is largely
ignored in this legislation, as are crucial elements concerning nurse
education. Francis was clear about the need to train, regulate and
register HCAs. These recommendations were also strongly made by the
recent commission that I chaired, but in the Bill there is no
regulation and no registration, and only a minimalist training
programme that is not
mandatory.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000211">Can
I suggest to the Minister that at the earliest possible date Skills for
Health is quietly retired, that new standards are set by the NMC and
that Health Education England is mandated to ensure high-quality
training with appropriate certification for all healthcare support
workers? I understand the challenges of adopting a fully fledged
registration scheme, but ensuring that any healthcare support worker
who cares directly for 
<?notus-xml column=773?>patients is trained to a mandatory standard, and
that training is certificated and registered for inspection with
employers, is surely achievable. Making employers legally responsible
for registering the competency of their staff and regularly updating
that competency safeguards patients, staff and the reputation of the

I am delighted with the progress made on the HRA so far. The HRA has
demonstrated that it is more than an enhanced national ethics service,
which I feared it might become, and I congratulate the Minister and his
colleagues on ensuring that it was given that freedom. The crucial next
step of creating an NDPB with scope to make the NHS and our social care
system the most research-intensive in the world is hugely exciting.
However, there remains timidity about the legislation in this Bill. In
2011, the Academy of Medical Sciences highlighted the need for better
and more streamlined regulation, and we are not there yet. Clause 93
gives the HRA the duty to promote the co-ordination and standardisation
of practice in the UK with regard to health and social care research,

regulation?</hs_para>

Technology Select Committee hearing, part of its inquiry into
regenerative medicine, one regulator said to the members, who included
the noble Lord, Lord Winston, that because the science was complicated,
so must the regulation be. That is what bedevils the regulatory
framework for research. The power of different regulators to gold-plate
their regulation continues to worry me. Does the HFEA really have a
role in embryonic stem cell research, or could its regulatory functions
be subsumed by the HRA or indeed be merged with the Human Tissue
Authority? Will the HRA have the powers to abolish, or at least to
recommend to Parliament the abolition of, unnecessary regulators, or
will those regulators, with their independence, still have the upper
hand?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000214">As we
move to more stratified medicines, regenerative medicine and greater
emphasis on genomics and bioinformatics, the key will be to move fast
with often small groups or lone patients. The current system of
regulation is too burdensome and cumbersome for us to be able
to act. The system is simply not fit for purpose. Surely we should be
seeking to strengthen the powers of the HRA so that it can
decide appropriate regulatory pathways, rather than
the existing regulators.</hs_para>

with National Health Service research and development permissions. The
HRA has done brilliantly in streamlining local ethics approvals, but
there are still difficulties with individual trusts over site
approvals. Not only does each site have to give approval, but if there
are variations to a clinical trial, the whole process has to be
repeated. This is nonsense if we are aiming for more trials involving
more patients at more sites. Simply publishing good guidance, as
expected in Clause 98, is insufficient. I hope the Minister will go
further and say how the HRA will ensure that trusts have regard to its
guidance. Of course, the success of research and the HRA will depend
significantly on public buy-in, an issue which the Joint Committee took
very seriously. Transparency is key, and the open publication of data
should be a 
<?notus-xml column=774?>statutory requirement for the HRA. The Association of Medical Research
Charities, which I chair, has just published <I>Our Vision for Research

why this Bill should be welcomed—and it is not often that one
can say that about a government Bill. First, it consolidates and
modernises the legal framework for adult social care. Secondly, it
creates a framework for limiting people’s exposure to crippling
costs for their care. Thirdly, it establishes the principle that the
well-being of the individual should be the animating purpose of social
care. Fourthly, it establishes rights for carers. Fifthly, it
establishes the principle of portability of care. Sixthly—a
slightly more parochial concern, in which I declare my interest as a
vice-president of the RNIB and a visually impaired person—it
renews the statutory basis for local authority-maintained registers of
visually impaired adults. We still have some work to do to ensure that
the system is maintained for visually impaired
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:10:31"></hs_TimeCode>. The

Bill, therefore, makes important progress in getting the framework
right. However, there is still major work to do to ensure that it is
adequately funded and implemented in the right way. Without this, all
this good work will come to nothing. Adult social care is now consuming
more and more of local government’s budgets, and is set to
consume virtually all of them in a couple of decades’ time.
However, four in 10 disabled people who receive social care and support
say that it does not meet even their basic needs for things like
eating, washing, dressing and getting out of the house. At present, the
shortfall in funding is conservatively estimated as being in
excess of £1.2 billion a year. Over the past three
years £2.68 billion, or 20%, has had to be cut out of
adult social care budgets. If greater integration of health and social
care budgets is to mean anything at all, it must mean a transfer of
resources from the NHS budget to fund adult social care

has important implications for the sections of the Bill that deal with
prevention—Clause 2; and eligibility—Clause 13. Getting
these right will be key to delivering the Bill’s potential, and
I will say a word about each of them. Prevention has the potential to
be a win-win. It clearly matters to individuals, who see their care
needs escalating without the kind of support that Clause 2 requires
local authorities to put in place. However, it matters not just to
individuals, but to 
<?notus-xml column=775?>cash-strapped councils as well. In the debate on the Queen’s
Speech, the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, spoke most interestingly of
their being three stages of

disability, such as a lack of mobility, the inability to reach or

£700 and £10,430 per person, depending on the individual
circumstances. This places a premium on the preventive aspect of care.

someone is discharged from hospital or loses their sight or

Bill represents significant progress on the prevention agenda. The Care
and Support Alliance, the coalition of more than 70 organisations
working with people with care needs, particularly welcomes the
references to preventing needs in the assessments and eligibility
sections of the Bill, in Clauses 9 and 13. Yet the Bill says nothing
about the importance of providing this kind of intermediate
care—what is increasingly referred to as reablement, which we
used to know as rehabilitation. Reablement perhaps focuses more on
getting people over the immediate short-term crisis. The Bill says
nothing about these things. This is especially regrettable when you
consider that a structured programme of rehabilitation and the
provision of minor aids and adaptations can be just the services that
the blind and partially sighted, and many other adults who become
disabled, need most if they are to remain independent. Clause 2 on
prevention will therefore need strengthening if we are to move towards
a care and support system with prevention at its heart. At the moment,
the accountability for fulfilling the preventing needs duties is weak
so, when we come to Committee, I shall look for amendments to
strengthen the lines of accountability through health and well-being

signal the Government’s intention to set out specifications for
different types of preventive services and to whom or for how long they

intermediate care, or perhaps even longer bursts of specialist
rehabilitation, get the help that they need? Can the Minister confirm

of the most important areas for reform of social care concerns the
question of eligibility. The Bill will fail to improve the social care
system for disabled 
<?notus-xml column=776?>and elderly people if eligibility is set too high. We are all familiar
with the impact that slashing social care budgets has had; many local
authorities have been raising the threshold at which people become
eligible for support. In 2005, 50% of local authorities set their
eligibility criteria at moderate needs; by 2012, 84% were setting their
eligibility criteria at the higher, substantial needs level. As a
result, just 14% of those with moderate needs are receiving care, and
at least 800,000 people with care needs are not receiving any support
at all. The introduction of an eligibility threshold under the Bill is
thus most welcome, but it will do little good unless the threshold can
be set at the equivalent of moderate under the fair access to care
services system, and the Secretary of State is required to have regard
to the duty of local authorities to promote individual well-being in
setting the
threshold<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:17:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052162000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052162000226">There
is no denying that this will be a daunting challenge, but there can

that needs assessments were unduly standardised. We need to get away

what I see as unnecessary changes to the definition of mental health

start with the new national eligibility criteria and personal budgets.
Overall, I support the Bill’s focus on this and believe that
giving everyone who is eligible access to a personal budget will
greatly improve their lives. However, accessing these budgets is a far
from simple process. For example, there are already significant
variations in the take-up of personal budgets between councils and
regions, and between different community 
<?notus-xml column=777?>groups. The official figures from the NHS information centre show that
while 29% of adult care users or carers receiving community services
had a personal budget in 2010-11, the rates ranged from 4% in Somerset
to 71% in Manchester. The figures suggest that progress on moving
people onto personal budgets is slowest in the south-west, where the
average take-up is around 18%, and fastest in the north-west, at around
35<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:21:17"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052189000005">Moreover,
the uptake of personal budgets among people with dementia still lags
way behind most other client groups. The Alzheimer’s Society in
a report in 2011 found that three in five people with dementia assessed

while 15% declined an offer of one. The report clearly highlighted the

am concerned that it was not considered necessary specifically to
reference advocacy within the duty to provide information and advice.
In meeting this duty, local authorities will be expected to provide
information and advice that is accessible and proportionate to all. Of
course, I recognise that an individual’s requirements for
information and advice could range from a leaflet or a face-to-face
conversation to long-term independent advocacy but, as the Law Society

in a really important point, the Law Society notes that Clause 2(3)
states that local authorities may be permitted to “make a charge

Mental Health Act, where there is an even stronger case for the
provision of effective and independent advocacy. I feel very strongly
that unless all patients subject to compulsory powers under the Mental
Health Act can access a truly independent mental health advocate, they
will continue to be at risk of missing out on the most basic elements
of care and support intended by the Bill. This is even more important
for those groups already experiencing significant inequalities, such as
those suffering from mental health problems who are from black and
minority ethnic communities. It is crucial that we tackle these
existing inequalities  
<?notus-xml column=778?>in the mental health system. I believe that
providing effective and independent advocacy would be an essential step
in doing
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052189000009">In fact,
I am very concerned about the relative lack of focus on mental health
in the Bill. Frankly, mental health is the biggest unaddressed health
challenge of our age and is costing our society and the economy
millions of pounds every day, not to mention the cost of the suffering
among individuals and families. Why, given the critical nature of
mental health problems, have the Government once again chosen to change
the statutory provision of free aftercare services for people who have
been treated under the Mental Health Act? I speak, of course,
about Section 117 services, which noble Lords will recall that this
House debated to a large extent during the passage of the Health and
Social Care Bill. Yet here we are again, faced with what I believe to
be an unnecessary and possibly harmful change to these vital services.
I will be seeking to make amendments in Committee unless the Minister
can explain how these changes help or improve provisions which may not
be perfect, but which ensure a degree of protection for those very
vulnerable groups of

is surely unnecessary, but more importantly—and this gives me
real cause for concern—given the history of local authorities in
trying to avoid their responsibility for aftercare services of this
kind, this new definition would enable local authorities to refuse
aftercare on the basis that the need is no longer related to the mental
disorder. Far from clarifying the position, this new definition adds to
the complexity and risk, creating a situation where more people are
denied access to these essential services.</hs_parafo>

of the vulnerable must be at the forefront of our efforts. Therefore I
welcome the statutory framework for adult safeguarding, which includes
the establishment of Safeguarding Adults Boards in local areas. The
Bill states that these boards will be required to produce safeguarding
plans and updates on progress, and that where a board “knows or
suspects” that “serious abuse or neglect” has
contributed to the death or serious harm of an individual, it will be
required to carry out a safeguarding adult review.</hs_para>

of concerns and questions around how these boards will be able to
exercise these functions effectively. For example, not only must local
authorities and the NHS work together, but neighbouring local
authorities must establish communication systems to ensure that all
knowledge on abuse issues is shared not just in a local area but across
areas, if another Winterbourne View is to be avoided. We also need
avenues of communication for carers and families to register concerns,
and for these to be looked at quickly. In fact, carers and families
should not only have input on the boards but, I suggest, be supported
to act as representatives on
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052189000014">Moreover,
effective safeguarding work cannot be disassociated from other aspects
of care and support provision. For example, with more and more people
with higher needs potentially being employers with personal budgets,
they will be vulnerable to abuse in their own homes. How will this be
safeguarded against? There can be no doubt that for these boards to be
effective, local authorities will require additional funding. Where is
this to come from? I will not add to the many comments about lack of
funding already made by other speakers; I simply pose the question
again.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052189000015">Finally,
as I understand it, the whole point of this Bill is to move away from
responding to crises and emergencies which can result in costly and
unnecessary hospital or residential care. The aim is rather to develop
person-centred and preventative approaches that meet real needs in a
timely and appropriate fashion. One group who especially need this are
those with social care needs who are entering or leaving prison. For
this group, care is often not of the same standard as it would be in
the community. In fact, a 2007 report by the University of Birmingham
for the Care Services Improvement Partnership, <I>Adult Social Care in
Prisons: A</I><I> </I><I>Strategic Framework</I>, identified major
shortcomings in the provision of social care in
prisons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0001.htm#13052189000016">Clause
69 could be a very important step in addressing these shortcomings,
particularly considering that around 70% of prisoners will have mental
health and substance misuse problems. Providing this care can have a
significant impact on reoffending and greatly enhance people’s
ability to rebuild their lives on release. However, for such benefits
to be realised, it is essential that there is continuity of care
between prisons and the community. We need to ensure that prisoners
have access to care that is equivalent to what is available in the
community. People receiving care before entering prison should continue
to receive such support, and any care provided while a person is in
prison should be continued through the gate. Local authorities, prisons
and probation services must work together to ensure that effective
links are in place. I would like some reassurance from the Minister
that this will indeed be an outcome from the Bill and one that he
recognises is important.</hs_para>

Bill are welcome and are long overdue. However, there are significant
omissions and there is a real risk that in the current economic climate
and with the background of funding cuts, nothing will really change. I
am concerned about those who are most vulnerable and whether we have
truly learnt the lessons from Winterbourne View and Mid Staffs. If we
continue to react to problems rather than resolving 
<?notus-xml column=780?>them at an earlier and more effective point, we will
place the most vulnerable in our society at risk. I hope that the

Emerton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for the
introduction to the Care Bill. This legislation provides the missing
links in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and sets out clearly the
responsibilities and the part to be played by local authorities in
providing the missing links towards achieving a fully integrated
service which aims to provide holistic care, from maintaining pathways
in well-being, disease prevention, sickness, care and support through
to end-of-life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:31:40"></hs_TimeCode>

also shows how the costs of the services will be met, ensuring that
advice and understanding will be available for all. The Bill’s
success depends on breaking down the organisational and professional
boundaries that have prevented progress previously. It will succeed
only if its three parts are fully discussed in Committee and then
implemented in line with the comments made on Second Reading.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:32:11"></hs_TimeCode> Committee
will address Part 3, followed by Part 2 and then Part 1. I firmly
believe that Part 1 will not succeed unless Parts 2 and 3 are fully
understood and addressed.</hs_para>

am a retired nurse and a carer so I approach the Bill from an
essentially practical perspective. I shall therefore start with the
provision making Health Education England a non-departmental body. This
change is vital if the body is fully to fulfil its responsibilities, as
the noble Lord, Lord Willis, said. The Secretary of State will issue a
mandate and this will be of great value to Health Education England,
which must work in tandem—and within a defined
budget—with a wide range of specialities and many different
bodies. The Government’s addition of Clauses 87(5) and 93(3)
from the draft Bill underlines the fact that planning for a period of
longer than one year is essential when considering workforce
requirements such as education and training which involve a long
lead-in period. Clause 88 sets out the importance of having sufficient
numbers of skilled workers to meet the health and social care
requirements. LETBs will have responsibility for planning for the
workforce and the skills requirements for a defined area but they must
also take account of the wider geographical requirements if
specialities and the time element are to be addressed, especially if
this is to be
cost-effective<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:33:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

assistants—support workers—have been a subject of concern
regarding training and the review by Camilla Cavendish which the Prime
Minister requested is due shortly for publication. Skills for Health
has published a list of skills that should be part of the training for
healthcare assistants. As we know, however, simply teaching a skill
without providing the background knowledge is of no value in delivering
quality care. Both Robert Francis QC and the noble Lord, Lord Willis,
recommended mandatory training. I hope that the Government will
seriously consider that after considering Camilla Cavendish’s
recommendations. I ask the Minister seriously to consider mandatory
training programmes which might link skills training to the
NMC’s care standards, which are the core of the nurse 
<?notus-xml column=781?>training curriculum. That would provide a greater
understanding for both the healthcare assistants and for the registered
nurses who are responsible for supervising and delegating to the
healthcare assistants. If high-quality care is to be delivered in the
NHS, in local authorities and, importantly, in the independent sector
of nursing homes and care homes, where standards are not always
compatible with high-quality care, then the matter of training for
healthcare assistants must be dealt with
urgently.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000022">Health
Education
England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:35:10"></hs_TimeCode> has an
enormous task in improving the provision of workforce data on all
disciplines and clarification is required about the part to be played
by the Centre for Workforce Intelligence and how this slots into the
Health Education England programme. Achieving the right numbers of
appropriately qualified people who are in the right place at the right
time is an enormous task but it is essential if safe, high-quality care
is to be delivered to the satisfaction of patients and their families.
There are already examples of shortfalls in all disciplines but in
nursing there are great disparities between those who produce
high-quality care and those who do not. These disparities usually
reflect the ratios of registered nurses to healthcare assistants and
the required level of supervision. The right numbers in the right
ratios are the most cost-effective and care-effective way of delivering
high-quality, safe patient care both in the NHS and in local authority
health and social care services. I hope that the two vital issues of
healthcare assistants’ training and the ratio of registered
nurses to healthcare assistants can be sorted out as a matter of
urgency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000023">Continuing
professional development is crucial to the future of integrated care
programmes. It is important that the values set in the NHS constitution
and within healthcare trusts, primary care and local authorities are
understood by all employees and employers. There is a need to encourage
onward development of all employees by implementing a sound appraisal
system which reflects the needs and aspirations of each employee and
results in an individual CPD programme. If this is not rigorously
followed through on, the issue of burnout and loss of commitment will
become apparent. In such circumstances morale falls and healthcare
provision can fail. Such a culture is not conducive to high-quality
care and is similar to that experienced in Mid

turn to the Health Research Authority. Evidence-based practice and
innovation depend on research findings. It is a great disappointment
that the constitution provided in the Bill is stated in such general
terms that it is impossible to determine whether there will be
multiprofessional representation on the board or among the employees.
All healthcare professionals now require a degree but the
responsibility for research has until now remained with the medical
profession and little attention has been paid to the other healthcare
professionals when considering representation on boards, in committees
and in terms of funding. How can innovations be developed without
research backing? Promises were given verbally during the briefing and
passage of the Health and Social Care Act but there is no evidence that
any notice has been taken.</hs_para>

Fundamentally, integration is vital and the most important ingredient
in successful health and social care, bringing together a huge band of

Browning:</Member></B> My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to follow
the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, in these matters. She has not only a
lot of knowledge, but a great deal of personal experience. I always
listen carefully to what she says. I refer the House to the register
and to my interests particularly in certain charities which I shall
mention. I, too, share the welcome that has been widely given across
the House to this legislation. It has great potential to improve the
lives of many people with a disability or who are elderly and frail.
Simplifying legislation that affects local authorities’ care
responsibilities is both timely and something that many of us hoped
would happen for some time.</hs_para>

concern about the ability to fund such an ambitious piece of
legislation. In the impact assessment available in the Printed Paper
Office, I noticed that the monetarised benefits actually outweigh the
public sector costs. If that is true, it is really to be welcomed, but
I must tell my noble friend at the Dispatch Box that in Committee we
will want to look carefully not just at the costs identified in the
impact assessment, but at what are perhaps the glaringly obvious
omissions, particularly future demographics. This Bill is very
generous. To a degree, it seeks to underwrite the costs for people who
currently do not 
<?notus-xml column=783?>receive state help with their care. The way in
which the population demographics work out in this way is
challengeable. I would say to my noble friend that what is really
important is that we do not raise expectations through this
legislation, only to find that they cannot be resolved.</hs_para>

personal experience. I remember some years ago when my son, who has
Asperger’s syndrome, was in his late 20s and lived permanently
at home with my husband and me. As the named carer, I received through
the post forms to fill in, asking me what my carer’s needs were.
Every time this form came, I am afraid that I wrote across it in large
letters: “If my son’s needs were met, my needs would be
minimal”. They probably caught me on a bad day. As any carer
will know, the reality was that sometimes even the very basic needs of
the person you are caring for are not met. In a way, this Bill promises
that this will be addressed. After all, what does
“well-being” mean if not the well-being of the whole
person? The well-being of carers is very much dependant on the
well-being of the person for whom they
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000032">This is
particularly relevant among those people who cannot advocate for
themselves. We heard in today’s debate discussion about people
with dementia, mental health problems and learning
disabilities—so ably expanded by my dear noble friend Lord Rix.
I have had an association with various autism charities and can say
that these people need somebody to make the case for
them—usually the carer, though there is not always an immediate
carer. It is really important that this legislation will fulfil its

a little concerned about one particular area. Although it is extremely
welcome that throughout this Bill there are requirements to
assess—for example, the person needing care or the
carer—if those assessments cannot be fulfilled, there will be a
huge feeling of let-down. My own experience, not just as a carer, but
having served for nearly 20 years in another place as a constituency
MP, is that all too often there is huge push-back and resistance to an
assessment, even when there is a statutory requirement to provide it.
This is purely because the people who are asked to carry out the
assessments know only too well that whatever their conclusions, they
cannot do very much about them because the resources are not there to
deliver what that person
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000034">It must
be pretty awful for the people who carry out those assessments to know
that if they do their job fully and properly, at the end of the day
there is not an awful lot they can do to make a difference to that
person’s life. I think my noble friend described the resources
attached to this legislation as being about the engine working better
rather than putting more petrol in the car. I would say to him that the
engine needs to work better and he needs to fill up a few more times,
otherwise I do not think that the resources will meet the
need.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000035">Looking
quickly at the autistic community, I mentioned earlier that there are
some omissions. This applies both to autism and to people with
dementia, perhaps more elderly people who go on to have
Alzheimer’s. There are a huge number of people who are still
undiagnosed. In the autistic community it is improving, 
<?notus-xml column=784?>particularly with younger children. However there is still an adult
community with needs that do not always come to attention. As with
those with learning disabilities, if they have been living at home with
elderly parents who themselves have a crisis, it is the crisis of the
person they have been caring for that comes to the attention of the
authorities. All too often, that means crisis management and huge sums

something which the Bill aims to address—I hope it is successful
and has been touched on by many speakers already today. This is the
relationship between health and social services. When I was a
constituency MP, I used to say, tongue-in-cheek, “We are having
an ‘Oklahoma!’ moment”. Often people would come to
my surgery with the typical problems of those who do not receive the
correct services, or are carers who are at breaking point and cannot
get anybody to understand their needs. For those who can remember it,
“Oklahoma!” has a song with the line, “The farmer
and the cowman should be friends”—but they never seem to
talk to each other. That is the “Oklahoma!” moment, and
it is quite easily resolved by Members of Parliament. When in my
surgery or on the phone I was presented with a problem that quite
clearly needed a group of people to sit around a table and talk about
it, I used to cut to the “Oklahoma!” moment as quickly as
I could. All too often, good things happen when an MP says to health
and social services, “I think you should get together”.
Indeed, I sometimes used to say, “Don't worry, I'm very happy to
come along to the meeting myself”, which usually galvanised a
few people. Problems were not always totally resolved overnight, but we
started to make progress. It used to occur to me, “Why do I have
to have this ‘Oklahoma!’ moment when all these people
could be doing all this for
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:50:11"></hs_TimeCode>?”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000037">I
say to my noble friend that, as we go through the Committee stage of
the Bill, I will want to pay particular attention to those parts that
seek to improve things so that we do not have
“Oklahoma!” moments. The structure must be such that
automatically there is dialogue and not stand-offs about who pays for
what, because the difference between who funds the social care and who
funds the health care is addressed in the Bill. All of this bodes well
for resolving many of these problems, but I still have concern that if

their families had sufficient money and suitable housing, were
warehoused in residential care with no hope of living any sort of
normal life. In the decades since, as we heard from my noble friend
Lady Campbell, we have witnessed the liberation of this group to live
fully integrated lives as part of the community. Some have been enabled

despite the fine words of Clause 1, these ILF users fear that current
government action is threatening to return them to institutional care.
ILF funding is ending and these people are being transferred to the
local authority system in 2015. Their fears are not exaggerated and
have been confirmed by the directors of social services, the Local
Government Association and the Government's own impact assessment as

have said that some councils will decide that residential care is a
less expensive option than supporting people to live at

weeks ago, a group of ILF users took this decision to judicial review.
It lost, but during the two-day hearing, it became clear that
transition funding to protect current ILF users is available only for

confined within their own home with only ‘life and limb’
care following the transfer of funding responsibilities to local
authorities? If this Care Bill is to fulfil its principle of
well-being, what level of funding do the Government believe is
necessary to ensure that we do 
<?notus-xml column=786?>not return to the days when disabled people with high support needs had

justified fears of ILF users serve only to highlight the current crisis
in adult social care which is failing to support disabled
people to do the basic things in life—basic needs such
as washing, dressing and getting out of the house. I will not repeat
the points that other noble Lords made so eloquently. However, as the
Care and Support Alliance has emphasised, this Care Bill will
fail to improve the social care system for disabled people if the
welcome proposal of a national eligibility threshold is set too high.
The White Paper's suggested threshold of “substantial” is
too high. For the ambitions of Clause 1 of the Bill to be
realised—that social care should enable participation in work,
education and society—it is essential that the eligibility
threshold should support that ambition, not demolish
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000047">It is
vital that the national threshold is set at no more than
“moderate” to ensure that prevention is at the heart of
the social care system. Prevention must lie at the heart of this Bill.
It will also depend on other government departments and other local
authority services playing their full parts to ensure that social care
expenditure does not escalate in an unintended
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000048">One of
the most important factors in prevention is housing; both the provision
of suitable housing and the aids and adaptation service. Countless
stories of people being unable to return to their own homes after
serious illness or accident because of inaccessibility are
heartbreaking. They also result in costs occurring elsewhere in the
system because of delayed discharge from hospital or expensive
residential care. Simple adaptations to a person’s home can
prevent the need for costly care, whether it is the provision of ramps
and handrails, lever taps or a downstairs bathroom when stairs become
insuperable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000049">This
applies equally to the need for supported housing especially for people
with learning disabilities. Frequently, local authorities do not even
seem aware of their legal responsibility to house this group. I
congratulate the Government on having listened to the Joint Committee
on the draft Bill and including the suitability of a person’s
home in the definition of well-being in Clause 1. During the passage of
this legislation, I will seek to ensure that housing also appears on
the face of the Bill in other relevant clauses so that it cannot be

Barker:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as one of the
usual suspects referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley.
Like many of the speakers in today’s debate, I am a veteran of
more care Bills than I care to remember. I wish to put on record my
admiration not just for my colleagues Paul Burstow and Norman Lamb, who
did a remarkable job getting this Bill to where it is now, but also to
a number of people—not least of whom are the noble Lords, Lord
Lipsey and Lord Sutherland of Houndwood—who over the whole of
the last decade started the debate which has got this Bill to where it
is today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:00:16"></hs_TimeCode>. An
awful lot of work has gone on in the last decade that has shaped this
legislation. It has to be clear, coherent and consistent; people and
their carers need to know what they are entitled to receive from social
care, what they will be expected to contribute and what their
entitlements will be. That has been a long process, but it is a relief
that we have finally got there.</hs_para>

lot in this Bill is admirable and it starts for me at the third
sub-heading in Part 1, which talks about the purpose of assessment.
Assessment is key to all of this Bill: the extent to which it is
possible to assess a person’s needs, means and support networks
and the extent to which social care, health and private insurance have
a common assessment process are the keys to whether the aspirations
that we all have for joint care can really and truly be achieved. At
the heart of it all is housing. We have known for some considerable
time that the care that an older person receives in later life depends
upon whether they own a property and the extent to which they can use
that to fund their care. This Bill goes a long, long way to ensuring
that other people—those who do not have properties at their
disposal—get the help that they need as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:01:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

here about the assessment process and much of it is extremely welcome.
However, there is one subsection—Clause 9(4), which looks at how
one’s need for support is assessed—which talks about the
need to look at what a person can do and the sources of support around
them in their family before an assessment for eligible needs can be
carried out. We need to be clear by the time this Bill finishes all its
stages that people and their families are being assessed on what it is
that they are able to provide by way of support and care, rather than
what they are expected to provide to make up for some of the
deficiencies of the care system at the moment. We do not wish to see
people and their families pressurised into providing more than they
possibly
can<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:02:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

which talks about the enduring responsibility of a local authority to
care for an older person even if they refuse to have an assessment. All
of us who have worked with older people know that horrible moment when
a carer finds that their mum has gone for her assessment and sworn
blind that she can do lots of things which on the her very best day she
might be able to do, but routinely she cannot. Here I also make the
point that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, and I always raise
on occasions such as this, in memory of Lord Weatherill. There are some
people, particularly Christian Scientists, who do not lack capacity but
who wish to refuse to have assessments and so on. Their views need to
be upheld<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:03:34"></hs_TimeCode>. I am 
<?notus-xml column=788?>extremely pleased that the need to assess
somebody’s financial resources is in the Bill. It is quite clear

about the cap on care costs and implement Andrew Dilnot’s
report. Again, there is much in this that is extremely welcome. It is
welcome that there are some things for which local authorities will not
be able to charge. The whole process of how one gets from the point of
an assessment of need to the point of eligibility is much more
complicated than many people realise. There will be things such as care
costs that people have already paid for in their own homes which are
not taken into account. The same is true for payments for their daily
living costs. We also know that the current system whereby local
authorities will pay up to what they call the usual rate—which
may be well below what an older person and their family believe they
need—will continue to endure under this new
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:05:01"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:05:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000057">It
is absolutely critical that this whole part of the Bill is scrutinised
in great detail, because there is a danger that this could end up like
the fares for a budget airline. You have an upfront figure, which by
the time you finally get to the airport, turns out to have so many
add-ons that it bears no resemblance to the original fare. If,
at the end of our process of scrutiny, that is what we end up with,
then the whole system will become discredited. We really need, above
all else, to emerge from this legislation with everybody knowing in
detail, with some certainty, what their costs are going to

of the issues on which the Government’s response to the joint
scrutiny committee was slightly disappointing was about drawing the
boundaries between health and social care. Those of us who have been
involved in working with older people for any length of time know that
when resources are tight, the ability of the NHS and local authorities
to withdraw and start pressuring people from pillar to post gets
tempting. There was an attempt in the draft Bill to differentiate
clearly between healthcare and social care. In the Bill that has
emerged now, it is less clear than it was originally. That will not
help anybody; it will simply set the basis for ongoing court cases
about what constitutes continuing care. Again, one of our main duties
in the passage of this Bill is to ensure that there is clarity on that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:06:48"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:06:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

payments for social care, we currently have a system of deferred
payments and we have some case law already on the way in which that
works. It is welcome that the Government wish to extend that and to
make it more consistent across the country. However, I hope that in
doing so, they have paid attention to the existing case law about when
people’s properties can be taken into consideration when other
members of their family are living in those houses. I have to ask the
Minister what financial modelling has gone into this part of the Bill,
because we are talking potentially about the deferment of a lot of
money for a lot of care for a very long time. Given the state of
finances of local government at the moment, we could be talking about a
policy of quantitative worsening of social care, rather than
quantitative easing of

move on quickly to safeguarding. It is very welcome that we are finally
getting a statutory power to investigate the potential abuse of older
people. People such as the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, have been
working for 20 years towards a time when we put the abuse of older
people on as serious a statutory footing as the abuse of children.
However, the changes to Section 47 of the National Assistance

withholding access to somebody who may be being abused, may

means testing when patients are dying does not seem to be compassionate
or caring. The argument for providing free social care at the end of
life is strong. It will deliver the Government’s vision of
integration and choice. Research by the Nuffield Trust shows that a
saving of some £52 million a year could be made through reduced
hospital admissions. I hope sincerely that the Government will amend
the legislation to do this, or accept an amendment that I will bring
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:12:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is also the issue of the support that the carers of cancer patients get
or, rather, that they do not get. Almost 1 million cancer carers give
their valuable time to this, saving services probably in the region of
£12 billion a year, yet half of them receive no
support at all and the other half very little. This is partly because
most of them do not see themselves as carers and are unaware of their
rights; fewer than 5% get any assessment at all. What would help is if
a similar duty as the Bill puts on local authorities is placed on the
NHS to work with local authorities to identify the support needs of

concern to me relate to Clauses 55 to 63, also referred to by the noble
Lord, Lord Rix, and I associate myself with his comments. I want
particularly to make a point about the support and care of children and
young adults during the transition period. More than 40,000 children
and young people aged between one and 19 in England have long-term
conditions which, for the most part, will end their lives or for which
they will require palliative care. They may have complex health
conditions and severe disabilities, and for the most part they are
looked after by parent carers. This is not end-of-life care, but care
that brings some comfort, respite, the relief of suffering, and a
little bit of quality of life. Evidence shows that while they are
children and in their early teens, these young people receive support
from children’s services. In their late teens they begin to
receive services from adult services, but that support is often
reduced, fragmented and disjointed. Parents describe this transition of
care as “standing on a cliff, about to fall into a black
hole”. It is not difficult to imagine the stress and anxiety it
must cause to young people and their carers.</hs_para>

proposals in the Bill are a step forward, but in my view they need to
go further. A consortium of charities which has grouped together under
the charity, Together for Short Lives, feels that this provision needs
to be strengthened. The Bill should make it clear that when a young
person reaches the age of 14, local authorities should initiate
transition planning with the young person, their family and the
relevant agencies, so that by the time they reach the age of 16 a
five-year rolling programme for their support and care is in place. I
hope that the Government will be sympathetic to this and that the
Minister, if he is able to do so, would be willing to meet with
representatives from Together for Short Lives and myself.</hs_para>

relates to performance rating. I support in principle the idea of
introducing a system that assures quality of delivery of health and
social care. Suffice it to say at this stage that whatever the final
system that is introduced is like, it has to be credible and have the
confidence of both patients and health professionals. If it is going to
be based on three domains of quality—clinical effectiveness,
patient experience and patient safety—the dataset needed to
achieve this in an equitable and fair way is available for some areas,
but not all of them. I hope that the Government will see the
introduction of assessment as formative and embedded over a
period of time, evolutionary in helping to develop appropriate datasets
leading to improved services, rather than a one-off assessment that
identifies only failures and shortcomings. 
<?notus-xml column=791?>I am very familiar with a system based on standards that encompass the
three quality domains of clinical effectiveness, safety and patient

a similar methodology. I look forward to the debate on this subject and

I am also encouraged by the appointment of Professor Wendy Reid as the

Wigley:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome this very important Bill. I do
not want to repeat the points that have been made, but I will add my
support to the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell of
Surbiton, on the need for real independence and dignity for disabled
people and to the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, on
the housing needs of disabled people of working age. I also share the
concern expressed by her and by many speakers in this debate that this
Bill will work only if adequate resources are available. I noted the
comments made by the noble Lord, 
<?notus-xml column=792?>Lord Rix, that the system is now in crisis and that people with real
needs are left without support, which is a worrying
situation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000074">I
want to highlight matters relating to the detailed working of this Bill
and the complexity that arises in some areas by virtue of the fact that
social care is devolved in Wales to the National Assembly, since some
of the provisions in this Bill impinge on devolved responsibilities.
First, can the Minister confirm that legislative consent Motions have
been agreed with Ministers in Cardiff and that there are no outstanding
issues that need to be
resolved?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000075">Secondly,

understand that additional spending in England of about £1
billion should generate about £60 million of
consequential spending in Wales. Can the Minister confirm that a figure
has been agreed, and can he tell the House what it is? There is the
associated question of the Barnett formula being generally inadequate
and particularly inadequate in this context, where the age and need
profile in Wales differs from that in England. Wales has higher levels
of disability for historical and industrial reasons, and thousands of
people retire from England to the beautiful coastlines and countryside
of Wales. They are very welcome to come, but there is a cost
implication. Wales has the highest proportion of older people of any
country or region in the United Kingdom. Nearly one in four are over 60
years of age, and that is expected to increase by a further 5% over the
next 10 years. The noble Baroness, Lady Browning, rightly emphasised
the need to be aware of the demographic changes that are taking place
and the effects that they will have. Any funding system that is based
merely on total population relativities will inevitably generate
inequalities.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13052189000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000076">Thirdly,
the Government of Wales are currently in the process of reorganising
social care in Wales. The Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Bill
is similar to this Bill in many aspects and will, inter alia, increase
the number of services for which people can claim a direct payment from
the local authority, introduce national eligibility criteria, and
provide for portable assessments to avoid the cost and trouble of
reassessment. These detailed provisions need not exercise your
Lordships’ House. What is of concern, however, is that any
provisions in this Care Bill with an England and Wales remit will
impact on the changes taking place in Wales under the other
legislation.</hs_para>

place in Wales will have an implication for cross-border placements and
the portability of care packages. Can the Minister tell the House
whether discussions have been concluded with Ministers and officials in
Cardiff and whether all issues in this area have been resolved? In
particular, has there been a resolution of the portability of social
services assessment undertaken in Wales in the event of persons
choosing to move to England, and likewise of the portability of care
packages for persons choosing to move from England to Wales? I am not
referring to cross-border placement, which is quite another matter.
Will the UK government cap on social care costs follow an individual 
<?notus-xml column=793?>who moves to Wales from England and is already in receipt of a care
package, and if the cap is different in Wales, which of the two would

difficulty to which cross-border issues give rise within England
between local authority areas is covered by Clause 36. This provision
deals with people choosing to move for genuine reasons, but it does not
appear to deal with those moving between England and Wales for genuine
reasons. Likewise, Schedule 1 deals with the cross-border placement
question, and paragraph 1(2) deals with the placement from
England to Wales, but it does not appear to specify who has the
responsibility for paying. Perhaps the further provisions referred to
in paragraph 1(5) are meant to cover this, but it is far from clear and
we need some assurances on the matter. It is also less than clear that
paragraph 6(2) of Schedule 1 is adequately rigorous to
provide for full recompense or that it is relevant in all cases. I
should say that the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Bill also
fails to clarify these cross-border issues. These are matters that we
certainly will need to clarify and to follow up in

I refer to the proposed health research authority provided for by
Clause 96. Clause 98 states that the HRA’s remit is to promote
the co-ordination and standardisation of practice in the UK in the
regulation of social care. The Bill places a duty on the HRA and the
devolved Administrations to co-operate with one another, but how on
earth is such a duty going to be enforced? And what happens if
disagreement arises between conflicting expectations in Wales, Scotland
and England? Does the Secretary of State in England have to act as a
referee in such a dispute? I am not arguing against the need for such
co-operation, of course, but legislating for these matters never
guarantees the desired outcome. All these issues are points for further
consideration in Committee. Meanwhile, I am very content to support the

Lipsey:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as unpaid
president of SOLLA, the Society of Later Life Advisers. I want in my
remarks to concentrate on the Dilnot-related parts of the
Bill—that is to say, the cap and the related changes to the
means test. I should state straightaway that I welcome the cap. Indeed,
I hope that the House will not think it unduly immodest of me if I
claim to be, if not its father, perhaps its grandfather. In the
minority report of the 1999 royal commission, which I signed with the
noble Lord, Lord Joffe, there was a proposal that people should have
their care costs covered if they were in care for more than five years.
I was not even able to command the majority in the minority on that
matter, because the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, did not agree with me on
that, although we agreed on everything else. So right from the
beginning I have been a strong supporter of people being protected
against catastrophic costs of care. I emphasise the word
“catastrophic”, because I am also extremely glad that the
Government opted for the 
<?notus-xml column=794?>£75K cap, which I referred to in this House
in my initial reaction to the Dilnot proposals, and not for the much
lower figures put forward by the commission, which frankly I thought to
be
unaffordable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000081">I
hope that my credentials as a broad supporter of what the Government
are doing are established and that it will not seem impossibly
contrarian if I point out two disadvantages of the proposed scheme that
we need to bear in mind throughout proceedings. The first is that it is
still pretty expensive—£1 billion by the end of the next
Parliament, rising to £2 billion by 2030, according to
calculations by the Health Economics Group at the University of East
Anglia and the LSE’s PSSRU. In the times of austerity in which
we are living, any increase in public spending needs to be very
thoroughly justified, because of its implications for taxation if
nothing else. There is a particular danger in spending money on helping
people to pay for care. The real acute and immediate crisis that we
face is not about people paying for care; it is about the amount of
care that we are providing, on which spending has been cut by about
£710 million in real terms since this Government came to power.
There are loads of figures, but that is the one that hit me. People are
doing without services. If you do not have substantial needs, you do
not get services any more. When the priorities come to be weighed, that
seems to me to be the pre-eminent one.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052189000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000082">There is also the issue
of where this money goes. The Dilnot proposals—for all their
advantages, which I will come back to before noble Lords get convinced
that they should not go forward—do little for the poor. They
mostly benefit the better-off. That is because poor people get paid for
in full under the present means-testing system. It is the better-off
who have to pay. Of course they do not like that and it understandably
creates a furore. Even the Government’s plan, which I
will call “watered-down Dilnot”, benefits most the
better-off. According to the same academic sources that I quoted, the
plans in 2030 will be worth £52 a week to people over 85 in the
top quintile by income—the top 20%—compared with just
£20 a week to those in the lowest quintile. That is an
inevitable consequence of replacing means-tested benefits with targeted
universal benefits, which is why some of us are chary of the current
fashion for scrapping means
tests.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000083">Dilnot
argued that the cap will protect a bigger share of the assets of those
with modest wealth than those with lots of wealth. That is true. It is,
however, also true that those with modest wealth will have to
contribute to the cost of their care a higher percentage of their
wealth than will richer people. It was therefore as difficult a choice
for me as it was for Joel, my noble friend Lord Joffe. I go back to the
only dispute that we ever had.</hs_para>

disadvantages had to be weighed two important advantages. One is that
there is real injustice in the present system, because it is a total
lottery as to whether you need care or none at all. It seems unfair
that one set of people, however well off they may be, have their wealth
wiped out because they happen to need a lot of care, while more
people—about two-thirds—get away with the full loot to
leave to their children because they do not happen to need care. That
lottery is unjustifiable.</hs_para>

have been in politics for some time and, frankly, I thought that it
would be a tremendous advantage if, at reasonable cost, we could get
this issue of paying for care off the agenda and concentrate on the
things that really matter—the money that has to go into care
services, the way that those services are organised and the way that
individuals get more control over those services. The issue of the old
having to sell their homes to pay for care is a distraction from a more
important debate, and the proposals, at modest cost, will take it off
the agenda. It is right to proceed with them, but I am sorry that the
cap changed from £75,000 to £72,000 and that it has been
brought in a year earlier as a result of the Budget. That means
increased Exchequer costs earlier, which is robbing money that should
go on
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000086">Incidentally—this
is a side issue, but important—the administrative burden on
local authorities is quite alarming. Getting this done by 2016 is a
major deal. Authorities will need to invest huge amounts in systems,
staff, advice and all these things—perhaps £500 million
just for the administrative costs. The Government must—I repeat,
must—pay for that in full, but it will be nip and tuck as to
whether it is done in an orderly fashion to the new timetable. If that
had not been done, we would have had a little extra money. At quite
modest cost, the government scheme could be tweaked to do more for
those with relatively modest wealth and we would not have to worry as
much that all the benefits were going to the better-off.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052189000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000087">This now gets a bit
geeky, but I will persist. The Government propose to raise to
£123,000 the limit on how much wealth you can have before you
stop getting means-tested support. That is good; it represents the
value of a cheap house in some parts of the country. However, it is not
very good. I do not know how many noble Lords are fully aware of this
but, in fact, if you have £123,000 in assets and that modest
house, all the money that the Government are trying to give you under
the means test will be taken away from you. Why is that? It is because
of a little-known thing called the tariff. Under the present system,
for every £250 that you have in excess of about
£14,000 in assets, you lose £1 a week in benefit. You
would require a 20% return on your savings—£50 a year on
£250—to benefit. The money is taken out of your pocket by
this tariff in the means test as it is put in by the increase in the
ceiling.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052189000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000088">How
could this be changed? It could be done easily. Suppose that the tariff
was changed so that, instead of losing £1 for every £250
of your assets, you lost £1 for every £500. Therefore,
those with assets of up to £123,000 would get decent benefits
from the state towards the costs of care. Nor would the cost to the
state be great. According to the academics whom I quoted, the cost
would be around £150 million—less than a sixth of the
cost of the Government’s proposals. A small slice would go to
those with modest income and wealth and, if necessary, it would reduce
the very large slice going to those with substantial income and wealth.
In other words, if this proposal were to be combined with the cap
proposals, we would have a much less regressive package. If it were
necessary to fund it by raising the cap from £72,000 to, say,
£80,000 or a little more, that would be a price well worth
paying for a more socially just solution.</hs_para>

party has rightly criticised the Government, mildly, because their plan
does not do enough for the less well-off. Here is a ready-made
solution. The Minister was described at a meeting earlier this
afternoon as a saint. I would not dissent from that. I do not mean to
be offensive to the noble Earl, but he would not like the tag put on
him that he cares only for the better-off. When the Bill goes to
Committee, I am confident that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, will stand up
and accept amendments to reduce the tariff to £1 for every
£500, thereby making this Bill much more progressive and helpful
to those hard-working people on modest incomes who want their fortunes
to be
protected.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_21_PT_1/0420D39A506C34E24A2AFDEEEC01A3E5D07457AC" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 May 2013">Tuesday,

Bichard:</Member></B> My Lords, I should declare an interest as chair
of the Social Care Institute for Excellence—or SCIE, as it known
in non-media circles. The first chair of that organisation was the
noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, so I am conscious that I have rather a
lot to live up to, but I will do my
best<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:36:32"></hs_TimeCode>. I took on
that role because I believe that social care is the most important
social issue for the next decade or two. That means that this is one of
the most important Bills to go through this House in this Session or,
indeed, at any time. As others have said, the Bill has the potential to
redefine the landscape of care and to offer a new deal to those in need
of care, many of whom, let us not forget, are vulnerable and frail and
face difficult and complex problems and decisions about their future.
They have often contributed greatly to our society and their
communities, and deserve to be properly supported and sustained when
the need
arises<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:37:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Bill to applaud and welcome: the greater emphasis on prevention,
the cap on the cost of care, the responsibility to promote
individual well-being, the emphasis placed upon integration and
co-operation, and the new rights for carers. We can all applaud and
welcome those provisions. However, in Committee we will naturally look
at ways in which we can make the Bill even better. I want to suggest
five measures that we may
consider<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:38:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052189000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000092">First of all, I should
like to see an even stronger commitment to dignity at the beginning of
the Bill. The recent events in mid-Staffordshire and in individual care
homes must surely have taught us that whatever changes we make to
organisational structures, technology, financial systems, buildings or
even equipment, they count for little if personal dignity is not
afforded absolute priority on the ground. It must be the bedrock upon
which everything else rests. It can no longer be taken for granted or
left unsaid<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:38:55"></hs_TimeCode>.
Clause 1(2) refers to dignity, but in passing. It does not feature
strongly enough and is entirely lacking in other key provisions, such
as in Clause 1(3). I should like the very first clause to state boldly
that the general duty of all providers, not just local authorities, is
not only to promote individual well-being but to ensure that
individuals are treated with dignity at all times and in all
settings.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052189000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000093">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:36:00"></hs_TimeCode>
making my second point, I declare that I am a vice-president of the
Local Government Association. There is a danger that
Parliament—I use that term rather than
“Government”, because we all have a responsibility in
this—sees this Bill as an opportunity 
<?notus-xml column=797?>to make bold statements of good intent and then
immediately to pass on the responsibility for achieving them to local
government, with insufficient thought being given to the
consequences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000094">Local<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:49:22"></hs_TimeCode>
government rightly has a key role to play in this, but we all know that
it is bearing the brunt of budget cuts, and it would be irresponsible
of us not to take account of the pressures facing local authorities as
we debate the Bill. Others have already reminded this House of the
reductions that local authorities are making: £2.68 billion in
the last three years to social care funding, and another £800
million in 2013-14. Like many others, I can see no way in which the
ambitions of the Bill can be achieved without some additional funding
sooner rather than later. At the very least, in our discussions and in
our debates we should carefully make explicit and take account of the
practical implications of every clause and every proposal, so that we
do not just make bold statements of
intent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:41:16"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:41:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000095">My
third point is that there is a danger that in making these proposals
the Government do not examine closely enough how their own practice and
their own behaviour can make it more difficult for all those on the
front line to deliver the kind of integrated service we all want to
see. It would be quite wrong for the Government merely to encourage
others to go away and integrate without looking carefully at their own
practice and their own behaviour. The King’s Fund—I am a
member of its advisory board—says that in feedback from its work
with local health and social care leaders, one reason for the lack of
progress in developing integrated care is that some aspects of current
policy, practice and regulation are acting as serious barriers to
progress. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:49:22"></hs_TimeCode>
Government need to look at how Whitehall departments can be
made to work together more effectively. They need to look at the impact
that silo-based budgets, targets and regulation systems have on good
practice on the ground, and they need to look at some of the big
strategic issues, such as the interface between the NHS Commissioning
Board and clinical commissioning groups. This needs to be addressed
afresh.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000096">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:49:22"></hs_TimeCode>
the moment, a great many good things are happening out there, but very
often you are told, as we were recently in the Select Committee in this
House, that they happen in spite of Whitehall and in spite of
Westminster, not because of them. Maybe Clause 3 should refer again not
just to local authorities exercising their functions with a view to
ensuring integration but to Government. Let us not forget housing
providers. Why do we feel comfortable imposing statutory
responsibilities to co-operate on everyone except central government
departments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:43:36"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000097">My
fourth point relates to the importance of information and advice, and
to the need for this to be properly independent from providers’
interest. Clause 4 refers to the need for financial advice to be
independent, but we need to ensure that individuals are not vulnerable
to other advice that might disadvantage them but benefit providers.
Clearly, the Government have set their face, for the moment at least,
against a legal right to advocacy, while acknowledging in the
Explanatory Notes that advocacy might be necessary in some
circumstances. I wonder whether this issue would benefit from one
further look. Is it really not possible for us to 
<?notus-xml column=798?>come up with some affordable advocacy support for people who are, as I
said earlier, facing such difficult
decisions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:44:38"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000098">Finally,
I would like to see us making greater efforts to make care and support
provision more inclusive. At the moment, care homes, to take one
example, sometimes stand apart from their communities, and too often
communities seem content for that to happen. Such a situation would be
completely unthinkable with schools. As a result, opportunities to
improve residents’ quality of life are missed, and crucial
opportunities to identify unacceptable practice are missed too. We
cannot expect infrequent CQC inspections to be the only way to spot
poor care, and I believe that David Behan, the chief executive of the
CQC, agrees. More frequent visits from volunteers could make a big
difference. It is quite clear that relatives of residents are often
reluctant to complain, because justly or not they fear that this would
be held against their loved ones. We need stronger external
involvement, and we could help to achieve it by adding a duty in Clause
1(3) to take steps to ensure that care and support facilities are open,
transparent and accessible to local communities. It is already good
practice and we can see it happening in the best care and support
facilities, but it needs to be
uniform.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000099">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T18:49:22"></hs_TimeCode>
Bill could be a defining moment in the history of care in this country.
Care is an issue that should in large part rise above party politics. I
look forward to this House doing what it does best: playing a key part
in achieving the best possible legislative outcome, but ensuring most
of all that those in need of care are treated fairly, and always with
the greatest dignity and
respect.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13052189000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000164">6.47

Donaghy:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the introduction of the Care
Bill. There are areas which I hope to see strengthened, but it
represents a basic framework on which future generations should
be able to build. My concern is how we make the words a
reality. It is not the first time that this has been mentioned in
debates. Will future funding restraints prevent any real improvements?
How can we ensure the essential co-ordination between hospital care and
home or residential care? My final concern is around the capacity and
welfare of our workforce in health and social care and in local
authorities. To make the words a reality the Care Bill must, in the
words of Age
UK,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13052189000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000140">“make

Bill contains measures to ensure a single national eligibility
threshold for care services, but if, as the noble Lord, Lord Rix, has
already mentioned, the regulations set the minimum level at
“substantial” rather than “moderate”, it
would affect 100,000 people and would render a national system
meaningless. Age UK asks for the Bill to be strengthened in a number of
ways, for instance by linking eligibility for social care to the
achievement of outcomes based on the individual’s well-being, as
defined in the Bill. The requirements on local authorities to plan to
meet the diverse needs of their populations and to promote quality and
choice could be strengthened by requiring service commissioners 
<?notus-xml column=799?>to monitor and take action where necessary. Clause
8, describing the kinds of support which local authorities must offer,
should include issues such as

on turning words into deeds, good quality information and advice is
needed. The most stressful thing for any family caring for the frail
elderly is finding their way through the maze, feeling unsupported and
fearful that they are not accessing the best possible services for
their loved one. Website information is welcome, but some people need
more intensive help. The clause on advocacy has already been mentioned.
It should be strengthened, perhaps by creating a positive duty on local
authorities to ensure that someone has the help and advice they
need.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052189000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000103">Secondly,
despite not being written in the scope of this Bill, future funding is
critical for its success. As many of us have said in this and previous
debates, there have been real-terms cuts to social care funding: 7.7%
in 2011-12 and 6.8% in 2012-13. The rising levels of unmet need are
such that 800,000 people who need care now are not receiving it. The
Nuffield Trust calculates
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13052189000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052189000151">“there

certification of care workers. Long shifts and low pay are a real
problem in residential homes and often determine the quality and
commitment of staff. With all these new responsibilities being piled
upon staff by this Bill, we should not forget our responsibility to
meet their capacity and welfare needs. Also, the statutory requirement

have the effect, among other things, of introducing certainty,

communications, which is dealt with in Clause 4. The Dilnot report,

the Bill contains no provisions for defining the test for sufficiency

third area that I want to address is the question of direct payments.
The Joint Committee was quite right to propose that we should not be

the Government agreed to that in their response and to see no

not to be abuse but accidental mismanagement and complications arising
from it. It seems highly likely that some who ask for and are
allowed direct payment may find the subsequent commissioning and
managing of the services that they need stressful, complex and
burdensome. It may be a very good idea if the local authorities have an
obligation to provide friendly oversight of and help with the
management of direct payment services, at least in the first months of
their existence. It would be a great pity if the valuable ability of
people to specify and obtain what they need was allowed to suffer from

fourth and final area on which I should like to touch briefly is

Greengross:</Member></B> My Lords, I add my name to the list of noble
Lords who have expressed the view that the Bill is very welcome indeed.
I was privileged to serve on the scrutiny committee considering the
Bill. Integrating—or at least having co-operation
between—services that are so differently organised at the moment
is extremely difficult to succeed in, but essential if we are to get it
right. We are talking about an extremely vulnerable group in our
society. In fact, there is more than one group. There is a huge number
of frail, older people and a very large number of disabled people of
all ages. It is not fair or worthy of our society to think that people
can shop around for the services that they need. It is impossible, we
know that. They must be integrated.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052195000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000002">I have a very
simplistic view on this. I know that it is difficult to bring a
paid-for service and a service that is free at the point of delivery
together, but if the money is ring-fenced and put in the hands of
either the clinical commissioning group or the health and well-being
board, where they are mandated to mix up the money and use it in a
co-ordinated way, I cannot understand why that would not work. As I
said, that is my simplistic way of looking at this.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052195000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000003">Everyone has echoed the
fact that we need more money to make this succeed. We do, but Andrew
Dilnot and his colleagues demonstrated clearly that the amount of money
needed to make this succeed is a minute proportion of what we spend in
the National Health Service, primarily on acute services, and that if
we integrate those services we can achieve a great deal. We do not
always measure the savings that we will make on acute NHS services, as
a proportion of NHS costs, by getting this right. Those are not,
generally speaking, the right services to deal with the people
involved. People often need to go into hospital for short periods but
much of what they need can, and much more could, be provided in the
community.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052195000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000004">I
have previously spoken with the noble Earl about the innovation that is
necessary, including step-down facilities for people who do not need to
be in acute hospitals, like the Scandinavian model of patient hotels.
That would not be privatisation, as they would be NHS-funded contracted
services which provide private accommodation and family
care—opportunities for care rather than healthcare—with
access to medical specialists as and when necessary. All sorts of such
experimental schemes can be introduced if we mix the money. I think
that that is the
priority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000005">We
need to get rid of the terrible situation at the moment where people
are waiting in their own homes for the care that they need. I know
about this because I was the lead commissioner for domiciliary
care for older people not very long ago. If people who need 
<?notus-xml column=804?>services are at home, a care worker comes to you who
cannot count the time that it takes to get there but then has to get
you up, clean you up, clean up your room, dress you, make you a meal,
talk to you and help you eat your meal within 15 minutes. That is,
physically and mentally, totally impossible. It is an insult and an
impossibility. We cannot go on doing that to vulnerable people, so we
must somehow put our resources together and get this right. It is a
disgrace at the moment and of course, when it does not work, we need
advocacy services. I agree with the noble Lord—forgive me, but I
think that it was the noble Lord, Lord Bichard—who was talking
about the role of care homes. Another step-down facility can be the
care home, if the care home of the future can be more of a local
hub.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052195000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000006">I would
like to see that my mum gets to know the care home provider, goes there
for French classes, local history lessons or art—and for the odd
weekend if daughter is going away—and that, knowing it, she goes
there for a holiday and then moves in. That is not dumping mum; it is
mum going to a place that she already knows well. The care homes of the
future must be a resource for the local community and linked to all the
other services. They must be part of the step-down procedures, from
acute hospitals to caring for the sort of vulnerable people who we are
talking about.</hs_para>

the possibility of making this happen but we must get some things
clarified. What are the duties of a local authority in promoting
well-being, for example? It is not absolutely clear. We must be certain
that there is enough care and support provision in every local area. In
terms of well-being, we need to make sure that the Prime
Minister’s challenge on dementia, which is due soon, will
outline how much progress is being made on making the quality of care
as important as the quality of treatment. When we talk about the
growing challenge of dementia, it is not always about treatment but
about care. The prevalence of dementia makes that essential. The other
point that we might bring in is that much of dementia care should come
under public health because it is about prevention, well-being, design
and preventive care. If we can bring public health professionals, who
are now very important at a local level, into this group of
providers then we stand a chance of getting this
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000008">I also
support the noble Lord, Lord Bichard, in making the point that
end-of-life care is important and that we must make sure that people
who are approaching their last days do not have to pay for the care
that they need. These definitions of what health and social care are
should disappear at that point. We are talking about services to dying
people. After all the years that I have worked in the field of
aging and with older people I know that the loss of dignity and
respect, and going into an inappropriate hospital setting, are what
people fear most as their life draws to a
close.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000009">I agree
with everybody who said that moderate care must be part of the
equation. If I was a director of adult social services, I would have to
concentrate on those in the greatest need. We are so limited as regards
the number of people who can obtain services at all. If we could only
include moderate services, we might have a chance of preventive types
of care being part of our envisaged service provision.</hs_para>

must also do something about self-funders subsidising the funders who
get their total funding paid for by the local authority. In terms of
inflating the cap and the personal care account, although annual wage
inflation appears to be the chosen index some sort of acknowledgement
must be made of the actual cost of care. I assume that the practice of
self-funders paying more than local authority-funded people, often for
the same accommodation in a residential or other type of care
home—subsidising the latter, in other words—will be
clarified or should cease. Otherwise, self-funders are going to reach
the cap far in advance of other residents. This is not only unfair but
might well be challenged as not being legal, being a form of taxation
which is not publicly accountable.</hs_para>

are frail go into hospital, their discharge procedure must be verified
and known about as part of the admission process. I think we made this
clear in the scrutiny committee. We get these terrible stories now of
very frail people being discharged from hospital with no proper plan.
We know, because we have heard about this recently, about the horrible
wait that people have to leave hospital. We must make sure that advice
relating to care and support includes information about how to access
relevant independent financial advice. This should bring in the members
of SOLLA; the noble Lord who spoke about that was in an authoritative
position to do so.</hs_para>

coming forward from one or two think tanks, including one with which I
am associated, which are looking at more affordable savings products

normally able to pay for an insurance scheme, these products would help
encourage the insurance companies to come in and provide the sort of
long-term schemes that are needed to make this care system work
properly. Unfortunately, they really do not exist in this country at
the moment, but with the catastrophic costs being taken on board by the
state it should be possible before too long to interest the insurance
industry in being part of paying for care for older people in the
future.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052195000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000013">This
Bill has been awaited for a very long time. We need to make sure that
other things that we have learnt, such as human rights protection, are
not left out of the Bill as it proceeds through Parliament. We know
that there are some serious problems in ensuring that human rights
protection will follow people, however their care is provided. I hope
that we can work on that in Committee to make sure that it is clarified
and that it is simple to access human rights protection. Whoever the
provider of care might be, frail and vulnerable people, who are usually
very old, need that protection. We have seen too many instances of
human rights being abused and quite dreadfully breached. This Bill is
so important, as long as it guarantees that those sorts of abuses will

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, let me say at the outset how much I
welcome this Bill and in doing so I pay tribute to the contributions
made to its construction and arrival in this House by Paul Burstow and
Norman Lamb. I should also declare my interests, as a member of the
Dilnot commission and as a member of the 
<?notus-xml column=806?>Joint Select Committee on the draft Care and Support
Bill. I emphasise that it produced a unanimous cross-party report with
more than 100 recommendations for improvements, mainly in relation to
Part 1 of the Bill. The evidence given to the Select Committee showed
strong stakeholder support for the Bill, but there were important
proposals for further improvements that we reflected in our
recommendations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000015">At
this stage I shall not comment on the Dilnot recommendations, other
than to distance myself slightly from the remarks of my noble friend
Lord Lipsey and to associate myself with the excellent remarks made by
the noble Lord, Lord Sharkey. I will come in a moment to some of those
Joint Committee recommendations that were not accepted by the
Government. First, I would like to ask the Minister about the
Bill’s silence on the key area of public health to which the
noble Baroness, Lady Greengross,
referred.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000016">We
know that the NHS’s core business is the management of 17
million people with long-term chronic conditions, many of which have
been largely caused by—if I may put it this way—lifestyle
decision-making. We know that nudging on its own does not really cut
the mustard with issues around smoking, alcohol consumption and poor
diet and that legislation may be needed. It was disappointing to many
people outside this House—certainly, I have had a lot of
approaches about this—that the Government did not use this Bill
to bring forward the standardised packaging of cigarettes, the minimum
pricing of alcohol and some kind of simplified system of food
labelling. They have failed to do so. Will the Minister tell us a bit
more about the Government’s plans for introducing legislation in
these three areas? If it is not to be this Bill, when will we see
legislation tackling these issues, on which there is a very large
measure of public support for something to be done?</hs_para>

areas in Part 1 that require fuller scrutiny in Committee and probably
amendment. The principle in Clause 1 of promoting well-being has been
warmly and widely welcomed, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay,
mentioned earlier. The Joint Select Committee considered that this
principle should be applied to Ministers when exercising their
responsibilities under the Bill. Ministers in oral evidence seemed
slightly sympathetic to this idea, but when they got back to Richmond
House they seem to have gone cold on it and rejected the Joint Select
Committee’s recommendations. I will be interested if the
Minister can produce more convincing arguments than I have heard so far
on why the Joint Select Committee’s recommendation was rejected.
If we are not convinced by the arguments of the Minister and his
colleagues, I hope that some of my colleagues on the Joint Select
Committee will join me in prodding the Government a little further with

for the Minister some other areas in Part 1 where I am minded to put
down amendments. On integration, I think the response to some of the
Committee’s recommendations suggests that the Government are a
bit happier talking the talk rather than walking the walk with
practical ideas such as—dare I suggest it?— pooled
budgets, joint commissioning, joint provisioning and a number of 
<?notus-xml column=807?>others. Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Mackay, I still think that implementing the Bill’s changes
effectively over time requires a statutory code of practice, and I
would favour an amendment to achieve that. As noble Lords have said,
the Bill needs strengthening on young carers, advocacy and human rights
protection for those in private care homes. We have been over that
latter ground a number of times in this House, and it is time to deal
with this once and for all. I do not think the outside world is
convinced by the Government’s position on this or, indeed, by
the previous Government’s position on it. We need some careful
drafting that gives proper protection to those in care homes who are
paying their own way. It is not good enough to leave things as they
are.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052195000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000019">Let me
flag up some issues around whether there will be a credible way of
dealing with what is likely to be a considerable number of disputes
over this legislation. The noble Lord, Lord Sharkey, mentioned this.
There will be two types of dispute: disputes between service users and
the local authority, and disputes between the local authority and
service providers. We could leave things as they are, but if we really
want a lot of judicial reviews and to clog up the courts, that is the
right way to go about it. We need to hear a bit more from the
Government about their further thinking on some tribunal-type way of
dealing with these disputes without relying on the courts.</hs_para>

by the Bill’s drafting on the boundary between the NHS and
social care, as is the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay. I am still
unclear whether the boundary has been changed. I would very much like
to hear the Minister’s response to the view of the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Mackay, given the attention he has given to this
issue in the Joint Select Committee and outside
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000021">The issue
in Part 1 that is of greatest concern to most people is Clause 13 on
eligibility criteria, as a number of noble Lords have said. They are to
be dealt with by regulations and, as I understand it,
drafts will not be published before the spending review
announcement scheduled for late June. The Government have promised to
establish a minimum national threshold of service need to be met under
these criteria. It is still a bit unclear to me where in the Bill we
find that. Will the Minister explain how this will be done?</hs_para>

13 there are widespread concerns that this threshold will be set too
low to ensure that enough effort is put into preventive help to protect
independence and preserve well-being. I think consideration will have
to be given in Committee to placing in the Bill a stronger framework of
requirements on eligibility criteria rather than leaving so much to
ministerial discretion within regulations. I certainly feel a set of
amendments coming upon me on this issue, and I welcome any
contributions on this issue—the more, the merrier.</hs_para>

issues I want to raise on Part 1, such as including social
care savings in auto-enrolment schemes for pensions, the right to die
at home and free social care at end of life for patients suffering from
cancer. However, the last point I wish to raise today on Part 1 is one
that a number of other noble Lords have raised: funding for social
care. The 
<?notus-xml column=808?>Dilnot commission’s report made it crystal
clear that its proposals would not solve the existing shortfall in
social care funding. I do not wish to trade figures today with the
Minister on this issue, but what is beyond doubt is that there is a
major funding shortfall relative to need. It is fair to say that
historically under successive Governments social care has been less
generously funded than the NHS, and promising a brave new future under
this Bill without adequate funding for implementing the new system
would be a cruel deception to inflict on many vulnerable people. More
immediately, the funding crisis in social care is having a major impact
on the NHS in terms of the major flow of people into A&amp;E
departments, especially at night, and the lengthening of hospital stays
as discharge packages cannot be
funded.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000024">Social
care has never had a review of its funding like the review that the
late Derek Wanless carried out for the previous Government on the NHS.
We should consider bringing forward an amendment to the Bill to provide
for an independent review of the funding required for adult social
care. I would like the Government to be willing to contemplate asking
the Office for Budget Responsibility to conduct such a review, and I
would like to be in a position to put down an amendment so that we can
debate this issue fully during the passage of the Bill. I know that the
King’s Fund will be undertaking a further review of social care
funding, but Derek Wanless did one for it on this some time ago. It
simply does not have the clout and authority that an organisation such
as the Office for Budget Responsibility has.</hs_para>

on Part 2 that I will wish to raise. I shall not dwell on them for very
long today, but I want to mention to the Minister some of the issues
around Clauses 76 and 77, which are concerned with trust failure. As I
understand these clauses, they relate to foundation trusts only, but
the trusts with the possibility and risk of failure are those within
the remit of the NHS Trust Development Authority. They are the trusts
with the longer-standing financial problems and, by association, they
present the greater risks to quality for patients. Indeed, the
TDA’s mandate, in a ministerial letter of 7 May, says
that the TDA is expected to “make a significant contribution to
improving quality of care”. Can the Minister explain to us why
the TDA trusts are not covered by the Bill when they appear to have a
less robust approach to failure than Monitor? Does this not put
patients in these trusts more at risk than those in foundation

of its conclusions. I also thank the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, for

context of this Bill has a history. The post-war creation of the modern
welfare state as we know it was momentous, and many of us have
benefited from that for most of our lives. The two Bs, Beveridge and 
<?notus-xml column=809?>Bevan, gave us two structures. The first is the National
Health Service, which in principle offers
healthcare free at the point of delivery, and the second offers other
benefits that cannot be defined as healthcare, including care services
deemed to fall outside healthcare. These are not free at point of
delivery but are subject to two constraints. The first is means-testing
and the second is that responsibility for delivering these benefits
lies currently with local authorities, and so is not currently in
national service as is the National Health
Service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T19:31:40"></hs_TimeCode>. This
Bill goes some way, but not the whole way, towards changing that
situation, and I will come back to that. It contributes to a
redefining, but I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that the role
and the difference between healthcare and social care still remains
unclear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T19:32:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

relevant point of difference from when the national services—the
health service and the local authority care service—were set up
is the growing demographic change in our country and in every country.
Demographic shifts have created a completely new situation which,
whether we like it or not, will have an impact on how and where we
spend money. We simply live in a different world. For 50
years, we got away with trimming at the edges, changing bits here and
there in relation to health and social care spending. That can no
longer be the case. It is clear, at last, that something must be done.
This Bill does something, and it is very welcome. That is the strength
of the Bill. However, it is, at best, a good start, for many of the
reasons that have been given already. Its strength is that a peg has
now been put in the ground, and there is a commitment to having a
national strategy and policy that we have simply avoided because of the
huge fissure that runs between health services and social care
services. That is part of the world in which we live and it has very
significant
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T19:33:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000029">The
fundamental recommendation of the Dilnot report, that a cap be put on
the cost of care for any individual, has been accepted. All credit is
due, for this is at last an acceptance by the Government, including,
therefore, the Treasury, that the risks involved in the frailties of
old age, like those involved in cancer, stroke and diabetes, should be
shared across the whole community. I hope that that principle has been
established in the Bill before
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T19:34:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000030">Of
course, the fears of the Treasury, which are always there, are already
being realised. Inevitably, a chorus of voices points out that there is
less to this than meets the eye. The Bill does not commit the resources
that we all know are necessary if you are to duplicate the quality in
social care services that we have in the National Health Service. As we
have heard, Dilnot’s proposal included the possibility that a
cap might be as low as £25,000. In the event, it is eventually
£72,000, with the possibility of deferred payment. Again, as we
have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Bichard, local authorities are
vigorously pointing out that there is already a shortfall in funds made
available before account is taken of this new proposal. They estimate
that the current round of cuts to the adult care budget amounts to
£2.68 billion—or 20% of previous provision—and
that is before the provisions of this Act are dealt with. At the same
time, as has also been mentioned, care home owners often subsidise 
<?notus-xml column=810?>local authority-sponsored residents from the charges
made to those who are self-financing. That cannot
be right. There should be a single charge, and a single cost that
applies to everyone. However, the rich—or the moderately
rich—are subsidising others. That is the position in which they
have been
put.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000031">Of
course, we all know that we are now in the worst financial crisis in
living memory. Account has to be taken of that—and I put it to
you that account has already been taken of it. What that
does—and the noble and learned Lord, Lord MacKay of Clashfern,
made this point very fairly—is to raise expectations, in the way
in which this Bill is being canvassed, which will come home to roost.

the Bill is an implicit bet—and that is the best of it, as far
as I can see—that the principle of a cap on care costs will
stimulate a strong insurance market to cover pre-cap and possibly
post-cap costs. We shall see, but there is no guarantee about that. Of
course, conversations have been held, but my previous experience on the
Royal Commission was that those providing insurance products were not

Government, while being commended on a good start, or indeed on facing
up to demographic change, must accept, however, that as we stabilise

that—a reordering of priorities will be the only rational
response to the empirical realities of the huge demographic change. We
must accept, as a Government and as a Parliament, that these priorities
will have to be looked at. The world out there is different. The facts
and the shape of the population are different. If there is no more
money, priorities have to move around a bit. That is the reality, or we

to do with care. However, there is the rub. Why were these two not one
Act? There is a legal, financial, and administrative fissure in our
society that runs through our attitude to the provision of care. We
simply cannot continue like this. It is at government and at
professional level. Doctors and social workers are the best of friends

would like quickly and briefly to make two points that have come up in
the debate about the assessment and evaluation of what is going on. The
first is that there is provision, rightly, to deal with what I can
refer to only as the Southern Cross problem. We cannot have major
providers going bust on us. That is right—but I wonder whether
it is right to ask the Care Quality Commission, whose expertise is in a
wholly different field, to take responsibility for this. Is there not
even a group within the department of health economists, or economists,
who know about running big businesses—they are essentially
property businesses—and can give a proper health reading? Those
responsible for assessing the quality of care are not those people.
Yes, they will employ others. But if it is to be a kingdom within a
kingdom, why not charge reasonably well paid civil servants with doing
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T19:41:46"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000039">Lastly,
although it is not mentioned in the Bill, the Minister made mention of
a new inspector. I simply ask whether we can have some information
about the context in which such an inspectorate will work. It is
canvassed as being like Ofsted, which is of course a great reassurance
to those of us who were involved in setting up that body. However, it
does not seem at all like Ofsted. Does this new inspectorate have a
statutory basis? Is it independent of Ministers? We have had a
row within recent weeks about who can close down a unit within a
hospital—for example, for the heart surgery of children. Where
are the lines of accountability? What is the new inspector responsible
for? The chief inspector of schools is accountable to Parliament, not
to Ministers. That gives it an independence and certainty about being
taken seriously that will not necessarily be the case for an inspector
within the employ of the
department<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T19:42:55"></hs_TimeCode>. So
there is a lot of room for clarifying the provision there, but I am

emphasis has rightly been put on the demands of our growing ageing
population, and it is right that we do so, as is the fact that one in
three of those who use our care services are disabled people of working

too long, Governments have used a sticking plaster approach and
incremental improvements in dealing with adult social care, resulting
in systems that are bewildering for the recipient and unwieldy for
authorities to administer. So I, too, welcome the principle of adult
social care reform. The Joint Committee inquiry took evidence from a
long list of expert witnesses representing all sectors, all the major
disability organisations and those involved in statutory provisions, as
well as local authorities and academia. There was undeniable consensus,
and a call for disabled people to be at the heart of social care policy
reform as well as making decisions in their care. In doing so, we must
not see them as passive recipients, but must uphold their human rights
under the UN convention to which the United Kingdom is signatory, and
embrace the fundamental principles of
independence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000043">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T19:45:25"></hs_TimeCode>

short of providing dignity and choice, thus hampering independent
living. Of course, the funding shortage is a reality, but we cannot
allow those who may be voiceless to be sidestepped at the behest of
what may be regarded as best value by locally set criteria. The
evidence received by our Joint Committee points to local authorities
struggling to achieve the best outcomes, resulting in raising their
eligibility threshold for care provision. Many instances have been
cited, implying that current eligibility criteria have led to many
thousands of disabled individuals falling out of the care system

statistics are astonishing. The Audit Commission on social care in
England found with the fair access to care system in 2005 that 50% of
152 local authorities in England provide services to those with
moderate needs and above but, by 2012, 84% were only providing services
at the higher threshold of substantial need, with three councils now
providing social care to people who fall into all four eligibility
bands and only 24 councils providing care to those with
moderate needs and above. The Care Bill will fail to improve the social
care system for disabled people if eligibility is set so high that
those in need will not receive even the basic help such as washing,
dressing or getting out of the house. These changes, challenges and
differences in eligibility are bound to lead to more disabled people
left ineligible for care and support, contrary to the Minister’s
claim that the Bill will provide compassionate and consistent care to
those who need

inquiry committee hopes that the Government will consider more
uniformity in setting thresholds for eligibility right across the
country, ensuring that the 2013 spending review will give due regard to
adequate resources being made available so that the needs of disabled
people are not compromised. I was surprised to hear the Minister say
that legislation will not impact 
<?notus-xml column=813?>on the funding available. How can provision be
efficiently provided, as he suggests, when the system is already
stretched to its limits? Disabled people deserve to have
confidence in any new care and support system,

a new framework of eligibility, which should actively engage core
stakeholders, addressing gaps highlighted already in the House today.
The joint inquiry report suggests that the current fair access to care
services criteria should be replaced by a system that is more objective
and coherent and implemented across the country, where resource
allocation is transparent and enables the disabled person and their
carers to take part in the decision-making process. Worryingly, the
evidence that we took suggests that there is little cohesion within
various partners of care providers. This will stretch the ambition of
the seamless services that the Care Bill envisages. Personalisation
appears not to break down the barriers between care, housing,
transport, leisure and community involvement, particularly when any
person moves from one area to another. Therefore, I welcome the
commitment in the Bill that continuity of care packages will not be
interrupted by any move to another local authority or area. I would
like to ask what mechanism will be in place to ensure a smooth
transition if that happens, and whose lead responsibility it will be to
manage the transition. I suppose that I am asking who will
manage the “Oklahoma!” moment and who will provide the

Care Bill is happening alongside the Government reassessing all those

augmented last week by the whistleblower giving an insight to reports
that individuals were not receiving even-handed services. The fact that
supporting evidence given by applicants was not forwarded by the
assessing company for assessors to use suggested a bias towards finding
reasons to award points begrudgingly or not to award points, thereby
affecting resource allocation. I have spoken to a number of carers and

best value for the authority but completely ignored her condition and

our society is to be judged by how we treat our weakest members, we
have some distance to walk. I hope that we will be bold and ambitious
enough to remember that social care must not simply be about basic
survival but about supporting people to live independently. Independent
living means disabled people of all ages having the same universal
rights of freedom, choice, dignity and control as other citizens at
home, at work, and in the community. It means having the

Lordships may not be surprised to learn that even in this context there
is a distinct difference in the services provided to those from
minority communities. It is a fact that 32% of all disabled people live
in household poverty. Sadly, for minorities this figure jumps to 44% of
disabled people living in household poverty. A report suggests that
income for minority disabled people is 30% lower than for the general
disabled population. The Equalities National Council and Scope in a
report entitled <I>Over-looked</I> <I>Communities, Over-due Change</I>
found that services are not fully inclusive for BME disabled people,
who experience significant language and communication barriers, social
isolation and stigma exacerbated by their lacking access to information
and advice, including from well recognised NGOs. Many of the large NGOs
operating within communities accepted that they had some way to go in
addressing the needs of minority disabled people. In fact, a quarter of
BME disabled people report difficulties receiving benefits and
accessing independent living compared with 16% of others, indicating
that additional unmet needs exist. Evidence on barriers to care shows
that BME disabled people's conditions and impairments tend to escalate
quickly to higher levels of need. I submit to the House that this is a
costly process and that it is therefore even more important that the
social care system provide effective coverage at lower care need

is not all: meeting criteria and being eligible for support is not the
end. An assessment determines the value of someone’s personal
budget, and the resource allocation system ascribes a number of points
to each eligible need which has been identified and, in referring to a
table, sets out the financial value of each set of points, which then
fleshes out the support plan to purchase and achieve identified
independent living outcomes. Final decisions about the value of
personal budgets are made by an anonymous panel of local authority

this point and found that a lack of uniformity among local authorities

for individuals is causing deep confusion and stress. A case was
brought to my attention recently of a disabled
adult who had all services stopped at 6 pm one
evening. Apart from the legality of how and why this happened, an
anonymous panel had turned down for the third time a request to
increase travel by nine miles twice weekly, despite the social worker
having great input from advocates on the matter. As the client had
received an insufficient explanation from the social worker at 6 pm at
night, she had to recall her father from business in London. He arrived
at the social work offices the next day to petition the head of
services as to why this had happened. Fortunately, services were
immediately reinstated, with the family being offered a transfer from a
direct service from the local authority to a personal

carers claim that all these formal processes lack transparency
regarding panels, their remit, obligations and decision-making.
Disabled adults and their advocates are forbidden from having adequate
details about the panel making the decisions. Surely transparency
should be an obligation. If the objective is to provide care and
support while maintaining the dignity of the individual, surely it is
critical to have the individual or their representative present to
ensure that their opinion is heard and valued as they are the experts
on their own lives. The panel should have due regard to the
contribution of disabled people in determining the nature of their care
and support in any decisions that are made. Our report asks that the
Government place resource allocation systems on a statutory footing
through the Care and Support Bill and place new duties on councils
to be transparent about these decisions. I welcome the move to
put personal budgets on a statutory footing in Clause 25 of the Care
and Support Bill. That should be enhanced to ensure that local
authorities are transparent about decisions relating to the allocation
of resources. All too often, personal budgets have care costed at one

they will just have to read <I>Hansard</I>. I will not repeat what I
said the other day, save to reiterate my specific plea that we pay
attention to the screening of vulnerable elderly people in the
community by primary care and social services staff so that we can
introduce simple preventive measures to keep people at home. I hope the
noble Earl might say something about
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000056">Tonight
I want to concentrate on the proposals in the Bill to establish Health
Education England and the Health Research Authority as non-departmental
public bodies. These are, of course, extremely welcome proposals but
inevitably there are a number of aspects where we need to seek
clarification and improvement. The roles of the HEE and the associated
local education and training boards—inelegantly abbreviated as
LETBs—are spelt out in the Explanatory Notes but I fear that the
Bill itself is fairly silent on how it will ensure high quality and
standards in
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000057">For
example, much is made of the fact that the LETBs are provider-led and
dominated by the needs of NHS trusts for sufficient numbers and range
in the workforce to meet those needs. So far so good, but what is
missing is a proper recognition that the quality of training, the
curricular content and the skills and knowledge of those going through
training programmes will be taken care of. Where, for instance, is
reference made to the need to include postgraduate deans on the boards
of LETBs? It is not in the Bill and given only passing reference in the
Explanatory Notes. Where is reference to the need to engage closely
with local universities or training colleges—that is, with those
whose whole raison d’être is education and all that that
entails? Content of training programmes and maintenance of standards is
their special expertise and for providers to ignore that aspect will be
to their detriment. I am sure they are aware of that but we need
mention in the Bill of a need to involve universities, either in the
membership of the board, albeit in a minority, or, if not that, then an
obligation to seek their advice in formulating their programmes of
training.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000058">At
the national level, in the HEE, there is some recognition in the notes
to the Bill, but not in the Bill itself, of a need to seek advice from
the royal colleges—here I have to express my interest as an
ex-president of a royal college—the GMC, the GDC and the NMC in
developing its policy. It seems to me that all those bodies have
considerable expertise in education and training. Indeed, the main
functions of the medical royal colleges, for example, are in the
development of all the curricula for medical trainees and in setting
their exams and assessments to make sure that they have reached an
acceptable level of skills, aptitudes and knowledge. Every
cardiologist, orthopaedic surgeon and psychiatrist has to go through a
training programme devised and run by a royal college. The regulatory
bodies have responsibilities for the oversight of training and
education to ensure that it is fit for purpose. Yet despite all this
remarkable body of expertise, no mention 
<?notus-xml column=817?>is to be found in the Bill that the HEE will draw on any of this for
advice and assistance.</hs_para>

issue of the need to take account of the importance of clinical
researchers in programmes of training and education. We have heard much
helpful comment from Ministers about the need to embed research in the
NHS and to make every health professional a researcher and every
patient a willing participant. The noble Earl was extremely helpful in
getting research high up the agenda for the NHS in the Health and
Social Care Bill. It is, of course, through research that we may in due
course find some answers to the major diseases from which we suffer
such as dementia, diabetes and Parkinson’s, so it is vital that
research really is in the middle of the
NHS.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000060">While the
new Bill is very helpful in stating that the HEE must promote research
into matters relating to its activities, which is rather subtle, it
hardly takes account of the need for LETBs to take account of this in
their training programmes. Those embarking on a clinical academic
career have to be able to take time out from their purely clinical
training to train in research, perhaps for up to three years if they
are going to do a PhD. All other trainees, at least in medicine, need
to be able to carry out some research so they have experience of what
research is about. They are then in a better place to take advantage of
the results of research and not resist the rapid introduction of
innovations when they go on into practice. I fear that the dominance of
provider-led interests in LETBs will lead them to paying little
attention to this aspect of training unless they have access to advice
from their local universities and the research community. I fear very
much that the shadow body of the HEE has shown little sign
so far that it is aware of this particular
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000061">I come
now to the Health Research Authority. I believe we are extremely
fortunate in having Professor Jonathan Montgomery as its first
chairman. He is clearly switched on to the need to be able to protect
the public and the patient interest, while at the same time encouraging
high-quality clinical research and not putting unnecessarily burdensome
regulation in the way. It might be thought that these twin
responsibilities—the need to protect patients and ensure their
safety and confidentiality on the one hand while promoting and
encouraging research on the other—are opposed to each other but
they are closely aligned. Patients want not only to be safe but they
are very keen for research to be done on their diseases. Furthermore,
surveys of patients’ attitudes show that more than 90% of
patients want to be involved in research themselves in clinical trials.
They are desperate for innovations in treatments arising from research
to be applied to them. Of course they want to be safe and protected but
they also want high-quality research, so the two go hand in hand. It is
pleasing to know that Professor Montgomery is well aware of this and
the need for proportionality in
regulation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000062">I
welcome the clear statements in the Bill on this and in particular in
Clause 98(3) where it is proposed that the HRA must promote
standardisation of the regulation of research across England and ensure
that such regulation is proportionate. It is clear, too, that for the
HRA to gain credibility with the public and 
<?notus-xml column=818?>patients it cannot simply pontificate about safety from on high. It must
actively communicate with the public and have processes in place for it
to be able to listen to the views of the wider public. It needs access
to the public view and should put in place mechanisms to achieve
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052195000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000063">I come
now to another aspect of transparency. In addition to its own
transparency, the HRA should also be encouraging transparency of
researchers engaged in clinical trials in academe and industry and
their results should be published as expeditiously as is reasonably
possible. Results should become freely available, after careful
checking for reliability, whether they are positive or negative. It is
helpful to know that GSK is leading the way in industry by publishing
its data more openly and others are beginning to follow. We do not want
the HRA to be given too rigid a formula. That would be
counterproductive, but we do want to be able to encourage and support
the HRA in its efforts to use measured
persuasion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000064">Finally,
it is good to see in the Bill the confirmation that the HRA will
continue its good work in co-ordinating the work of the ethics
committees and in taking on the roles provided until now by the
Secretary of State and what was PIAG in ensuring the safe use of
patients’ data. It is gratifying to know, too, that the HRA is
moving towards a single application process for entry into the jungle
of research regulation. There remains at least one major barrier to
research and that is the local R&amp;D approvals that have to be given
by each trust where clinical trials are being done. This is where we
need a rational, proportionate and national system and if the HRA can
incorporate trust R&amp;D approval into that national scheme, the
research community would heave an enormous sigh of relief.</hs_para>

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, we are approaching the end
of what has been a serious and expert debate on the Care Bill, which
has clearly drawn considerable support from your Lordships’
House. However as speaker after speaker has pointed out, there is a
marked contrast between the Bill’s intentions and the reality of
the health and social care system, which is under huge financial
pressure at the moment. Of course, this Bill puts new pressures and
responsibilities on local authorities, but there are no signs yet as to
how those authorities are to find resources.</hs_para>

co-operate in postponing deliberation of Part 1 of the Bill, to allow
it to take place after the spending review has been announced. However,
in a sense that concerns the future and future responsibilities. The
fact is the crisis is here now in relation to social care. Very little
has been heard from the Government about how they intend to respond to
it. I hope the noble Earl will say something about it tonight. Many
noble Lords have referred to the eligibility criteria and the intention
to set this at a national level to get consistency and deal with the
issue of the huge variation that is now apparent throughout the
country. This has been widely welcomed, but I would tell the noble Earl
that we certainly expect the Government to publish the all-important
draft regulations before we go into Committee to deal with this
important matter. I would be grateful if the Minister will confirm that
he intends to do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000077">He will
know that there is widespread expectation that the Government will set
the national level at the “substantial” level. I do not
expect the noble Earl to confirm that tonight, but does he agree with
the noble Lord, Lord Rix, that local authorities have increasingly
moved the threshold up to the substantial level, with, of course,
prevention and early intervention being unavailable? May I also ask him
about the risk of those local authorities which do not at the moment
set the threshold at the substantial level, actually raising it in the
light of the national criteria being set at that level? That way, we
will have national consistency, but it will be consistency where
provision is at the meanest. That would cause considerable concern in
many local authority
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000078">The
noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, and my noble friend Lord Warner
raised the question of Clause 22 and the all-important
boundary definition between the means-tested social care and the

that at some point this might be a thing of the past, but at the moment
this is a critical delineation between 
<?notus-xml column=821?>the two services. The Minister will know that the Select Committee was
concerned that a court might view any changes in the wording as
implying a change in the meaning of the provision. It is important that
we hear a response from the Government about why we ought not to worry
about that.</hs_para>

Lady Campbell, spoke so eloquently of the problems of people being
shunted between the two services because of the cost implication
between local authorities and the NHS. At the same time, the noble

not just a Bill for older people, but the challenges that older people
face are formidable, as my noble friend Lady Bakewell said. Like my
noble friend Lord Lipsey, I welcome the Dilnot provisions and the
cap—as far as they go. However that is not the complete picture.
The cap and increased threshold will reduce the risk of catastrophic
costs, but there is a concern about the way that people of modest means
will be treated. I listened with great interest to what my noble friend
Lord Lipsey said about the operation of the means-tested tariff and the
impact on people with modest income. My noble friend Lord Warner does
not quite take his view on that, but it would be good to have a debate
on this in Committee.</hs_para>

interested to know whether my noble friend Lord Lipsey has taken into
account that in some benefits the first £6,000, and in others

raised. What is the noble Earl’s current assessment of the
prospects of an insurance market developing? Has his department been in

confidence that he has in insurance products developing? This is very

in this area, I turn to a point raised by my noble friends Lord Lipsey
and Lord Warner. The actual administration and assessment that will
have to take place, particularly as thousands of self funders will need

major administrative task and to an increase in disputes and legal
challenges. The Joint Committee was not confident that Ministers had
fully thought out the implications for local authorities of these
changes. Will the noble Earl comment on that and also on my noble

good points were made about the need for impartial information in

after-care and the implications that it has in relation to Section 117

carers represent a uniquely valuable group of people whom the
Government should be ensuring receive help to address the very serious

clear that there should be a power of entry for local authority
representatives where a third party is refusing access to a person who

by my noble friend Lord Warner about non-foundation trusts? I should

noble Lords. I would particularly refer to my noble friend Lord

high quality in training and the involvement of
post-graduate deans. As regards research, again, the provisions are
very welcome but there is real concern that this country is losing out

Does the noble Earl thinks that the HRA should be given more authority

opposite. As ever, I stand ready to work with the noble Baroness and

<?notus-xml column=824?>maintain access to services. In the White Paper, we committed to
additional support for social care over the next two years. However, it
has to be remembered that local authorities ultimately have discretion

However, noble Lords will understand the realities facing us. We cannot
improve care and support by simply putting more and more money into the

It is surely to be welcomed that, for the first time, there will be a

in a care home or that all their life savings will disappear. The level
of the cap is not set in the Bill, but will be set in regulations. Why
do we propose to set it at £72,000? We want to strike the right
balance between supporting people in paying for care and managing the
public purse in a sensible, sustainable way. We believe that a cap of
£72,000, which is equivalent to around £60,000 in Dilnot
terms, along with the increase in the means test threshold to
£118,000, achieves this balance. I was grateful for the

modest housing wealth to the greatest risk of losing everything to pay
for their social care. That is unfair and it needs to change. Yes, we
are expanding the scope of the means test benefit so that more people

scale determines the amount they must contribute. Individuals are

Clause 4 sets out clearly and places the duty on local authorities to
provide information which is accessible to people needing care and
support in the local community. The information must be accessible to
those for whom it is provided. So, for example, it should be translated
into the languages that are used in the area. The noble Baroness also
said that a disabled person should be involved in decisions about how
their needs are met and their personal budget is settled. Clause 25

the reasons for it. These are important new rights, which will promote
transparency and aid decision-making. Where people are unhappy about a
decision, there is an established right to make a complaint which is
set out in the Local Authority Social Services and National Health
Service Complaints (England) Regulations 2009. There is no need to set
out another system in the Bill. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt,
that we will look at the existing complaints arrangements, including

ensure appropriate distinctions between what can reasonably be expected
of adults and children. It is of course crucial that adult and
children’s services work together to ensure that young people
are not carrying out inappropriate caring roles or are disadvantaged in

amendments to the Children and Families Bill on support for young
carers were debated in the other place. My honourable friend the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children and Families, Mr
Timpson, recognised that the effective identification

achieved by children’s social care, health and education
services working together and considering the whole family’s
needs. He explained that he would reflect on the arguments put forward
and the evidence from the National Young Carers Coalition. Ministers in
his department are very happy to meet noble Lords who are interested in
this area as the Children and Families Bill moves to this House.
Officials are in contact with the National Young Carers Coalition and
other key stakeholders as part of the consideration of the evidence
that they have provided. I should say, however, that the Care Bill
encourages local authorities to take a whole-family approach in
assessing an adult, which means that adults’ needs for care and
support are not seen in isolation from their family circumstances,
including the contribution of young carers. Regulations about
assessment procedures to be made under Clause 12 will put a duty on
councils to have regard to the family of the adult to whom the
assessment
relates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T20:48:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Rix, spoke about the transition into adulthood, and I completely agree
that transition between childhood and adulthood is an important time
when young people and their families are thinking about their goals and
aspirations for the future. The Bill gives young people and child
carers the right to request an assessment before they turn 18 in order
to help them to plan for the transition to adult care and support in
order for them to have the information that they need to prepare for
their future. The Bill will ensure that no child reaching the age of 18
should go without the care and support that they need around the point
of transition. It will require local authorities to maintain
children’s services until a decision has been taken about
whether they require adult care and support in place for there to be no
gap. The Bill will therefore incentivise local authorities to focus
more closely on the relationship between these services to improve the
experience of transition for all.</hs_para>

and their families face as they move into adult care and support are
well documented. The Care Bill aims to smooth the transition. It sets
no restrictions about whether the child is already receiving a specific
service under children’s legislation in order to request this
assessment, nor does it contain any restriction or stipulation about
the age of the child for whom the request may be made, or their
proximity to their 18th birthday. Instead, the local authority must
consider whether the individual child is likely to have needs for care
and support after they turn 18 and whether there would be significant
benefit in undertaking the
assessment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0002.htm#13052195000117">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T20:54:28"></hs_TimeCode>

Clause 9(4) needs to be clear that people’s needs are assessed

expected to provide, so that there is no pressure on them. I completely
agree with what she said. The assessment is to include whether any
carer is able, and is likely to continue to be able, to provide care.

services when somebody moves. We believe that when people move local

They may be moving to be nearer family support or to take up
employment, and their needs for care and support may also change. After
the move it will not always be appropriate for them to have services
that are equivalent to those that they had before. Moreover, equivalent
services may not be available in the new area. The assessment process

Warner, all referred to the duty in Clause 1 to promote individual
well-being, and asked why the Secretary of State was not bound into
that duty. I am sure that we will have debates in Committee on that
point, but I only say now that the well-being principle in Clause 1 is
intended to apply at an individual level, when a local authority makes
a decision. This individual focus on the specific well-being and
outcomes for that person is at the heart of the way that the Bill has
been drafted. It is not intended to apply in a more general
way. Given that we do not think it would be appropriate for the
Secretary of State to be subject to the same duty, the Secretary of
State does not make decisions at the individual

noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Low, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Greengross, asked about Clause 22. The boundary between
the NHS and local authorities is critical to the way in which the law
impacts on the services people receive. This needs to be as clear as
possible so that the division between local authority care and support
and healthcare, particularly continuing healthcare, is more easily
understood. The current law is especially complex and dates back to
1948. It was not designed for setting out the boundary between modern
care and support and the reformed NHS. It has been subject to much case
law and dispute over many
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T20:59:50"></hs_TimeCode>. The
clause establishes the boundary between the responsibilities of local
authorities and the NHS and includes a regulation-making power to
enable clarification in the event of uncertainty. It is not intended to
alter the current boundary, but instead to express it in a more
transparent way which fits with the new
framework<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T21:00:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0003.htm#13052195000129">I
shall cover rapidly the rest of the points made, if I may. My
noble friend Lady Jolly asked about the timescales for introducing
ratings. We are currently considering the Nuffield review; we will
respond in due course with our plans for implementation. We want to
proceed quickly, but it is important that the CQC has the time to
develop ratings properly in consultation with the wider health and care

publication of a consultation document in
June.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052195000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-0003.htm#13052195000130">The

key stakeholders, to design and develop the rating system. However, the

considerable influence over the education that is commissioned from
education institutions and the training that is delivered by employers
through clinical placement and training programmes. They will work
together with providers to deliver high-quality clinical and public
health placements. I can assure the noble Lord that Health Education
England must seek advice widely. The Bill requires that the body

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:30:17"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, the
order before us today will allow for greater flexibility in the
deployment of traffic commissioners across Great Britain. Traffic
commissioners are appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport as
independent regulators of the heavy goods and public service vehicle
industries in Great Britain. Traffic commissioners’ statutory
functions can be found in numerous pieces of primary and secondary
legislation but two key Acts set the regulatory framework. The Public
Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 establishes traffic commissioners, traffic
areas and the general regulatory framework around licensing of road
passenger transport operators, while the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of
Operators) Act 1995 establishes the road haulage operator licensing
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000003">Most
operators of lorries, coaches and buses in Great Britain must hold an
operator’s licence to operate legally. Traffic
commissioners’ key regulatory functions are to licence the
operators of lorries, buses and coaches and to consider and take, as
necessary, disciplinary action against operators who have not observed
the conditions of their licences. To grant an operator’s
licence, a traffic commissioner must be satisfied that the applicant
has sufficient funding, is of good repute and has arrangements in place
to be able to operate in a suitably professional
manner.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000004">Although
the majority of traffic commissioners’ work is focused on
operator licensing, they also have a number of other key functions.
These include registering local bus services and matters relating to
the granting of vocational driving licences or taking action against
the holders of such licences. The work of traffic commissioners is
funded by fees paid by the industries that they regulate.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052187000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000005">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:32:29"></hs_TimeCode>
Local Transport Act 2008 contained a number of reform measures to the
structure of traffic commissioners. One of the key reasons provision
was made in that Act for this restructuring was in recognition of
traffic commissioners’ strengthened role resulting from that
Act—for example, in relation to bus punctuality where the Act
allowed traffic commissioners to issue a broader range of penalties to
bus operators. Another 
<?notus-xml column=26?>reason for these measures was to respond to concerns raised by the
industry about different standards or processes being applied in
different parts of the  country.</hs_para>

traffic commissioner reforms attracted cross-party support during the
Bill phase of the Local Transport Act and were designed to strengthen
the independence of the regime, with the post of senior traffic
commissioner becoming statutory rather than administrative. The first
statutory senior traffic commissioner was appointed in March 2009. The
legislation before us will provide that officeholder with more
flexibility with regard to how resources are allocated by removing,
except in Scotland, the statutory link between an individual traffic
commissioner and their appointed regional traffic area of
responsibility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000007">Given
the degree of devolution of their functions, in Scotland a traffic
commissioner will be retained who will be referred to as the Scottish
traffic commissioner. However, the Scottish commissioner would be able
to act on reserved functions in England and Wales and vice versa to
provide further flexibility, and the legislation before us reflects
that flexibility.</hs_para>

that the legislation before us, and the associated commencement order,
will not directly result in any changes to how traffic commissioners
are deployed across Great Britain. Any changes to how traffic
commissioners are deployed is, under the Local Transport Act, a matter
that must be detailed in the senior traffic commissioner’s
guidance and directions, on which the senior traffic commissioner must
consult as set out in the Local Transport Act. This arrangement ensures
that the independence of traffic commissioners in fulfilling their
regulatory functions is maintained. However, any redeployment of
traffic commissioners will help ensure that the fees paid by the
haulage and passenger transport industries for the traffic commissioner
system are kept as low as possible, which of course is particularly
welcome given the financial pressures many in the industry are
experiencing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000009">The

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State announced in the Commons that he
was proposing a review of the transport commissioners’ duties.
Apparently it is a quinquennial arrangement and the duties must be
reviewed on that basis. I will draw two or three matters to the
Minister’s attention, with a view to him raising with the

commissioners have a duty to bring before a traffic
commissioner’s court the bus operators whose vehicles either do
not keep time or run erratically. That is perfectly reasonable, but in
a number of cases the operators concerned find it almost impossible to
run a regular and reliable service because the highway is obstructed.
It may be obstructed by roadworks, which are often carried out in a
very undisciplined fashion, or by inconsiderate parking. These are
matters over which the local authority and not the bus operator has
control.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13052187000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000012">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:39:26"></hs_TimeCode>
I am asking in the first place is that, where a bus service is shown to
be unreliable, if the traffic commissioner believes that the highway
authority is not discharging its duty to provide a highway along which
a reasonable bus service may be operated, they should have the ability
to summon the director of highways, or whoever in a local authority is
responsible, to give an explanation of the way they are contributing to
the operation of a decent bus service. This is not meant to be
divisive, but we are moving into an era of partnership working between
local authorities and bus operators, and it is reasonable that a
balance should be made, and that where a local authority is not playing
by the rules, it should be answerable to the traffic
commissioner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:38:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000013">The
second matter that I will raise—again, I would like it to be
addressed in the upcoming review—is the question of goods
vehicle operating centres. Traffic commissioners have the duty of
approving premises where goods vehicle operators are based. That
includes the facilities for maintaining and stabling the vehicles, and
having access to the highway. However, the traffic commissioner is not
allowed to take his consideration any further than the gates of the
depot. Sometimes—this is happening more and more as farms become
heavy haulage depots—you will find that heavy lorries are making
their way on to totally unsuitable roads. I am suggesting that the
traffic commissioner’s discretion should extend to the point
where the lorry will meet a main road, and that we should not let our
lanes be devastated by heavy lorries that not only destroy the road
surface and are dangerous but make for unfair
competition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:40:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000014">That
brings me to my third issue: the question of the competition
authorities. As the Minister said in opening, the traffic commissioner
licenses new local bus services but has no discretion whatever about
what a local bus service should be. For example, if the noble Lord,
Lord Davies, runs a bus service that runs on the hour and the half
hour, I can come along and register a service at 57 and 27 minutes past
the hour so that I run my bus three minutes in front of his and take
all his passengers. I am asking that there should be an element of
discretion in the traffic commissioner agreeing to a licence. Where the
people who are trying to register a new bus service can be shown to be
acting in a predatory way, which is not difficult to judge, the traffic
commissioner should insist that journeys are spaced out evenly so that
the public get a better service and we do not engage in the thoroughly
wasteful bus wars that have been going on since 1985 and still flare up
in some
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:41:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Davies of Oldham:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the
Minister for his introduction to this statutory instrument. I indicate
from the beginning that I thoroughly endorse the principal objective of
the instrument—namely, that the link between a traffic
commissioner and a geographical area should end and that we should have
the degree of flexibility that the SI envisages for the
operation of the traffic commissioners and, particularly, the head of
the
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:42:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

yesterday that in the question I asked in the House, which I thought
was suitably penetrating, I was in fact too kind to the Minister, so
the Minister today will not expect me to be too kind to Ministers on
consecutive days. I therefore have one or two points that are slightly
more abrasive than my general introduction, in which I just said that I
support the thrust of the SI, not least because it builds on
legislation that was passed by the previous Administration in 2008 with
regard to the
commissioners<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:43:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

constructive as the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, has been with his
questions about the traffic commissioners. I am having difficulty in
understanding the timing of this SI. Why are we doing this when the
Minister announced earlier this week that he was reviewing the whole
question of traffic commissioners? It seems odd to have a statutory
instrument recasting the position of traffic commissioners that is
predicated on the assumption that there will be a review of the whole
situation in the very near future. It looks to me as if that is back to
front, and I should like an explanation from the Minister for why the
SI has been tabled at this particular moment, although it
has merit.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052187000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000019">I
appreciate the points that the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, made. There
is no doubt at all that the Minister will appreciate that the
punctuality of services is absolutely critical to their use by the
public. This is particularly so in rural areas, where people often have
very limited cover when they are waiting at bus stops. Therefore, I
very much appreciate the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw.
If competition is introduced and two bus companies provide a service,
it is better that the commissioner regulates those services to the
benefit of the public rather than allow the free wind of competition to
enable one bus company to pre-empt the other by running the service
just in advance of its competitor. I hope and expect that the traffic
commissioners will attend to that issue. The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw,
is to be commended for having raised it and I hope that the Minister
will respond to that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:45:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

this SI represents a wasted opportunity to advance services generally
on behalf of communities and that it is making it harder for a bus
company to withdraw a vital local service. We all know that when
services are withdrawn with a degree of arbitrariness, 
<?notus-xml column=29?>it causes great dismay in areas. Therefore, does not the Minister
consider that the current 56-day period of notice required before an
operator can withdraw or vary a bus service ought to be extended? I
cannot see why that period could not in fact be doubled and then the
public would have very real notice of a potential change in order to
make alternative arrangements. The present situation seems to be loaded
very much in favour of the bus
companies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:46:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that we think the Government have a poor record in regulating bus
services. They have failed adequately to support transport authorities
that wish to move to a regulated model for local bus services through
quality contracts. This concept was, after all, discussed with the
industry and was subject to widespread consultation before being put
into legislation four or so years ago. Now, we see very little progress
on that and many opportunities to enhance the quality of services seem
to have been missed. Will the Government think again about being fair
to passengers and indeed to local authorities which are seeking to
respond to their local needs, rather than siding continually with the
private bus companies?</hs_para>

say that against a background where the Minister knows the figures and
statistics. This is an industry which last year received £580
million in public subsidy. Therefore, it is an industry supported
through the public purse to provide adequate and proper services. It is
an industry in which the five bus operators made a combined operating
profit of £580 million last year but the actual subsidy from the
Government was £2 billion. That is a lot of public
money. If these companies are operating at a fairly generous profit,
their services ought to be up to scratch. The noble Lord,
Lord Bradshaw, indicated one or two instances where the bus companies
clearly failed. Such complaints are often legion, and local authorities
are not enhanced or supported by the Government in improving the
contracts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000023">I
hope that the Minister can give us an assurance today that, when all
these issues relating to traffic commissioners are being reviewed,
things will be taken further than what this SI represents in
legislation and that there will be an improvement in bus services on
which so many people are dependent. I know that we all comment on the
degree of car ownership and on alternative forms of travel, and I know
that the Minister might be tempted to indicate just how successful
Transport for London is, but all that Transport for London does is
illustrate to the rest of the nation the limited capacity of a local
authority to influence quality of service in the way in which the
statutory arrangements for Transport for London are
established.</hs_para>

of service, particularly the guarantee of punctuality, is of greatest
significance to the public, against a background where an awful lot of
people who travel by bus do so through need—for example,
students and young people who have to get to their place of education
and mothers who have to ensure that the shopping gets done and that
they can get to the place in the town centre where that is possible.
Elderly people value the bus. That is why so much emphasis is placed on
the retention of the bus pass—I was grateful for the reassurance
given yesterday that there is no threat to the pensioner bus
pass—but, as I 
<?notus-xml column=30?>mentioned yesterday in the House, the bus pass is of little value if
there are no buses on which to use it. In rural areas in particular, we
should not underestimate the dependence of communities on the bus

Lord Davies, have pointed to a number of issues raised by the order.
The order will allow the senior traffic commissioner the flexibility to
determine what individual traffic commissioners work on and how their
duties are broken down to different regions. The chances are that the
traffic commissioners will become more specialised in different
regions. For example, one traffic commissioner may specialise in
issuing licences for buses; another may specialise in licensing the
haulage industry. The order will create the consistency that we
require. Currently, there is no consistency between the eight regions.
I am sure that the senior traffic commissioner will give the necessary
direction to traffic commissioners to create this
consistency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T15:53:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000027">The
noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, spoke about competition among local bus
services. This will obviously be determined by the transport

Davies, endorsed the order as being long overdue, which I welcomed.
Whether to introduce a quality contract scheme is entirely a local
decision and, like any decision, it must be made in the public
interest. Central government has no role in such decisions; the
Government are focused on improved joint working between local
authorities and bus operators. We have seen the benefits of that

wish them on itself. On the industry making extraordinary profits, I

changes that these orders make. It is sensible to narrow the scope of
the obligation to disclose convictions, particularly where they are of
a less serious nature. However, there remain some issues on which I
should be glad to have clarification. In particular, paragraph 7.4 of
the Explanatory Memorandum states, as the Minister pointed out,
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13052187000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000168">“no conviction

Minister identified the various periods of time after which disclosure
need not be made. My honourable friend Jenny Chapman, in dealing with
this statutory instrument yesterday, questioned the basis of the
periods of time given. They are rather curious, ranging from, for
example, 11 years for an adult conviction resulting in a non-custodial
sentence to five and a half years for a young offender. Obviously, in
the case of a young offender it should be a shorter period, but I just
wonder why this rather odd figure of 11, on which the other figure is
presumably based, was
chosen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:07:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

also asked whether harassment or stalking offences should be disclosed
if a perpetrator seeks to enter a profession in which they will work
closely with vulnerable people. I understand that such offences will
not be exempt from disclosure but perhaps the Minister can confirm
that. She also raised a question about a conviction for online sexual
offences—for example, downloading indecent images of children
and the like. Again, I assume, but would welcome confirmation, that
that also is a conviction that would have to be disclosed. It would
certainly make sense if that were the

hand—my honourable friend referred to this matter as
well—in the run-up to the police commissioner elections we had a
rather ridiculous set of circumstances arising where very old
convictions for very minor offences served to disqualify people from
being a candidate for that position. Because they were not custodial
sentences, I do not know the extent to which these provisions would now
change that rather absurd outcome. I hope that they would but, 
if not, perhaps the Minister will undertake that a review will be made
of the provisions that affect the 
<?notus-xml column=34?>nomination and qualifications for the position of police
commissioner—if that is not already in hand as a result of
several people having been disqualified in the rather absurd

the matter would be kept under review—that is, how the
exceptions and so on are working out and whether the list requires
change at all. Perhaps the Minister could indicate how and when such a
review might take place. It might take place in two or thee

said, we certainly support the principle and, subject to answers on
these rather detailed points, are happy to support the two orders, the
second being consequential on the first. My honourable friends in the
Commons voted against it yesterday because at that point the Minister
was unable to give assurances around certain of these matters, in
particular in relation to harassment and sexual offences having to be
disclosed. If I am right in thinking that that has now been confirmed,
of course we would accept that position. If not, we would ask the
Government to think again about those categories of

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Beecham,
for his welcome for these proposals. They are a rational response to
the court’s decision. We have had an interesting exchange of
views. I hope that I will be able to satisfy the noble Lord on all the
points that he raised. To the extent that I do not, I hope that he will

point that he made and that I would like to emphasise is that
notwithstanding the changes, public protection, particularly of
children and adults in vulnerable circumstances, is of paramount
importance to the Government. In the Chamber earlier today I had to
give some horrendous figures which gave us all a chance to reflect on
these things. It is also right that we should acknowledge
individuals’ wishes to put their past behind them, and to allow
that to happen in circumstances where we can be fairly confident that
public protection will not be
compromised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:11:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000054">The
Rehabilitation of Offenders Act aims to aid the employment and
resettlement of ex-offenders who put their criminal past behind them.
It does this by declaring certain convictions to be spent after a
specified time has elapsed after the conviction. A spent conviction is
deemed for most purposes never to have existed, and an ex-offender will
not have to reveal it in many circumstances, including when applying
for most jobs. The rehabilitation periods are determined according to
the sentence imposed, in order to reflect the severity of the offence.
Currently, a conviction resulting in a custodial sentence of more than
30 months can never be
spent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:12:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000055">There
must be a balance to ensure that members  of the public,
especially those groups at greatest risk  of harm, such as
children and adults in vulnerable circumstances, are adequately
protected. The exceptions order of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act
seeks to achieve this balance by excluding certain employment
positions, bodies and proceedings from the general 
<?notus-xml column=35?>application of the Act. This means that where an
individual applies for a specified job or role, such as working with
vulnerable groups, including children, their spent convictions must be
made available to the employer and may be taken into
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:13:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000056">Linked
to this, the Police Act requires that all cautions and convictions,
whether spent or not and regardless of how old or minor they may be,
are disclosed on criminal record certificates issued by the Disclosure
and Barring Service. It is this regime that the Court of Appeal has
found to be incompatible, and which the orders we
have debated seek to
address<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:13:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000057">I
will go through some of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham. Perhaps I may begin by explaining that the orders introduce a
mechanism to ensure that certain old and minor spent cautions and
convictions no longer need to be disclosed and are no longer
automatically included on criminal record certificates issued by the
DBS. The introduction of such a filtering mechanism is a significant
modification of the current public protection arrangements, and it is
important that we approach the proposed changes with care. With that in
mind, I am grateful for the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham, to the debate
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:14:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000058">The
noble Lord asked about what was a conviction and what was a custodial
sentence. A conviction, which is any determination of guilt by a court,
regardless of the sentence imposed, and a conditional and absolute
discharge are both sentences following a conviction. A custodial
sentence includes any sentence of imprisonment, including a suspended
sentence. I hope that that helps the noble Lord in that respect and
confirms the nod that he may have seen from my officials behind
me<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:15:02"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:15:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lord asked about the 11-year period. A caution is spent immediately and
will be filtered after six years. A non-custodial sentence received as
an adult can become spent after five years and, again, will be filtered

noble Lord asked how these figures came about. For cautions, six years
for offences committed as an adult is the longest period consistent
with the Court of Appeal judgment and the specific circumstance of the
cases involved. We think that there should be substantial extra relief
for offences committed as a juvenile, which is why we are suggesting
one-third of that period, or two

noble Lord asked about online offences. They are covered. He also asked
about stalking and harassment. Offences of putting people in fear of
violence or stalking that causes alarm or distress will always need to
be disclosed. The less serious offences of harassment and stalking,
which are summary only, are subject to filtering, but the safeguards in
the amendments apply so that they will not be filtered if custody was
imposed as part of the sentence, and so
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:17:11"></hs_TimeCode>. We will keep

Beecham:</Member></B> I am grateful. There is one matter that I ought
to have raised before: the provision is in relation to the dispensation
from disclosure only if there is no other conviction on the
individual’s record. Does that mean a conviction of any kind, or
would the conviction have to be of a category that would otherwise
create the obligation to disclose? If it is the former, then for a long

otherwise not necessarily be the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000064"><hs_speaker><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="13052187000207" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000207">Lord

Astor:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government have so far rejected the
opportunity to pause and wait until the Davies report on airport
capacity in the south of England is published in 2015 and are pressing
ahead with HS2. Therefore, we may have a new railway line on the right
side of the country but, equally, we could have a railway line on the
wrong side of the country. Who knows? However, HS2 is going ahead. What
we do know is that the department has rejected a route stopping at
Heathrow and so far has rejected a spur that would connect to Heathrow
Aiport, so we are faced with the possibility that Heathrow may end up
with the worst rail connections of any major airport in
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:22:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the House of Commons Transport Select Committee called for a third
runway at Heathrow, rejected the idea of a new airport in the Thames
estuary and called for HS2 to serve Heathrow directly. What is the
Minister’s response to this report? I imagine that the
Government will want to wait until the Davies report has been
published.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000069">Today,
we have to deal with the route for HS2 proposed by the Government. If
it cannot cross the Chilterns at their narrowest point, it must be
tunnelled where possible or mitigating measures must be put in place to
give maximum environmental protection. If the Government would accept
just one principle, which they accepted for HS1—that for any
areas of outstanding natural beauty the route should be
tunnelled—opposition to HS2 in the Chilterns would largely
disappear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:22:56"></hs_TimeCode>.
Another help would be to add an intermediate station, perhaps at
Bicester, so that at least those living in the area could benefit from
HS2.</hs_para>

is worth repeating what made HS1 acceptable—what became known as
the Kent principles: any route should be tunnelled or engineered with
cuttings and sound barriers to minimise sound intrusion; it must follow
the shortest route for areas of outstanding natural beauty; there must
be an advantage for locals in intermediate stations, such as Ashford,
which was created for HS1; and, where possible, any route should follow
noisy transport corridors such as existing
motorways<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:23:32"></hs_TimeCode>. HS2
achieves none of these for one very simple reason—speed. I will
come back to that in a moment.</hs_para>

urgent issue that really concerns me is compensation. The judicial
review judgment found that the Government must review their proposals.
If you live within 60 metres of the line, you are automatically
entitled to compensation. However, perhaps your Lordships can imagine
HS2 crossing the middle of the Prince’s Chamber. If your house
is on the first Cross Bench, you get compensation, but if your house is
on the third Cross Bench, you get nothing. I would submit that there is
not a large difference between them.</hs_para>

know of at least one house 450 metres away from the
proposed line that has been valued as worthless by the local building
society. Many with homes just outside the planned route have found that
their value has plummeted and that they cannot sell at any price. The
mortgage company is demanding repayment due to the loan falling below
the value of the house, and of course the banks are not interested in
helping.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000073">I
will give one example. A couple in their late 70s live a few metres
beyond the 60-metre limit. Their house was worth well over
£200,000; now, it is virtually worthless. They cannot afford to
sell but they cannot afford to stay. They want to move into a care home
but they cannot. Theoretically they would have to pay because their
assets are worth more than £70,000, but they do not have the
money and they do not have a way out. They do not meet the definition
of hardship and will be able to make an application for compensation to
the Lands Tribunal only after 15 years, based on physical nuisance
under complex rules. If they have not been gathered by then, they
certainly will not be able to afford the costs of the case. They are
suffering in a terrible vicious circle, and this is an issue that the
Government ought to
consider.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000074">So
far, three-quarters of those who have applied to sell their homes to
HS2 have been turned down under the Government’s exceptional
hardship scheme. I believe that they should review the terms of the
scheme. A property bond has been proposed that would allow home owners
to apply to the Government for an undertaking to purchase the property
at a future date if a buyer cannot be found at the unblighted price.
The bond would be transferable with the property to give confidence and
security to any future purchaser or mortgage lender. This is not a new
scheme. This type of scheme has been operated by Central Railway Ltd as
well as by the British Airports Authority, which has a similar scheme,
and mortgage lenders have successfully worked with the
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000075">The
Government should remember that we are considering not just the effect
of the trains once the line is completed but the many years of
construction: the noise, the dust in summer and the hundreds of heavy
lorries using country lanes. Local businesses, too, will be affected,
and under the scheme they will have to prove loss of
business—but only after some years. It would be depressing to
see the value of your business decline in front of you and be unable to
do anything about it until it was too late. We know that HS2 will cost
more than £32 billion for the track, and another £8
billion for the trains: more than £40 billion in all. Can we
have a little fairness for those who suffer real hardship? Will the
Government consider a property bond? I gave the Minister notice that I
would ask this question.</hs_para>

issue comes back to speed. The faster you go, the straighter the track
has to be: no corners, so no flexibility. The Government have designed
the track so that trains can run at 400 kph, which would make them some
of the fastest in Europe. The plan is that they will start at 360 kph
and work up to achieve an average speed from London to Birmingham of
330 kph. HS1’s maximum operating speed is 225 kph,
with an average speed from London to the Channel Tunnel of 211 kph. The
average speed of the HS2 
<?notus-xml column=39?>service shows that it will have to operate at much slower speeds through
tunnels and urban areas. Of  the 225 kilometres of HS2’s
route from London to Birmingham, less than half—109
kilometres—will be capable of allowing the planned 400 kph
speed, due to various
constraints.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000077">So
why design a track that will enable trains to run at this high speed of
400 kph when we know that it takes time to build up speed and as much
time to brake to a slower speed, both of which will use energy and
increase CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions? The problem with a projected speed
of this nature is that there can be no corners: the track has to run
virtually in a straight line. The minimum radius of curvature for the
track increases, I am told—I am no mathematician or
expert—from 4.05 kilometres to 7.2 kilometres. What is more, it
will then limit the length of tunnels in which the train can travel at
speed. Therefore, the line has to be straight. It cannot avoid urban
areas or the unspoilt valleys of the Chilterns, or follow the line of
the M40, where possible, to
Birmingham.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000078">We
know from Europe that train speeds are being reduced, not increased,
due to the disproportionate effect of very high speeds on train and
track maintenance and on energy consumption and efficiency. If the plan
was to operate HS2 at the same top speed as HS1, all the main issues
could be dealt with, including a station at Bicester linking through to
the Midlands, which would attract local support. Following the M40 as
closely as possible to minimise environmental impacts would avoid most
of the scarring and destruction and the damage to many homes. Many
fewer houses would be affected than under the current plan, and that
would enable the Government to save money, even though there would then
have to be a longer track. It would avoid the loss of ancient monuments
and woodlands and the severance of many public rights of
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000079">Therefore,
my plea is for the Government to see what can be done. It is not too
late. With HS1, we know that right up until the moment it was built
there was a debate on where the track should go. It is not impossible
to make changes. We know that we have an enabling Bill coming before us
in this Session of Parliament, and we know that the Government hope to
introduce a full Bill perhaps next year, so it is not too late to
review the route and to take in all the matters that affect the route,
whether it is speed, the environmental benefits or the environmental
impact. I quite understand if the Government are determined to go
ahead, and they should do so, but I urge them to look at the effect on
those who live along the route and to see what they can do to mitigate
the damage and improve the compensation that is
available.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_21_PT_1/EA9D8EB7D5DAE83901F320C18A5A241DDCDE6BD5" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 May 2013">Tuesday,

Berkeley:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Viscount on
securing this debate. It is timely and he has raised some interesting
points. Certainly, he made a very good point about compensation. When I
worked on the Channel Tunnel, which was an Anglo-French project, we
were struck by the difference in the compensation regimes of the two
countries. I think 
<?notus-xml column=40?>that in France people got the valuation of the property plus 10%,
plus their moving costs. It was remarkable that
very few people complained there, whereas they did in England and they
continue to do so. Given the extra time and hassle, and the unfairness
that the noble Viscount mentioned, I think that there is a strong
argument for improving the
package<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:31:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

mentioned the link to Heathrow. I believe in a new line to get extra
capacity on the railway between London and the West Midlands, the
north-west and the north-east. Whether that is via a high-speed
passenger line, an ordinary passenger line or a freight line—I
declare an interest as the chairman of the Rail Freight
Group—more capacity is needed. The traffic is forecast to double
in the next 20 years and the existing line certainly cannot cope with
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:32:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government have chosen the high-speed line.</hs_para>

I do not have too much of a problem with most of the route. It is
interesting that it is still subject to change, as we have seen. I do
not think that a spur to Heathrow is particularly sensible. I am sure
that passengers going to Heathrow are terribly important, but the
volume there compared with the number of passengers going to central
London is very small. Probably only one train an hour is justified
from, say, Manchester, whereas there will probably be three or four
going to central London. They are not going to get to their terminal
without changing trains because there are three groups of terminals at
Heathrow. Therefore, if they are going to have to change anyway, they
might as well change at Old Oak Common—that is my simplistic
view on
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:33:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about with the present situation is that we are getting more and more
tunnels. We have a new one next to East Midlands Airport, which I think
is very good for the logistics industry, we have another one near
Ruislip, which I am sure my noble friend Lord Rosser will be pleased
about, and we have lots of tunnels or extra lengths through the
Chilterns, where there may be more to come or there may not. The extra
cost of these tunnels is now probably well over £1 billion,
although it may be more than
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:34:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

raise relating to the tunnels. The noble Viscount said that they slow
down the trains. They do unless you build a tunnel big enough to reduce
the air pressure, and that costs more, so there is a balance to be
struck there. I do not have a clue what the right balance is but he
made some good points.</hs_para>

whether one needs quite so many tunnels. If you go down and look at the
line in Kent, you will see there are not that many tunnels. I spent
quite a lot of time working on the side of line when it was being
built. There was enormous opposition at the time. I thought that the
environmental protection was pretty good—there are some fake
tunnels and a real tunnel through the hills. You do not find many
people there who now say what a disaster it is. They live with it; they
are quite happy with it, and they basically ask what all the fuss was
about. Having been brought up in a nice little village called Great
Missenden, the one thing that I did not like was the road going through
it from Aylesbury and Amersham, which, even 40, 50 or 60 years ago, was
a pretty horrible road with lots of traffic. Frankly, building beside
it a high-speed 
<?notus-xml column=41?>railway that was pretty straight, with the right sound barriers, I would
have thought was probably just as good or bad as building a long
tunnel—but that just happens to be my
opinion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:35:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000087">Many
noble Lords have talked about, and probably will talk about, the
alleged destruction in the Chilterns and elsewhere. I do not know how

the proposed demolition west of Euston station and up at Camden Road.

noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, and I have come up with an alternative
scheme for the London end of High Speed 2 that avoids those two areas
of demolition. The idea is instead to construct an underground station
linking Euston and St Pancras, next door to where Crossrail 2 might go.
That would give a much better passenger throughput to the two stations
as well as allowing a proper connection to HS1. It would provide not
only for international trains, such as they may  be, but for a
new east-west Thameslink, which would probably become very
popular—new forecasts are coming out quite soon that will

that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:37:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000089">Does

it is going to add £1.5 billion to the budget for
tunnels, it should at least look at this scheme. If it is the same

friend on bringing this matter before the House again. Many issues
surround this expensive, grandiose and, in my eyes, not needed venture,
but perhaps I may first declare my interest, as HS2 slices right
through the magnificent farmland and rural communities of the
constituency where I live. We are blighted not only by this but also by
the threat and horror of wind turbines. The M40 runs through the
constituency, so, altogether, we feel that we have been singled out for
a battering. This seems to me to be the industrialisation of our
beautiful countryside. People’s lives are being ruined as they
assess their plight, and I feel particularly concerned for those who
would apparently not be compensated because they live very close to HS2

this venture is to proceed, it seems very strange that the Government
did not choose to build the  line in the corridor of the M1 and
the Birmingham to

has already been established, and the links around

business case for this project seems to be very flimsy, and it is
difficult to find reliable figures in support of it. I heard on Radio 4

increase—all public projects do. We are told that HS2 will

the privatisation of the railways, I have marvelled at the
transformation of rail services. My nearest station is Banbury, so I
can travel to London on the Chiltern line. We have new trains that are
all fitted with wi-fi, enabling passengers to work on their computers
in the comfort of carpeted carriages. Travel time is seen not as a
waste of time but as quiet time away from phones before the start and
hurly-burly of the day. The journey of 55 minutes, arriving at
Marylebone on time, is impressive, and it seems to me that we travel at
high enough speeds

to travel at peak times, but if seats are in short supply, as many
others have said, longer platforms to accommodate longer trains would
be the answer. This would involve developing our infrastructure, thus
bringing much-needed employment to all parts of the country now, not in
the years to come. I do not know how many would profit from HS2, but it

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest,
as the current preferred route for phase 1 of HS2 goes very close to my

it, in the words used by the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, but
certainly not close enough to qualify for any compensation.</hs_para>

Viscount, Lord Astor, for securing this debate and indeed for his
valiant work altogether in keeping this issue in the public eye. I
agree with everything that he said about the compensation scheme, which
I think needs to be completely reworked, perhaps along the lines of the
French model mentioned by my noble friend Lord Berkeley. I also thought
that the noble Viscount’s points about the way in which the 
<?notus-xml column=43?>route for HS1 was changed quite late in the day were ones that we might

the noble Viscount, I have no objection to HS2 in principle and I
support my party’s position on the introduction of this
technology. However, taking  a fresh look at HS2 may well help
the Government, and indeed future Governments, to build in greater

Atlee, who is also the noble Viscount, Lord Prestwood, say why this
approach was not taken for phase 1, which currently destroys the AONB
in the Chilterns—including, it should be noted, the village of
Prestwood? Indeed, the Chilterns AONB is now the only AONB along the
entire HS2 phase 1 and phase 2 routes that is adversely impacted by the
proposed project. Although the route is tunnelled from the M25 for
approximately 13 kilometres through to Hyde Heath, partially bypassing
Little Missenden, the remainder of the route through the AONB to beyond
Wendover is on the surface or in cuttings of various depths. This has
had a major and unacceptable impact on areas of ancient woodland, a
scheduled ancient monument and several rights of way and ancient

residents, the county council and local district councils, along with
conservation bodies, believe that if the current route has to be

continuing from Little Missenden, under Mantles Wood to Wendover. This
would ensure that the villages of Prestwood, Great Missenden, Hyde

agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, that the Government need to
think harder about environmental impacts, and to learn the lessons from
what made HS1 acceptable. What he described as the Kent principles

protecting the environment and unique natural assets, redrawing the

local concerns without damaging the overall objectives of the entire

landscaping costs and mitigate 
<?notus-xml column=44?>major surface construction at 10 locations within the AONB, including

applied to HS2 phase 1, and in particular why the preferred route does
not follow existing transport corridors, away from the Chilterns AONB.
They need to get a better balance between the irretrievable loss of a
unique natural landscape and shaving a few minutes off a journey. I
would be grateful if the Minister would confirm that a plan to tunnel
all through the Chilterns AONB will be included in the final

eminently sensible proposal. It must make sense for the Government to

our last debate in February, there have been further developments. The
National Audit Office’s report on HS2 is damning. The case for
HS2 is not convincing and the timetable is “challenging”.
The NAO said that it was unclear how the project would deliver and
rebalance economic growth, particularly in the regions. The Department
for Transport had not assessed the value of time-savings correctly and
had knowingly used outdated data. There was a £3.3 billion
funding gap and the DfT had simply got its cost-benefit ratio figures
wrong<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T16:50:10"></hs_TimeCode>. The head

response of the Secretary of State for Transport in the other place to

the NAO as a “bunch of bean counters”. Quite apart from
the extraordinary spectacle of a Cabinet Minister attacking a body set
up by Parliament to hold government to account, I question why the
Secretary of State for Transport has more faith in his own officials,

is also the question of the draft environmental statement, which is
disappointing. The Government’s own forestry policy statement,

strategic reasons for developing High Speed 2 were not well presented
in the business case. Its report also states that the timetable for
introducing the hybrid Bill for HS2 phase 1 to Parliament this year has
been overambitious and remains challenging. Witheringly for Transport
Ministers, the NAO then drew attention to its earlier report on

considered, but would require 10 ventilation shafts as well as an

services. Only one feasible location for this access station was
identified, close to Little

proposes a relief tunnel, exactly as specified and required under
European legislation, at Wendover Dean? That has the support of local
residents, which is one of the major reasons why it has been put
forward. To say that there is no alternative except in Mantle’s
Wood, the very ancient woodland that we are most concerned about, which
happens to be near Little Missenden and indeed Great Missenden, is
wrong, and we are against that. There is an alternative. It is not the

Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, I am extremely sorry to the Committee if
I appeared to be aggressive. I have no intention of doing that at all.
However, the noble Lord is raising detailed questions about the route,
and my duty is to defend the whole scheme. It will be the duty of
Parliament to finally approve the route. At the moment, we are
consulting about the route, and we need to do that properly. I will of
course read <I>Hansard</I> carefully to look at the precise points that
the noble Lord has
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000144">I turn
to the issue of train speed, which my noble friend Lord Astor raised.
The route has been engineered to allow for train speeds of up to 400
kilometres per hour in future, should there be a commercial
justification for doing so. Operation at up to 400 kilometres per hour
would require the consideration of whether improved train design
enabled services to operate at that higher speed without additional
significant adverse environmental effects. Going fast does not
disproportionately increase the cost of the infrastructure, but it
means that the alignment has to be more or less straight.</hs_para>

many questions as I can in the time remaining. My noble friend Lord
Astor proposed a station at Bicester, but then he went on to point out
the difficulties of accelerating and decelerating from stations. My
noble friend made further comments  on train speeds. While it
is true that some European operators are looking at operating at
slightly lower speeds, largely due to maintenance issues, we
are  not aware of any that are planning to go as low as
225 kilometres per hour. The infrastructure is still built
for higher speeds so that, when technology allows, they will be able to
return to those higher operating speeds.</hs_para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:10:16"></hs_TimeCode>noble friend
also talked about the spur to Heathrow. It is important to understand
that the spur has not been cancelled but has been paused, and it is too
early to predict the outcome of the Airports Commission’s work
or any of the decisions taken following that. There are no plans to
slow down the progress of phase 1. We need to press on quickly with
phase 1 so that we can deliver the economic and wider benefits that
higher rail speeds can bring. Does pausing the spur mean no third
runway at Heathrow? The 
<?notus-xml column=51?>Government’s position on a third runway at Heathrow remains
unchanged, as set out in the coalition agreement. However, the
Airports Commission has been tasked with
identifying and recommending to the Government options for maintaining

noble friend Lord Astor and others have suggested that, where possible,
the route should follow noisy transport corridors such as existing
motorways. During the course of the scheme development work in 2009,
six main corridors, including the M40 and the M1, were
considered. The routes were rejected, primarily because
of their adverse implications for journey times
and economic benefits, which were compounded by their higher
costs. Any environmental advantages that these options offered over the
proposed scheme were marginal at best, and therefore not decisive in
discounting these
routes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:11:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052187000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-gc0001.htm#13052187000148">I
turn to the issue of compensation. We are clear that we need to have a
very good compensation scheme. Most infrastructure projects compensate
property owners only at a much later stage of development, when
statutory measures apply. For the HS2 project, however, an exceptional
hardship scheme has already been introduced while the route is being
considered. Subject to consultation later this year, the Government
have already stated that we hope to introduce subsequent schemes that
go even further than the law requires in order to ensure fair
compensation for those directly affected by HS2.</hs_para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-21T17:12:27"></hs_TimeCode>it would be
helpful if I gave a case study for what we are doing with the EHS,
remembering that it is inappropriate for me to comment on specific
individual cases. Take a lady living 350 metres from the proposed HS2
route who suffered from an illness that meant she was unable to safely
climb the stairs in her home. The lady therefore needed to sell her
home to purchase a bungalow but, because of the proximity of HS2, she
was unable to achieve a sale at the required price. The lady and her
husband applied to the EHS, providing documentary evidence that they
met the criteria for the scheme, including that the lady was suffering
exceptional hardship. A majority independent panel considered the
evidence and recommended that the lady’s home should be
purchased from her. This recommendation was reviewed and agreed by a
senior civil servant at the DfT. Some 12 weeks later, we exchanged
contracts on the lady’s home for the full, unblighted value. So
far we have brought 81 properties on to the scheme, spending just under
£50 million, and have offered to buy a further

a request from the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, the
Department of Health has undertaken an analysis to investigate whether
the gender birth ratio in the United Kingdom varies by mothers’
country of birth beyond the range that might 
<?notus-xml column=70?>be expected to occur naturally. The analysis concludes that when broken
down by the mothers’ country of birth, no group is statistically
different from the range that we would expect to see naturally
occurring. However, there are significant limitations in what these
data can show. As there are small numbers of births for most groups,
large differences in birth rates would be needed to identify ratios
outside of the normal range.</hs_para>

a number of factors can influence the sex of a child. These include
paternal and maternal age, coital rates, number of children and sex of
previous children. However, ratios above 108 and below 103 are unlikely
to occur naturally other than as a product of the random variability
associated with small numbers of
births.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052152000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-wms0001.htm#13052152000040">Recorded
birth ratios vary widely by mothers’ country of birth. Initial
analysis identified a small number of countries for which there were
indications that birth ratios may differ from the UK as a whole and
potentially fall outside of the range considered possible without
intervention. However, departmental analysts emphasised that it is
possible that this was the product of natural variation and that
further analysis would be undertaken.</hs_para>

was quality assured by the Methodology Team at the Office for National
Statistics and identified 10 countries which over the period 2007 to
2011 had over 10,000 births and recorded gender ratios either lower
than 103 (seven countries) or higher than 108 (three countries).
However, the tests undertaken indicate a strong probability that this
is occurring by chance. Only one country, Sri Lanka, was found to have
a birth ratio significantly different from the figure of 105.1 for the
UK as a whole. Mothers born in Sri Lanka have a birth ratio of 99.2 or
99 male children for every 100 female children. However, this is not
statistically significantly lower than the 103 threshold and again is
likely to be the result of random variation, particularly given the
relatively small numbers
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052152000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-wms0001.htm#13052152000042">The

P5 reaffirmed their commitment to the shared goal of nuclear
disarmament and general and complete disarmament as provided

the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 and its environmental protocol. This joint
inspection included verification that the international stations are
implementing relevant environmental rules and that facilities are used

P5 discussed the latest developments in the area of multilateral
disarmament initiatives including the situation at the
conference on disarmament. They expressed their shared disappointment
that the conference on disarmament continues to be prevented from
agreeing on a comprehensive program of work, including work on a
legally binding, verifiable international ban on the production of
fissile material (FMCT) for use in nuclear weapons, and discussed
efforts to find a way forward in the conference on disarmament,
including by continuing their efforts with other relevant partners to
promote such negotiations within the CD. The P5 reiterated their
support for the immediate start of negotiations on a treaty
encompassing such a ban in the conference on disarmament. They noted
the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on FMCT, and expressed the hope
that its work will help spur negotiations in the conference on
disarmament. The P5 reaffirmed the historic contribution of the
pragmatic, step-by-step process to nuclear disarmament and stressed the
continued validity of this proven route. In this context, they also
emphasized their shared understanding of the serious consequences of
nuclear weapon use and that the P5 would continue to give the highest
priority to avoiding such
contingencies.</hs_quote><hs_quote UID="13052152000325" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521-wms0001.htm#13052152000325">The
P5 advanced their previous discussions of an approach to reporting on
their relevant activities across all three pillars of the NPT Action
Plan at the 2014 NPT Preparatory Committee Meeting, consistent with the
NPT Action Plan, and resolved to continue working on this issue under
France’s leadership. They plan to continue their discussions in
multiple ways within the P5, with a view to reporting to the 2014
PrepCom, consistent with their commitments under Actions 5, 20, and 21
of the 2010 RevCon Final Document. They welcomed the progress made on
the development of the P5 glossary of key nuclear terms under
China’s leadership and discussed next steps. They stressed the
importance of this work, which will increase P5 mutual understanding
and facilitate further P5 discussions on nuclear matters. The P5
reaffirmed their objective to submit a P5 glossary of key nuclear terms
to the 2015 NPT review conference. The P5 are working toward the
establishment of a firm foundation for mutual confidence and further
disarmament efforts. They shared further information on their
respective bilateral and multilateral experiences in verification and

Joint Statement of 3 May 2012 at the Preparatory Committee of the NPT
review conference and pledged to continue their efforts in different
formats and at various international fora to find peaceful diplomatic
solutions to the outstanding problems faced by the non-proliferation
regime. They reiterated their call on the states concerned to fulfil
without delay their international obligations under the appropriate UN
Security Council resolutions, undertakings with the IAEA and other
appropriate international commitments. In the context of the nuclear
test conducted by the DPRK on 12 February 2013 and the continued
pursuit of certain nuclear activities by Iran, both contrary to the

fundamental importance of an effective International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) safeguards system in preventing nuclear proliferation and
facilitating co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The
P5 stressed the need for strengthening IAEA safeguards including

protocol and the development of approaches to IAEA safeguards
implementation based on objective state factors. They also discussed

reviewed the recent UK-hosted P5 experts meeting on CTBT, at which the
P5 identified a number of areas for future P5 collaboration and decided
to pursue further inter-sessional work, in particular ahead of the
integrated field exercise in 2014. The P5 called upon all states to
uphold their national moratoria on nuclear weapons-test explosions or
any other nuclear explosions, and to refrain from acts that would

P5 shared their views on how to prevent abuse of NPT withdrawal
(Article X). The discussion included modalities under which NPT states
party could respond collectively and individually to a notification of
withdrawal, including through arrangements regarding the disposition of

membership. They resolved to make efforts to broaden consensus among
NPT states party on the latter issue at the 2014 PrepCom, thus making a
further contribution to the NPT review process.</hs_quote>

binding protocols of nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties. They reaffirmed
their view that establishment of such zones helps to build confidence
between nuclear and non-nuclear weapon states, enhance regional and
international security, and reinforce the NPT and the international
nuclear non-proliferation regime. They reaffirmed their readiness to
sign the protocol to the treaty on the Southeast Asia
nuclear-weapon-free zone as soon as possible. They underlined the
importance of holding consultations, including on the margins of the
Second PrepCom, with the states party to the treaty on a nuclear

position of some regular payments to fund investors made by persons

distributions to domestic investors, offshore investors are not
normally subject to withholding tax on either interest or equity

believe that food production must remain the primary goal of

security, in the UK or internationally. Modelling analysis published as
part of the Bioenergy Strategy suggests that increased EU demand for
biofuels has led to global crop prices being around 3% to 5% higher
than they would otherwise have been and that this would correspond to
only a modest rise in food prices, since crops represent a small share
of the cost of food production. As set out in that strategy, it is
nevertheless essential that we continue to monitor the volume and all
types of bioenergy demand and their links with food prices and
production. To this end we will continue to work with the European
Commission in its ongoing evaluation of the economic, social and

Warsi):</Member> The Government hope that the proposal for the
appointment of three additional Advocates-General to the European Court
of Justice, including the Polish Advocate-General, can be agreed by the
Council of Ministers during the current Irish presidency. Parliamentary
approval under the European Union Act 2011 is required before the UK
can support a decision at the Council of Ministers. Debates to secure
parliamentary approval will be arranged when Parliamentary time allows.
The timing for the appointment of the Polish Advocate-General will then
depend on when the Polish nomination is
made.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13052174000598" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130521w0001.htm#13052174000598">EU:

reformed in April 2012. In 2012, 15,553 visas were issued to overseas

Government recognise that overseas domestic workers can be vulnerable
and that there is a risk that abusive employer/employee relationships
are imported to the UK. The April 2012 reforms address that risk by
ensuring those entering the UK to be overseas domestic workers in a
private household do so only for a short time (up to six months) and to
accompany an employer who is visiting the UK and with whom they have a
pre-existing relationship. To be granted a visa, they must show that
they have worked for the employer for 12 months before accompanying him
to the UK, and must have signed terms and conditions that certify that
the individual will be paid in line with the National Minimum Wage Act.
As part of the visa-issuing process, domestic workers are informed of
their rights in the UK and where to get help if needed. The Government
do not agree with Kalayaan’s view that the experiences of the 29
workers who have approached Kalayaan demonstrate that the
