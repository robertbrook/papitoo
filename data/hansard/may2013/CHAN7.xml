instance. Presumably, the right hon. Gentleman means the dog owner.
Most of the microchipping will be done by charities and will be free to
owners. A number of charities are happy to work with us on that, so I
do not think that we are talking about prohibitive cost. We are working
with the devolved Administrations so that, as far as possible, we have

very good work to promote responsible dog ownership, not least because
it sees the consequences when things go wrong, and I certainly commend

Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, which will deal with
precisely this problem. I cannot see the obsession with the label that
is placed on those orders—it is the outcome that matters. What
matters is the fact that flexible tools will be available to the police
and others to deal with this nuisance in the way the hon. Gentleman
wants. The measures will be in the Bill, and he will have the

there are any opportunities for

House will have to consider a number of issues relating to freedom of
conscience. It will also have to consider the amendments relating to
the possibility of humanist weddings, which would completely change the
basis of English marriage law from one that is building-based to one
that is celebrant-based. I think it is important to remember that in
Scotland, where that happens, pagan weddings and weddings in other
formats are now taking place, which I am not sure we would necessarily
want to see in England. Likewise, the House will have to take a view on
whether having heterosexual civil partnerships will or will not enhance
the concept of marriage. Those are all issues that the House will have
to consider during the two days next week. The Government, as I

the subject of exports has been relevant to debates in the past week.
He is right, though, that exports are essential. If we are to get
growth, we cannot rely, as has been the case in the past, on

an important point, not least in referring to the tragic events in
Dhaka, by which many of us have been deeply shocked. All those issues,
including the elections in Pakistan, demonstrate the importance of good
governance and democracy in many of these countries. In Pakistan, we
have seen for the first time the democratic election of a new
Government following a full term from a previous democratically elected
Government, which is positive. I hope that there will be an opportunity
for a debate on all these countries, but it might be appropriate if he

“platform”. May we have a statement from the Secretary of

on the basis of agreed Government policy and the relative priority of
the various measures. In this case, the issue is that where two parties
are in a coalition Government, it requires the agreement of the two

operational difficulties associated with aspects of 111, in particular
with the three new providers in the south-west, the south-east and
Oxfordshire during its introduction in April. Equally, we could go back
much further. For example, 10 areas of the country were running NHS 111
on a pilot basis when I left the Department of Health in September last
year, and in many places it is operating successfully. What Members

Burstow:</Member></B> I certainly would. The fact that a large number
of hon. Members are present, hoping to contribute to the debate, that
the Backbench Business Committee advocated the debate, and that the
Government have given the time suggests there is cross-party consensus
that mental health has for far too long been hidden in the shadows and
not awarded sufficient priority. The cost to our society of mental ill
health across England, Scotland and Wales amounts to over £116
billion a year, but that does not adequately capture the human
cost—the misery—that arises from it. Given that the
burden of mental ill health is about 23% of the burden of all disease
in our country, it is surprising that for so many years it has not been
tackled with the necessary vigour. So I agree absolutely with the hon.

question. He is absolutely right that access to talking
therapies—begun as a result of Lord Layard’s initiatives
before the general election, which the coalition Government continued
to support and which is being rolled out—is very important in
enabling people to recover socially, get back into work and get on with
their life. At the best performance rates, as many as half the people
that go through talking therapy services recover, and that can make a

spoke from the Dispatch Box. I was able to report some important
progress. We had a new mental health strategy. We had the continued
roll-out of talking therapies, which the hon. Member for Harrow West
(Mr Thomas) just asked about. Groundbreaking work was being done to
reinvent child and adolescent mental health services from the inside
out, to offer access to talking therapies for children and young
people. We had the flowering of a new movement to establish social
recovery as a goal for mental health, with the establishment of
recovery colleges channelling the lived experience of mental illness
into practical learning and skills, and resilience to enable people to

Burstow:</Member></B> Yes, I am concerned. The picture is complex. The
figures show that spending on adult mental health services over the
past couple of years overall has reduced by about 1%, which is not
good, but deeper analysis of those figures shows that about half of
commissioners have increased their investment and the other half have
reduced their investment, so the picture is more complex than it first
appears. None the less, it is concerning that services are being
withdrawn where they involve providing peer support or reaching into
harder-to-reach communities, particularly black and minority ethnic
communities, which often get left behind and often are most prone to
being subject to the most coercive parts of our mental health system.

the need for a greater focus on well-being. It is one of the reasons
why I am so pleased that the Care Bill which was introduced in the
House of Lords last week has as its first and clear mission for our
social care system the promotion of well-being, and it goes on to
stipulate what that means in practice. It is about control and
people’s ability to lead ordinary lives—the lives they
want to lead in their communities. That must be at the heart of an
approach to mental health that sees the whole person, rather than
trying to treat them in constituent parts of the presenting
conditions<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051646000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0002.htm#13051646000021">The
point about failure to join up services is key. All too often,
long-term physical health problems overshadow mental health problems.
The results of that are all too clear—slow, and in some cases
no, recovery and people living with long-term physical health problems

to Members on both sides of the House through their constituency
casework, for example, was raised in last year’s debate.
Although some steps have been taken to try to improve those processes,
they still do not seem to me to capture fully the important differences
in dealing with mental health and, as a result, can exacerbate mental
health problems. There is more to do in that area and I look forward to
the Minister picking up on that issue.
Given<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T11:49:16"></hs_TimeCode> that the

is worth noting that there are a considerable number of working-age
people with a history of schizophrenia, for example, who are able
and—I stress this point—willing 
<?notus-xml column=817?>to work. Indeed, Rethink’s schizophrenia commission identified
employment rates in that group as being about 8%, with a range of 5% to
15% across the country, compared with the obviously much higher rates
for the general population. Individual placement and support schemes,
which are some of the most effective forms of employment support for
people using mental health services, really can achieve remarkable
transformations in people’s ability to take up employment. I
hope that the Minister can say something on how such issues are being

example. The Royal College of Psychiatrists and its president, Sue
Bailey, have been looking, on behalf of the Department of Health, at
the whole issue of parity of esteem and what practical steps could be
taken to address it, and it has recently published work on that. How
can it be right, for example, that a recommendation by the National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence on the availability of a
drug is a must-do for the NHS  but a NICE recommendation on the
availability of therapies is not? This means that evidence-based

Post-traumatic stress disorder has risen up the mental health agenda in

stress disorder affects 11% of veterans of the war in Afghanistan and
20% of Iraq war veterans. By contrast, the figure for the

want to consider the issue of alcohol abuse in the armed forces and its
impact on mental health problems. The Ministry of Defence has spent a
lot of time providing services, raising awareness and developing
programmes such as TRiM—trauma risk management—which I
will look at later, and there is far greater understanding of mental
health problems among the military. Much of that is thanks to the
excellent work of and collaboration between the MOD and King’s
college London. I draw Members’ attention to
“King’s Centre for Military Health Research: A fifteen
year report”, which was published in 2010 and sets out the
stunning work that has been carried out. It talks about the roll-out of
TRiM. The unit has helped to raise the awareness of most common mental
health problems among military personnel, including depression, alcohol
misuse and post-traumatic stress disorder, although that is not the
most prevalent. The unit found that pre-deployment screening was not
effective in picking up problems and that mental health problems did
not necessarily apply only to those whose problems had been indentified
before they were deployed. Who will be affected by deployment cannot be

Member who speaks today will no doubt be aware of the difficulty of
working with general practitioners and of making them aware of the
mental health services that are available. On problem is that GPs see
few veterans. There is a heavy reliance on individuals to make their GP
aware of their military service. In 2011, the Royal College of General
Practitioners issued guidance to GPs on how to meet the health care
needs of veterans, but the onus is on the GP to be aware of it.
According to the last figures I have, only 320 GPs had accessed an

problems. We need to work to increase that number.</hs_Para>

commission on mental health and policing showed that the Met police
have a particularly poor record of dealing with people in mental

am in the Chamber because this debate is extraordinarily important. I
could spend this Thursday knocking on doors in my constituency and
pressing the flesh. If I was lucky, I might meet 100 people,
but by being here, I can represent the interests of many thousands
of people. That is why the Chamber of the House of Commons
is so important. I hope that, this afternoon, I speak up for the
interests of many thousands of my constituents who suffer directly from
mental health problems and illness, and many thousands in their
families who support
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051646000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0002.htm#13051646000082">We
have come a long way in the past year. In June 2012, we had a great
debate in the Chamber. Many familiar faces who took part in that debate
are in the Chamber this afternoon. In a sense, the lid has been lifted.

mental health experiences, but of mental health in general, and the
hopes, aspirations, fears and expectations of their
constituents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051646000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0002.htm#13051646000083">Although

that situation, he would want acute and crisis services. Is the hon.

primary care trusts, which are now clinical commissioning groups, and
mental health trusts about their acute and crisis care services. Does
he agree that we ought to ensure that such services are available to

Walker:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that information. I
have campaigned alongside Mind for many years to ensure that people
have such services. We talk about support within the community, but it
is variable and people’s experience of it is variable. If we are
to get things right when people go into crisis or feel a crisis coming
on, they need to be confident that the support they require will be
there for them. That is why having a crisis plan is so important:
people’s wishes can be respected. We too often talk over the
heads of people with mental health problems, unwellness or
illness—however we define it. We need to be aware of their
wishes, because they are people and we have an absolute obligation to
their welfare and to respect their wishes.</hs_Para>

couple of days ago, I met Liz Johnson from UK Changes, who works in
Staffordshire to ensure that people with mental health issues can
remain and keep a foothold in the workplace. For those who are out of
the workplace due to illness, her organisation provides mechanisms to
help them get back in. The organisation has some reach and I strongly
recommend that the Minister meets its representatives. I know there is
a drive to ensure that people who have suffered from mental health
problems have the opportunity to re-engage with the labour market. One
great sadness is that the chance of being in work for those with a
diagnosis of psychosis or schizophrenia is approximately 8%. A 92%

have been in work—they are not young and may be in middle
age—but have fallen out of it. Does the hon. Gentleman agree
that there needs to be a lot more work done with employers to ensure
that an episode of mental ill health does not lead to people being
sacked and becoming unemployed? Employers need to be much more

organisations are doing that at the moment. The Work Foundation
launched a report in the House of Commons a couple of months ago, and I
was delighted 
<?notus-xml column=826?>to be able to speak at that event. Some people who had been excluded
from the labour market for many years but are now in work spoke at the
launch downstairs in the Churchill room. It was moving and uplifting.
Good news stories tend to be uplifting and we need to have more of
them. There is still a lot of disappointment and sadness in this area,

Gentleman for giving way; he is being very generous. Like other
Members, I pay tribute to him for his work on this issue. Before he
moves on, I want to touch on the important point about employment. A
constituent has written to me to say that employers need to be far more
open to the idea of encouraging their employees to talk about these
issues and support them in times of need. The loss to companies could
be greatly reduced if they were able to support employees through times
of mental fatigue and mental illness. Does he

Walker:</Member></B> Absolutely. A lot of good points are being made
this afternoon and that is another one. BT and Legal &amp; General are
doing a huge amount of work on this. BT does it because it is a decent
employer, but also because it wants to hold on to some of its top
performers who make a difference to the business. It therefore makes
sense to support people and ensure they can stay in work.</hs_Para>

about the area of mental health—it is not all doom gloom, far

for the particular communities they serve. That is to be applauded and

people and local organisations that are doing 
<?notus-xml column=827?>great things. I met representatives of the State of Mind campaign, which
is running in rugby league. It is not a particularly well paid sport,

remain terribly concerned about psychosis and schizophrenia. I
mentioned a few minutes ago that anyone with a diagnosis of psychosis
or schizophrenia is likely to be unemployed. If one is not unemployed
at the time, one will end up unemployed. Life expectancy, which has
already been mentioned today, can be up to 20 years shorter than for
someone who does not have that diagnosis. That is not acceptable in a
civilised society and should not be tolerated. I have spoken about this
before in an Adjournment debate and I want to revisit it because it is
so important.</hs_Para>

concern, having talked to people who care for loved ones with
schizophrenia—sons, daughters, mothers or fathers—is that
sometimes the NHS is more interested in managing the illness than with
the overall health needs of the patient. Symptoms are managed down so
that patients do not make a nuisance of themselves and take up time,
but when one stands back and looks at them, they are desperately
unhappy. It does not matter if they are smoking 70 or 80 cigarettes a
day, because they are not making a nuisance of themselves. It does not
matter if they weigh 20 to 25 stone, because they are not making a
nuisance of themselves. It does matter, however, because that patient
is slowly killing himself or herself and we have to address
that.</hs_Para>

know that the Minister and other colleagues share my concerns, but as a
civilised society we just cannot allow this to continue. Yes, progress
is being made in the advancement of drug therapies, but not fast enough
in mental health. We still have treatments that were breakthroughs in

and beyond. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:28:24"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Bridgend rightly said that we have to be very careful
about the language we use today and not frighten people. I do not want
to frighten people and I hope that she does not think I am, but I get
terribly moved when a constituent, who is very ill and being cared for
in hospital, writes to me and tells me that once every other week he is
held down on the bed and has an eight inch needle injected into his
backside. I just think that that must be terribly demeaning,
distressing and awful—I am sorry, I am a bit upset about it. We

mental health, and the extent to which he argues the case for a fair
share of resources and attention to be given to it. Does he agree that
it is important for clinicians, who he was talking about earlier, to
listen to loved ones and family members to hear their perspective? Of
course there is the issue of confidentiality, but sometimes clinicians
hide behind that and are not prepared to listen to those who know the

talking about family members. I have a close family member with a
severe mental illness. It was a big part of my childhood and early
adulthood, and remains a big part of my life to this day. It is so
important that we have this conversation. It is not something that
people share or talk about because of the stigma that surrounds it.
Instead, people internalise it, deal with it and become their own
expert, so I would like to thank the Backbench Business Committee for
returning to this important issue. It is time to talk and time to

congratulate the Backbench Business Committee and the sponsors of this
debate. Remarkably, this is the second debate on this subject in less
than a year. I think we should have one every year in order to raise
issues that affect many in the House and many of our constituents.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:35:37"></hs_TimeCode>Our last debate
was on 14 June 2012, when I spoke about my depression and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:35:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Broxbourne spoke about his struggle with mental illness. We were
both a little wary about what the reaction would be, but it has been
nothing but positive, to the extent that he and I have become the Eric
and Ernie of the mental health conference circuit. I leave it to you,
Madam Deputy Speaker, and the House to discern which of us is Eric and
which is Ernie. I have received well over 1,000 e-mails and letters,
and I think one was negative, 
<?notus-xml column=830?>but so what? As I said last time, if people did not like me before I
spoke last year, they are not going to like me now.</hs_Para>

most remarkable thing for me is that some people I thought I knew well
have told me about their own mental illness. I want to pick out three.
I will not name any individuals, and I pick them out only to
demonstrate that mental illness and depression are equal opportunity
conditions. It is not determined by social status, education or what
someone does in life. The first was a chief executive of a large
council whom I have know for many years. If she was here today, hon.
Members would think her a confident and forthright individual, but
speaking to her after the debate, I learned that she suffered terribly
from post-natal depression.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13051646000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0002.htm#13051646000118"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:37:20"></hs_TimeCode>The
second person was the chief officer for a large European defence
company. I am sure that some people in the House have met him several
times. He is the last person hon. Members might think suffered from
mental illness but, as he explained to me, 10 years ago, he suffered
from a bad bout of depression. The third person, remarkably, is a
retired general I know. Others in the House will know him. I will not
mention his name, but again he is not someone we might think suffered
from mental illness.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:37:55"></hs_TimeCode>I pick out those
three to demonstrate my point. These are not weak individuals or
failures in life, but confident individuals, and had they not told me,
I would not have known, and neither would anyone else, apart from their
immediate families.

want to give another example. I was on Chester-le-Street in my
constituency one Saturday morning. I was walking down the street and a
lady, perhaps in her late 50s, early 60s, came up to me and said,
“Mr Jones, can I thank you for what you said on mental
illness?” I said, “Thanks very much.” She said,
“I’m a recovering alcoholic who had 10 years of
depression, but now, with the proper support, I am leading a good,
constructive family life.” Normally, if I had walked past her in
the street, I would not have thought that this well-dressed,
middle-class lady had suffered from mental illness. That reinforced the
point that unlike a broken leg, for example, we cannot see mental
illness. Every day we pass people in the street or working with
people—people we might know very well—who have suffered
from mental illness or who has a family member who has suffered from
it.</hs_Para>

important the speeches that he and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:39:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Broxbourne (Mr Walker) made were. The key point is that despite the
number of sufferers who battle against these problems at some point in
their lives, there is still huge amount of stigma attached to them.
That is why debates such as this are so important. On his point about
health, it is quite right that the Government and public health
organisations do so much on smoking, weight loss and reducing alcohol
intake to improve health and well-being, but why does he think so
little is said publicly, or by health organisations generally, to raise
the problems of mental
health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:40:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), who championed
IAPT—improving access to psychological
therapies—services, for example, 
<?notus-xml column=831?>but part of the problem is cultural. We do not talk about these issues
in this country. I think that is changing—I will come to the
stigma around this issue in a minute—but for anyone who has
suffered from a mental illness or a family member, there is a sense of
shame. There should not be, but there is a sense that talking about it
means that those people are failures or somehow is a sign of weakness,
when I would argue the opposite. In many cases it is a sign of
strength. With the right support, people can function normally, work
perfectly normally and have a perfectly happy and productive family

health and alcohol. I repeatedly had texts from a dear friend of mine
who is a minister in the Church. He had severe depression and was
self-medicating with alcohol. His family and the police would
repeatedly take him to mental health services, which would turn him
away, because they said he had been drinking. He was drinking because
he needed their services and could not access them. We have to ensure
that mental health services cannot turn away people who have been
drinking, but hold them until they are no longer under the influence of
alcohol and then ensure that they access the services they need. The
link between alcohol and mental health has to be explored and
tackled.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=832?>the stigma. We should remember that it is not just the individuals with

the Member for Ashfield (Gloria De Piero) mentioned her own family. A
lot of families suffer in silence because they think there is no one to
turn to. In many cases, they think they have failed in some way or
wonder where they can get help. It is not uncommon—I have come
across a lot of these cases—for carers to end up suffering from
mental illness themselves because of the daily pressures on

hon. Member for Broxbourne raised the issue of schizophrenia. I pay
tribute to the Schizophrenia Commission, which reported towards the end
of last year. It looked not only at services for schizophrenia, but at
the stigma around it. Again, the popular image in the media is that
someone suffering from schizophrenia is potentially the mad axeman or
woman next door who will come and kick the door in, when nothing could
be further from the truth. When we describe people’s conditions,
there is an onus on us all to describe them properly, because there are
people suffering from schizophrenia who, with proper treatment and
support, can function quite normally.</hs_Para>

also pay tribute to Lord Stevenson, not only for championing the Bill

Did that legislation help in itself? Yes, it did, because it sent a

have been criticised—we see this occasionally in some
newspapers—by people who say, “Well, it’s okay for
famous film stars or even MPs to say they’ve suffered from
mental illness,” as though it is somehow an easy thing to do,
but I can tell Members now that it is not. I would like us to reach a
position where people generally are talking about mental illness, so
that if people are suffering in a workplace, they can open up to their
colleagues. I should point out—not just to people in this
Chamber, but to those in the wider audience—that most people who
are suffering from a mental illness would be very surprised by the
reaction if they told people. However, it is a big step, and I know
personally that it is a very difficult one to take.</hs_Para>

of the best examples of that was from a Channel 4 programme that I
appeared on after I spoke last year—I pay tribute to Channel 4
for its work to raise awareness of the stigma around mental illness.
The programme had the great title of “Mad Confessions”
and presented by a very mad individual called Ruby Wax. By chance, it
happened to include one of my constituents, Derek Muir, who suffered
from depression. The programme started with him talking about his
depression—he had been off work for a number of months and lives
in Edmondsley in my constituency. At the end of the programme they got
all his work colleagues together in a room and he told them. It was the
first they had known about it, but the reaction was very positive and
supportive. That is the point we need to get to. Sometimes it is a big
step for people suffering from 
<?notus-xml column=833?>mental illness or depression to admit what is seen as a
frailty—although it is
not. The strength is in opening
up and asking for help.</hs_Para>

area that we need to do more work in is getting mental health policies
in the workplace right. I pay tribute to BT and Dr Paul Litchfield for
their policies, which have buy-in not just at the level of personnel
managers, but from the board downwards. They are not only talking about
getting people to talk to one another and open up about mental illness,
but trying to be supportive of people with mental illness. When I was
at a seminar with Paul last year, somebody asked him, “Why has
BT done this? Is it just to tick the social responsibility box?”
He said no. Indeed, the board was quite clear: the policy makes
economic sense for BT. The message we need to get across to more and
more employers is: “Why write off people who are valuable to
your business, just because they happen to suffer from a mental
illness?” BT is to be congratulated, and I certainly
congratulate the board and Paul on their work in this

Madan, the head of the unit across the road that MPs and staff can

assist Members with mental illness, and that there had been an uptake
of the services since the money was made available. I would recommend
that anyone who wants to go and have a chat with her should do so, as
she is a very good and open individual. We must give credit to Mr
Speaker and the Commission for that funding, because that was not an
easy decision to make, especially as he was getting criticism from
certain newspapers for giving special treatment to MPs. It is not
special treatment; it is a vital service. Unfortunately, it is still

Harrington’s review of the process put forward the idea of
mental function champions. The Government spun that idea out a bit, as
though it was the big answer to the problem, and I actually fell for it
at the beginning, thinking that those people would be the ones who
would carry out the assessments. That was not the case, however; they
are there to give advice to the Atos assessors. So we still have
assessors with no mental health

<?notus-xml column=835?>how the champions were recruited, and there is no indication that they
need any formal qualifications. I understand that they are given a
two-day Atos in-service training course, but they do not interact with
any of the royal colleges or other outside bodies. Remarkably, they are
also not accountable to the DWP.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T12:56:32"></hs_TimeCode> put it to the

again. The process is not only causing a lot of heartache and
difficulty for many of our constituents; it is actually not a good use
of public money. People are failing the tests and going to appeal. At
least one of my constituents has been affected in that way. They

back into work through voluntary work easier than being thrown straight
back in. We also need a pool of employers who understand and are

is important to recognise that the symptoms of a wide variety of mental
illnesses such as low self-esteem, physical abuse and alienation from
peers are common traits in a wide range of mental health problems, and
are often particularly manifested in eating disorders. As I have said
previously, the route map to an eating disorder is not identical for
everybody, but similar traits and commons themes can be found. The same
route map and traits can be found in schizophrenia and serious
personality disorders such as bipolar disorder, for example.</hs_Para>

demonstrate the significant threat posed by eating disorders, one need
only make a comparison with a more well-known and recognised mental
health problem such as borderline personality disorder. BPD has a
higher incidence of occurrence than schizophrenia or bipolar disorder
and is thought to be present in about 2% of the general population. It
has a phenomenally high rate of suicide and self-harm: 10% of BPD
sufferers eventually commit suicide successfully. Those mortality rates
are augmented by disorder-related deaths from drug or drink abuse. One
of the most well-known cases of undiagnosed BPD was that of the singer
Amy Winehouse, who eventually died from alcohol poisoning.</hs_Para>

anorexia nervosa—like BPD, it is thought to affect roughly 2% of
the population—has a 20% mortality rate, which is nearly twice
that for BPD. Yet awareness of this shocking statistic is not high;
people simply do not know about it. That could be because, unlike BPD,
those deaths do not predominantly come from suicide—although
that is not uncommon—but happen many years later after the
physical effects of anorexia have taken their toll. Many of the deaths
occur from multiple organ failure or heart attacks, in addition to the
straightforward and more well-known effects of the sufferer having too

right hon. Gentleman’s example of diabetics who manipulate their

want to touch briefly on the significant impact eating disorders can
have on future career opportunities and in the workplace. As I said
earlier, eating disorders are often trivialised and generalised as
being conditions affecting teenage girls. That is far from the truth,
as the highest rate of increase is among male sufferers. In addition,
many eating disorder sufferers are managing their conditions over many
years or even decades. I am the first to emphasise that sufferers can
be of any age and of either gender, although I acknowledge that the age
at which an eating disorder is most likely to manifest itself is 17,
and that it is most likely to do so in girls. It often occurs in
academically high-achieving individuals who put themselves under
immense pressure to be absolutely perfect in every way they can. That
frequently manifests itself in a control of food intake. Those
determined to put themselves under significant academic pressure also
put themselves under massive physical pressure and wish to conform to a
body ideal that is actually far from

wives of people with eating disorders, who told me that not just their
relatives but they themselves suffered that stigma. A number of them

supportive way, and are often very successful. Nafsiyat, an
intercultural therapy centre based in Finsbury Park which was founded
by the late Jafar Kareem, was groundbreaking in its ideas of looking at
the cultural background and ensuring culturally appropriate treatment
of people with mental illness, for example by making sure there are
people who speak the necessary languages and understand something of
the specific cultural background. The Maya Centre, which particularly

wish to make only a couple more points, because I know that other
colleagues wish to contribute to this debate. I intervened earlier
about the number of suicides that take place in prisons and the number
of people in our prisons who are suffering mental illness. Although
such people may be there on the basis of a crime, they need mental
health support rather than incarceration in a prison. Today’s
edition of <I>The Guardian</I> contains a helpful reproduction of a map
of suicides in British prisons. Although the number of suicides has
reduced, 833 prisoners committed suicide in the decade up to 2011. When
a prisoner commits suicide it is traumatic for the prison and for the
prison officers concerned, and devastating for the rest of the prison
population. We need to look much more seriously at how our prisons
operate, the training that is given to prison officers and the mental
health issues that need to be assessed much more carefully by the
courts and by the prison services. We also need to examine whether it
is really necessary or appropriate to put someone who has a mental
health condition into a prison, at any level of security, knowing that
there is a real danger of their committing suicide. They are not going
to become less better because of this approach; they are probably going
to get considerably worse.</hs_Para>

undertaken by Atos on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions. I
am sure that every hon. Member has had people come to their

interview when they are suffering from a mental health condition.
Whether on a good day or a bad day, nearly all of them get assessed as
being capable of work. They therefore start losing benefits and then go
through an appeal. Usually, these people eventually win the appeal, but
the trauma caused during that process has led to suicides, to deep

automatically calling those with mental health conditions in for an

medical records should be looked at first and a much more sympathetic

work and an employer is able to take them on, as there is a job, that
is clearly good—we want and welcome that—but we should
not force them into it. We should not force people to try to hide
mental health conditions. Instead, we should be supportive and
sympathetic towards them. I hope that the message we can send from the

the personal support she has given to addressing issues such as alcohol

an example of maximum alcohol pricing, whereby white cider is being
sold at a maximum price of 23p a unit, and that is destroying areas.
There will always be a way for people to get around a minimum pricing

want to draw attention to the evidence on providing integrated
services. Mental health and physical health services should be much
better integrated. Is the Minister aware of the recent report by the
Centre for Mental Health and the London School of Economics, which
evaluated the use in Birmingham city hospital of the RAID
service—the rapid assessment interface and discharge psychiatric
liaison service? Is the Minister aware of the role that liaison
psychiatry plays? Such services are greatly appreciated by patients and
provide an excellent way for them to receive services; moreover, they
are incredibly cost-effective. By providing rapid access to a
professional service, not only for in-patients but for people who
attend accident and emergency services and those who are seen by the
poisons unit, it reduces re-admission rates, provides better care and
far better outcomes, and saves money. The pressure on A and E services
has been much in the news in recent weeks. Liaison psychiatry reduces
re-attendance at minor injury units and A and E departments, so such
services are vital. It would be really helpful to know whether the
Minister is aware of the evidence base and will be promoting liaison
psychiatry
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0002.htm#13051649000042">I
want to talk about social exclusion and the role of mental health
services in social exclusion. If a person is homeless, they are far
more likely to suffer from mental health problems. Equally, if a person
has mental health problems, they are very much more likely to end up
homeless and on the streets. In my area of Totnes, we tragically have
suffered some deaths among our homeless population. We know from those
who provide help to the homeless in south Devon the level of dual
diagnosis—the number of people who have both mental illness and,
for example, addiction problems. I would very much like to hear from
the Minister in her summing-up what work will be done to improve access
to dual diagnosis. I pay tribute to Mark Hatch and the work that he has
been doing, alongside very many dedicated volunteers, with the Revival
Life Ministries and with Shekinah, providing an outstanding service to
our local community.</hs_Para>

raise a point about access to GP services for the socially excluded and
homeless. In coming months, there will be much focus on how we reduce
health tourism. If, in reducing health tourism, we require people to
bring a passport to their GP in order to be registered, very many
people who are socially excluded will not be registered because they
simply do not have access to identification. I ask the Minister, in
addressing an important problem of great concern, to be particularly
careful to avoid making it even harder for the socially excluded to
obtain help with their problems. That would be a real avoidable
tragedy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0002.htm#13051649000044">Prior
to the debate, a constituent wrote to me most movingly about the
Cinderella service around autism, and lack of access to mental health
services for those who suffer from autism, which has a knock-on effect
on their carers. Listening to accounts from parents, who have been
struggling for so long to obtain the help that their children need, and
their description of what happens as their children move into adult
services, it becomes clear that that is an area where services
genuinely need to be improved. I look forward to hearing from the
Minister what more can be done.</hs_Para>

return to the Health Committee’s review of the Mental Health
Act. Would the Minister look at the evidence on the variation in the
use of community treatment orders around the country, and tackle that
variation? It cannot be right that in some parts of the country they
are not used at all, while in others they are heavily used. The
evidence base on their effectiveness is very poor. Should the
Government lead on that, or should the royal colleges take a lead, so
that we have a system that is transparent and used equally around the

Steve Reed</B> (Croydon North) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to
follow many moving and thought-provoking contributions. I want to raise
the case of Olaseni Lewis, known to his family as Seni, who died after
his family left him in the care of the mental health service. Seni was
a 23-year-old young black man living in Croydon North, the constituency
that I now represent. He had a degree in IT and plans for further
postgraduate study.</hs_Para>

history of mental or physical illness when, on 31 August 2010, he
started to behave in an uncharacteristically odd and agitated manner.
His parents did what they thought was the right thing by taking him to
hospital. He was admitted as a voluntary patient for a few days’
assessment and care. His family left him, when visiting hours ended at
8 pm, with reassurances that they would be contacted if anything
happened.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0002.htm#13051649000048">Seni
became agitated in his family’s absence, and even more so after
he was told that he could not leave the hospital even though he
understood he was there voluntarily. It appears he was sectioned in
order to detain him against his will, and was then restrained and held
face down on the floor by several members of staff and by police
officers who had been called after he kicked a door, although there is
no evidence that he was violent towards
anyone.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0002.htm#13051649000049">Seni
was held face down in a seclusion unit by up to 11 police officers for
a total of 40 minutes in a way that appears to contravene international
conventions on human rights and torture. During the course of that
restraint, Seni slipped into a coma and was eventually put on a life
support machine, which is how his family found him when they were
eventually called four hours after they had left him. He was pronounced
dead four days
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0002.htm#13051649000050">The
Independent Police Complaints Commission is responsible for
investigating the events leading to Seni’s death. Its
investigation began in September 2010. Instead of conducting its
investigation under criminal proceedings and interviewing the police
officers under caution, it chose instead to accept written accounts
which were never challenged. It now accepts that that was a serious
mistake.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0002.htm#13051649000051">In
August 2011 the IPCC referred the matter and its report to the Crown
Prosecution Service to decide whether to prosecute, with a
recommendation against. In the meantime, the IPCC had received new
information that led it to believe that a criminal prosecution should
in fact be pursued. That new information, received in July 2012, was
the pathologist’s report, which raised fresh concerns about the
extent of restraint used against  Seni Lewis. Frustratingly,
the CPS refused to accept that new evidence because it was not included
in the IPCC’s original report—even though it was the IPCC

<?notus-xml column=848?>that wished to amend its own submission. The IPCC claims it has
repeatedly raised that point with the CPS, but to no avail. The CPS
refused to
prosecute.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0002.htm#13051649000052">The
IPCC, eager to put right its own admitted mistakes, tried to persuade
the Metropolitan police to reopen its investigation in order to trigger
a fresh investigation by the IPCC. Following legal advice, the IPPC
believed that that would allow it to interview the police officers
under caution and include the pathologist’s findings in a new
report to the CPS. The Met, unfortunately, had contradictory legal
advice telling it that the IPCC could not overturn its own original
report and refused to open a fresh investigation. The IPCC is now
accusing the Metropolitan police of blocking the investigation that the
IPPC wants to
reopen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0002.htm#13051649000053">So
we reach a highly unsatisfactory impasse. The police will not reopen
the investigation, the CPS will not accept the fresh and potentially
compelling evidence, and the IPCC is not allowed to overturn its own
decision not to investigate under criminal proceedings even though it
believes that the original decision was wrong. In the meantime, a
bereaved family have been waiting, with astonishing patience and great
dignity, for over two years and eight months for an answer on how and
why their beloved son now lies dead after they placed him in the care
of a hospital when he showed early signs of mental ill
health.</hs_Para>

questions that this case raises are profound and frightening. The
organisation Black Mental Health UK is concerned that black people are
44% more likely to be subject to detention under the Mental Health Act
than their white counterparts, even though there is no higher
prevalence of mental illness among the black community. Once in the
system, black people are more likely to be labelled psychotic than
their white counterparts for exhibiting exactly the same behaviour.
They are also more likely to be given a diagnosis of schizophrenia and
to be considered an immediate threat than non-black people. This group
is 29% more likely to be subject to restraint and 49% more likely to be
placed in seclusion. Black Mental Health UK believes this may be the
result of prejudicial assumptions made about young black men in

Croydon. To date the Lewis family have been failed by the mental health

have raised the case of the Lewis family with Ministers over recent
months but I am dissatisfied with their responses. When I asked when an

advice was given to the police over how to operate in a mental health
setting, I was 
<?notus-xml column=849?>told none. When I asked what discussions had taken place between the
Home Secretary and the Health Secretary about the use of the police in
mental health settings, I was told none. When I asked the Health
Minister how many patients were restrained in a mental health setting

does not collect these data. I do not wish to impugn the intentions of

North Yorkshire there have recently been some changes in the way the
problem is tackled. The Harrogate Dementia Collaborative has been
formed, which brings together different bodies. I have met the

I meet mental health groups in my constituency, one of the issues they
raise with me is the provision of a safe haven, a secure place where
people can feel safe, and “safe” is the word that is used
time and again. It is a place where they can find understanding of the
challenges they face, where there is no stigma and where a supportive
environment exists. Such places must be provided by local NHS mental
health services, but they can also be supported by the work of the
voluntary services. I would like to pay tribute to Harrogate Mind and
its team, led by its chair, Mr Peter Thompson. I have visited its base,
the Acorn centre on Station parade in Harrogate, and found it to be a
friendly and relaxed environment with a fantastic range of activities.
Users have told me that they view it as an essential safe place for
them. However, the provision of such places is also a public duty,
something that must be recognised in the NHS and the police services,
as the police are often on the front line in dealing with those who
face mental health
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0002.htm#13051649000074"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:01:48"></hs_TimeCode>Lastly,

the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones) said earlier, look very normal;

I<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> believe that

have already touched on how people can be reluctant to talk about their
mental health issues because there is still an element of stigma and
shame. Although it is great that people are talking about it, we know
that it is still not being talked about enough and that there is still
stigma. Mental health issues can also affect employment and housing and
can lead to rejection by family and
friends.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000079">Different

My<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon) quite properly touched on mental
health issues in the armed forces, and other hon. Members touched on
mental health issues in black and minority ethnic communities. I will
mention that as well because, in addition to a number of barriers, such
as jobs, stigma and rejection by family and friends, they also face the
barrier of accessing appropriate care and treatment that is also
culturally sensitive.</hs_Para>

it is accepted that there is nothing genetically that makes people from
black and minority ethnic groups more vulnerable to mental health
issues, often those issues are not diagnosed properly. Psychiatry in
the United Kingdom, understandably, is based on the western
understanding of mental illness and often medical models are used to
treat it, but in fact mental health means different things to different
people from different cultures and different communities, and they can
be affected by many different issues, such as spiritual, religious and
background issues. Those might relate, for example, to the countries
they have come from. Therefore, a purely medical approach is not
necessarily the right one for many people. A more holistic approach
that looks at a person’s overall health should be
considered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:06:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000081">Contrary
to what was said earlier, there are of course problems with resources.
We know that mental health issues can be very expensive to deal with,
because often it is hard to identify what is happening and the
treatment might take months or years and require one-to-one assessment.
It is much easier when somebody has a damaged arm or a faulty kidney;
such conditions can be expensive to treat, but at least they can be
identified and treated. Once the treatment is done, the person
recovers. But mental health is unique in that respect, because that
does not happen.</hs_Para>

know that drug and alcohol addiction is often linked with mental health
issues. In fact, units that deal with addiction are very expensive, so
there are funding problems. I know that from my own practical knowledge

<?notus-xml column=853?>and experience, having been a criminal law practitioner for 20 years
before becoming a Member of Parliament. When clients were charged with
various criminal offences, they often had psychiatric problems or
problems with drug or alcohol addiction. When they were being
sentenced, the pre-sentence report would often require us to look into
drug or alcohol rehabilitation units. The first question we used to ask
was whether the local authority or social services responsible for the
person had the necessary funding. Weeks used to go by while everybody
searched around to find the funding so that the person could go into
the unit. That is why I raised funding for mental health issues earlier
and questioned whether it is sufficient and appropriately applied to
the whole country. In parts of the country, there are very good
practices and systems, but in many others that is not the case. It is a
question of ensuring that the same treatment, facilities and services
are available across the whole country.</hs_Para>

treatment centres should be available
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:09:35"></hs_TimeCode> the criminal
justice system. There should also be more psychologists and
psychiatrists. The problem we had in criminal cases was that the person
in question often needed to be assessed by a medical expert or
psychologist, and it used to take weeks and weeks before that could be
done, which then used to take time away from treatment. Six months can
elapse between somebody being charged and getting treatment. That is if
they even get the treatment, because sometimes the funding authority
will not fund it, so they end up in the prison system, which does not
help them. That is partly why a large number of people, in comparison
with the rest of the population, commit suicide in
prison<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:09:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000084">Everybody
here, including Ministers, I am sure, wants to deal with mental health
on a humanitarian level, but there is also an economic and financial
case for ensuring that the system is working properly. If we are able
to help a person to recover from their mental health problems, it will
be better for our country and for society generally. For example, if an
adult who cares for children suffers mental health problems and is not
treated properly, those children will often be taken away and put into
care homes or with foster families. That is an incredibly expensive
process. If we are able to support and help the parent, the thousands
of pounds that it would cost to deal with the problem will be saved.
Everyone talks about the humanitarian case, and we all agree with that,
but it makes economic sense as

round objects that came from their youth, and music was being played in
the background that also came from their youth. The environment was
made to look almost like a 1950s drawing room. I was very struck by

That is very important. The other job is to persuade the public that

that there are conditions such as serious neurological malfunctions,
deterioration of the brain, and so on. Affective disorders can be
evident in people classified as being well and also in people
classified as being unwell with mental health issues. What determines
the classification is not only the severity of the condition—the
extent to which the person is down one continuum or another—but
the capacity of society to deal with the condition and the ability of

Speaker, for allowing me to speak in this debate. I had not planned to
do so, but I realised earlier today that I wanted to address an aspect
of female genital mutilation, which I have discussed often in the
House. When I listened to the opening speeches, I realised
that  I have never talked about an issue that many of the

of both acute and, in particular, chronic FGM.</hs_Para>

about; I do not expect any instant answers. As many Members have said,
it is hard enough to talk about mental health, but raising the issue of
the mental health problems of the victims of a secret, taboo and
illegal practice that we have never successfully prosecuted adds
several layers of difficulty to an already difficult situation. We know
enough, however, for the matter to be put on the record so that
somebody at the Department of Health can at least think about it. We
should be worried about
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000100">Female
genital mutilation is practised in many countries around the world, but
it is predominantly an African practice. In this country, it is
practised predominantly by communities from east and sub-Saharan
Africa. Most professionals in the field think that the largest diaspora
groups in which FGM remains prevalent are probably from Kenya and
Somalia; it is certainly heavily practised in those

the absence of a more up-to-date study, people work on the numbers

Women’s Health, Research and Development—which was itself

66,000 women with FGM living in England and Wales and that about 21,000
more girls are at risk of becoming victims. Of course, given the
substantial migratory trends of people from practising countries to the
UK in recent years, the real figure is likely to be

the mentality of those who put them through FGM could not be more

is considered entirely normal in a sexualised society for magazines to
invite young women to express their sexuality and have a fulfilled sex
life. If someone has had a procedure carried out on them, the entire
aim of which is to stop them wanting to have sex and to be a sexual
person, and to restrict them and preserve their virginity—and
everything else associated with the centuries-old tradition of
FGM—that leads to

I meet through some of the groups I work with will say off the record
that it is happening here, but it is more difficult to get people to
say so on the record and to point the police in the right direction.
For example, women are re-presenting having being re-infibulated in
hospital, which is also illegal. I think there is enough evidence now
to suggest that FGM is happening here, but I think that the predominant
view, and that of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, is that
girls being taken overseas is still the biggest problem. Since 2004,
when a private Member’s Bill closed a loophole in the
Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985, such girls have also been
covered by British law. The extraterritorial aspect of the law means
that it is against the law to take a British resident or citizen abroad
to perform FGM on them. Either way, that is covered. I think it is
happening here, but we do not

Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, has been really good on

It has reopened several old cases and is going through them with the
police to see whether a prosecution is possible. It is also looking
more imaginatively at prosecuting the aiders and the abetters, such as
the people who set up the travel and those who supply the strong pain
killers. If we wait for a seven-year-old girl to walk into a police

mental health cases that I came across was that of a wife and mother
who had been subjected

the ordeal had healed, the mental manifestations continued a decade on.
She could not function either as a woman or as a mother and wife. That
case drove home to me that
many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:36:21"></hs_TimeCode> of the
mental health issues that we face in this country are ignored simply

issues have come to my attention recently through my casework: the
speed of treatment and the consistency of care. One of my constituents
had to wait for many weeks to be referred to a psychiatrist. She was
able to cope with that, but every time she went to see the psychiatrist
for an appointment, she saw a new psychiatrist and had to repeat her
case history. Although the notes may have been there, the new
psychiatrist either had not bothered to read them or wanted the patient
to repeat the details. That was disruptive to the
treatment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:37:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000132">My

constituent turned 18 or 19, she was no longer suitable for the
facility that she was in. She had to fight for a new facility, with the
help of her parents. When she eventually got into a new facility, it
was not in the same place or with the same clinicians. That disruption

the mental health of the patient would benefit from continuity.

caught up with the “prison works” narrative, it is worth
remembering how many people in prison are either illiterate or simply

speech about—among other things—the importance of a
holistic treatment for mental 
<?notus-xml column=862?>health issues and taking regard of people’s different cultural
backgrounds, which I thought was important. There was, as always, an
interesting and provocative speech from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:44:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Southport (John Pugh), and I was interested to listen to
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:44:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Battersea (Jane Ellison) who spoke about mental health and female
genital mutilation—if it had been my choice, her speech could
have gone on longer. I thought she raised important issues, and the
House should respect the lead that she has shown in addressing the
issue, which is difficult for people outside the affected communities
to address. If in future some young girls are not subjected to that
child abuse because of her work, she will deserve the congratulations
of this House.

every family will have experience of mental health. It is not something
that happens to other people, but something that happens in our own
families. One in four of us will suffer from mental illness at some
point, and by 2030, depression will be the leading cause of disease
around the world, costing the NHS a further £10 billion a year.

year. The key points he made are worth reporting and concern the
importance of breaking down stigma—something that the House
dwelt on at length in last year’s debate—and the
importance of parity of esteem for mental health within the NHS. My
mother was a mental health nurse in Huddersfield, and her hospital was
a former Victorian workhouse on the fringes of Huddersfield. Having an
old workhouse outside the city for mental health issues, and mainstream
health services in the centre, illustrates the lack of parity of esteem
for mental health in relation to the services we offer, and also to
practitioners at every level within mental health services.</hs_Para>

concluding, I want to say a few words on black and minority ethnic
persons and mental health. It has been known for at least 25 years that
BME persons are disproportionately present in the mental health system.
We are more likely to be diagnosed as schizophrenic, less likely to be
offered talking therapy, and more likely to be offered drugs and
electro-convulsive
treatment—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:52:52"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Totnes touched on that important point. There is
therefore a great deal of fear and anxiety about approaching the mental
health system on the part of some of our BME communities. Very often,
mothers will be trapped at home with sons who have serious mental
challenges. I have dealt with cases in which they are assaulted in
their own homes, but are so frightened of the system that they will
stay trapped rather than take their sons for treatment. That is a real
problem. We must monitor what is happening and use the voluntary
sector. We need to ensure that minority groups do not hold back from
presenting with mental health problems. The later people present, the
more severe the
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000160">Mental
health is the biggest financial burden on the health service. It will
affect the families of all hon. Members in the Chamber in our
lifetimes. There is much to be concerned about in mental health trends.
For instance, there is a rise in mental health issues among young
people. Fully half of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youngsters
are
self-harming.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000161">As
I have said, there is a relationship between an economic downturn and a
rise in suicides of men under the age of 35. None the less, there is
the possibility of progress. I believe that there is now less stigma
about mental health than there was a generation ago, and the debate we
had last year on the Floor of the House played its part in helping to
lessen it. I think there is more understanding about some of the
contributory issues than there was a generation ago, and I believe that
public health going to local authorities opens up the possibility of
innovation in mental health, working together with the voluntary
sector.</hs_Para>

that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T14:57:05"></hs_TimeCode> the arrival
of public health in local authorities presents us with an opportunity.
The establishment of Public Health England brings its expertise to bear
on its relationships with local practitioners in public health, working
alongside other services. The potential for public mental health, which
has been largely disregarded or ignored in too many places in the past,
is real. At the conference for the directors of children and adult
services in Eastbourne last October, I attended a presentation by an
academic from the London School of Economics on the economic case for
interventions in public mental health. There is a powerful return on
investment, which means that people are benefiting from it. We have a

risk of suicide, yet only about 50% of A and E departments ensure that
that happens. That has to change, because lives are literally at stake.

to sign up to that campaign, so that we can lead from the front. We 
<?notus-xml column=866?>cannot expect private sector and other public sector employers to act

respond to the substantive challenges and questions they have raised,
but let me touch now on several quick points made today.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:02:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bridgend (Mrs Moon) mentioned the importance of recognising the
link between alcohol abuse and mental health. She talked about people
who have left the armed forces with problems of post-traumatic stress
disorder, which has become prevalent with the conflicts in Iraq,
Afghanistan and so forth. Simon Wessely and his colleagues are doing
some fantastic work on that.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady also mentioned the role of the police, particularly the
Metropolitan police, and made the valid point that they are not trained
well enough or systematically enough. Lord Adebowale, whom I met this
week to talk about his report, makes the point that the police will
always have to deal with mental health. It is not a question of it
being wrong that they are dealing with it; the critical point is that
there should be close working between the police and mental health
services so that there is an immediate referral, not an inappropriate
placing of someone in a police cell. Just imagine suffering from a
mental health crisis and ending up in a police cell. It is the worst
possible thing that could happen. Even children sometimes end up in
police stations. It is totally inappropriate and avoidable—that
is the important point.</hs_Para>

hon. Members for Broxbourne (Mr Walker) and
for<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:03:33"></hs_TimeCode> North Durham
(Mr Jones), who have done so much to challenge stigma, have performed a
valuable service in speaking out about their own experiences of mental
illness. They have demonstrated, very visibly, that someone can be
successful and make an enormous contribution to society, yet also have
mental health problems. That is an incredibly important point.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:04:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Broxbourne talked about the role of employers and mentioned some
really good employers, such as BT. This is about enlightened
self-interest, not just about being kind to people. It is in
companies’ and employers’ interests, including the
Government’s, to treat mental health issues
seriously.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:04:59"></hs_TimeCode> The
cost to employers when 
<?notus-xml column=867?>those suffering from mental health problems lose their jobs—the
loss of all the training and experience or just the sickness
absence—is enormous, but it can be significantly reduced with a
smarter approach. The hon. Member for North Durham talked about a
number of individuals who have had mental health issues, but also been
very successful. He talked a lot about the importance of tackling
stigma.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)—I apologise for missing

issues. I will ensure that she receives proper responses to them. She
talked about liaison psychiatry. While we are talking about emergency
services, one thing that has become more and more apparent to me is the
complete disparity between what happens to people with mental health
problems and what happens to those with physical health problems. I was
utterly shocked—but sadly not surprised—by a letter that
a Member of Parliament in the south-west wrote on behalf of a
constituent. The constituent had rung the crisis number for mental
health services in his area and had not got a reply. No one was
answering the crisis helpline.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:06:31"></hs_TimeCode>On another

we come to what happens in A and E and the fact that in too many
hospitals there is no mental health specialism available. Last Saturday
I met a constituent who had found her son at home with ligature marks
round his neck. She took him to A and E, where there was a half-hour

picture round the country was very variable. That is more the case in

the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones) and I raised the question of the

Someone else made the point that this is not a question of not
addressing the need to help people get back into work. Work is
particularly important in relation to people suffering from mental ill
health, and the idea that we should simply leave them undisturbed and
out of work for the rest of their lives is totally wrong. The way in

hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Mike Freer) talked about
waiting times for access to treatment. He asked if he could gently
challenge the Minister—I appreciated that approach. On the
mandate for the NHS Commissioning Board, NHS England has been very
clear that we expect it to assess the scale of the problem of access,
including for IAPT. Other Members have raised the question of whether
we are meeting the IAPT programme’s four-week target. We want

of the big problems relating to what I regard as the institutional bias
against mental health is that on one side of the equation we have the
18-week maximum 
<?notus-xml column=870?>waiting time for physical health, which is a very powerful political
driver of where the money goes, yet we have nothing equivalent for
mental health on the other side. That, to me, is a lack of parity of
esteem. For people with mental health problems, early access is
particularly important to ensure that their condition can be halted, if
possible, and the deterioration stopped.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

want to mention four of the most important things that this Government
are doing to create the environment and incentives for improving mental
health across the system as a whole. The first is the Health and Social
Care Act 2012, which creates a “parity of esteem” so that
mental and physical health share the same importance, as we have
discussed this afternoon. Changing the law is just the start, but it
sends a clear signal—that mental health is important, and that
the health and care system can and must play a leading role in changing
attitudes across society as a
whole.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000196">Secondly,
there is the mandate the Secretary of State has issued to NHS England.
It shows the importance we have ascribed to mental health and makes it
clear where improvements are needed. The mandate makes clear our
overarching goal—that mental health must have equal priority
with physical health across all aspects of NHS work. In particular, we
have highlighted the need to close the gap in outcomes between people
with mental illness and the population as a whole, as well as the
absolute imperative to ensure that people can access the services they
need when they need them. Neither of these facets of good mental health
treatment is entirely up to scratch at the moment. I think we all

relate specifically to mental health and many others that include
mental health just as much as physical health. The other outcomes
frameworks contain other measures designed to ensure that we improve

we provide the best possible care and support to those people with

I want to mention our continuing commitment to the IAPT programme.
Since the programme began, it has treated more than 1 million people

moved from benefits into work. Nevertheless, we need to do more. We are
currently involved in a joint programme with the Department for Work
and Pensions, which involves commissioning work to find a way of
providing much speedier access to psychological therapies for people
with mental health problems who are out of work. It seems crazy that we
are spending money on benefits when giving those people access to

Mark Spencer</B> (Sherwood) (Con):</Member> First, let me say that it
is not my intention to take up the full two hours that are available to
us for this debate, but I do want to raise an issue that is very
important, in particular to my Sherwood constituency. One of the issues
on which I stood for election was resolving the terrible road safety
record in Sherwood, particularly around the A614, a stretch of road
with which all in the east midlands will be familiar. There have been a
lot of fatal accidents on it, with people killed at some of the
terrible junctions. That was affecting the local community.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13051649000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000222">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:29:30"></hs_TimeCode>
was one tragic accident in which six people were killed, which
resonated particularly strongly with the local community, and it became
one of my ambitions to get elected as a Member of Parliament and
resolve some of the problems facing the people living around the A614.
I have campaigned long and hard to introduce measures to improve
junctions. We have been able to improve the Ollerton roundabout and
make traffic flows much smoother. We have also been able to put in new
traffic lights at the Rose Cottage junction and improve the flows in
and out of Edwinstowe.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13051649000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000223">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:29:30"></hs_TimeCode>
have also introduced average speed cameras, which have reduced traffic
speeds along the A614 and—I hesitate to say this—stopped
the fatal accidents; there has not been another one since they were
introduced.
Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:29:12"></hs_TimeCode> cameras
are not universally welcomed. Some of my constituents do not like them;
they complain they delay their journey, so it takes them longer to get
from A to B. I recognise the frustration of some drivers travelling up
and down our busy roads, but my priority is making sure people are not
killed on the
roads.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000224"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:27:22"></hs_TimeCode>It
is important to draw a distinction between a conviction for speeding,
for which someone might get a £60 fine and three points on their
licence, and more serious incidents for which the perpetrator might be
convicted of dangerous or careless driving. There is a conception among
the public that it is easy to secure a conviction for speeding, such as
driving at 34 mph in a 30 mph zone, but that there is less enthusiasm
among the police and in the Crown Prosecution Service to go after the
more challenging conviction of dangerous driving, as the burden of
evidence is much greater.</hs_Para>

was contacted by a constituent of mine, Louise Stanbrook, who had been
to a concert at the Nottingham arena and was crossing the road to walk
home when she was knocked over by a driver and quite seriously injured.
She suffered a broken collar bone and was knocked unconscious. She also
suffered damage to her teeth and spectacles and to her possessions. It
was a very serious incident.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:29:12"></hs_TimeCode> perpetrator
had a number of previous driving convictions, and was also due to be
sentenced for another crime unconnected to this driving offence.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:29:19"></hs_TimeCode>The CPS and the
police decided it was not in the public interest to pursue the
individual for the driving offences he had committed on this occasion,
as he was serving an offence unconnected to
driving.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000226">It
strikes me that the justice system is there for two reasons, the first
of which is to make sure that those who commit crimes are rehabilitated
and are able to 
<?notus-xml column=874?>come back into society, having paid their debt. However, the justice
system is also there for the victims to see that justice has been
done and that when they have been violated in any
way the perpetrators of the crime against them make recompense and have
to pay a debt to society. That might involve a fine, a custodial
sentence or a driving ban, which is another point I wish to deal with a
little
later<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:30:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000227">Louise
would say that it is a perception—it is her
perception—that people who commit a minor speeding offence,
which is still an offence, are prosecuted on a regular basis, as we can
agree is only right and fair, but people who commit a much more serious
offence such as dangerous driving or careless driving do not suffer the
same enthusiasm from the Crown Prosecution Service; there is a
reluctance to pursue convictions for such offences because of the
amount of evidence that has to be gathered in order to pursue them.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:30:57"></hs_TimeCode>That sends the
wrong message to society, and the House needs to overcome that and
ensure that we turn that tide, so that not only is justice being done,
but it is being seen to be done by our constituents and they can have
confidence in it. We have to put our hands up and say that many people
get caught speeding, but people need to feel that those who commit
serious offences are being pursued by the legal system with the same
vigour and enthusiasm.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13051649000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000228">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:31:30"></hs_TimeCode>
is very important and it leads me to my second point, which relates to
where the justice system is letting us down. It seems wrong that where
someone is convicted of a very serious driving offence and is sent to
jail, and part of the sentence is a driving ban, they can serve that
ban while they are in prison. Given that they cannot drive then anyway
because they are being held at Her Majesty’s convenience, it
would seem only appropriate that any driving ban that is part of the
sentence should be served when they come out of prison and back into
society. I would ask the Minister to pass my comments on to the Justice
Secretary; he should examine that issue closely on his return, as it is
a fundamental part of this debate.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13051649000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000229"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>There
is another perception that people get enormously frustrated
about—my constituents certainly do. Most people work hard, they
purchase a car, which can be very expensive, they pay their tax by
buying their tax disc and they pay for insurance to drive that car.
They also pay for an MOT to make sure it is roadworthy and if they are
caught committing a driving offence, they of course pay their fine.
However, a section of society does not take out insurance, does not
pass a driving test and does not obey the laws. When such people are
caught committing a driving misdemeanour, they are often taken to
court, prosecuted and then given points on their licence—which
they do not possess—and banned from
driving<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-16T15:34:16"></hs_TimeCode>, even
though they did not possess a driving licence in the first place.
Members of the public find it enormously frustrating when they see all
the hoops they have to jump through to be a law-abiding citizen and to
drive appropriately, yet they perceive that those people who—I
hope hon. Members will forgive my Sherwood language—stick two
fingers up at the law and ignore it seem to get away with it. That
really does need

Elan Jones</B> (Clwyd South) (Lab):</Member> Does the hon. Gentleman

suppose the challenge is that the law is in chunks—careless
driving, death by careless driving, dangerous driving, death by
dangerous driving—and there are very tight boundaries. There is
no sliding scale of punishment. I believe that lack of flexibility is
what drives the CPS sometimes not to go for the more serious chunk, but
to satisfy itself with a conviction lower down the scale because it can
be sure of obtaining one. That needs addressing, and the only way to do
that is to have a review of what laws are in place and whether those
tools need adapting. Within the current law the tools are available to
make those serious prosecutions, but at the moment the CPS is not
minded to go for those serious convictions, whether that is because of
the chunking of the convictions or the lack of a sliding scale. That is
what needs
addressing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000233" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000233">As

Spencer:</Member></B> I would agree with that. We must remember that
the purpose of speed cameras is not to catch people; it is not to get
cash out of drivers. It is to prevent them from being killed or
seriously injured. I get many letters from constituents asking for the
police to go into their village—I hesitate to use the words
“speed trap” because it gives the wrong impression, but
that is what they often ask for. They want the police to enforce speed
limits to ensure that people driving through their villages and towns
do not break the speed limit, particularly outside primary schools and
other local schools. That gives me confidence that we are on the right
side of the argument—that our constituents want enforcement of
speed limits and want the law to be obeyed. However, they want a
balance between serious and minor offences. The perception is that
there is not that balance at the
moment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051649000236" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/debtext/130516-0003.htm#13051649000236">If
I may summarise, my No. 1 request is to remove the anomaly of driving
bans coinciding with prison sentences. If a person is convicted of an
offence, serves time in jail and receives a driving ban, the start of
the driving ban should be postponed until their release from prison, so
that there is that extra removal from our roads for those who have been
convicted of a driving offence. Secondly, I want to encourage the CPS
and the police to use all the tools at their disposal. I am
sure  the Department would be more than happy to receive
representations from the CPS or the police if they have reservations
about some of those tools. I would encourage the CPS and the police to
be more diligent and look at going for more serious convictions if they
feel they can 
<?notus-xml column=876?>gather the evidence to get those convictions. They should not simply
lay the burden of keeping up the number of
convictions on the minor offences.</hs_Para>

in individual cases are a matter for the courts to decide, subject to
the maximum limits and sentencing guidelines. When deciding what the
appropriate sentence within the range should be, the court will
consider the seriousness of the offence. This includes both the
culpability of the offender and the harm that the offence has caused.
The court will also consider any other aggravating or mitigating
factors. The law therefore seeks to punish those who cause death or

the vehicle, safety measures such as seat belts and offences relating
to non-compliance with, for example, driving direction and traffic

careless driving, and causing death where a driver is unlicensed,

Justice figures show that, tragically, the number of motoring deaths

convictions for dangerous and aggravated offences has come down and the
number of convictions for careless driving has gone up, which suggests

issued two relevant sets of guidelines: those on driving offences where

regard to the relevant treatment of speeding and drink-impaired

£2,500 when committed on a motorway. The court may disqualify
the offender and must impose penalty points. Driving under the
influence of alcohol is punishable by a fine of up to £5,000 or
up to six months’ imprisonment. The court must disqualify the
offender for at least 12 months. Those convicted of serious driving
offences face the prospect of lengthy custodial sentences. In 2011, the
average custodial sentence length for those convicted of causing death
by dangerous driving was over four years. Accident statistics from the

drug-driving are fairly equally unacceptable in terms of harm caused.

Graham Stuart</B> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con):</Member> I am
delighted to be here to lead this debate under your august
chairmanship, Mr Benton, and to have the opportunity to discuss my
Committee’s report. I am also pleased to be joined by so many
Committee members and ex-members, and to see that all three main
parties are represented in the debate. The reason why we are here is
that the ministerial decisions considered in our report will have
profound and far-reaching consequences. Young people need good-quality
careers guidance if they are to make informed choices about the courses
that they take at school and their options when they leave school. That
is all the more important now due to the difficult economic
backdrop.</hs_Para>

advice typically available? No. It is worth putting on record that the
Government inherited a bad situation: a dysfunctional system of careers
guidance. In 2009, the Panel on Fair Access to the Professions reported
on the low level of satisfaction with the careers guidance work
provided by the Connexions service, which is little mourned overall. In
2010, Ofsted criticised inconsistencies in provision.</hs_Para>

Act 2011 represented a chance for a fresh start. The Education
Committee’s report was prompted by the introduction of the new
statutory duty on schools to secure access to independent, impartial
careers guidance for pupils in years 9 to 11. The Committee came to the
conclusion that the transfer of responsibility to schools was
regrettable, as was the way it was done. Our view was prompted not by
any nostalgia for the previous arrangements but by concern about how
the transfer was implemented. At the time, Ministers had other
priorities. They were under great budgetary pressure, and careers
guidance lost out. None of the £196 million in funding that the
Connexions service received for its careers guidance
work—£196 million to provide the signposting that we
argue is vital for young people to make the right choices and ensure
that the public money that serves their needs is spent in the right
way—was passed to schools.</hs_Para>

change, a survey by Careers England found that only one in six schools
had the same level of investment in careers activities as the year
before. That is, one in six maintained what they had. The Minister
needs to take that seriously. The survey also found that not a single
school had increased its level of investment, even after the Connexions
service, however patchy its performance, had been removed from the
scene.</hs_Para>

countries that have transferred responsibility for careers guidance to
schools, such as the Netherlands and New Zealand, does not support that
approach. In those countries, the schools were at least given funding
to supply the service when they were given the duty to do so;
nevertheless, the Committee was told that even there, the transfer of
the duty had resulted in a significant reduction in both the quality
and extent of careers guidance provision in schools. That is why we
described the transfer of responsibility as regrettable, much to the
Government’s
chagrin.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000012">Separately,
the OECD has highlighted the limitations of a purely school-based model
of careers advice. They include lack of impartiality, weak links with
the labour market and inconsistency of provision between schools. That
matters, because young people need guidance in order to make good
decisions. A recent study by the Education and Employers Taskforce, led
by Nick Chambers, underlined the problem. The taskforce surveyed 11,000
13 to 16-year-olds, mapping their job ambitions against the employment
market up to 2020. It showed that teenagers have a weak grasp of the
availability of certain jobs. For example, 10 times as many youngsters
as there are jobs likely to be available were aiming for jobs in the
culture, media and sports
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000013">I
acknowledge the pressing need to deliver spending efficiencies where
possible, but this is not a spending efficiency; it is the promotion of
spending inefficiency, as we waste money by placing students on the
wrong courses. When the Committee visited Bradford college in October
last year, I met a young man whose experience typifies the waste of
time, money and potential to which poor careers guidance, or the
complete lack of it, can lead. He was taking a course to join the
uniformed services. He had wasted the previous year on a course that
was not right for him and would not have led to a job in the fire
service, which he wanted to join. To add insult to injury, this young
man, who wanted to be a fireman, found out during the appropriate
course that the fire service is now shrinking, and that there was
unlikely to be a job for him at the end of his course. The system let
that young man down, and it is doing the country no good at all. How
did it happen? He did not receive proper guidance about the courses
that he needed to realise his dreams, or even guidance about the dreams
that he had a chance of realising.</hs_Para>

one anecdotal example. When the experience is scaled up, huge amounts
of money are being wasted. With youth unemployment at 21% and the CBI
currently characterising the transition from school to work as
“chaotic”, the policy smacks of false
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000015">None
the less, the Committee accepts that the new arrangements involving the
statutory duty on schools are in place, and being so freshly put on the
statute book, are not immediately likely to change. Schools have the
duty. If I appear to be giving the new Minister a hard time, I
recognise that he only has one foot in the Department for Education,
whose performance on the issue has been so woeful. He also has
responsibility in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills,
whose performance has been much better.</hs_Para>

the National Careers Service is a  huge boost to careers
guidance for adults. It is essential in an integrated and competitive
world, and it is re- professionalising careers advice. The
Committee was therefore pleased—nay, delighted—that the
Government

schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000017">On
the subject of the NCS, I note with regret the recent resignations of
Heather Jackson and Professor Tony Watts from the National Careers
Council because they believe that the Department for Education has been
“escaping its responsibilities” by proposing that the
funding provided by BIS for the National Careers Service should be
stretched to fill the gaps in services for young people. They observe
that the Department for Education has provided the NCS with only
£7 million in funding, compared to the £83 million that
BIS has provided for adult careers services.</hs_Para>

Minister reassure us that the Department for Education is committed to
supporting the work of the NCS properly? Will the Department realise
the opportunity that the NCS provides to ensure that we have an
all- ages, competent, re-professionalised careers service? An
opportunity has arisen from the Government policy that established the
NCS. An extra £50 million in funding, set against the £56
billion education budget, could make a huge difference and deliver a
much more sophisticated and responsive service.</hs_Para>

some changes that the Committee welcomed. We were pleased by the
decision to expand the duty on schools to offer careers guidance down
to pupils in year 8, and up to 16 to 18-year-olds in school
or college. We think that was logical, and our Committee heard strong
evidence for doing it. It might seem an obvious thing to do, but the
Government should none the less be congratulated on doing it. That
decision was taken during the course of our inquiry. I know that
Ministers always—well, mostly—take note of the powerful
arguments coming from our Committee, which makes for a much more
coherent policy. It is a big win for young people, particularly those
about to leave the school system, and I congratulate
Ministers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000020">However,
the Committee was disappointed that the Government rejected several of
our other recommendations. We advised that each young person should be
entitled to at least one face-to-face careers interview with an
independent adviser, an opportunity that 98% of schools consider
important. We also suggested that schools should be required to publish
an annual careers plan setting out information about the careers
guidance provided to pupils and the resources allocated to it. Careers
plans could form an important part of the new accountability regime for
schools. At the moment, schools simply do not see careers advice as a
priority. Being obliged to publish their plans would put them under
pressure  to deliver in that area and not merely to focus on
things such as GCSEs, which tend to drive behaviour in secondary
schools.</hs_Para>

neither of those recommendations has been adopted. Like all
organisations, schools are driven by the things on which they are
evaluated, and they are not evaluated on careers advice—except
during Ofsted’s rare visits—so it gets neglected by head
teachers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000022">We
welcome Ofsted’s ongoing thematic review of careers advice and
guidance, which is due to report this summer, but Ofsted’s
routine inspection framework for schools is simply not designed to make
a clear judgment 
<?notus-xml column=4?>on careers guidance provision, as Ofsted itself acknowledges.
Accordingly, we urged Ministers to pursue the development of more
sophisticated education destination measures, to make the data analysis
more
meaningful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000023">Only
yesterday, I questioned the Secretary of State for Education before the
Select Committee. He apologised for failing to include destination
measures in the Government’s accountability consultation for
schools, and he made a commitment to do further work to strengthen the
accountability proposals in that way. We support our Ministers’
ambition to expand the time frame of the destination measures and to
try to make them a reliable set of data that can be used to hold
schools to account—something which, for now, we do not
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000024">Careers
guidance can provide a crucial signpost for rewarding employment. It
can help young people—such as the young man I met in
Bradford—to make the right choices first time. With the right
advice, that young man could have a clear sense of where his
opportunities lie. If the fire service was not recruiting, he could
explore a job with another branch of the services, such as the Army. He
would not waste time repeating a year, and could get a job when he left
education. High-quality, independent and impartial advice has a key
role to play in helping pupils to make good choices. If the system
fails young people, a human and economic cost is incurred, by both the
young people and the wider society that risks squandering their
talents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000025">In

respect to Ministers, our so-called process points were about ensuring
that young people can access proper careers advice, at a time when five
in six schools are cutting back on it. That could help to prevent
obvious mistakes. For example, our report highlights the lack of

being a flagship coalition
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000027">Ministers
assume that schools will always do the best thing for the children in
their care but, in reality, schools will deliver what they are measured
on. The system will not deliver when schools are not evaluated on the
quality of the careers guidance they provide, and when they are not
given funding to supply it. In truth, the Committee is perhaps better
focused on outcomes than Ministers who made such a hash of the policy
in the

is the point of all the education reforms the Government have
undertaken, if there is no decent signposting between education and the

Ministers think that this is about process, I assure them that it is
not. It is about our Committee, working on a cross-party basis,

want to talk today about the Committee’s report, and a little
about the Government’s response. In taking evidence from many of
those involved in the education of young people, the Committee visited
careers services and schools, looking at what good practice was
emerging, and identifying where deficiencies were most acute. Most
importantly, perhaps, we also spoke to young people themselves about
the services they received. The crux of our findings is wrapped up at
the start of our
report:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13051650000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000164">“The

we found that international evidence suggests that a school-based model
does not deliver the best provision for young people, and we concluded
that the weakness of that model had been compounded by the
Government’s failure to transfer any budget to schools with
which to support the service. That led, predictably and perhaps
inevitably, to a drop in overall provision, with fewer than one in six
schools providing anything like a reasonable
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000033">In
its inquiry, the Committee was very realistic about the historical
performance of career services and Connexions, and did not see the
previous service provided to young people as good or not in need of
considerable reform. It was clear to us that the Connexions service had
fallen well short of expectations in most areas, with the probable
exception of its services for vulnerable children, where I think that
the level of provision and service was at least reasonable if not good.
It was also clear that the service delivered far from the high
expectations that the Government had of it on its
creation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000034">However,
the Government’s response has been not to reform the Connexions
service but to abolish it altogether, transferring the statutory duty
to schools, and not providing any of the £196 million of funding
that was previously available for the service. That is leaving schools
and pupils high and dry, and it is clear that young people will make
less informed decisions and choices about their future education and
training as a result. That will have a major, negative and long-term
impact on the lives of some young people, and it will be those who do
not have access, within their families and family circles, to
well-informed professional advice who will be hardest hit and lose out

just on one survey: we listened to a huge amount of evidence from
schools, local authorities, careers specialists, employers, sixth-form
college representatives, further education colleges, teachers’
representatives and head teachers’ representatives, and we
listened to what young people told us about the service they received.

practice, they were doing it on very little funding, or by borrowing
from Peter to pay Paul—taking money from other parts of the

failure to draw attention to the Education Committee’s report,
with its strong recommendations on steps to be taken to address the
current crisis  in schools, including the urgent need for

Whittaker</B> (Calder Valley) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to
participate in this debate under your chairmanship, Mr Benton. I think
that everyone agrees that top-down careers guidance under the old
Connexions-type service did not work effectively. As we have heard, the
damning 2010 Ofsted report proved that point. The opportunity for the
coalition Government was therefore immense. It was a good opportunity
to have a hugely coherent policy, while getting value for money for the
taxpayer. The verdict is still out on whether that has been achieved,
and we as a Committee look forward to revisiting the new policy to
assess its effectiveness and value for
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000051">I

have personal experience of growing up in a small outback Australian
town, based purely around the production of steel, where aspiration
among our peers, our parents and the educators tasked with inspiring us
was low, not because we all grew up in households that were not loving
and caring—in fact, quite the opposite—but because, in
those days, our parents quite often did not understand what aspiration
was beyond their lot. Top that with teachers who had never done
anything apart from being in education, and it was almost a recipe for
most of us in our small country town to be destined  for much
the
same.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000053">Of
course, 20 years on—okay, 40 years on—some things are
very different, and we live in a very different world. However, for
young people from backgrounds where aspiration is low, in many cases
because people know nothing different, it is vital that when they are
away from their family home they are given every opportunity not only
to aspire, but to understand aspiration and to have signposting to the
steps that they need to take to unlock a world that is
enabling.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000054">Many
people need to play a role in that journey, not least the family, but I
am concerned about what happens when, for whatever reason, parents
cannot give that support. As our Committee saw in Bradford, some areas
are pooling resources for a coherent policy for all schools that takes
away the postcode lottery. What about schools and areas that do not do
that? How do we ensure that each child has free access to support the
unlocking of each step of their
journey?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000055">I
agree that schools have the second biggest role to play after the
family, so their role is increased when that support is not available
in families. We all remember our inspirational teachers, but I bet we
remember more those teachers we hated or who did not inspire us. When
the Minister gave evidence to the Committee, he said that teachers come
from a variety of backgrounds. Yes, they do, but not enough come from a
different career background, so they have very little experience of
what the jobs market needs or offers as opportunities for young
people.</hs_Para>

the banking crisis hit a few years ago, we discovered that Calder
Valley has the third most vulnerable local economy in the UK, based on

TSB’s base there. Yet there has been a partnership between that
bank and our local college on apprenticeships for only two years,
despite the bank’s reliance on more than 6,000 employees from
the area. Just now, as we speak, the local college is constructing
courses to tie in with the area’s high-end manufacturing base.
Although 20% of people in Calder Valley work in manufacturing, only now
is there a manufacturing-specific vocational course. Why does it take
an MP to drive those things? They should have happened many years

first job as MP was to open a technology centre in one of my local high

only last year did we see a local business taking over the hairdressing
course. That was another huge opportunity missed, sadly letting down

that the Government have removed the statutory duty around work-related
learning to enable schools themselves to decide on what is the best
vehicle for young people, but as I have highlighted, we have a huge way
to go to change the experience and the ethos of our educators to
deliver such a huge aspiration. Sadly, we have missed a huge
opportunity to encourage business to play a much bigger role. The
countries around the world that do exceedingly well in this area show
that a partnership between education, business and family contributes
not only to producing high aspirations among their young people but

to pick out the points that the commission highlighted. Interestingly,
those points, which come from a regional perspective, accord with what
the Select Committee has found nationally. First, it was noted that
information, advice and guidance is frequently not impartial or focused
enough. Secondly, many young people do not know about the roles that
are available; they are just not aware of the jobs and roles that are
available either locally or nationally. As the Chair of the Select
Committee said, there is a mismatch between what they might be
interested in and what jobs are there. Thirdly, it was said that we
need more employers involved in mentoring and coaching, but we need an
infrastructure to make that happen. If the money has been taken away
and the responsibility transferred, how does that
happen?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000068">Fourthly,
the commission noted that labour market information in insufficient and
restricted—a key point made by the Chair of the Select Committee
at the start of the debate. Career opportunities need to be sold to
young people, so a process is needed by which their eyes are opened.
The hon. Member for Calder Valley talked about inspirational teachers,
but we could have inspirational careers advisers,
too.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000069">The
commission also said that parents need to understand the opportunities
that are available for their children. It is important that they have
access to advice and guidance as well. There is a lack of information 
<?notus-xml column=11?>with regard to opportunities in the offshore wind industry and the
supply chain. Given that there is a big opportunity in such an
industry, it was quite a stark moment to realise
how little was known about it within the educational system, which
needs to be preparing people for the jobs of today and tomorrow and not
the jobs of yesterday.</hs_Para>

people as well? Furthermore, does he agree that if the Government found
from the Department for Education not necessarily the kind of money

because the last thing the Humber commission found was a mismatch
between the standard of support for young people and adults, with
adults generally getting a better service. The Chairman is absolutely
right and he lays down the challenge to the Minister, but the Minister
can be inventive. We have heard one way forward. Another way would be
to provide the resources to local enterprise partnerships. The matter
could then be taken forward through city deals to allow the LEPs to
innovate. The Chairman gives a good way forward, but there are other
ways, and I am sure the Minister will be up for taking on board those
interesting ideas.</hs_Para>

attention to the concerns of the Association of Colleges—this is
coming from my background as a college principal. There is concern at
the moment about the perverse incentives in the current system, which
allow new schools to be established even where there is an over-supply
of places. When that happens, we create a competitive environment in
which schools are trying to maintain their pupil numbers through
compulsory education and up to 18 years old. That militates against the
provision of truly independent information, advice and guidance because
such advice might, for example, recommend that a young person remains
in the school because that benefits the school but not necessarily the
young person. Independence of advice is crucial; otherwise we get the
outcomes that have already been described in this debate that are not
in the interests of either young people or UK plc because we are
wasting
talent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000073">Let

see the hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin) gracing the education
world once more. We remain a happy if not always entirely united
Committee, which is good for democracy. This morning, I was busy
telling a conference just what the role of a Select Committee is. There
seemed to be some confusion, with people thinking that we are just
another adjunct of the Government, but if they came along here they
would notice that members of Select Committees do not just simply
salute the Government, which is another good aspect of Parliament that
we should reflect on and be pleased about.</hs_Para>

Chairman of the Committee mentioned, at our last meeting we talked
about destinations, and the Secretary of State mentioned that he was
sorry that he had not covered that issue properly in the accountability
world. It is a critical issue and I want to say why it is so important
that we know about destinations, and why that has an impact on schools
in terms of careers. Obviously, if a school is to be measured by the
destinations of its pupils in the future, it will show a great interest
in finding the best destinations for its pupils and encouraging them
towards those destinations. We need to bear that in mind as a stimulus
for schools, particularly secondary schools. In other words, if a
school is identified as good because of its record in getting pupils
into good jobs or good pathways to further their careers and so on, it
will establish the mechanisms that will help it to do that. We should
work really hard to ensure that we have a destination measurement
system in
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000080">I
say that because whenever I ask companies in my constituency what we
can do to help, there are usually three things. First, there are
regulations; they are talked about by people in just about every
organisation. Then, of course, there is criticism of high street banks,
because they do not lend. But the commonest question is, “Where
do we recruit from? Where are the skills?” We must start working
out how we match the demand for skills with the output of our education
system. Doing that is critical, especially when we are attempting to
rebalance the economy, because while we are doing it we are effectively
recalibrating the kind of skills we need. Therefore, 

<?notus-xml column=13?>we must ensure that people understand where the best opportunities are,
both for themselves and for our economy. Business and education need to
engage properly.</hs_Para>

having conversations with people from the Chartered Institute of
Personnel and Development, for example, and they make that point
forcefully, because they are aware that there is a bit of a void
between many schools and businesses. What do we have to do to improve
the situation? First, we must send a signal  that now that
schools have the responsibility for  careers guidance, which
they will have for some time notwithstanding the discussion that we
have already had today about resources, we must make sure that schools
are actually going out to engage with businesses. Governing bodies will
have a role, and head teachers have to accept that it is part of their
responsibility. It is absolutely right that Ofsted should consider how
schools deal with those challenges, and measure the performance of
schools and comment on it as part of the inspection package.</hs_Para>

business has to engage with schools as well; there must be two-way
traffic. Businesses must communicate with schools, because it is no use
their sitting on the sidelines and saying they wish that this or that
would happen; they must ensure that they influence the schools.
Academies, of course, are more autonomous, so they should be more
responsive and more open to contributions from the business world, and
certainly from local businesses.</hs_Para>

what the hon. Gentleman said, up to that point, but will he talk about
resource? I still visit many schools and they would love to do the
things that he has just been articulating, but schools are busy and
strapped for cash and resources. When I chaired the Education
Committee, the two things that we said a school needed were a person
trained to be a careers adviser—it does not come from
Buggins—and the resource to get out of the classroom to meet
businesses. Does he not agree that resources are
crucial?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000085"><B><Member ContinuationText="Neil Carmichael" PimsId="5604" UID="13051650000201" xid="1191" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000201">Neil
Carmichael:</Member></B> I will just finish my response to the point

resources, of course everybody accepts that we do not have a bottomless
pit. Having more resources would be better, but we must work within the
framework we have. Businesses should engage with schools from
self-interest, and we need to make that point more. I tried to provide
some context by pointing out that, in some cases, businesses are
concerned about where they are going to
recruit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000087">In
my constituency, I have a festival of engineering and manufacturing. I
do so for two reasons. First, one in every five jobs in my constituency
is connected with engineering and manufacturing; it is a big
proportion, which shows we have critical mass. Secondly, I am aware
that there ought to be more dialogue between medium-sized firms and
schools, so I provide a platform for that dialogue to happen. We
organise events, for 
<?notus-xml column=14?>example constructing electric cars, and various projects involving
batteries, computers and so forth. Children come into businesses and
find out what it is like to see a business, and business people go into
schools and see what the situation is there. We had the festival
last  year; it was incredibly successful and that is why we are
doing it again this
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000088">We
want to see more such initiatives; it is all very well sitting around
and saying, “This is what we need to do”, but we have to
get on and do it. My festival is a good example. It is not something
that everyone would necessarily want to copy, but people may want to
consider the messages that it sends out and the mechanisms that it
uses.</hs_Para>

absolutely right that we get businesses into schools. The motivator
could well be the destination measurements, and it is really important
that teachers learn more about the place of work. That is something
else that the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development talked
to me about, and I intend to expand that dialogue to see exactly what
else we can learn about the way
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000090">I
finish by discussing economic competitiveness, because as a country we
have to be more competitive and make more use of the European Union. I
do not want to go through the arguments that we had in the House
yesterday, but in my contribution to the economic growth debate, I made
a point about the role of the Mittelstand type of companies in Germany.
They have linkages with their local community, knowledge of and
involvement in local schools, capacity to plan ahead and an interest in
ensuring that they get the right supply of skills into their firms, as
needed, largely on the basis of knowing what their requirements are and
having the contacts to ensure that they can be fulfilled. We need to
arrive at such a situation. It requires not resources and bureaucracy
but a change of culture, in which schools and businesses start working
together to ensure that we have the right skill sets and the right
environment for pupils and students to choose careers that suit them
and contribute to the rebalancing of our economy and produce more
economic
growth.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13051650000184" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000184">2.20

have no doubt about the importance to our country of a well-functioning

the evidence sessions on the Government’s reforms to the
service, the Education Committee heard from many expert witnesses that
the service was going downhill. There seemed to be little disagreement
among them that the service has suffered since the changes took effect;
things are going in the wrong direction and youngsters are the ones
losing out. The subsequent report outlined compelling evidence that the
service has begun to, and is likely to, continue degrading.</hs_Para>

oral evidence, we found ongoing concerns about the quality,
independence, impartiality and availability of careers guidance. We
also heard numerous concerns about an emerging postcode lottery of
provision, with some schools and local authorities making a success of
the reforms and others sometimes lacking the resources, expertise and
perhaps even the will to do the same. One thing that stood out was the
observation that effective guidance services will only support the
complexity of needs if they are appropriately resourced and structured
to do so. Although the Committee raised concerns, the Government have
so far failed to address major funding issues in the careers service or
the crisis facing the provision of careers advice in
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000095">The
funding provided for the careers guidance  element of the
former Connexions service totalled some £196 million,
as the Committee Chair and other hon. Members outlined. Responsibility
for providing careers guidance was transferred to schools as part of
the Education Act 2011, but as has already been said, none of that
funding was transferred with it. In consolation, if it is any
consolation at all, the Department for Education funds the National
Careers Service, for services for young people, to the tune of a paltry
£7 million for a helpline, which we found that many young people
do not even appear to know exists. I should like to know where all the
cash has
gone.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000096">The
staff need to be in possession of the requisite skills and knowledge to
meet the needs of our young people. I remember my careers chat with Mr
Harding, the deputy head teacher of Branksome School in Darlington,
when I was 15. I thought I should like to be an engineer or maybe
something else. “Okay”, he said. “Five O-levels,
including maths and English for you”, and I was out the door.
There was no real discussion, no exploration of my skills and no help.
Perhaps if he had considered how incompetent I was with a piece of wood
or metal, he might have been able to say, “Engineering is not
for you, but you’re not so bad at English, you know. Maybe you
should think about something along those lines.” The fact that I
ended up as a journalist and politician probably speaks for
itself.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000097">Sadly,
many young people today face the same level of support that I had, and

good quality, well-resourced careers service is one of the few levers
that the Government have at their disposal to do something about youth
unemployment. In my Stockton North constituency, youth unemployment
stands at more than 1,000, and nationally it is around 1 million. If
the Education Department is serious about ensuring that young people
have a chance when they leave school, it needs to ensure that the
careers system is up to scratch. The Committee realised that, the
Labour party realises it, and campaign groups recognise it, but it
appears to have passed the Government by. As my hon. Friend the Member
for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin) said, the response to our report may be
disappointing, but we now have a new Minister who will, I hope, chuck
the earlier response in the bin and respond by taking the actions that
employers, educationalists and, most important, our young people need
him to take for their
future.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_16_PT_1/4E658E98DF7653041E627A61AB9E9CF2252F5DBE" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="16 May 2013">Thursday

have been a Member of Parliament for quite a while, and I came here
with several clear views about the careers service. First, the careers
service was patchy—Connexions had mixed success in different
parts of the country. Secondly, the careers service was clearly not
doing enough in my south London constituency to give young people the
advice, information and guidance that they needed to be able best to
maximise opportunities. Thirdly, that was probably the case across the
country,
too.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000111">After
the debates on higher education tuition fees, the Prime Minister and
Deputy Prime Minister asked me to do a bit of work in the first six
months of 2011 to consider access to further and higher education in
England. I went to Merseyside, the west and east midlands, Cornwall,
Hampshire and Kent, and I talked to people 
<?notus-xml column=18?>in London. I went to schools, colleges and universities. I spoke to
people outside the school, college and university systems, and I spoke
to parents, teachers and so on.  I presented my report in July
2011.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000112">I
think that this is the first time I have quoted myself in a debate, for
which I apologise, but I was told some very clear things. I was told
almost universally by the young people I met that the careers advice,
information and guidance that they received was not up to standard.
Across all those places—from the most remote, rural communities
to the most urban, deprived communities and the most affluent, home
counties communities—people said, “We are not getting the
careers service we need.” I was therefore fairly robust in my
recommendations to the Government. The document is available for people

recommendation would bring people together, and it makes the point that
parents and carers often also need to be educated in the world of
careers, because, as the hon. Member for Calder Valley (Craig
Whittaker) said, parents naturally come with their own prejudices and
historical recollections, and they do not always understand either that
the world has changed or that the technology and processes of getting a
job have changed, as they certainly have. It is better that people have
their parents, family, peer group, brothers and sisters on board with
them in the process, rather than leaving them behind thinking that they
cannot benefit from the
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000119">A
couple of things have since happened. In October 2012, my hon. Friend
the Member for Burnley (Gordon Birtwistle) introduced a private

report.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000120">I
will concentrate on the issue that most exercised me and colleagues in
both Houses during the passage of the Education Act 2011, on which we
had to fight like fury to get the Government to agree that schools
should have any duty to provide a face-to-face careers service to
anyone. Eventually, mainly as a result of pressure in the Lords,
concessions were made so that children on free school meals or with
special needs would be guaranteed face-to-face careers advice, but the
rest would not.</hs_Para>

Committee has clearly recommended that there should be at least one
opportunity for face-to-face careers advice. I will
pause for a second, because the Government and particularly the
Secretary of State for Education—this relates to the Department
for Education, not the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills—has resisted and held out against that recommendation,
and he is wrong. That is not
helpful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000122">First—again,
this point was made by the hon. Member for Calder Valley—careers
advice does not mean only trying to big up opportunities for further or
higher education, particularly the latter; it also means considering
alternatives such as apprenticeships or training and ensuring that
young people understand that the route through life might start by
going off into work from school and then back into training or
apprenticeships. It may later go into further or higher education
qualifications, or it may go different ways. I have family members who
have done just that. They have effectively gone from school into the
services and then into work. My younger brother then went to university
and had a very successful academic and professional career. Other
people do the same. We must ensure that schools big up destinations
other than just higher and further education qualifications.
Apprenticeships and training should be equally valid as places to
go.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000123">Secondly,
people need to think laterally these days. Someone sitting in the
county I was born in, Cheshire, or the county we moved to,
Herefordshire, or the constituency I represent in south London has a
predetermined view of things, depending on their circumstances, their
location and the local industries and occupations. It is not sufficient
to be told how to write a CV and to think that sending it, possibly by
e-mail, will mean that it will be looked at, picked up and the
writer’s brilliance will be
discovered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000124">The
important point therefore is that the process of self-presentation and
maintaining up-to-date information requires personal contact. It is not
enough to think that going onto the web or phoning someone will give
people the support, confidence, mentoring and back-up that they need. I
am not talking about children with parents who have no academic
qualifications; children with two teacher parents, for example, may
also need someone who is not their parent to help them in their route
of deciding what to
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000125">My
plea is that the Government reconsider their view that there should not
be face-to-face careers advice, information and guidance for everyone.
The Select Committee recommends that that should happen once, but as
much advice as is needed should be given. I am certain that it would
make a significant difference if there were well qualified
experts to support young people as they navigate this and sometimes to
help them as they fall back and realise—the hon. Member for
Beverley and Holderness gave such an example in his
introduction—that a career in the fire service, police service
or armed services, or whatever it might be, may not be an option
because they are not recruiting but shedding people. Sometimes, people
have to confront reality and think
again.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000126"><B><Member ContinuationText="Nic Dakin" PimsId="5672" UID="13051650000204" xid="1143" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000204">Nic

very well. From a lifetime of working with young people, I know that,
although they might be

what are very difficult questions for any of
us.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000127"><B><Member ContinuationText="Simon Hughes" PimsId="1067" UID="13051650000205" xid="296" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000205">Simon

have two final points. First, if someone wants to go into the
construction industry to be a plumber or builder, actually knowing the
best way to go from their secondary school to get the relevant
qualification, knowing which college is the best place to do an FE
course and knowing which company might give them the best learning is
not something that they will necessarily pick up accurately just
because their uncle happens to work for a building firm or their elder
brother happens to be self-employed and has his own firm. It does not
happen like that. People need to have wider
experience.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000129">This
point may be controversial, but I am clear about it. We are having a
big debate in this country on immigration. It is abundantly clear to me
that people from outside this country are often employed because they
are better qualified. When there is competition, as in Lincolnshire or
elsewhere, between a Lithuanian or Polish immigrant and someone from
Boston, for example, offering their skills, we are failing all those
young people who lose out because they are just not as competent or
qualified—they have not got to the same place as the immigrant.
If we are to show that we are providing the opportunities for our young
people to get the jobs in this country and abroad that we want them to
have, we must give them the careers advice to set them on the route to
do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000130">We
cannot complain when we discover that, at the end of the day, they lose
out because they have been unsupported. I am dealing with constituents
who are now in their 20s and 30s, and I can testify to the fact that if
people do not get the right support, it is doubly difficult for them
when they are 21, 25, 29, 32 and 35 to get into the jobs market. If
they did not have the support and encouragement to be at work when they
were 16, 17, 18 and 21, it is really difficult later, and we set back a
generation. So I ask the Minister, who is a new Minister and as far as
I know a good thing, to persuade his boss in the Department for
Education to rethink, to drop the ideology and the right-wing
philosophy and to pick up on the evidence and support careers guidance
for everyone in every single school in
England.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_16_PT_1/17B1E1412BF07327D9E6C25E9BFFDBB1C7DB4489" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="16 May 2013">Thursday

acknowledges that careers guidance for young people was in need of
reform, which is why the previous Labour Government were committed to a
review of the IAG—information, advice and
guidance—strategy in 2011, following our response to Alan
Milburn’s report. The Committee has produced a typically
thoughtful and comprehensive contribution to an important issue.
Transferring the statutory duty for careers guidance to schools is a
radical and untested departure in the history of careers guidance in
the United Kingdom, deserving of close scrutiny. Furthermore, the
report arrives at a moment of crisis. That young people in this country
are more likely than the elderly to be unemployed is a shocking
situation and the exact opposite of what is happening in, for example,
Germany. Youth unemployment in this country remains around 1 million,
so this is exactly not the time to undermine effective careers advice.
The Labour party, however, will try to approach the debate in a
bipartisan spirit. Young people are not well served by tit-for-tat
exchanges or by apportioning blame. The truth is that youth
unemployment and social mobility are deep-seated challenges. We look to
work with the Select Committee and the Government where
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000134">The

has also been recognised by a wide range of professional bodies, from
the CBI to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. It is
pleasing that the Government recognise the Committee’s findings
that good-quality, independent careers guidance is
“essential” for all young people. However, we believe
that the Government could be doing more to drive aspiration, boost our
competitiveness and stop exactly the kind of waste pointed out by the
Chair of the Select Committee, when he mentioned the young man seeking
to forge a career in the fire
brigade.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000136">We
are pleased that the Minister has belatedly persuaded his colleagues of
the importance of a technical baccalaureate, although it remains
disappointing that, unlike Labour policy, which it attempts to imitate,
it does not include a commitment to a proper work experience placement
or a course structure developed by business. One of the strongest
criticisms made by the Committee report is the removal of a statutory
duty to provide careers education and work-related learning. In the
public consultation on the Wolf report, nearly 89% of respondents did
not believe that the statutory duty should be removed. With employers
routinely complaining —as the hon. Member for Calder
Valley (Craig Whittaker) explained—about the lack of workplace
knowledge and poor employability of young people, the Government must
consider whether scrapping work experience is a good idea. It would not
be so bad if different routes to employability, vocational education
and apprenticeships were well advertised by the careers services under
the new regime, but, as both Government and Opposition Members have
explained, that is simply not the
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000137">I
strongly urge the Government, therefore, to respond with greater
clarity than they did to the Select Committee report on how they will
ensure that young people are made aware of the full range of post-16
options available in their local area, as my hon. Friends have
discussed, including apprenticeships. Pupils need an independent 
<?notus-xml column=22?>and impartial system of advice. The problem is an element of
over-concentration by the Government on the 16.4% of state school
pupils who achieved EBacc results. We all want as much academic
achievement as possible in our schools; we all want that excellence and
rigour, but we also need to be aware of different learning and career
pathways. That is the difficult situation that the Minister faces. His
colleagues do not seem to share his concern for rigorous vocational
training.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000138">Unfortunately,
the sloppy approach to evidence appears to have seeped into the reforms
as well. The international evidence for the statutory transfer of the
careers service to schools is, at best, thin on the ground. The Select
Committee is clear about that, and it cites the OECD, which has
highlighted the limitations of the school-based
model—“lack of impartiality, inconsistency” and,
perhaps most damaging, “weak links” with the labour
market—also emphasised by hon. Members. Labour is not dogmatic
on the location of the statutory duty. Quality of delivery is what
counts, not who holds the responsibility. We agree with the
Committee’s findings that further upheaval and uncertainty,

the current fiscal climate, we also agree with the Committee that
additional direct funding to schools is unlikely. Schools need to make
careers guidance a priority within their budgets. The Chair of the
Select Committee’s figures about five in six not providing the
same level of allocation are terrifying. As the deputy Chair of the
Select Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for North West Durham (Pat
Glass), pointed out in her speech, that does not mean that the
Government should present the withdrawal of £200 million of
funding as consequence free. In his evidence, the Minister suggested
that the Government have protected school spending, but schools are
having to invest about £25,000 each for something that was
previously allocated funding, and we can see from the report that
levels of provision have simply fallen off a
cliff.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051650000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051650000140">All
that comes at a difficult time. Teaching morale is at an all-time low
and, for better or worse, the change comes when our education system
faces enormous structural upheaval and fragmentation. The Government
are asking schools to take on a commissioning role, but if we have
learnt nothing else over the past 30 years of public policy, it is that
commissioning services is not easy and requires a complex set of skills
and capabilities. Extraordinary demands are being placed on our
schools, and the simple question that the Minister must answer is
whether his Government are doing enough to provide guidance and support
and to disseminate best practice. The Committee report seems clear that
the answer is no. In the words of Professor Tony Watts of Careers
England, it

performance. Like the Chair of the Committee, what most concerns me
about the report is the accountability dimension. The report merely

unemployment is falling and this week, thankfully, the figures showed a

skills shortage. To fill that skills shortage, we must make sure that
the young people of this country have not only the training and
qualifications, but the skills to get a job and hold it down. That is
the motivation behind the massive increase in apprenticeships and the
introduction of traineeships, which will start in the summer. There is

do to provide information, advice, guidance and, much more broadly,
motivation and inspiration. Times have changed since the Connexions
service was opened up. Information is widely available, but it is
obvious that information on the web is not enough; it is about the
individual connection between human beings, with young people being
inspired, usually by a practitioner who is doing something with their
life. Young people look at them and say, “That’s the sort

issue has been raised many times. Times are, of course, tight for
funding, but the central point is that the legal duty to secure
independent and impartial advice in schools needs to be delivered from
the school budget. Schools have a whole budget to deliver this, not
just the £7 million that the Department for Education put into
the National Careers Service. Frankly, we must be much more ambitious
and look forward not back. I have taken up the mantle that was laid
down. We understand what happened. There has been a big change and the

market information through local enterprise partnerships, city deals

clear about the role of LEPS in providing labour market information.

different languages, must be based on stronger relationships, and it is

propel themselves through their careers because they are inspired to
succeed. Let us take the discussion forward and be ambitious in our

is crucial to the economy. It has been estimated that the engineering
work force produces a fifth of our GDP and half of UK exports. In 2010,
the sector generated 25% of UK turnover—that is three times the

engineering’s importance, the UK is facing a shortfall in the
numbers and quality of engineers. About 820,000 science, engineering

and we will need around 82,000 engineers and technicians just to deal
with the requirements up to 2016. That demand will not just be met by
university graduates; we only produce 23,000 engineering graduates a
year, and not all of them stay in engineering. The loss is a particular
concern when it comes to women. Only 12% of engineering students in

14-to-19 education. In my view, another part of the work that is needed
is for us to work on developing continual professional development in
schools, including, very importantly, among primary schools, because
the seeds are sown at a much younger age. My simple answer is that the
issue was outside of the scope of our report, but he raises a very
important point that ties back into the earlier debate, a large part of
which I was privileged to sit in on.</hs_Para>

to find out why there is such a mismatch between the demand and supply
of engineers, and how subject choices were made, which is obviously
part of it. Let us start with the English baccalaureate. The EBacc
performance measure was introduced in 2011, but retrospectively applied
to 2010 figures. It recognised where students have achieved a GCSE
grade C or above in English, maths, sciences, history, geography and
languages. Looking at the impact of the EBacc on engineering education,
we heard mixed views. Some welcomed the EBacc’s focus on maths
and sciences, which are important precursors for engineering. Some
evidences shows that the EBacc has correlated with a greater uptake of
science GCSEs. Some 93% of GCSE students are due to take a double or
triple science GCSE in summer 2014, which is the highest proportion for
two decades.</hs_Para>

EBacc has a downside for engineering, too. Maths and science GCSEs are
not the only route into engineering. Important subjects such as design
and technology are not included in the EBacc, and I know 
<?notus-xml column=28?>that a lot of companies agree with me on that point. About a quarter of
the students accepted on to engineering degree courses in the UK have
an A-level in design and technology. Worryingly, a qualification

Metcalfe</B> (South Basildon and East Thurrock) (Con):</Member> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr Walker,
and to speak in this important and timely debate.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13051655000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000002">Why is a
debate on educating tomorrow’s engineers important, and worthy
of a report by the Select Committee on Science and Technology? There is
no doubt that the country faces huge challenges. None is greater than
the economic challenge; and our future is by no means certain, so we
need to carve out a new future for our nation—one that is not
based just on financial and other service-based industries, which
perhaps we have come to rely on too much. They are valuable industries,
but we need to rebalance our economy.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13051655000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000003">We need also
to recognise that we will not return to the heavy metal-bashing
industries of the past and that we need to play to our strengths;
perhaps we had  
<?notus-xml column=32?>forgotten what they were. For too long, we abandoned—or at the
very least undervalued—our skilled industrial and engineering
heritage, in favour of other sectors. The time has come for that to
change, and I hope that the report will instigate and support that
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000004">What
lies behind the Government’s reforms in education must be widely
and generally welcomed. There is a deep-seated belief that we need to
give young people the best possible opportunities and skills to enable
them to get access to the jobs that will exist in future. Some of the
reforms that we considered will achieve that. We may collectively have
underestimated the value of engineering, but let us not undersell
ourselves.</hs_Para>

Committee Chairman, the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston
(Andrew Miller), said, engineering and manufacturing are still hugely
important to the country. They are also important to me personally in
my constituency. The UK is home to more than 500,000 engineering
companies, employing, as we heard, 5.4 million people, of whom 2.3
million would consider themselves to be skilled engineers. That
accounts for 8% of the work force. As we heard, it accounts for one
fifth of GDP and half of all our exports, and turns over £1.15
trillion. We should not underestimate the importance of the sector, but
we sometimes do, and we therefore seem to have created an ever-widening
skills gap, which has consequences for the economy and for the
rebalancing of our national
wealth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Mosley" PimsId="5727" UID="13051655000052" xid="1045" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000052">Stephen
Mosley:</Member></B> I am the co-chairman of the parliamentary ICT
forum, and one of the things that companies always tell us is that the
No. 1 thing they look for when considering investing in any country is
not tax or any such factor but whether the skills that they need are
available where they are thinking of locating a factory or development
lab. The report ties into that.</hs_Para>

Metcalfe:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right. Skills are a major
factor when people are deciding where to invest. Something that I found
surprising, or perhaps even shocking, was that when the CBI conducted a
survey of companies, it found that 42%, across all sectors, reported a
skills gap when recruiting. That skills gap is as true in my local
context as it is nationally.</hs_Para>

Basildon and East Thurrock has a long and rich industrial heritage, and
I shall, if I may, blow my constituency’s trumpet for a moment.
For example, one in 10 of the world’s large tractors are built
in Basildon, at Case New Holland, generating £7 billion of
exports. The personal IED-blockers that our servicemen wear in
Afghanistan are built, designed and programmed in Basildon by Selex.
Gardner Aerospace is a medium-sized engineering firm, employing more
than 200 staff in my constituency. It is a tier 1 supplier to
Airbus—there is not an Airbus A380 that flies without a part
made in Basildon—and it competes with firms in cheaper-cost-base
countries such as India and China, and why is it able to compete?
Because of its quality and because it delivers on
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Tristram Hunt" PimsId="5588" UID="13051655000054" xid="1198" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000054">Tristram

Metcalfe:</Member></B> That is probably a debate for another day. There
is no doubt, when we export 50% of our goods to Europe, that it is an
important customer of ours, and I would not want to do anything to
undermine that, but what does undermine that company’s ability
to prosper and grow is the lack of skilled engineers in the wider work
force. When I recently visited the company, I was told that although it
is managing to recruit apprentices to train up to support its current
work base, if it were to be offered a new large contract, it could not
go out into the economy and recruit enough engineers to expand, even
though we can compete with low-cost-base countries. That demonstrates
why it is so important that we bridge that skills
gap.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000011">While
I am blowing my own constituency’s trumpet, let me say that it
is also home to Ford’s research and development facility at
Dunton. The facility employs some 4,000 designers, engineers and
technicians. For these companies to prosper, we need to bridge that
skills gap, so what can be
done?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000012">First,
we need to change our attitudes towards engineering as a career. We all
need to work harder at promoting engineering as the rewarding,
well-compensated profession that it is. It is a profession that shapes
the world that we live in, and too many people do not understand that.
Certainly, too many young people do not understand it. They are not
aware of the role of engineering—how it shapes the world that
they touch and experience every day. Even when they understand that and
have a positive attitude towards it, that does not necessarily
translate into wider participation, so we must have a change. We must
find a way to engage with young people and show them that they have a
role to play in engineering. That starts in schools, but there are
concerns, as we have heard, that some of the changes that have been
made to our education system will not necessarily support
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000013">There
are concerns that the curriculum changes will do little to inspire
people to take up STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and
maths. There is concern that with design and technology no longer being
compulsory, people will not be able to take their enthusiasm for that
subject further. I look forward to being corrected if that is not the
case. One of the issues that I would like my hon. Friend the Minister
to address particularly is whether the EBacc is likely to encourage
schools to concentrate on the five core subjects, rather than offering
a broader education that might include exposure to engineering. Concern
is also expressed that the new TechBacc does not receive the same
recognition as the EBacc. Again, if that could be addressed, I would be
most
grateful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000014">There
are concerns, as we heard from the Chairman of the Select Committee,
that the changes to and perceived downgrading of the engineering
diploma could send the wrong message. I am sure that that is not the
Government’s aim. As I said at the beginning of my speech, I
believe that the Government’s changes to education are designed
to give people all the skills that they need to make the most of the
potential that they
have.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000015">There
are plenty of positives, and I will try to touch on them, although I do
not want to detain hon. Members too long. One of the things that I
welcome most is the university technical colleges—I would
certainly welcome one in my constituency. They are a fantastic way of 
<?notus-xml column=34?>giving young people skills and inspiring them into potentially
interesting and well-rewarded careers. My only concern about the
university technical college programme is that not enough people will
have access to it. I think that they are fantastic and would support
them wholeheartedly. I would love to see an engineering and logistics
university technical college in
Basildon.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000016">I
am very pleased that, through an initiative funded by the Department
for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Government are creating a
network of more than 25,000 STEM professionals and academics who can go
into schools to support STEM education and promote STEM careers. I
understand that the Government are also part-funding STEM clubs. The
hope is that 80% of secondary schools will have one of those clubs by
2015. I have seen how some of the clubs work in my own constituency
when they are supported by industry as well. They are fantastic; they
really do get people
excited.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000017">Both
the private sector and the voluntary sector have a role to play, as I
have seen locally. The power generation company npower runs programmes
that involve people going out into schools and showing young people the
practical application of engineering. Network Rail produces support
material. JCB, as we have heard, sponsors a UTC. Businesses such as
Ford and Selex in my constituency support the engineering and STEM
clubs. There are initiatives such as “We Made It!” and
Primary Engineer, which is fantastic, because we cannot start
encouraging people to be interested in engineering young enough.
Primary Engineer is a project that works with key stage 1 and key stage
2 pupils, getting them to design vehicles that they can then test in a
competition. It allows them to look at the engineering solution to
certain problems. It is fantastic to see in
practice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000018"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andrew Miller" PimsId="1909" UID="13051655000056" xid="428" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000056">Andrew
Miller:</Member></B> I add to the hon. Gentleman’s list the
Rolls-Royce awards. This year’s winner is a primary school from
Belfast. It is an inspiring project that the youngsters and teachers
have been engaged in, but the key there was the partnership between the
company and the school to bring the technical expertise that was
outside the school into the
classroom.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000019"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Metcalfe" PimsId="5711" UID="13051655000057" xid="1179" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000057">Stephen
Metcalfe:</Member></B> Absolutely, and that leads me to my next point
beautifully. All those things are brilliant, and to see them in action
is fantastic. My concern is that what is happening is not systematic
enough. We are not getting it into every school, and not every pupil or
student has access to it. One of the recommendations in the Select
Committee report—I was delighted that the Government accepted it
without amendment—was that all the learned societies,
professional engineering institutions and trade bodies should oblige
their members to go into schools, in a systematic way, to promote
engineering and technology. Even if it was just for one day a year, if
each of those engineers could go into schools across the whole school
body, it could have a significant
impact.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000020">As
a result of some of the initiatives, we are beginning to see an
improvement in the uptake of engineering and particularly in the number
of engineering apprentices and apprenticeships in our economy. Today,
just before I came here, I had some very good news. DP World, which is
constructing the London Gateway container port down at Shell Haven in
my constituency, will on Monday announce the creation of six new
engineering apprenticeships to support the engineering activity that 
<?notus-xml column=35?>takes place on that site. To see £1.5 billion
invested in south Essex is great, but the
engineering feat—the reclamation of the land and then the
handling of millions of containers—is a fantastic sight and
something that will, we hope, excite those six potential
engineers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000021">In
conclusion, there are some fantastic organisations and companies
throughout our country doing some great things to inspire the next
generation of engineers, but we must do more. We face a lack of skills
and a shortage of aspiration to give people those skills, but those
problems are not insurmountable. My right hon. Friend the Prime
Minister said

progress is being made and the general thrust of what the Government
are trying to achieve is welcome, we must do all that we can to ensure
that engineers can continue to take our society forward and continue to
forge a future that will meet our increasingly complex needs. I hope
that the Government will revisit our report, take it in the spirit in
which it is meant and use it to achieve our shared and combined goal of
creating a broader uptake of engineering across our whole
society.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000023"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Charles Walker (in the Chair)" InTheChair="True" PimsId="4830" UID="13051655000058" xid="814" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000058">Mr

Neston (Andrew Miller), the Chair of the Committee, on the excellent
way he introduced his report and on his earlier speech, and my hon.
Friend the Member for South Basildon and East Thurrock (Stephen

am most grateful to the Chair of the Committee for what he said about
my speech last week in the Queen’s Speech debate. I echo what he
said about the welcome response from the Leader of the Opposition,
declaring cross-party support for efforts to encourage the status of
engineering in our society and, in particular, women’s role in
engineering. My speech last week had one great problem; it was
overshadowed by the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson. I have bad news
for the Chair of the Committee today; this debate will also not get the
attention it deserves, because it is being overshadowed by the
announcement today of David Beckham’s retirement from football.
My serious point is, would it not be great if the retirement of a major
engineering figure attracted even a fraction of the attention that the
retirement of a major footballer does? As my hon. Friend the Member for
South Basildon and East Thurrock said, it is engineers who change the
world. Footballers entertain us marvellously and they are great
people—probably overpaid, but great none the less—but
engineers make the world a better place to live in. Their role is
important to society. I have just come back from Jordan, where I talked
to Jordanian 
<?notus-xml column=36?>parliamentarians about democracy. Most of the Jordanian Members of
Parliament I met, rejoiced in the title “engineer” before
their name. If only we could honour engineering as they do in other
societies around the world, it would be better for all of
us.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000026">I

my chairmanship of the Select Committee on Business, Innovation and

to TRaC Global, a test and evaluation company, and opened its Dorset
facility. I was told, “Minister, we’ve given up looking
for engineers from British universities. It is not worth our while,
because they aren’t there. We’re recruiting from Spain
and Portugal.” That was my moment of revelation. It is all right
for a major British engineering company in the civil sector to recruit
overseas—it is a massive wasted opportunity for British young
people that they are not being employed to work in those engineering
companies and the jobs are going to foreigners instead—but we
cannot do that in the defence sector, because we need UK eyes only on
high security matters. As I said in my speech last week, when I

success of engineering companies can be a problem for Members of
Parliament. In my part of the world, Jaguar Land Rover is
flourishing—sucking up all the design engineers it can find, not
only in the west midlands, but further afield. The result is that many
engineering companies in my constituency find it more and more
difficult to recruit engineers due to the desperate shortage of
engineering skills. The shortage is made infinitely worse by the
demographic of the engineering profession. Many people will retire in
the next 10 years, so we will have to recruit a phenomenal number just

that key stage 2 and, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Basildon

21% or 22%; here, the estimates differ, but 10% to 12% is a good
guess—half the French rate. The French are
worried that their rate is too low, and yet we have
the lowest rate in the European Union. We are 27th out of 27 and will
be 28th out of 28 when Croatia joins. It is a scandal in its own terms,
but it is also a missed opportunity for engineering. Modern engineering
and its problem-solving nature lends itself more and more to the skills
sets that females bring to the profession. We desperately need women to
be engaged in engineering, and it is a great shame that we have not yet

important thing that the Committee’s report refers
to—although perhaps not quite enough—is how to engage
business in schools. There is a lot about taking teachers out and
helping them to understand business, but how do we help businesses to
engage more in schools? What upsets me so much is we are living in a
society with a real, acute youth unemployment problem—not only
in this country, but around the world—and employers are crying
out for skill sets that are not available in the labour force. It
cannot be beyond the wit of man to marry up those problems; if we
produce more engineers, we address the problem of youth unemployment,
at least in part, and solve the problems facing our economy and
security.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051655000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0001.htm#13051655000033">Things

it is nowhere near enough. A problem in the debate is that education
gets boring so quickly. It becomes ridden with cliché and
jargon, complex constructs and complex bureaucracies, but there is one
thing at the bottom of it: we must inspire more young people,
particularly girls, to want to be engineers—that is the essence
of it. The Government understand that, as does the Minister and the
Under-Secretary of State for Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for West

do not think “complacency” can be used to describe the
Government’s response; I caution against that. The issue is
pressing and urgent and must fundamentally be addressed. The Government
are right to say that the figures are improving, but the figures are
not better enough and they are not improving fast enough. They are not
as high as they were in the 1980s, for heaven’s sake! The
scandal of girls’ participation is a real problem. The Institute
of Physics produced a marvellous report, “It’s Different
for Girls”, on participation rates for women in engineering, and
physics in particular. One statistic in the report horrifies me more
than any other: 49% of maintained co-educational schools sent no girls
on to take A-level physics in 2011. In half of all maintained
co-educational schools, no girls do A-level physics as a result of
their education up to A-level. We simply must change that. Physics is,
I think, the fourth most popular choice for boy, but the 14th for
girls. The figures are well down and there is no reason for that
whatsoever.</hs_Para>

stage 2, because many of the role modals available, for girls in
particular, in primary schools are female arts graduates. That is not a
criticism of them at all, but they do not understand engineering, nor
should they be expected to. The key is to get businesses into schools.
We cannot expect teachers to correct every problem in our

businesses into schools. That is why I particularly welcome what the

the curriculum has been so dramatically improved as a result of her
interventions, for which I am grateful. As I said to her when we met to
discuss it a couple of weeks ago, the curriculum now provides an

as a focus to inspire the institutions, major companies and trade
associations to bring the initiatives together in a single place,
probably under EngineeringUK’s “Tomorrow’s

Committee recommendation, to which the Government responded in
paragraph 52, on the role of institutions. To become chartered

only 14 years old. The UK has the lowest number of women scientists and
engineers of all EU countries, fewer than 9% of girls opt for physics
at GCSE level and 25% of schoolgirls think that science careers are
most suited to boys. I remember hearing powerful evidence from the

I am happy, indeed delighted, to pay tribute to the Minister’s
excellent work on promoting mathematics in schools and encouraging
greater female take-up of mathematics, sadly, the Government have not
fulfilled the other side of the equation. Instead, they have devalued
apprenticeships, undermined careers guidance by abandoning the
statutory duty to provide work experience and downgraded a successful
qualification in the engineering diploma. From the Committee’s

Chair of the Select Committee, I also look forward to seeing those
responses, because the evidence is unequivocal. National Grid suggests
that downgrading the diploma will make it a less attractive option to

light of that damning verdict from the sector’s leading
employers’ federation, will the Minister enlighten us as to how
exactly she considered carefully the engineering sector’s views
on the process of the downgrade? The Opposition agree with the
EEF’s verdict and support the Committee’s position that
the downgrading of the diploma represents a poor message about how much
the Government value engineering education. It is all very well for the
Government to suggest that they are now consulting on a replacement,
but it is difficult to find fault with the Committee’s simple
argument that any new plans could have been developed before the
decision to downgrade. Indeed, that is arguably representative of
elements of the Government’s education agenda.</hs_Para>

experience, when done well, can provide a really good opportunity to
get an insight into either a sector of our economy or the world of
work. Too often, however, work experience for 14 to 16-year-olds is not
rewarding at all and can put people off work. Schools often scratch
around trying to find enough employers to provide what is, basically, a
sitting service for two weeks at the end of year 10 and the start of
year 11. It has to be valued and it has to be good, and sometimes that
is not possible at 14 to 16. That is why I think that the emphasis on

experience serves no purpose. The onus is clearly on the responsibility
to deliver an effective work placement. Once careers guidance is
downgraded—as we have discussed—our worry is whether the
capacity to offer rewarding work experience and work placements will be
there in schools. We will see how this rolls itself out, but with
careers, work experience and work placements there is a genuine concern

new accountability proposals are a small step in the direction of
correcting the narrow focus of the EBacc as the sole performance
measure. The Opposition also welcome the progress made on university
technical colleges, which play a small but vital role in delivering
engineering excellence. We have heard about the work of Sir Anthony

We know that people with degrees in subjects such as maths and
engineering are some of the most highly paid and sought after, and we
need to get that message through from a very early age. As the world
develops, there is an increasing return to skills. The correlation
between our PISA—programme for international student
assessment—results and economic growth has doubled over the past
30 years. There has been a 30% growth in managerial, technical and

remit of the report is 14-19 education, but the building blocks at
primary school are so critical that we cannot not mention them.
Importantly, we are reviewing our primary mathematics curriculum, so
that it focuses much more on core arithmetic skills. It will ensure
that children have their times tables, which are the basis of things
such as ratio and proportion that are so important in solving
multi-step problems in subjects such as engineering. We are also
developing a new computing curriculum that will start in primary
school. Children will learn not just to use IT programmes, but to
programme things such as Scratch and Raspberry Pi from an early age.
That will open their eyes, at an early age, to the opportunities that
engineering
brings.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051658000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0002.htm#13051658000006">I
mentioned the broadening of the design and technology curriculum. We
want primary schools to open children’s eyes to industries and
things available for them to do in the local area, which is important
for getting girls involved. There has been a lot of media commentary
recently about the segregation of girls’ and boys’ toys,
such as chemistry sets. As parents, we have to stand up and be counted
on such issues. I have two daughters. If we allow the mindset to
develop at that age that particular things, such as chemistry and

engineering and other sectors to ensure that it is broad and high

often in education, and not just in science and technology subjects,
the application for later in life is lost. Perhaps we might broaden
that idea to ensure that there is always some practical example why
children, from a very early age, are learning something. When I go into

reason why we have had such a low uptake in maths from 16 to 18, which

nothing: children do the full A-level or nothing. We are creating a
number of core maths qualifications, such as maths in education and
industry, and we are working with Professor Tim Gowers of Cambridge

was asked whether the technical baccalaureate is equivalent to the
EBacc. No, it is not, because it is a 16-to-18 qualification, while the
EBacc is a 14-to-16 qualification. The technical baccalaureate is a
high-level vocational qualification that is aspirational—it
includes level 3 maths—and it is also an applied qualification.
It will be recorded in league tables alongside A-level, rather than at
the 14-to-16 level. That is in line with Alison Wolf’s report on
vocational education, which recommended that young people follow a
general education curriculum until the end of key stage 4, with
vocational specialist options postponed until after that stage, and
explains why we have the EBacc, which is a core qualification and
represents only 60% or 70% of the curriculum, so there is still space
for students to study additional subjects. That is the expectation to
16, and the technical baccalaureate, the academic alternative or an

example through an extended project qualification. The core is there,
following the best traditions of countries such as Germany, which has
upgraded its qualifications so that all students do a strong academic
core until they are 16. That is the intention behind the new progress 8
accountability measure, which includes English, maths, three EBacc
subjects and three additional subjects, so providing a common academic
core for all students, plus three additional
subjects.</hs_Para>

down that brick wall, because we will have students doing core maths
plus physics and chemistry, as well as core maths plus history and
geography or core maths plus an applied occupational qualification. The
key is that those qualifications are valued by employers or by
universities as leading to progress, which is what we should be looking
at. I am pointing out that the fact that part of it is the same maths
qualification shows that there is a shared core between the A-level
side, to put it that way, and the occupational
side.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051658000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0002.htm#13051658000021">I

philosophy that followed the Wolf review—having a common core
until 16, and reviewing the league tables in that light. It is wrong to
see the change in the GCSE equivalents of the engineering diploma as
downgrading the qualification. We have approved level 2 principal
learning in engineering for inclusion in the 2015 key stage 4
performance tables. In addition, three new engineering qualifications
for 14 to 16-year-olds, which are being developed by the Royal Academy

important that we have a consistent message in our 14-to-16 and
16-to-18 programmes about the status of qualifications in our league
table. The progress 8 accountability measure really shows the
Government’s intention, which is that students of those ages
should be studying core subjects such as sciences, which are vital for
engineering. In particular, we need more students studying physics to
do engineering, but there is space reserved in the accountability
measure for subjects such as design and technology and art.</hs_Para>

opportunity for young people to enter the engineering profession. In
the 2011 Budget, the Government made a commitment to deliver at least
24 UTCs by 2014, and we are set to exceed that commitment:
five UTCs are already open and 40 are in the pre-opening phase, of
which 12 are due to open in September 2013, and a further 28 in 2014
and 2015. Those UTCs will together allow around 27,500 students to

transformative.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051658000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0002.htm#13051658000024">When
good schools open in a local area, it has a ripple effect on other
institutions. For example, the maths free schools, which will be run by
universities, will specialise in maths, further maths and sciences for
students looking to go to university to study those subjects. Those
schools were announced in the 2011 autumn statement and are based on a
model from schools already operating in Russia and China. Two have
already been approved and are due to open in 2014 at King’s
college London, and Exeter. We are in discussion with other
universities about the development of more of these maths schools. As
they will have university-style

issue in the whole debate is that we need to increase teacher supply in
the critical subjects. Maths has the greatest teacher shortage, but
physics also has quite a large shortage. The Government are offering
bursaries in those subjects. Improving the professional development of
teachers in those subjects so that they are inspiring is important in
encouraging the next generation. Who do children listen most to? They
listen to their parents and their peers, but they also listen to their
teachers, and a teacher can make a real difference. Having exemplar
schools, whether they are UTCs or maths free schools, will help to
improve the quality of
provision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051658000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/halltext/130516h0002.htm#13051658000026">Finally,
I want to look at the role of industry in promoting STEM education and
engineering. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Worcestershire
pointed out, there are keen institutions that want to get involved in
helping schools. However, it does not always happen at local level, and
sometimes the coverage can be patchy. As we have cross-party consensus
on the issue, I am keen that we work together to promote subjects such
as engineering, physics and mathematics and their value to the country
and to the individual. Too often, when we wake up in the morning and

on precisely that issue. We need role models and we need to be able to
communicate clearly about the key messages. The social value of
engineering is very important. Countries such as Malaysia and India
have been successful in recruiting female engineers. We should look not
just at Europe but across the world to understand why engineering is
seen as an aspirational career. It is clear that we need a concerted
campaign and a concerted effort to address the whole issue. Despite the
fact that we all know there is a desperate shortage of engineers, I am
concerned that the message has not gone through to schools, and

“We do not believe”. It is not belief I want but facts.

which significantly move forward our work on the HS2 route between
London and the west midlands (known as phase 1 of HS2). These are the
draft environmental statement and the design refinements
consultations.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13051647000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/wmstext/130516m0001.htm#13051647000185">Publication
of the draft environmental statement (ES) is a key step towards
delivering the hybrid Bill for the HS2 route between London and the
west midlands. The formal ES will be published alongside the hybrid
Bill later this year, having been further refined in light of responses
to the draft ES
consultation.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13051647000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/wmstext/130516m0001.htm#13051647000186">The
draft ES provides, wherever available, information on the likely
significant environmental effects of HS2—and our plans wherever
possible to mitigate
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13051647000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/wmstext/130516m0001.htm#13051647000187">The
Government believe that HS2 is vital for this country and will provide
a huge economic return. However, I am aware that the building of the
railway will cause disruption for those living close to the line of
route. I am determined that this disruption should be kept to a minimum
and mitigated wherever
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13051647000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/wmstext/130516m0001.htm#13051647000188">Consulting
on the draft ES is not a statutory requirement but the Government
recognise the importance of ensuring widespread engagement on the
scheme. Best design can only be reached with the input of local
communities, environmental groups and all levels of
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13051647000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/wmstext/130516m0001.htm#13051647000189">Once
the hybrid Bill is deposited, there will be a further period of
consultation on the formal environmental statement as part of the
parliamentary
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13051647000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/wmstext/130516m0001.htm#13051647000190">Alongside
the draft ES, I have published a consultation on a series of design
refinements for the HS2 route between London and the west midlands.
Since we set out our proposed route in January 2012 we have been
developing the detailed design of the scheme, listening to the
representations from individuals and organisations affected by the
route. This refinement process aims to ensure that we design a railway
that is as efficient and effective as possible while limiting as far as
practicable its impacts on people and the
environment.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13051647000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/wmstext/130516m0001.htm#13051647000191">Many
of these proposed refinements are small in scale but some are more
significant, altering the local impact of the scheme. To ensure my
final decisions on these refinements are informed by the best possible
information I have decided to consult on my initial preferences for the
more significant changes before deciding whether to include them in the
final design of the
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13051647000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/wmstext/130516m0001.htm#13051647000192">Consultation
on both the draft environmental statement and the design refinements
closes on 11 July. Consulting on these two documents is part of the
process of helping to make HS2 the best it can be, providing passengers
with the high level of service they expect while minimising as far as
practicable the impact on local
communities.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Writtens" ColStart="331"><?date 2013-05-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_16_PT_1/7128977E18D01EDF9354920633F3030146AF9232" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 May 2013">Thursday

The comparison with census estimates led to revisions to the rolled

component, focussed on the middle part of the decade before

public service broadcasting and the welsh language and the desire for
it to be on a stable financial footing. We welcome the agreement with
the BBC which took effect from April 2013, meaning that the BBC became
S4C's majority funder and has already committed to funding S4C until
the end of the current charter and licence fee period in 2016-17. The

of homelessness. However, Jobcentre Plus advisers are equipped with the
necessary guidance and training to identify and provide an appropriate
level of tailored support for the homeless, as well as other
disadvantaged groups. As a priority group, the homeless are able to
access additional support through Jobcentre Plus advisers to enter
employment, including early access to the Work programme. The guidance
which supports Jobcentre Plus advisers is subject to regular review to
ensure its effectiveness for helping to tackle homelessness and the
barriers it creates to

outdated, it is not feasible to upgrade the existing service. Digital

TeS and developing a business case to demonstrate the financial
viability of new replacement services. The new services would be based

in the Health Protection Report in August 2012, found abnormal prion

blood-borne routes of infection, such that blood taken from donors with

infection. However, risk assessments, prepared for the independent
scientific Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP), are based
on the presumption that this could occur. In February 2013, ACDP agreed
and published an updated variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and
blood components risk assessment, which takes into account the recent
prevalence study data. A copy of this document has been placed in the

Soubry:</Member></B> The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in the United
Kingdom over time is assessed through systematic analysis of
notification data obtained from the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance
System, run by Public Health England. In 2011 in the UK, a total of
8,963 cases of TB were reported, a rate of 14.4 cases per 100,000
population. This information is contained in Tuberculosis case reports
and rates, UK, 2000-11 which has been placed in the Library. TB
notifications and rates increased from 2000 until 2005, and have
remained high but relatively stable

badgers where they have been identified as contributing to an outbreak

There are a number of differences between the situation here and in the

population density and ecology (population density is lower and badgers
appear to move over larger distances in the Republic of

commitments from the World Bank for them to use existing resources and

agriculture or health which are also designed to have a nutritional
impact. The Bank has huge investments in agriculture and social
protection which have significant

use this portfolio of programmes to deliver nutrition

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and Department for

Afghan Government implements its national and international human

Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
Implementation of the Afghan Elimination of Violence Against Women Law

international community. We, along with our international partners,
will hold the Afghan Government to account for the commitments they

to protect and uphold women's rights such as the development of the
Afghan National Police's policy on promoting human rights

our support to EUPOL, the European Police Mission to Afghanistan, the

defend the rights and fundamental freedoms of others. This year the UK
has provided £500,000 in funding to the Afghan Independent Human

The British embassy in Kabul monitors threats of violence towards human

in consultation with the British high commission in Suva, the local EU

encouraged the local EU delegation to raise these issues with the

promote.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051674000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/corrtext/130516c0001.htm#13051674000017"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Deputy Prime Minister" PimsId="2631" UID="13051674000022" xid="885" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130516/corrtext/130516c0001.htm#13051674000022">The
Deputy Prime Minister:</Member></B> I fully stand behind the position
that I took then and my party has taken ever since, that when there is
a change in the rules and new things are asked of the United Kingdom
within the European Union, there should and there will be a referendum.
Not only that, we have done better since we issued that leaflet in
2008: we legislated to guarantee that to the British people for the
first time in primary legislation just two years ago. We spent <B>100
hours</B> debating that in this House at the time. If my hon. Friend
wants to reinvent it all over again and keep picking away at the issue,
what will he give up from a fairly crowded Queen’s Speech? Will
he tell his constituents that we will not put a cap on social care
costs; we will not deliver a single tier pension; we will not pass
legislation to have a national insurance contribution cut for
employers? I think that we should stick to the priorities of the
British people, which are growth and
jobs.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2013-05-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_16_PT_1/Index/6C52685C0C021127ED80C07ED2F084D749AFB938" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="23" cday="Thursday" cmonth="May" cyear="2013" date="16" day="Thursday" issue="7" maxparts="1" month="May" part="1" price="5@010c00" printing="daily" session="201314" type="back" volume="563" year="2013"><title col="771">Oral
