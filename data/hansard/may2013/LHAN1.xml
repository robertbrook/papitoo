Mackay of Ardbrecknish what would happen after the State Opening. His
answer was that some old codger on the Government side would be asked
to propose an humble Address. Your Lordships may understand, therefore,
that proud and privileged though I am to undertake this role, it brings
with it a certain poignancy, as in the crossing of a threshold, as I
come to realise that I am now a fully fledged member of SOCs, the
society of old codgers. To my fellow members around the House I say

support of Her Majesty at all times earns our enduring admiration and
respect. We were also honoured today by the most welcome presence of
their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.
His Royal Highness works tirelessly in support of countless good

another more modest but much cherished reign has ended with the
retirement from the Front Bench of our former Leader of the House, my
noble friend Lord Strathclyde. His well-rounded style, if I may call it

of judgment, and a grasp of the business of politics that has brought
benefit to us all over his 25 years of public service. We shall miss
his bounteous hospitality.</hs_para>

politics of any coalition are never easy, and parties can become
frustrated. There are a few loose slates on the roof. However, I recall
clearly how, after the general election, our two parties, acting in the
national interest, each put aside its own agenda and combined in order
to bring stability to the nation’s government after a near
calamitous collapse of our economy. Looking back on that crisis, which
was years in the making and will take years to surmount, put me in mind
of the George Best school of economics. When the famous footballer was
asked, towards the end of his life, how he had managed to lose his
fortune, he replied that he had spent most of it on wine, women and
song and the rest he had just
wasted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050834000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130508-0001.htm#13050834000052">Putting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T15:42:55"></hs_TimeCode>
the nation first was not mere rhetoric. We needed discipline and a new
direction to avoid the abyss. To have reduced the
deficit—although not yet the national debt—by one-third,
and to have seen more than 1.25 million new private sector jobs created
in the past two and a half years despite a state of chronic recession
in the eurozone, our biggest export market, has been quite an
achievement. I pay renewed tribute to Sir John Major, who won for this
country the right to stay out of the euro. I welcome the continuing
commitment expressed in the gracious Speech to promoting economic
competitiveness through the rigorous reining back of unaffordable
increases in public expenditure and to the maintenance of low interest
rates. These constitute the two most fundamental of policies for
growth. If we gave up on them, the burden of past extravagances would
come back to haunt us. As a certain Lady once said, “There is no
alternative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T15:42:55"></hs_TimeCode>”.
In that regard, I acknowledge in particular the courage of my right
honourable friends George Osborne and his Chief Secretary, the
articulate and unflappable Danny Alexander. They personify the
coalition at its best: stalwart, steady and united, they continue to
put the nation first.</hs_para>

pundits thought that coalition would be a recipe for
paralysis. However, at this half-way stage in the
Parliament, it is notable how much really major legislation has reached
the statute book. I am thinking of the giant strides of my right
honourable friend Michael Gove in education and of my right honourable
friend Iain Duncan Smith in tackling the wasteful and damaging morass
of the world of welfare. These are great and far-reaching
breakthroughs, of Beveridge proportions, from which one may feel sure
that the nation will benefit for years to come and of which many
single-party Governments, over an entire term, would be proud. Now, in
the gracious Speech, there is more to come in both

the gracious Speech reveals no loss of impetus, with many significant
new measures, for example on pensions and immigration. There is the
long-term care and support Bill, a matter surely of compelling interest
to your Lordships—we will all have to declare our interest when
speaking on it. It is a measure of vital long-term importance to a
growing proportion of  the population. Another Bill will tackle

altogether welcome here. This year, by contrast, many of your Lordships
look eagerly for such a measure, but in vain. Of course, last year, for
some it was a case of reform by abolition; for most, our ambitions are,
I believe, more modest but more practical. One might argue that there

programme, the gracious Speech rightly focused on creating a stronger
economy and promoting a fairer society. However, it is my observation
that a real sign of strength of purpose is a
Government prepared to take big decisions in difficult times. Perhaps
being a coalition makes this easier. Members coming from different
parties are required to hold a more open debate on the problems faced
than the debate which happens within a single-party Government. Perhaps
historians of the future will be able to observe on that
possibility.</hs_para>

the gracious Speech that we have heard today faces up to two of the
major problems of our time, problems which have lurked in the
“too difficult” pile for many years. I refer to the
announcement of measures relating to social care and single-tier
pensions. Those are indeed bold measures in tough economic times. They
put in place the architecture for major policy change that allows for
financial improvement once times become better and extra money becomes
available. An ageing but healthier society with greater longevity lies
behind both those policies. The measure to deal with the problems
caused by the high cost of social care is the culmination of a
multitude of reports, commissions, studies and investigations, not
least the one headed by Andrew
Dilnot<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T15:56:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050834000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130508-0001.htm#13050834000074">The
most important matter to be dealt with is that of
certainty—certainty of knowing what costs will fall on
individuals, to replace the high costs which fall almost at random on
many older people and their families, with many having to sell their
homes. No one knows if he or she will be the one person in 10 who is
hit with the enormous cost of long-term care. That problem is worsened
as people live longer. I commend the Government for tackling a
deep-seated issue, now finally to be

reform to pensions will create a simple, decent state pension set above
the basic means test. It is to happen sooner than intended. The new
state pension will be fairer to the low paid, the self-employed and
carers, and make it easier for people to understand what they will get
from the state when they reach state pension age. However, regrettably,
there are many noble Lords to whom this reform will not apply. It will
not be retrospective. I know that your Lordships generally take a dim

mentioned in the gracious Speech, but it was today. It is a thread
which runs through the fabric of this Government. It may be the case
that having a coalition Government ensures openness; it might be a
factor of the parties working together. However, this Government should
be praised for their attitude towards provision of information. They
have set the government information switch firmly to open, where that
is possible and practical, rather than to close, with the outside world
having to rely on leaks and squeezing out information in bits and
pieces.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050834000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130508-0001.htm#13050834000079">I

can easily find out”. This exchange on Ministers also took
place, with Sir Humphrey telling Bernard: “Ministers should
never know more than they need to know. Then they can’t tell

Government’s legislative programme, as set out in the gracious
Speech, it is a great pleasure to congratulate the noble Lords, Lord
Lang of Monkton and Lord German, for their speeches this afternoon. The
noble Lord, Lord Lang, of course has a distinguished record, not just
as a member of SOCs—an organisation whose membership I certainly
aspire to—but as a former senior MP and Cabinet Minister. His
membership of the Commons neatly coincided with the entire period of
the previous Conservative Administration; he won his seat in
May 1979 and lost it in May 1997. He rose through the
ministerial ranks to be Secretary of State for Scotland—never
the easiest job in government, especially not when succeeded 
<?notus-xml column=11?>in office by the now noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. He then
became President of the Board of Trade, which is also not the easiest
job in government, particularly not when succeeding in that office the
now noble Lord, Lord Heseltine.</hs_para>

way through such highly dangerous, shark-infested Tory waters meant
that the noble Lord, Lord Lang, was a natural to play a central role in
John Major’s “Back me or sack me” re-election
campaign as leader of the Conservative Party in July 1995. The then
Prime Minister was trying to rid himself of those in the Conservative
Party who were on one side of the Tories’ fundamental divisions
over Europe from the late 1980s and early 1990s onwards. I will not use
in your Lordships’ House the term that the then Prime Minister
used for them, but your Lordships may recall that it seemed to closely
question their
parentage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050834000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130508-0001.htm#13050834000084">The
experience of the noble Lord, Lord Lang, in helping to handle that kind
of thing means, I suspect, that he knows a thing or two about
divisions. So it is probably of no comfort to him to be seeing
something of a replay of those years in interventions such as that
yesterday from one of the noble Lord’s then colleagues: the
former Chancellor, the noble Lord, Lord Lawson of Blaby. However, it is
a replay with a difference. Last time, it was just the Conservative
Party ripping itself apart. This time, with the prospect of an in-out
referendum on our membership of the EU, the stakes are so much higher.
The noble Lord, Lord Lang, has been a distinguished Member of your
Lordships’ House for many years, and I take this opportunity to
pay particular thanks and tribute to him for his role as the chair of
the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments.</hs_para>

people, especially in Wales, will know him better as that. We worked
well together on the enlargement of the European Union and I am of
course pleased to see him as a Member of your Lordships’ House,
even as a Liberal Democrat. Mike is a former leader of the Liberal

Final because this time next year the coalition Government—if

do we have in this year’s programme? Well, it is difficult to

know, a Bill was brought forward, but within months, the House of Lords
Reform Bill was in trouble. The Bill was voted against by 91 rebelling
Conservative MPs, and so much of a rebellion it was that the
Conservative MP leading the supposed rebellion has now very
particularly been favoured by the Prime Minister by being appointed to
the Prime Minister’s principal policy review committee. Finally,
it was abandoned and withdrawn by the Government. The Bill moved,
within months, from being the flagship of 
<?notus-xml column=13?>the Gracious Speech this time last year to not being a Bill at all. So
we have little idea whether, as with last year’s flagship
measure, any of the measures in today’s legislative programme
will survive the huge fissures of difference between the component
elements of the coalition. They might, but they might not. We just do
not know.</hs_parafo>

Bills, we do not really know what is in them because of the way the

making significant amendments at the last minute, often in your

Agricultural Wages Board in the last Session was a clear example of a
poor way of making policy. We have no idea, for instance, whether more

be fair to this coalition Government, they are trying to learn from

So, no legislation, shamefully, to put into statute the

against rogue landlords and extortionate fees in the private rented

even begin to meet the economic challenges which people, families,
communities and the country are facing. It does not begin to address
the scale of anxiety and disillusion throughout the country, which was
shown clearly not just in the results of last week’s elections
but in the shameful 29% turnout. We have legislation that will not do
much if anything for individuals, young people, families and
communities who are now so hard-pressed by being squeezed by the
Government’s economic policies that many of them barely know how
to make ends meet. They have to borrow from family and friends, and
take up people’s generosity by making use of the rapidly
burgeoning number of food banks. They worry not just about themselves
and their children’s future but about getting food on the table.

Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Lord Hill of
Oareford):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great honour to stand here as
Leader of your Lordships’ House and to reflect on the previous
Session and look ahead to the new one. My first few months in the job
have brought home to me time and again the importance of the
contribution that the House makes both to the legislative process and
to our wider political debate. They have also made me realise how
fortunate we all are to receive such outstanding support from those who
work in the House. To that end, and on behalf of the whole House, I
place on record our gratitude to Black Rod and all the staff for
organising such a superb
day<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T16:19:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050834000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130508-0001.htm#13050834000109">Today
is a great state occasion, which means one thing: briefly, I get to be
nice about the Leader of the Opposition. I thank the noble Baroness,
Lady Royall, for moving the Motion to adjourn. For the first two
minutes of her speech, I agreed with everything she said; and while she
and I do not always agree on content of what is before the House, I
know that we have a shared affection for it and a shared idea of how it
should work. I am grateful to her for the professionalism and courtesy
that she has always shown me and the usual channels. I know how hard
she works on behalf of her party and Back-Benchers and, indeed, the
House as a whole, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with
her in the coming Session. I also greatly appreciate the parts played
in the work of this House by my noble friend the Deputy Leader of the
House, and the noble Lord, Lord Laming, as Convenor of the Cross
Benches. They, too, are fundamental to what this House is
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T16:19:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050834000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130508-0001.htm#13050834000110">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T16:20:09"></hs_TimeCode>
praising the work of the usual channels of today, I should also like to
pay tribute to my predecessor, my noble friend Lord Strathclyde, who
was a mainstay of the usual channels for almost 20 years. He was a
quite outstanding Leader of this House and leader of my party and I,
along with many others, am greatly in his debt. Now, I know that my
noble friend was sometimes accused of being wily. That is an accusation
that I categorically reject. It is a grotesque understatement. His
explanation to me of what it would involve to be Leader of the House
was not wily: it was a flagrant breach of the Trade Descriptions
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T16:20:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050834000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130508-0001.htm#13050834000111">In
looking back over my noble friend’s remarkable career in this
House, for which he was rightly made a Companion of Honour, I was
struck by an odd pattern. He first became a government Minister in
1988, the year when the SDP merged with the Liberal Party. In 1994, the
year when the Liberal Democrats took Eastleigh from the Conservatives,
he became government Chief 
<?notus-xml column=17?>Whip. In 1998, the year when the Liberal Democrats overtook the
Conservatives in local elections, he became Leader of the Opposition.
In 2010, when he became Leader of this House, the first coalition
Government for more than 60 years was formed between the Conservatives
and the Liberal Democrats. Is this coincidence, or has my noble friend
in fact been a Liberal Democrat sleeper for all these
years?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050834000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130508-0001.htm#13050834000112">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T16:22:04"></hs_TimeCode>
is not something of which I would ever accuse my noble friend Lord
Lang. I am especially delighted that he said yes to the invitation to
propose the humble Address, and I know I speak for the whole House when
I congratulate him on performing his role with such wit and style this
afternoon. For those who know of his early career, this comes as no
surprise. A member of the Cambridge Footlights with John Cleese and
Peter Cook, he went on to write scripts for “That Was The Week
That Was”. What better preparation to be a Conservative Cabinet
Minister than training as a satirist? First, as Scottish Secretary, and
then as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my noble friend
served in the Cabinet for seven years with great distinction. As a mark
of his particular skill, he was the only Cabinet Minister I can
remember appearing on programmes such as “Question Time”
in 1997 without being booed. I say to my noble friend,
“Don’t relax”—we might have to call on him
again.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050834000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130508-0001.htm#13050834000113">It
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T16:23:06"></hs_TimeCode> also a
pleasure to congratulate my noble friend Lord German on his speech this
afternoon. He may be a more recent entrant to your Lordships’
House, but he is no newcomer to the political world, with a career in
Welsh politics spanning three decades. I see that he is also a member
of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Cyprus, where I fear his
surname may prove something of an embarrassment at the moment. A former
music teacher, he continues to put his musical talents to good use,
until recently chairing the parliamentary choir. To coin a phrase,
where there was discord, he brought harmony. I am particularly
intrigued by what I understand is my noble friend’s party trick
of singing the words of one carol to the tune of another. This is, of
course, a great skill for life in a coalition government. I will be
perfectly happy if from now on he sings from the same hymn sheet as
me.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050834000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130508-0001.htm#13050834000114">The year

vital as it is, the business of this House is not just the passing of
legislation. The previous Session saw a wide range of debates, some led
by government Ministers and many more by Back-Bench Members, addressing
issues of national and international importance, while our Select
Committees have continued to produce excellent and thought-provoking
work. Our new ad hoc committees have demonstrated the House at its
best, complementing the work of the House of Commons and making use of
a wider range of the expertise available among our Members. The same is
true of the first dedicated post-legislative scrutiny committee that we
set up last year to look at the statute law on adoption and consider
draft clauses in the Children and Families Bill. Since the start of
this Parliament, we have also seen an increase in the number of Joint
Committees of both Houses conducting pre-legislative scrutiny, a trend
which continued last Session, with five such Joint Committees
appointed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050834000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130508-0001.htm#13050834000120">As

look forward not only to the House’s legislative work in the
next Session but to the establishment of a series of new Select
Committees, including three ad hoc committees and two post-legislative
scrutiny committees, which will allow a wider range of Members to serve
on a committee. We will also be creating new opportunities for
Back-Bench Members  
<?notus-xml column=19?>to lead debates. This will include a regular weekly slot for a topical
short debate on the Floor of the House as well as making more use of
the Moses Room for short debates to double the
number of opportunities for Members to have debates

will be busy with legislation, busy with scrutiny and busy in shaping
our country’s political debate. As we set about those tasks, I
