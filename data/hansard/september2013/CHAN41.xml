regularly operate from royal naval vessels. Some specific training is
needed to qualify crews to enable them to operate from ships, but no
specific engineering work is required for Chinooks to embark on or fly
from ships, so no marinisation programme is needed. But as Chinooks
cannot fit in the hangar on any of our existing vessels, they embark
for specific operations or exercises rather than for long

questions. The Trident alternatives review states categorically that
Trident provides the best value and the best capability for the United
Kingdom. As for the separate question of how many boats are needed, the
Government are determined to maintain continuous-at-sea deterrence, and
the best advice at present is that that will require four boats. The
cost differential between three and four boats is about £1.7
billion in net present value terms, or about £50 million to
£60 million a year over the life of the

would be prey to a pre-emptive strike—which means that it would

is a relatively small and densely populated land mass, is one of the
factors taken into account by the Trident alternatives review, and one
of the reasons why the idea of land-based ballistic missiles was ruled
out at an early stage. The review states clearly that all alternatives
to Trident are less capable, higher-risk and more expensive. That

ultimate answer to the hon. Gentleman’s question is 42, as the
UK currently participates in 40 NATO smart defence initiatives and two
of the European Defence Agency’s pooling and sharing projects. I
am happy to write to him with a list, if he would like it. Capability
development is a long-term process. Many of these projects are still in
their infancy and as such we are unable to quantify meaningfully direct
savings to the UK, but savings there certainly will be. There are clear
benefits for the UK in seeking collaborative opportunities and
encouraging other partners to do the same, particularly working in
small groups where it is expedient to do so. UK-Dutch amphibiosity, 40
years old this year, is a very good

I support what the Government are doing to try to buy at lower cost
collaboratively with allies, but the Government’s defence
expenditure, according to public expenditure statistical analyses last

still for such Bills to be debated on a Friday, the worst possible day
for being quorate? With regard to the end of the report—this

Acts “Back-Bench Acts” reduces

have come up with a number of recommendations that may or may not find
support with the House. The first suggestion relates to how Bills are
selected for debate. The current ballot system has much to commend it.
Those entering have an equal chance of success and it is not
susceptible to manipulation. However, the ballot is totally random and
does not discriminate between Members with serious intent to engage
with the process of private Members’ legislation and those with
a passing interest—such as myself, at times in my
past—and a willingness to sign their name in the book because it
seems like a good idea at the time, as they are directed towards it in
a Division Lobby by the Whips. Therefore, we ask the House to consider
a system whereby the responsibility is placed on Members to gather
support for their legislative initiatives.</hs_Para>

Bills with the greatest number of signatures drawn from across the
House would take precedence. Members would be allowed to support only
one Bill with their signatures—this is very important—so
once they had signed their signature away, they could not give it to
anyone else, unless they withdrew it from the Bill that they had
already said they would support. The process of attracting support
would start well before the date of presentation and demonstrate the
seriousness of intent behind the Member’s proposed legislation.
It is hoped that those participating would cast their net wide in
seeking support and, of course, include Ministers and Whitehall at an
early
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T15:48:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Jack Straw</B> (Blackburn) (Lab):</Member> I have been able to read the
Procedure Committee’s report since it was issued this morning,
and I greatly welcome it. Were it to be implemented, it would result in
a sea change in the attitude of Members on both sides of the House to
private Members’ legislation, and their behaviour would change
as a consequence. However, achieving such a change in behaviour is not
so much about the method of selecting the Bills in the first place as
about providing, through timetabling, a process by which decisions can
be made. At the moment, any Bill that is even remotely contentious ends
up being kicked into touch as a result of the activities of the Whips.
This creates a dishonesty that verges on farce, and leads to
institutional disingenuity 
<?notus-xml column=28?>by those in the Whips Office—of all persuasions—and
therefore by Government Departments.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T15:51:07"></hs_TimeCode> also very much
welcome the Committee’s proposal for the Government to have to
state their attitude to a Bill on First Reading. The Leader of the
House suggested in his evidence to the Committee that the Government
spent a great deal of time forming a view of such Bills. If that is the
case, things have obviously changed since 2010. Also, we must be able

in my view and the view of most members of the Committee, timetabling

facilitate its introduction, in which either some or all of the private

“cobblers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T15:53:11"></hs_TimeCode>”.
However, we need to ensure that colleagues have an incentive to turn up

Reading through a timetable for fewer than three hours
would, I think, be damaging. I have in mind issues such as
the legalisation of homosexuality, abortion and similar issues. A
greater move is being made to have one Member present or address one
Bill on one day, but I am slightly concerned because I recall
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T15:56:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

sits, constituents can expect their MP, if the MP so chooses, to be in

Reading before taking any further interventions. One of the most
important parts of our report is the suggestion to remove the vote on
Third Reading from the Friday proceedings and put it on a mid-week
prime-time slot. That will serve two purposes. First, it will allow the
Government to take a view and if they want to kill a Bill, they can
stand up at the Dispatch Box and explain why they want to kill it and
whip accordingly. It also means that the whole House—or those
present, which will be almost the whole House perhaps on a Monday,
Tuesday or Wednesday—can come to a view on that piece of
legislation. If a Bill is passed, it will pass with the will and

The Government have not, as yet, specified what form the sale of Royal

a sale to private equity—although they have said that an IPO is
their preferred method of sale. There is a great deal of concern
throughout the country that the Government are rushing their timetable
for political reasons. They have said that the sale will take place
within the 2013-14 financial year. If that is the case, we will be

Government have framed their argument for privatisation in such a way
as to suggest that Royal Mail is in imminent danger and that
privatisation is the only solution, but that is not the case. Royal
Mail is doing very well at the moment, and profits more than doubled in
the past year, to more than £400 million. That is
partly because the Government have taken over the assets and
liabilities of Royal Mail’s pension scheme, saving the company
£300 million each year. I congratulate the Government on taking
that step. Of course Royal Mail needs access to capital for investment,
but the urgency of the Government’s case seems to be driven more
by a political timetable. There are many ways to get access to capital.
For example, Network Rail is a public body that is authorised to access
private capital, without affecting Government borrowing. This House has
the right to expect the Government to look at other ways in which Royal
Mail could get this access without going down the privatisation
path.</hs_Para>

privatisation. The National Federation of SubPostmasters was originally
sympathetic to some of what the Government were saying but it is now
calling on them to halt the privatisation of Royal Mail, because of
what it says is the Government’s failure to provide new work to
post offices. In the briefings that it has been providing to Members
throughout the country, which have been given to me by my constituents
and when I have visited post offices over the past few days, the NFSP
says that no new work has been awarded to post offices since May 2010
and that the new services that have been introduced are one-off
transactions available only at a small number of post offices. It says
that without the promised new Government work Post Office Ltd and
individual post offices do not have a viable future and that a close
relationship with Royal Mail is vital and will be jeopardised by
privatisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T16:10:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309025000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0001.htm#1309025000238">One

villages have at their core a pub, if not two pubs, and a village shop,

Mole Valley lost a number of sub-post offices, which in turn
threatened, sometimes fatally, the associated village shops. I
understand that there are 11,800 post offices in United Kingdom, and
approximately 750 are what could be called main post offices.

Post Office Ltd is the front line in over-the-counter processing of
digital photographs for licences issued by the Driver and Vehicle
Licensing Agency, passports and other ID photos. This service is being
cramped by Post Office Ltd. It is being moved to the 750 main post
offices, where Post Office Ltd is installing at considerable expense
what are called Cogent cameras, which will take the photograph and
transmit it to the DVLA or Passport

have in my constituency the head office of Photo-Me. This is a business
with which many of us are familiar because there are a couple of
Photo-Me booths downstairs. There are many such booths throughout our
small towns and, in my area at least, some sub-post offices have them.
If the proposal to use Cogent cameras proceeds, my constituents will
have to travel from their villages to a centre such as Guildford. It
does not look far on the map and it is not far as the crow flies, but
my constituents do not fly. I am aware that the trend is for on-line
services, but according to a recent estimate, 40% of households in my
constituency do not have a computer, let alone broadband. For many, the
internet is so complicated that they prefer to use the printed form
with the printed photograph.
These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T16:26:17"></hs_TimeCode> folks will

that the universal service will not be threatened because it is
enshrined in law through the Postal Services Act 2011, but that covers
only the bare minimum of the universal service. Many aspects of the
universal service are set by the regulator, Ofcom, and could easily be
changed while remaining legally compliant. For example, Ofcom recently
looked at various ways the universal service could be changed to make
it cheaper to run. It considered getting rid of first-class mail, and
therefore the next-day service, reducing quality of service standards
and cutting delivery days from six a week to five. Thankfully, it did
not proceed with those changes, but with a privatised Royal Mail those
options are likely to be raised again and again because of commercial
pressures. On 23 December 2012 <I>The Daily Telegraph</I> reported that
Conservative Ministers were thinking about future changes to the
universal service obligation and that an all-Conservative Government
could perhaps seek to relax
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309025000277" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0001.htm#1309025000277">Privatised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T16:32:04"></hs_TimeCode>

the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran said, consumers in remote and
rural locations are frequently charged extra. She pointed out that
there are reports of £45 being charged for the delivery of
£25 phones. The Government say that Royal Mail faces
imminent danger and that privatisation is the only answer, but that is
simply not the case. The most recent financial results show that under
public ownership its profits more than doubled in the past year to
£403 million. That demonstrates that Royal Mail can
be profitable in the public sector, which is where most

of the letters service will also impact on post offices in remote and
rural locations. The post office network is reliant not only on
Government subsidy but on the commercial relationship with Royal Mail
that allows its postal products and services to be sold through that
network. The current chief executive of Royal Mail says that the
commercial success of both companies is best served by their working
closely together, but a new chief executive of a privatised Royal Mail
may take an entirely different commercial view. There are legitimate
concerns that a privatised Royal Mail responsible only to shareholders
would seek to sever this relationship in line with its commercial
interests. That would have a disastrous effect on the entire post
office network, but branches in remote and rural areas would be at
particular risk because of their low population density and their
revenues. The last Postcomm annual report on the post office network in
2010 found that fewer than 23% of rural branches generated over
£40,000 per annum, compared with 70% of urban branches and two
thirds of branches in deprived urban areas.</hs_Para>

Government and Ofcom need to make sure that the universal service
obligation in its current form endures and postal services in rural and
remote areas are protected. This requires Ofcom to use the powers that
it has to tackle the end-to-end competition from private postal
operators such as TNT UK. It also requires the Government to consider
an alternative business model for Royal Mail that would keep the postal
service run in the interests of the public and properly engage the work
force. The main problem is that the model of competition under the 2011
Act has meant, in a privatised context, cherry-picking of the most
profitable parts of Royal Mail’s business—for example,
taking the profitable parts such as business mail, sorting it and then
delivering it to city centres, but dumping it back into the Royal Mail
network for delivery to the most remote and costly rural areas. That
imposes a double burden on Royal Mail, taking revenue away and then
forcing it to bear the extra cost.</hs_Para>

Although that is what the motion largely refers to, it is inevitable
that Members have spoken a lot about post offices, because they are so
crucial to our constituents. I will be no different, because I want to
discuss the importance of the post office network, which is a key part
of the proposals. I also want to talk about issues relating to the
universal service obligation that have already been raised by hon.

constituency of North Cornwall contains 65 parishes. During
the previous Parliament, when we had a formal programme of post office
closures, it had 70 parishes, so it has shrunk since then.
However, it is still a big rural area without a single railway station
and where people rely on services that are close to them, wherever
possible. It is a huge source of anxiety to them if they feel that a
service that provides access to the wider world is going to be
withdrawn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T16:43:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309025000296" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0001.htm#1309025000296">We
have also had issues with the provision of broadband, which the hon.

in my constituency were so-called not spots where not only did they not
have fast broadband, but they did not have broadband at all and were
still on dial-up. That was a source of consternation to a few people
who had decided to relocate to the constituency to run a business,
which was welcome, only to find when they tried to connect to broadband
that it did not exist. I am delighted that we are making progress on

that the Royal Mail delivers on behalf of a number of well-known

have brought back local community shops and post offices. The scheme in
Blisland predates the closure programme. The community there came
together and provided an excellent facility that has an internet

the post office closed, the community recently got together to apply
for funding for a new building. That went up incredibly quickly, which
is testimony to the hard work of the community. In other places, the

shut down buildings, took away the old NAAFI and so on, which put the
post office under threat. Again, the community came together and put
forward a good proposal with Cornwall council. It now has a lease on

into the post office at the same time, or if they are going to the shop
they might also go into the pub. Such things all support a viable set
of services and businesses in the area, and the post office plays a big

finding a buyer may not prove such an easy prospect. We must get

securing this debate. I wish, like others, to contribute because a
large part of my constituency covers a rural

post is a vital service in rural areas. It goes beyond merely putting
mail through the letterbox. For example, people who are not naturally
gifted at form-filling can get help at competitive prices from the post
office on a range of official documents, including passports, driving
licences and tax discs. The post office will check the photo and form
for a new driving licence for £4.50; by contrast, private
companies offering similar services online can charge up to £60
for passport checking. The difference is between a public service at a
modest cost and the free market charging whatever it thinks it can get
away
with.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090211000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0002.htm#13090211000005">When
public services began to be privatised back in the 1980s, the mantra
from many who occupied the Government Benches at the time was that
competition meant a better deal for the customer. However, let us look
at some recent examples. The privatised Thames Water makes profits of
billions of pounds but surcharges Londoners for upgrading the sewer
infrastructure in the city. The energy companies, including British
Gas, have put household fuel and electricity costs up to an
unacceptable level in recent years—not something they are keen
to tell Sid about. The railway companies are allowed to get away with
above-inflation fare increases when passengers have to tighten their
belts and suffer a drop in their incomes. There cannot be many people
left apart from some on the Government Benches who believe that
privatisation always means a better deal for the general

have said those things in jest, but there is a serious point. A line
must be drawn on how far privatisation is allowed to go. Everyone,

Parliamentary seats are legally immune from sale. The Prime
Minister’s dinner table ought also to be exempt, although there
are reports that donations to one Government party can get people
through that front

complaints from the head of Royal Mail, Moya Greene, about remuneration
for higher executives in the service, suggest that one priority for a
privatised postal service will be significantly better pay for those in
senior management positions. I am sure that Moya is still smarting from
having to agree to hand back the £250,000 she received to get on
the UK housing ladder, on top of the £127,000 she receives
annually in relocation payments. Marie Antoinette’s riposte,

evidence does not back up the case for selling off postal services, so
we must ask what is the real reason for this project. For most of those
on the Government Benches it is surely a dogmatic belief that, whatever
the evidence, private is good and public is bad. I anticipate that the
argument that postal services do not really have the same status in
this technological age as they may have had in the past may come up. We
will be told that people have the alternative of going online or using
e-mail, and so do not have to rely on postal services. However, my
recent experiences in Blackwood, Kirkmuir Hill and other rural areas in
my constituency suggest that that is a rash assumption. British Telecom
and the Scottish Government, supported by the UK Government, are
rolling out programmes for so-called superfast broadband. In rural
Blackwood and Kirkmuir Hill, however, a part of the community—a
new development—has been left out due to the rather bizarre
claim that they could not be sure of demand. Those constituents may get
new broadband speeds in three, four, five or six years’ time, so
they cannot rely on the internet and e-mail to conduct their business
now. They have to resort to more traditional means.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T17:04:37"></hs_TimeCode>clearly
demonstrates that communities in rural areas, where it is most
expensive and difficult to upgrade online services, are the most likely
to have to rely on postal services for the longest time. Yet if postal
services are deemed to be too expensive, it will be in those areas that
services are most likely to be jettisoned by private 
<?notus-xml column=49?>sector companies as uneconomical. That has certainly been the experience
in New Zealand. In the UK, the number of rural post offices has been
cut by 2,765 since 2000. I acknowledge that that cut is less than the
cut to the number of urban post offices in the same period, but the
accessibility criteria I mentioned earlier mean it is more significant,
as rural offices are much further apart. Rural areas suffer in the
provision of traditional Royal Mail and Post Office services and in the
technological revolution from which urbanised areas will be able to
benefit more or less immediately.</hs_Para>

course, questions about access to services for those who do not own
cars and have to get to urban centres, where postal services are more
profitable and more likely to remain. A recent Library note shows that
the accessibility criteria already differ between urban and rural
areas, with urban post offices expected to be within 1 mile of the
customer, but up to 3 miles away in rural
areas.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T17:04:26"></hs_TimeCode> There are
bus services from rural areas—my constituency is no different in
that respect—but they are by no means as frequent as those that
urban users are familiar with. That self-evidently reduces access,

facility in one’s own village.</hs_Para>

there is the question of whether the public want postal services to be
sold off. The evidence from my postbag is that many people are deeply
concerned about the proposals and have shown support for the
Communication Workers Union campaign. I, too, would like to mention
Hugh Gaffney, who has been a regular correspondent and has worked
tirelessly on behalf of his union members in my constituency. However,
nobody has written to me to say that the sell-off is a good thing and
should go ahead. I cannot find any reference to a Royal Mail sell-off
in the 2010 Conservative or Lib Dem manifestos, so there can be no
claim of an electoral mandate for the proposal.</hs_Para>

quickly and efficiently. Ministers have recently taken to justifying
the privatisation on the grounds that, as a public service, the postal
service has to compete with schools and hospitals for scarce public
funds. That is emotive, but completely the wrong way to look at the

is a long way to go, particularly in the more rural areas, but we are

being made in other parts of the UK—I recognise that the
Government have made money available for that. The extension of
fibre-optic broadband will improve the ability of small and medium
rural businesses to operate over the internet and give an important

I have said, it is not only privatisation that poses a threat to that

absolutely nothing to prevent Royal Mail or its new private owners from
introducing zonal pricing in any service other than the universal

introducing, for example, a different first-class
service—perhaps an inter-city first-class service serving the
major urban areas at a lower cost than the universal service—in
the face of the competition that will undoubtedly exist. That could
lead to a situation in which urban businesses had access to a
lower-cost service than rural businesses. Such a move would not breach
the obligation under the Act. Indeed, it could be beneficial to large
urban areas and larger users as competition developed, but it would, as

a first-class stamp already 60p—one of the highest prices in

if Ofcom decided to use its powers, they would be insufficient to

Royal Mail is obliged to continue the universal service provision, and

does Ofcom have to deal with such a

Postal Services Act sets out what could be done in such circumstances,
and it is worth noting that the decisions would be taken by Ofcom in
the first instance. It would make a recommendation and a Minister would
then decide whether to accept or reject it. If the service were in
danger, Ofcom would have to consider the matter. It could decide to
review the minimum requirements of the obligation, which could result
in a reduced service that would be disastrous for rural areas. It could
also decide on the establishment of a compensation fund. Importantly,
however, such a fund would have to be paid for by all users of the
services and not by the companies that deliver the mail. That could
give rise to serious difficulties. It could also lead to substantial
price increases for consumers.</hs_Para>

could also impose general service conditions on all or some other

seems likely, the other competitors would be found only in relatively
small geographical areas and Royal Mail were the only provider in rural

had hoped to say more about the post office network, which is also very
important in rural areas, but I am unfortunately running out of time.
Post offices play a part in the delivery of mail, because they provide
a pick-up and delivery point in many rural areas. No one in the Chamber
will be unaware of the torrid time that the post office network has had
over the past decade, when over 34% of post offices have closed.
Although there is no closure programme at the moment, it does not mean
that post offices are not still struggling and, in some cases, closing.

which I will return later. As many Members have mentioned today,

rural areas, and that it will not revitalise the service, as some have
suggested it will, but leave it to wither on the vine. I am worried

we have seen with other privatisations, once the horse has bolted and

unacceptable at any point for rural customers to have to pay more for
that service. I ask the Minister to reassure us today that that will
never happen, and that we are not on a slippery slope towards the
erosion of the universal service obligation. I should also like to hear

me reiterate that I do not oppose the modernisation of the service.
Indeed, the initial plans for modernisation met with a degree of
approval. It was hoped that more Government functions and business
would be returned to the Post Office, and that the plans would return
post offices to the centre of local life and diversify the service to
meet the needs of all in the community. Over the last 
<?notus-xml column=54?>10 months, I have been pleased to be asked by the Post Office to open
rebranded branches in my constituency, which have been open for more
hours and have offered a broader range of services. It is important for
such services to be retained in hard-to-reach rural communities. There
is clearly a public demand for more of them to be provided, primarily
through local post office branches. In response to a recent ICM poll,
89% of people said that they wanted a face-to-face service, and 73%
said that they preferred the post
office.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090211000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0002.htm#13090211000043">I
believe that, following the recent review of banking and financial
services, the Government have missed an opportunity to put the Post
Office at the centre of a restructured retail banking sector. I believe
that there is enormous potential for post offices to offer high-street
banking services that would provide income for the Post Office while
also bringing customers through the door to use their other services.
That would apply particularly in rural areas that are currently
experiencing a wave of bank branch closures. In Northern Ireland,
Ulster bank, RBS, First Trust—part of Allied Irish
Banks—and the Bank of Ireland are closing branches in rural
communities.</hs_Para>

high-street banks were compelled, or encouraged, to offer access to a
wide range of transaction services in local post office branches, and

economy. What we need from the Government is an approach that aims to
develop and support our postal services, bringing them into line with

SubPostmasters, a representative of which I met recently, has made it
clear that in practice it is very much not opposed to modernisation or
to getting more services, but it is opposed to any contraction or

me move on to the post office. We cannot forget that in many rural
centres post offices can be a hub for the local community. We should
invest in that and support it. I want to pay tribute at this point to
the post office diversification fund of the Labour Welsh Government,
which last year made a grant to Pontfadog post office in the beautiful
Ceiriog valley to fund new lighting and signage, a new chiller for
fruit and veg, sandwiches, pies and cakes for tourists, a photocopier
and a notice board. The post office, like many in the smaller villages,
manages to combine being a village centre with being a place of
hospitality, a tourist information centre and so much more. We must
support such initiatives and commit ourselves to them and those like
them in our rural areas.</hs_Para>

must think, too, about how we can support postal services in two other
scenarios that are, I think, almost exclusively rural. The first is
when there is no longer a full post office but the Post Office is
willing to retain a counter. How can we give more support to other
retail outlets, where they exist, or to other organisations? We must be
more flexible in that regard and urgently need to do more to promote
partnership working and to get post office counters running. As long as
there is the relevant security, we can and should be very imaginative
about where to place those counters.</hs_Para>

the second scenario, the Post Office will want to keep a post office
open but no willing party will take on the post of postmaster, which
means that we see temporary or, in some cases, long-term closures. We
should be open to different patterns of employment so that services
never have to close for the lack of one post holder. More must be done
to ensure that those post offices should stay open. Post Office Ltd
should not be let off the hook in this regard: we would not say that it
did not matter if a school or health service provider closed for six
months.</hs_Para>

drastically and maintaining the USO is expensive. However, the
maintenance of the USO is at the crux of the debate. The Government
cannot guarantee either the USO or the inter-business agreement with
the Post Office because they have no real control over rival end-to-end
operators cherry-picking more profitable services, which in turn makes
delivering  
<?notus-xml column=58?>the USO more expensive. A more expensive USO puts pressure on a

the Minister nor the Royal Mail can tell us what will happen if
everything goes wrong. If the USO becomes too expensive to deliver or
if the privatised Royal Mail just hands back the keys to the
Government, as the private companies did when their contracts failed on
the east coast rail line, what will happen? The taxpayer will pick up
the tab. The situation is compounded by the fact that the Royal Mail
has much higher service standards than rival deliverers. It therefore
faces higher standards that are more expensive to deliver, and pressure
on its most profitable parts from rival companies operating under lower
service standards and employing staff under worse working conditions,
as my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T17:38:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran said, to make their
services cheaper still. Combined with that is an ever-more expensive
USO, pressure on the inter-business agreement with the Post Office and
the fact that the Government have no strategy on how to protect the USO
in the long term. Then there is the big question of the EU directive,
because will the UK be in the EU? Does the Prime Minister want to
repatriate in this area and will that create further uncertainty about
the universal service obligation? This is a recipe for disaster, and

would be naive to think that any new owner of a privatised Royal Mail
would not aim to maximise shareholder value. That will put pressure on
reducing costs and on services that might be considered uneconomic,
such as reaching remote areas. Rural businesses might well have to pay
more to have their mail delivered, while getting parcels from online
retailers could come at a premium for householders. We have heard that
a survey by Citizens Advice Scotland found that 84% of people living in

importance of the post office network to rural communities is shown by
statistics from the National Federation of SubPostmasters saying that
55% of post offices are in rural areas and that 31% are the only retail
outlet in some areas. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T17:39:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson) said, such post offices are often how
rural communities access the wider world. The post office network
depends on Royal Mail for more than 30% of its income, so we can see
why there are considerable concerns that the 10-year inter-business
agreement will fall. First, it was included in the Postal Services Act
2011 only after Labour and stakeholder pressure. Secondly, it can be
reviewed in five years and, thirdly, it can be altered if there are
material adverse effects on either of the two companies. It is a vital
link in the sustainability of the post office network.</hs_Para>

Office is in a precarious position. A recent survey by the National
Federation of SubPostmasters found that operating costs were rising;
personal drawings for sub-post masters had fallen by 36% in four years;
one in four sub-postmasters took absolutely no salary from their post
office income; and most sub-postmasters earned little or no income from
financial or Government services—the two areas that Ministers
identified as having “real growth potential”. Most
importantly for this debate, the Government have completely failed to
deliver their pledge to make the post office the “Front Office
for Government”. Do hon. Members remember 
<?notus-xml column=59?>that mantra? That has resulted in the NFSP withdrawing its support and

the impact on rural areas of the roll-out of the Post Office Local

concerned that the model could result in many rural communities losing
their post office or seeing further cuts in services such as manual
cash deposits and withdrawals, manual bill payment services. and
on-demand foreign currency. That is particularly worrying, given that

setting out the background to how we got where we are today, it is
important to remember that the Government are implementing a package of
key reforms recommended in Richard Hooper’s independent review,
which was first commissioned in 2008 by the previous Government. He set
out three clear recommendations that needed to be implemented as a
package if the Government wanted to secure the future of the universal
postal service: that they should tackle Royal Mail’s historic
pension deficit; that responsibility for postal regulation should
transfer from Postcomm to Ofcom; and that Royal Mail should have access
to private capital to support its ongoing modernisation. The previous
Government accepted those recommendations in full, but their Bill was
subsequently dropped owing to market
conditions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090223000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0002.htm#13090223000007">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T17:49:58"></hs_TimeCode>

recommendations. As the House will be aware, we have now relieved Royal
Mail of its historic pension deficit—I am glad that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T17:51:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North Ayrshire and Arran was able to welcome that move—and
established a new regulatory regime under Ofcom, with stronger powers
to protect the universal service. The third and final recommendation,
to give Royal Mail future access to private capital, is now being
progressed through the planned sale of shares in the company. That is a
crucial element of the Hooper package. It will be positive for Royal
Mail as a business, enabling it to respond to the changing needs and
demands of postal users now and in the future. Most important, it will
help secure a sustainable universal postal service in the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090223000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0002.htm#13090223000008"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T17:52:22"></hs_TimeCode>Many
Members have rightly mentioned that the universal postal service is
crucial to the UK’s economy and social fabric, particularly in
rural communities, and the coalition Government recognise that. That is
why the overarching objective of our postal market reforms is to secure

six-days-a-week service at uniform, affordable prices for everyone in

references have been made to whether that is a sufficient service or a
minimum one, so I thought that it would be helpful to state what it
actually means and what is set down in the legislation, which will
continue to apply in the event of Royal Mail being sold:
six-days-a-week delivery to the home or premises of every individual in
the UK; six-days-a-week collection from every access point—post
boxes and post offices—in the UK; a uniform, affordable tariff
across the UK; the provision of a registered items service at uniform
tariff; the provision of an insured items service at uniform tariff;
free postage for the blind and partially sighted; and a free service of
conveying qualifying legislative petitions. That is all set out in
legislation, so regardless of ownership Royal Mail will continue to
provide that universal service. The ownership change does

Royal Mail can continue to deliver as a successful company, and one of
the challenges it currently faces is its lack of ability to invest. The
postal service market it changing rapidly—parcel delivery, in
particular, is very much a growth area, as other hon. Member have
outlined—and we need to ensure that the Post Office has the
capacity to react to changing circumstances. That is why it needs to be

is short and I would like to ensure that I mention post office matters,
but on the issue of profitability and Royal Mail, which various hon.
Members raised, I will put into context the challenges it faces.
Competitors are investing significantly in their postal service markets
and in improving their technology to deal with that. For example,
Deutsche Post has invested more than €700 million
over the past two years alone in its mail facilities and infrastructure
and is focusing on another €750 million of investment
by 2014. That is the type of investment that Royal Mail, in its market,
ought to be looking at and that others in similar markets are looking
at. That is why accessing private capital will be so
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090223000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0002.htm#13090223000015">The
debate has also covered the post office network. I think it is
important to point out clearly that Post Office Ltd is not for sale; as
of 2012 it is formally separate from the Royal Mail Group and remains
wholly owned by the Government. Issues of Government contracts have
been raised. I point out to hon. Members that Post Office Ltd has won
10 of the 10 Government contracts it has bid for since 2010, and it has

concerns in all parts of the United Kingdom about the implications
should they decide to proceed with the privatisation of Royal Mail over

that we might be revisiting this issue very soon.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T18:01:20"></hs_TimeCode> hope that the

her. He was found guilty of careless driving, fined £2,700 and
banned from driving for just eight months. I therefore welcome the
review by the Ministry of Justice of the all too often derisory
sentences that are handed down to drivers when cyclists are killed or
injured. We also need a comprehensive review of the justice system,

the benefits of cycling to the economy and the huge savings it could
bring to the NHS, there could be huge benefits in the long run.
Cyclists are fitter and healthier than the population as a whole and
less of a demand on the NHS, so will the Minister say why the
Department of Health, which has a budget of £1 billion, last
week committed just £1 million to cycling over the next two
years? Making cycling safer in local residential streets would also
help. That is why our report calls for lower speed limits in urban
areas. The campaign by <I>The Times</I> calls for 20 mph to be the

arguments and the benefits. For instance, problems with obesity are
currently costing the NHS around £5 billion a year. Even if
cycling does not necessarily make people skinny—I am speaking
from personal experience—it is better to be fit and a little bit
flabby than not fit and a little bit flabby. However, this is not just
about the physical health benefits; it is also about mental health
benefits and the effects that have been shown on brain ageing among
people who manage to keep fit. The health economic assessment tool, or
HEAT, which is adopted by the World Health Organisation, shows a
£4 benefit for every £1 spent. Will the Minister say in
his response whether such an assessment has been made for, say, High
Speed 2? I cannot help thinking that we would leave a far happier, more
lasting and healthier legacy for Britain if we spent just a fraction of
what we are spending on HS2 on this issue—or possibly even on

Wollaston:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend. Rural speed limits are
important. In fact, the introduction of networks of 40 mph speed limits
on rural roads had a great benefit in Holland. There is a lot of
evidence to support their use, but this is about money. I welcome the
£10 a head in the eight cities that will benefit and the
spending in, for example, the Dartmoor national park in my part of the
world, but that is not what the report called for. Our report called
for £10 a head nationally and for us to think of the

achieve.</hs_Para>

this is also about speed, as my hon. Friend pointed out. Let us look at
the benefits we would see if we had 20 mph speed limits in urban areas.
Too often, highways departments look at accident data before making
decisions about speed limits. However, we all know that parents will
not let their children cycle in the first place if they do not feel
they are safe, and the perception of safety is strongly linked to the
speed at which the traffic is travelling. We should look at speed
limits across the board. I recently visited Falcon Park in Torbay,
which is a park home development with many elderly residents who cannot
walk down the road, let alone cross it, because of high-speed traffic.
In any other residential area, the speed limit would have been reduced
to 30 mph.</hs_Para>

is not only about 20 mph limits in towns and cities on a network of
roads; it is about reducing speed across the board and assessing our
priorities. Whom do we prioritise? Are we prioritising vulnerable road
users like pedestrians and cyclists, or are we prioritising the
motorist and speed? We need to change our priorities completely to
achieve that. It does not take a great deal of money to reduce speed
limits—everyone recognises that there is a financial
imperative—but the issue is not just reducing the speed limit,
but enforcing it. We heard shocking evidence in our inquiry about a
level of complacency towards enforcement. What discussions have taken
place across Departments to ensure that welcome changes in the issuing
of fixed penalty notices for careless driving will be extended to
penalising people who breach speed limits directly? It is immediate
consequences that will drive

South Devon Railway has an opportunity to create a link that would join
up the national cycle network and, in so doing, increase the footfall

they should wear it, but they should not be put off if they do not.
Most important, they should not feel that they need special kit.

authority in Exeter that it should apply to the then Labour Government
to be one of their cycle demonstration towns, I was told, “You
won’t get anyone cycling here, it’s too hilly.”

We need more than a Prime Minister who cycles to work for a photo

it clear that cycling is a priority across Government. It is cheap, and
it will save lives, improve health and boost productivity. It will also

would describe myself as an irregular but enthusiastic cyclist with a
tendency to go for the long cycles rather than the daily commute. Prior
to the general election of 2010, I made a pledge to my local
constituents that if I were elected, I would cycle from my constituency
to London. After being elected, the very first question I received from
a reporter was, “And when do you intend to cycle to
London?” I finally carried out that cycle, and this year I took
an even longer cycling trip from Land’s End to John O’
Groats. On both those trips, the experience was very good. I got a bit
fitter, lost a little weight and found it to be a great social
activity, doing it with friends. It is a great way to see the diversity
of our own country and, indeed, to raise a little money for charity

want to make two serious observations coming out of those two cycle
trips. First, there were potholes everywhere, and it would be helpful
if local governments

appreciate that many Members will speak about the report, its views and
its recommendations, but I want to make two specific observations and
suggestions, both of which will, I suspect, be highly controversial.
First, cyclists must take responsibility for their own safety. We must
ride our bikes sensibly and appropriately. It is vital for cyclists to
respect other road users, especially cars and lorries, as well as
pedestrians and other cyclists. I also believe that we cyclists should
wear a helmet.</hs_Para>

that last point, I would go further. Some have campaigned to make it
compulsory for children to wear helmets. I believe that that should be
extended to everyone: everyone who uses a bike should use a helmet. If
adults are seen to wear helmets, that will encourage children to do so,
but I see no reason why that should not be made compulsory in the
interests of safety. I appreciate that there are counter-arguments and
that some take the view that it would reduce the number of people
taking up cycling. I am of the view that safety is important and that,
gradually, the opposition to wearing helmets would be overcome as
people get used to the idea. We have all got used to wearing safety
belts in cars and helmets on
motorbikes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T19:22:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

that it would be a good idea to encourage training for children in
schools to encourage cycle riding and explain how best to be safe on
the roads? Even if the children were not to go on to cycle or drive
cars themselves, it would still teach about the risks of poor or
dangerous cycling while cars are on the road. Would my hon. Friend

second point, which I think will be seen as equally controversial, is
that I am not convinced by the arguments about speed limits,
enforcement or the education of drivers. Yes, it may be a laudable aim,
but I question whether enough drivers would pay attention to those
speed limits in practice, which would be necessary to make cycling a
much safer occupation or leisure activity. I fully accept that many
drivers are responsible and take care when cyclists are around. They
drive appropriately and safely, keeping their distance, slowing down,
giving cyclists a wide berth and so forth. On my cycling trips, I noted
many car drivers who did precisely that, taking their time and being
patient with cyclists. Equally, however, a large number of drivers
think cyclists are a nuisance on the road, so they drive too close or
too fast and endanger cyclists. From my experience, that is far more
common than we would like to think.</hs_Para>

believe that there should be a simple change in the law. In the event
of an accident, there should be a presumption in favour of the cyclist
over the driver. Clearly, any driver of a car has the right to rebut
such a claim and we have to accept that there are irresponsible
cyclists who take inappropriate care and attention when they cycle.
However, I believe that such a change in the law would mean that car
drivers, lorry drivers and other motorists would take far greater care
and would make every effort to keep their distance from 
<?notus-xml column=91?>a cyclist. All of a sudden, cyclists would become road users of whom
motorists would have to be very careful and wary, as their insurance
claims could be affected and there would be the potential for
criminality. Such a presumption is, in fact, accepted in some European
countries, and I see no reason why it could not be introduced in this
country.</hs_Para>

we want to reduce the number of accidents, we need to alter the
approach that many drivers have to cyclists. We have to get to the
stage where cycling is seen as safe, and I believe that the only way to
do that is to make car drivers far more aware of the dangers of
hitting, affecting or coming into contact with cyclists. If we want to
make cycling safe and therefore encourage others to start cycling, we
have to change the relationship between the driver and the cyclist.
With those two simple changes to the law, we could effectively do that;
cyclists would be encouraged to cycle safely by wearing a helmet, and
they would be given confidence in the fact that drivers would be taking
far more care when they pass them on the
road<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T19:25:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090226000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090226000029">I

are made by bike, and to persuade people to use their bikes more
regularly. That makes me part of the target market. Unlike my hon.
Friend the Member for Carlisle (John Stevenson), I am not a regular
cyclist. I would describe myself as a fair-weather cyclist who cycles
infrequently on country lanes for the purpose of exercise or
enjoyment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090226000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090226000042"><Member ContinuationText="Bob Stewart" PimsId="5537" UID="13090226000103" xid="1011" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090226000103"><B>Bob

inspiration that led me to use my bicycle more came during the recess.
A couple of weeks ago, on a Thursday, I read an article in <I>The Times
</I>by Dame Kelly Holmes, encouraging Members of Parliament to ride our
bikes before participating in the debate. I had intended to drive the
six miles or so from my home to the constituency office, but that day I
decided to cycle. I should add that the weather was very good during
August, and that the sunshine made my decision a great deal
easier.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090226000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090226000045">I
have a number of observations to make following that experience.
Travelling down Dunchurch road in Rugby in a cycle lane, I noticed that
other cyclists were still on the road. I asked myself why those guys
were still on the road when I was going down the cycle lane, which is
half on the footpath. Then I realised that there were “Give
way” lines on the side roads, and that I was having to give way
to the cars that were coming out of them. Had I been on the road, I
would not have had that problem. The other cyclists were making much
faster progress than I was. Perhaps the Minister will explain why cars
coming out of a side road have priority over the cyclists on a cycle
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090226000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090226000046"><Member ContinuationText="Kate Green" PimsId="5566" UID="13090226000105" xid="1207" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090226000105"><B>Kate

encountered another problem on that occasion. I had some constituency
duties to fulfil. It was a warm day, and it occurred to me that I ought
to carry an extra shirt, so I put one in a rucksack which I carried on
my back. I still arrived soaked in sweat, not looking much like a
Member of Parliament. I tweeted about the experience and received some
useful advice on Twitter, namely that I should put some panniers on my
bike so that I need not stick a rucksack on my back which would make my
back wet. I now know that if I am to use my bike regularly, I shall
need to invest in some panniers.</hs_Para>

that, in many instances, the cycle way was in pretty poor condition,
with very unclear markings. It had probably been constructed three or
four years earlier. Local authorities need to invest in ensuring that
the markings on cycle ways are clear. On more than one occasion,
overgrown trees rendered the cycle way useless and forced me out on to

was fast traffic to my right, and as I progressed along to the slip
road, to my left, coming up on the inside. Fortunately it was a quiet
day, but I should hate to be on that road in different circumstances.
Provision should be made for cyclists on slip roads off dual

has been some discussion today about the use of helmets. I made my
decision about whether to wear one when I hired a bike in the Lake

be more than happy not to bother with a helmet, he said “Sir,

make progress towards achieving the aims of this debate, the targets
should be not people making my journey of six miles or so, but people
making journeys of up to three miles in towns such as the one that I

to travel from a suburb such as Hillmorton or Bilton to the centre of
Rugby—a journey of no more than a couple of yards—to get
into their cars. Those are the people whom the cycling campaign needs
to target. We have already heard about the health and cost benefits
that accrue to those who decide to cycle, and the benefits to the
environment if more people do so more
generally.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090226000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090226000056">Planning
has also been mentioned. Rugby borough council has launched a green
travel plan. During the recess, I visited a business that had been
forced by the plan to include a cycle shed in the development that it
had built recently, but regrettably there was not a single bike in it.
It is clear that the policies need to be “joined
up”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090226000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090226000057">There
are, however, some fantastic cycle ways in my constituency. Last
Thursday, the mayor officially reopened a 173-year-old railway viaduct
that had previously been derelict. It had been 60 years since trains
last travelled on the route. It was opened by Sustrans, using a grant
from the Big Lottery Fund, as a new cycle way linking 
<?notus-xml column=95?>northern parts of the town to the railway station
and town centre. That is a fantastic initiative that supports
Rugby’s regeneration strategy, and I am sure that the route will
be used by many more
cyclists.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090226000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090226000058">We
have heard about cyclists sharing their road space with other users,
and in particular about the problems created by heavy goods vehicles.
One Member asked whether something could be done about them. Their
impact on cyclists is taken seriously by the logistics industry and the
country. I draw the attention of hon. Members to Cemex, a company in my
constituency that ships cement around the country. At last
year’s Conservative party conference—I hope it was at
other conferences, too—Cemex parked one of its vehicles and
allowed people to get into the cab so that they could see exactly the
blind spot that lorry drivers suffer from when driving. I hope that
more and more logistics companies will do precisely that; another one
did it at a fête I attended.</hs_Para>

he has done to raise the issue of cycling in our national life. In
these debates it is easy to get a sense that people are paying lip
service to cycling, but the profound and cultural change we need in
this country has not yet happened and now has to arrive. It is
important that we recognise that the debate about cycling, certainly
here in London, is being had against the backdrop of people having to
wrestle with issues of not only quality of life, but the cost of
living—petrol prices, transport costs, and rises in bus and tube
fares. Transport costs beyond London mean that people want cycling to
be a serious option.</hs_Para>

many of the reasons hon. Members have raised, and for some that I will
touch on, cycling does not feel like a realistic option. I think that
hon. Members want the Government to get behind the vision behind this
report to make it one. We need long-term commitments and aims, not
simply the short-term and headline-grabbing initiatives we have had in
the past. The target of a 10% modal share for cycling by 2025 is good,
but that will not happen by itself. Shockingly, just 6% of people in
Britain cycle for more than 30 minutes once a week and only 2% use a

Members will recall that, sadly, the Labour party lost the election in
2010. It has been said about Ministers, “You know you’re
no longer a Minister when you get into the back of a car and it does
not start.” I found myself in that situation, but at that point,
when I was 30-whatever, I was not a driver. When I hit 40, I
decided that I would learn to drive and I could be found driving up
Barnet high road trying to do so. On my third attempt, I recently got
my driving licence—[<SmallCaps>Hon. Members:</SmallCaps>
“Hear, hear.] But I hate driving, and I have not really been

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T19:40:20"></hs_TimeCode> like doing is
cycling. I, too, took my family to Holland this summer on a cycling

<?notus-xml column=96?>80 km in 10 days. I do not think I could do that in this

because I simply would not feel secure enough about the safety of a
five-year-old and a seven-year-old on their bikes on the cycleways.

half of all car journeys made in London are fewer than 2 miles long.
That is an easily bikeable distance, so we have to ask why so many
people are not choosing to bike. As the hon. Lady indicated, in London
alone more than 500 cyclists were seriously injured in just one year,
which is a rise of 22% on the previous year’s figure. It is
right that the current Mayor has done much to encourage cycling in
London, and he should be congratulated on getting behind cycling. His
appointment of a cycling tsar has also been very important, but targets
for reducing cycle casualties have been consistently missed. The number
of cycling casualties in London has increased every year since 2008,
which is only partly explained by the cycling participation rates.
Nationally, 122 cyclists were killed on British roads last year. So
road accidents are still proportionately involving cycling, despite the
incidence of other road accidents falling. That issue has to be
addressed and it can be done only if we challenge the culture of
cycling and do not have a

has said he wants and that I suspect he will say he wants, as it feels
a long way off for those of us who want cycling to get up to where it
needs to be. Investment and participation campaigns are crucial, but
they will go only so far. Ministers must treat British roads as

Friend the Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T19:49:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Dudley North (Ian Austin). A number of colleagues who have been
here much longer than I have mentioned how well attended this debate
is. Since then, about 15 or 20 hon. Members have left the Chamber and
will be back later. Despite that, seeing the number of people still in
the Chamber, I would guess that it is probably double the number of
Members who would have attended only five years ago and probably triple
the number who would have attended 10 years ago. That shows the
enormous strides that have been made in the cycling debate over the
past few years. I support that agenda for a number of key
reasons.</hs_Para>

first is the business case. In Eastbourne, we have a strong cycling
group called Bespoke, which is tremendously enthused and involved in
driving the cycling agenda in the town. I support that. Eastbourne is a
wonderful seaside town that has bucked the economic trend over the past
few years, with unemployment going down, apprenticeships going up and
regeneration in the town centre through £70 million of private
spend. I am keen to drive that agenda using cycling, because, like many
other parts of the UK and along its coastline, Eastbourne is a lovely
place for a cycling holiday.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T19:50:42"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Tottenham mentioned going to Holland with his family and I
went there myself only a few months ago. He is right that the level of
cycling and the safety there are astounding, because, obviously, it has
been part of the culture for 40 years. We are catching up, but I am
convinced that as we drive the cycling agenda in towns such as
Eastbourne—getting more families and tourists in as we improve
the cycle paths—it will make a substantial difference to their
economic turnover.</hs_Para>

we have gross cycling product of about £2.9 billion and 3.7
million bikes are sold in the UK, a 28% increase on last year. Some
23,000 people are employed directly in cycling in the UK. Cycling
offers a major and substantial benefit to UK plc, but that is just 
<?notus-xml column=98?>the tip of the iceberg. The number of people in the House today and the
report demonstrate that the UK is going in the right direction on the
cycling agenda in a range of areas, including health, business and
carbon emissions. We have a way to go but the starting gun has

Member for Exeter (Mr Bradshaw) made a strong and valid point about the
fact that the previous Government invested a lot of time and money in
cycling and they deserve a lot of the credit for pushing the agenda.
The difference is that my Government inherited an economic crisis that
means that challenging decisions must be taken, but I encourage the
coalition to focus on this report, which contains a lot of good
recommendations that would not cost a lot of money. I am confident that
proper investment in the recommendations put together by the all-party
group would offer a substantial economic benefit and help to transform
the lives of many people in the UK who, like me, should not wait 40
years to get back on a bike.</hs_Para>

are challenges. That takes us back to the question of Holland versus
the UK. Holland has a different infrastructure. The UK is an old
country that has not been designed for cycles so I appreciate the
challenges faced by any Government. I know that the Minister
responsible for this issue, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport,
my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)—he is a
neighbour of mine—has been passionate about cycling
and bikes for as long as I have known him, which is 11 years. There is
no stronger champion of cycling in the Government. When he winds up, I
look forward to hearing what further initiatives the Government will
introduce to keep things moving in the right direction and to build on
the momentum that has been established over the past 15 years so that
cycling really takes off. There are more people in the Chamber than I
have ever seen at a Backbench business debate and that demonstrates not
just the strength of feeling in the country but that the time has come
for political leadership. I look forward to hearing the
Government’s
response.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-02?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_02_PT_1/F7A50DE6A7DCF902FEFA6C0864FE3083374056C8" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="2 September 2013">Monday

hon. Members have spoken of the benefits of cycling to
individuals, to children, to society, to cities and to the environment.
At the end of July, Newcastle Gateshead hosted its first sky ride. It
was an amazing success, with 7,800 people attending, and shows just how
many people in Newcastle and Gateshead want to get on their bikes if
they can feel safe doing so.

Newcastle, we are lucky to have strong cross-party political leadership
on cycling. We have an enthusiastic cycling champion, Councillor Marion
Talbot, who chairs our cycling forum, which brings together the many
different voices for cycling in our city. There is, however, a lack of
such strong political leadership at a national level. The
abolition of Cycling England, set up under the previous Labour
Government, means that there is now also no dedicated pot of money and,
equally, no focal point for cycling. We have ad hoc announcements and
re-announcements, and then repackaged re-announcements. When separate
pots of money are released seemingly at random for cycling and
infrastructure, it makes it difficult for local authorities like
Newcastle to plan cycling development. The abolition of Cycling England
means that there is no obvious means for councils to share ideas and
the great best practice we have heard about today other than through
the mysterious cycle stakeholder forum, which is yet to be mentioned

Comparisons are odious, but sometimes they are essential. Everyone in

report notes that successfully increasing cycling in many towns
requires not just leadership and political will but investment. The
report notes the relative underfunding per head for British cycling,
which many hon. Members have spoken about today, but the Department for

not deal with long-term funding. On most other issues, the buck was

Britain cycling does and should fall to councils, there is plenty that
the Government can do to support them. Newcastle is working hard to
make the city’s road cycle-friendly and installing better
cycling infrastructure. It is one of the leading local authorities on

some milk and a loaf of bread. Some 66% of all trips made in Britain
are less than five miles. However, if one factors in the process of

that it was too dangerous for them to cycle on the roads, whereas the
figure for non-cyclists was 65%. It is also worth noting that there is
a significant gender divide regarding cycling safety because 60% of
women said that it was too dangerous compared with 53% of men. I am
therefore proud to be involved in Northwich Breeze rides, which are

because I had rushed here from one of my two bicycle visits today so

make the point because I have been cycling to Parliament and to

Members have observed, in that period there has been a huge growth in
the number of people who cycle—not just the number of people
working in the Palace of Westminster but the number of people in
general on the roads of London. That increase has not just
happened—it occurred as a result of public policy 
<?notus-xml column=103?>and public spending. That is the first thing that I
would say to the Minister: we need an increase in Government spending
to promote cycling and make the roads safer for cycling, but it needs
to be long-term and predictable funding, which is why I particularly
welcome the proposal that there should be spending by his Department on
cycling measures at the rate of £10 per capita.</hs_Para>

one notices me driving round. However, when I am cycling round my

relatively high level—at the beginning of the period to 12.5%.
In fact, it increased the use of cycling by twice the target—by

beginning of the period to 13.2%. Although there was no national survey
of the number of people who commute to work by cycle, looking at the
big employers in York, the increase in that period ranged from 17% to
35%. Achieving an increase depends on whether employers provide
incentives such as safe cycle parking, cycle workshops where people can
repair punctures for instance, and cycle loan schemes. The House could
do a lot more for the people who work here, and I hope that that is

the fact that I cycle to work in London. I can cycle from Fulham, where
I live, to King’s Cross, pretty much all on a cycleway. It is
much quicker than going by car. In Northumberland, I live near
Stamfordham, where we see more bicycles than cars travelling around and
about. There is no question but that the Northumberland economy depends
to a large degree on cycling tourism and the economic benefit that it
brings. I therefore support the motion wholeheartedly, but while cities
such as Newcastle have benefited from over £5 million, the
benefit to some rural areas, whether Northumberland or other counties,
is significantly less. We need equality of funding across all parts of
the country so that we may all benefit, rather than simply the towns

who are students of the film industry will hark back to the comment,
“If you build it, they will come.” That is the case in
relation to cycling. It is easy for too many civil servants, Ministers
of all types, local authorities, county and parish councils to think
that investment in cycling is not worth the money, the effort, the
criticism by drivers and pedestrians and the sheer difficulty of
persuading people to get out of their beloved vehicles. However, if we
build the type of facilities that we all require in our local areas,
cycling improves. We need only look at the success of places such as
Seville, as eloquently set out in the report, where between 2007 and
2010, cycling went up from 6,000 journeys to 60,000 journeys. We need
only look at the changes in New York or Holland, sponsored as we are by

with 2% in this country. That is patently the result of investment,

champions—not just the local larger champion of a county, but
individual parish and county councillors who could make a difference
locally. If we can start doing that and start working with health and
wellbeing boards and the like, there is great potential to turn the

the Member for York Central (Hugh Bayley) made the point that if we are
to increase cycle percentages, the starting point will vary from place
to place. Some places already have a very high percentage, but others
have a much lower percentage. I am pleased to say that Edinburgh has a
good record of encouraging cycling over the years. In our case 10% of
journeys to work are now undertaken by bike, whereas 10 years ago the
figure was only 3%, so we have seen a 300% increase, which shows what
can be done when there is consistent political commitment and a
spending commitment from the local authority, which has certainly been
the case in
Edinburgh<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000049"><Member ContinuationText="Ian Murray" PimsId="5730" UID="13090229000205" xid="1056" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000205"><B>Ian

the increase in cycling in Edinburgh. Will he join me in paying tribute
to Spokes, the Edinburgh cycling charity, which has done so much to
help that increase, and also the volunteers who organised Pedal on
Parliament 1 and 2? There were 4,000 cyclists at the Scottish

took part on a more conventional bike in that Pedal on Parliament. The
point that my hon. Friend makes is a good one. One reason we have seen
an increase in Edinburgh in the percentage of journeys undertaken by
bike has been the political commitment 
<?notus-xml column=106?>over many years—political commitment in which, I am pleased to
say, the Labour party over the decades has taken the lead, and which,
to be fair, is now widely shared across the political parties in
Edinburgh, just as it is in the Chamber today.</hs_Para>

campaign, first in the form of Spokes, the Lothian cycle campaign, of
which I have been a member for many years. That campaign has
consistently and in a well-informed way put pressure on local
government and central Government to deliver both cycle spending and
the integration of policies in wider planning and transport activity,
to give cycling a higher profile. We have also seen the very successful
Pedal on Parliament initiative, which started in 2012 with a couple of
thousand people lobbying the Scottish Parliament at the end of a cycle
ride, and which in May this year ended up with 4,000 people in a very
impressive lobby of the Scottish

Lazarowicz:</Member></B> Absolutely. My hon. Friend points to the
commitment of Edinburgh council not just to maintain a 5% level of all
transport spend, both revenue and capital, on cycling but to increase
it year on year by 1%, which is a major commitment. In a briefing to
some of us earlier, Chris Boardman said that it was the first city in
the UK to make that commitment. That contrasts with the poor record of
the SNP Scottish Government in supporting cycling. It is interesting
that the success of the Pedal on Parliament campaign in Edinburgh has
had the effect of shaming the Scottish Government into putting more
money into cycling. That is a tribute to such campaigning work, which
is so important at the grass
roots<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T20:24:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T20:24:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000054">I
do not want to make jibes at other political parties in what has
otherwise been a non-partisan debate, even if those parties are not
represented in the Chamber today. In Edinburgh we have now seen a
cross-party consensus on cycling policies. Although it is true that our
Labour colleagues on the council made a commitment to increase the
spending on cycling year on year, it is being done now with the support
of the minority party in the Edinburgh council coalition, the Scottish
National party. So let us hope that the SNP at Scottish Government
level will follow the example of its colleagues on Edinburgh

has been mentioned a few times in the debate, some of those who
organised the Pedal on Parliament campaign to lobby the Scottish
Parliament had personal experience of death and serious injury to
cyclists on our roads. The increase in deaths and serious injuries to
cyclists in England over the past five years has been replicated in
Scotland. We have seen a similar increase over the past five years. Let
us not forget that as well as 
<?notus-xml column=107?>being in every case a personal tragedy for the families and friends of
those involved, every cycling death or serious injury has the effect of
discouraging people who might otherwise come back to cycling, because
they do not realise the wider relative or absolute safety of cycling

with as a priority. It can be done quite easily now with current

of my constituency. Many people cycle to work and for pleasure, and
from quite a wide demographic range, although I agree about the need to
widen it, which will set up a virtuous circle. As an occasional
cyclist, I know that it can be very off-putting to go into a cycling
shop with an old bike and hear three young men in Lycra leaning against
the counter saying, “Poor old girl”—I am never

providing an area for cyclists to wait in front of traffic when the
lights are red, making them more easily visible to motorists and giving
them the space to move off when the lights turn green. We are also

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T20:34:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Dudley North (Ian Austin) on their leadership and drive
on this issue. This has been a refreshing debate. I am delighted to
continue my support for safety for cyclists, inspired, as were many
other Members of the House, by <I>The Times</I>’ “Cities
fit for cycling” campaign. Cycling has many advantages:
increasing health, providing a fitter population and work force; saving
energy; reducing the degradation of road surfaces; reducing congestion
and air quality; and, last but not least, it is also jolly good
fun<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T20:35:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000076">It
is great to speak today on what could be the cusp of a big change in
Britain to transform life and the experience of roads for future
generations—to get Britain cycling not just in individual
pockets of the country and to have a holistic vision. I congratulate
the all-party cycling group on its excellent report, which advocates
the dream of having 10% of all journeys made by bike by 2025. I am glad
that it does not mince its words on the need for leadership to start
with politicians because we, as politicians, have to think long term in
supporting cyclists with a shared commitment across Whitehall,
councils, schools, employers, and public transport
providers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000077"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T20:36:20"></hs_TimeCode>I
pay tribute to Hounslow Cycling, particularly to Tim Harris and Brian
Smith, who have been strong advocates and campaigners for improved
facilities for cyclists. Their excellent strapline is “Looking
for a mini-Holland in Hounslow”. Together with Hounslow council
they have an exciting longer-term vision for safer cycling,
but they have raised some issues that I would like to share with the
House. First, there is funding. 
<?notus-xml column=110?>The Government’s response to “Get Britain
Cycling” does not provide any assurance of funding for cycling
infrastructure in future. It is a shame that when Ministers recently
set out annual budgets for road and rail investment for the next eight
years they failed to do so for cycling infrastructure.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090229000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000078">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T20:37:29"></hs_TimeCode>,
20-mph speed limits should be adopted on residential roads as standard.
Hounslow Cycling makes the very effective point that we should not have
to fight campaigns in each neighbourhood to get safe speed limits and
good-quality cycle lanes and design standards governing how roads are
built. This should not be done for cyclists; it needs to be done with
cyclists, whose input at the design stage can have a real impact on the
quality of the result. We know that 20-mph speed limits can make a big
difference. In 2009 the <I>British Medical Journal</I> published a
review of road casualties in London between 1986 and 2006 having found
that 20-mph zones reduced casualties by over
40%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000079"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T20:37:33"></hs_TimeCode>Thirdly,
it is important to have a national cycling champion—a proposal
that has not been accepted so far. Perhaps the Minister might want to
say whether that is still the case. Fourthly, we must ensure that where
we have rules they are effectively enforced. Some of the behavioural
changes that we need, such as cyclists not going through red lights,
must be looked at in the interests of their safety as well as that of
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T20:38:06"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T20:38:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000080">Cycling
has the potential to be a huge British success story. We can see many
more Olympic gold medallists coming through if we encourage good
behaviours, start them young, and make sure that everyone feels they

hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) on securing this
debate through the Backbench Business Committee. I thank him for
inviting me to serve on the panel. I suspect that I ended up doing so
for one simple reason—that I am a reluctant cyclist. Although I
occasionally cycle, the reason I am reluctant is that I do not think it
is a particularly safe activity. I fully support <I>The
Times</I>’ “Cities fit for cycling” campaign
following the case of Mary Bowers, who is still in a coma. I also fully
support the implementation of the targets that the Government need to
make sure that there is strong political leadership at local and
national level and that cycling is
safe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000082"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T20:39:28"></hs_TimeCode>Over
the recess I spoke to a number of people in my Plymouth, Sutton and
Devonport constituency. Anne-Marie Clark, who rides with the Plymouth
Yogis, suggested that the Government should make it compulsory for
people to wear helmets. She was appalled that hirers of Boris bikes are
not offered helmets. The Mayor of London may want to look at
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T20:40:05"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T20:40:03"></hs_TimeCode>.
She also highlighted Plymouth’s notorious potholes, and I am
delighted that the Government and the council are working together to
fix them. Anyone who lives in my constituency who wants to have a

chairman of Plymouth’s cycling campaign, Stuart Mee, said that
one of the biggest impediments to getting on two wheels is the traffic.
He said that all too often cycle routes stop at junctions and do not
take cyclists to 
<?notus-xml column=111?>where they want to go. In Plymouth some routes end abruptly at difficult
junctions. He added that cycling can make Plymouth healthier. Several
cyclists who watched me do a little bit of cycling through the streets
of Plymouth during the sky ride picked up on my comments during the
last cycling debate, when I made it clear that if cycling were made
safer and I took it up I could put into effect the title of Tom
Vernon’s wonderful, well-known radio programme, “Fat Man

represent a city that has hills, which can make cycling a bit of a
challenge, certainly for those of us who are recreational cyclists.
Even in Sheffield, however, cycling rates have doubled over the past
eight to 10 years, but we have a long way to go compared
with—for a change, I will not mention Holland—hilly
Helsingborg in Sweden: 26% of daily commutes into its city centre are

Sheffield.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000089">Having<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T20:43:42"></hs_TimeCode>
said I would not mention the Netherlands, I will do so briefly,
although I hesitate to do so. I spent a few days in Tilberg, a fairly
ordinary city in central Netherlands, last year. I was struck by the
fascinating consequence of the impact of a planning approach that gives
as much focus to the needs of bikes as to those of cars. It provides a
contrast to the picture of British cycling painted earlier by

the Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick). In Tilberg I saw
a town in which elderly couples, families and young people all saw
bikes as the preferred form of transport for commuting, shopping or an
evening out. It was a transformational

the “Get Britain Cycling” report highlights, we need to
do a number of things to transform the situation in the UK. Clearly,
one is funding. That means not 
<?notus-xml column=112?>simply providing more funding, but making sure that the billions we
spend on our roads have funds earmarked within them for cycling and
meeting the needs of cyclists. That will be an important step towards
achievements similar to those of the
Dutch.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000091">When
I invited comments from my constituents on today’s debate, I got
a huge response. There were a number of common themes. They pressed for
more segregated cycle lanes and for more available and consistent cycle
lanes that are not used for parking for large parts of the day and that
do not disappear on the approach to difficult junctions or hazardous
roundabouts. They argued for road infrastructure to be better designed
and for speed bumps that do not have gaps at the side. They argued
against routes that follow illogical directions. They pushed for the
maintenance of cycle routes with regard not only to their quality, but
to their visibility to cyclists and motorists. They argued not only for
safe routes to schools, public buildings and places of work, but for
more secure places for people to leave their cycles when they get
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000092">I
would like a response from the Minister on one specific point when he
winds up: the role of cycling within an integrated approach to
transport. I am pleased that south Yorkshire has received funding from
the Government for a tram-train pilot, which will see the introduction
of a continental model with vehicles that run on both tram and rail
tracks. That is a significant development for us and a potential model
for the rest of the country. It is important that we get it right. Part
of that is ensuring that cyclists are able to take their bikes on to
the tram-trains so that both modes of transport can be used on a
journey. I have raised that issue with the South Yorkshire passenger
transport executive because decisions need to be taken now at the stage
of system design. The Department is also a key stakeholder, so I ask
the Minister to join me by confirming in his closing remarks that he
will seek to ensure that bikes can be carried on to tram-trains in that
important

Reynolds</B> (Stalybridge and Hyde) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I thank you,
Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to speak in this debate on a topic that
is important to me and a great many of my constituents, and in the
curtailed time available I will say something about the need to make
cycling a mainstream transport option and address the future funding of
cycling.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090229000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000103">Cyclists in
my constituency have made it clear that they feel cycling, which they
are passionate about, has not been taken seriously enough by policy
makers. However, I think they will genuinely appreciate the 
<?notus-xml column=114?>turnout and commitment shown in this debate, which is a sign that the
report has already had some impact. When my constituents contacted me
they cited simple mistakes and missed opportunities in public policy
and planning that have held back cycling and prevented the growth of
its popularity. It is difficult to disagree with that sentiment, as the
“Get Britain Cycling” report highlighted. Such neglect
has prevented cycling from becoming as popular as it might have been,
and that is often used as justification for the lack of attention
cycling policy receives. As we have heard, cycling undoubtedly brings
significant health and environmental benefits, but without political
leadership at national and local level it is hard to see how it can
move from being a mere afterthought to an acknowledged major means of
transportation.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090229000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000104">Having
listened to the whole debate, it is important to acknowledge that
things are not as good as they need to be. A lot of Members have
highlighted great practice in their areas, but if we give the
impression that we are satisfied with the status quo, that would be
wrong. To get things right, the Government, local authorities and
transport bodies must ensure that the needs of cyclists are properly
taken into account. For the benefit of any of my constituents reading
this speech, I acknowledge that my local authority has not always met
expectations in that regard, but I will say, if I can, how we are
trying to correct that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090229000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000105">The
“Get Britain Cycling” report offers a number of practical
solutions to address those problems. One is the cross-departmental
cycling action plan. That sounds as if it comes straight from
“Yes Minister”, but the goal of ensuring that cycling is
embodied at top levels of strategic planning and the political agenda
is the right one. Taking things a step further, local and central
Government have appointed lead politicians for cycling, which again
must be a good thing. For example, if we look at the commitment shown
to cycling in London on a cross-party basis over many years, we see
what can be achieved with a strong strategic plan coupled with the
political will to make it successful. Across my constituency and the
Greater Manchester area, I am pleased to say that action is being taken
to help get Britain cycling.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090229000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000106">As I said, I
recognise that in the past people have come to me with legitimate
complaints because they felt we have not taken advantage of our
position as a Greater Manchester borough that sits between Manchester
city centre and the Peak District national park, and we have not used
cycling fully enough to address that area’s poor public health.
Now, however, Transport for Greater Manchester, in partnership with
constituent local authorities, is implementing a bold strategy that
combines central Government funds with local money to make significant
changes. As well as looking at investment in the road network to make
cycle-friendly changes to roads and junctions, it is trying to provide
facilities specifically for the use of cyclists who wish to ditch their
car and cycle to work. Tameside council has taken the lead in that,
trying to build a cycling hub in the centre of the borough of
Ashton-under-Lyne. Once open, it will give commuting cyclists the
chance to lock up their bike, get changed and have a shower before
heading to work.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090229000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000107">Such ideas
lead to the major issue at the heart of this debate which is how we
fund and allocate money to transport projects, and the role of cycling
within that. 
<?notus-xml column=115?>To make things happen there must obviously be a
strong commitment from the Government. I welcome the money that has
been announced, although there are concerns about the loss of Cycling
England. If we are to catch up with our European neighbours—we
have heard a lot about Holland today—we must clearly move
towards that £10 per head target, as the APPG report
recommends.</hs_Para>

participate in
cycling.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000109">In
Hampshire, the bikability scheme is run by Mountbatten school in
Romsey. It gave evidence to the all-party group and has contributed to
the “Get Britain Cycling” report, which is an excellent
report containing brilliant ideas. Annually, the Hampshire schools
cycling partnership delivers in excess of 12,000 cycle courses
throughout Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton, in more than 300
schools. There is a commitment within the partnership to make cycle
training available to all, and to make both bikes and helmets available
to those who do not have them. There is a belief that cycling
is an essential life skill, and that every young person
should receive a safe grounding in cycling skills and road
use.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000110">Test
Valley borough has, for the past 16 years, run the Test valley tour, an
off-road cycling event that encourages participants from serious
cyclists down to the weekend peddler to enjoy the Hampshire
countryside. This weekend, as part of the borough’s Olympic
legacy project, a new BMX track is being opened in Valley park. There
is not only a competition-standard track, but a learner track, to
ensure that all levels of cyclist can get involved. It is important to
remember that cycling is about not just mountain and road bikes; people
can participate in a broad range of cycling. It is not just about
getting from A to B, which much of the debate has focused on; cycling
can be fun for its own
sake.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000111">It
would be wrong to suggest that all is rosy in Hampshire. The experience
of off-road cycle ways and of the conflict with road junctions is the
same as we have heard from many hon. Members. Test Valley works hard to
ensure that there is a network of off-road cycle routes, but the one
that always comes to my attention is the route running alongside the
A3057. Often, we see cyclists on the road rather than the cycleway,
which frustrates motorists. However, when I drill down with cyclists as
to what the problem is, they tell me not only that we need capital
investment to provide cycleways, but that cycleways need maintaining.
They say that the small stones they find if the cycleways are not swept
can be lethal to the thin tyres of road bikes. Indeed, the tarmac
surface of the road is often better for serious athletes wishing to
train and get up to good speeds.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=116?><hs_Para UID="13090229000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000112">There
is also conflict with the many junctions on the road way. I am thinking
in particular of Heron lane in Timsbury, where the markings are not
clear. Road users seeking to access the A3057 often meet speeding
cyclists on the cycleway who believe they have priority, when in fact
the motorist has priority. There are many near misses, which provokes
anxiety for motorist and cyclist
alike.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000113">I
am not suggesting that better signage is a panacea. In rural areas,
opting for red or—dare I say it?—blue tarmac is
incongruous, and does not fit well with the countryside. It is
important that we look for tailor-made solutions and that we are
innovative in junction improvements. There is no one-size-fits-all
solution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000114">I
should conclude with one suggestion from a cyclist, who said that we
need a similar legislative framework to that of Italy—hon.
Members will be pleased that he identified Italy rather than the
Netherlands. In Italy, the presumption is that the liability for any
accident is with the motorist and not with the
cyclist.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000115">One

confess that I am not an avid cyclist, but I freely acknowledge the
health, social and economic benefits of cycling. In fact, cycling can
become not only an economic tool in town centres, but a regeneration
tool. It can help to reduce congestion and pollution in town centres.
Those factors have already been acknowledged in the report. The health,
economic and social benefits of cycling are, as the report highlights,
well documented and range from reducing air pollution in our cities to
promoting spending in small businesses along commuter cycling routes
and improving, through exercise, the general health of our
population<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T20:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000119">There
is a growing attitudinal change among the public, who are ahead of us
in many ways in understanding the benefits of cycling and in

within Government. The Department for Transport’s response to
the report demonstrates that when it states:</hs_Para>

that statement is undoubtedly true, by presenting it as a bold opening
statement it is clear that the Department is perhaps trying to pass the
buck. Perhaps the Minister, in his closing remarks, will assuage my

Democrats have long recognised the positive benefits of cycling. It
assists in tackling road congestion, reducing air pollution and
supporting our economy. Not only is it a fast, cheap and green mode of
transport, it promotes a healthier lifestyle too. It is a sobering fact
that only 2% of journeys in the UK are made by bicycle. Our European
neighbours put us to shame in this regard. It is also important to note
that approximately half of all journeys made by car are only a few
miles. Surely we can encourage people to make some of those journeys by
bike. I am pleased that targets are included in the motion, and I hope
that the Government adopt
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000127">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T21:04:11"></hs_TimeCode>

hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker), the Minister for

that he has continued that attitude in government and done a good job
supporting cycling. For example, last March the Department for

Government are encouraging people to combine different methods of
transport in their journeys and increase the number of journeys made by
bicycle. In April, my hon. Friend the Minister for cycling announced

this evening we are not just talking about recreational facilities; we

people to go by bike wherever they need to go—whether to work or
to the shops, the doctor’s, the leisure centre or the cinema,
and so forth. That means making routes everywhere safer and more
pleasant for cyclists. We need proper investment—at least
£10 a head, as the report suggests—to ensure the
infrastructure. We need the political will to prioritise spending on
cycling. We need joined-up thinking across Departments. We
need thinking at the initial stages of planning for any

some of our rural roads. How do we get better visibility? How do we
warn that there are cyclists about? How do we make some well-used
stretches of rural roads, on which people want to get from one facility
to another, practical on a bicycle? We have heard about encouraging
children and young people through training programmes in schools, but
we also need training programmes for young adults—possibly at
university—and for adults when they start work. We talk about
encouraging people to cycle, particularly young children and school
pupils, but we also need

designated cycle areas, such as along canals or old railway tracks,

new, safe cycle routes that are separated from traffic. Many people are
saying that there should be more money. Yes, we can always spend more
money, but the Government have shown great leadership by making this
money available. I was especially pleased that some of it has been
directed towards national parks, including the Peak District national
park to the north of my constituency. Many people spend their leisure

constituency lies across the Derwent Valley Mills world heritage site,
the cradle of the industrial revolution which kick-started modern
economies, the development of technology and, ultimately,
globalisation. However, it is still not possible for a family to cycle
safely across the heritage site from one historic site to the next.
Part of the heritage site falls within the national park, but the part
in my constituency and in Derby, to the south, does not. I would like
to ask the Minister to provide some funding to enable the extension of
the proposed cycleways down through the world heritage site, via the
historic mills at Belper, Milford and Darley Abbey, to the Silk Mill
museum in Derby, which many people do not realise was the
world’s first multi-storey

underestimated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T21:11:45"></hs_TimeCode>.
Once the new velodrome in Derby South has been completed and opened,
even more cyclists will be attracted to the area. Germany, Austria and
Italy have already harnessed the potential of attracting cycle tourists
to increase their tourism income, which has the benefit of being spent
mostly in local villages and towns, either in the small-scale catering
industry or on buying regional products, thereby supporting 
<?notus-xml column=120?>local growth in jobs and the economy. We are trying
to do that in Belper, particularly through the sale of local food and
local products. Furthermore, Transition Derby is trying to stop people
using their cars one day a week, which is not too much to ask people to
do.</hs_Para>

are not the only benefits that could come from extending the cycleway
to the south. The added value of providing a safe cycleway from the
Derwent valley into Derby is that it would also serve the needs of
numerous commuters living in the towns and villages in the valley,
especially Belper, Milford, Duffield, Little Eaton, Allestree and
Darley Abbey. It would provide a safe, healthy, carbon-free alternative
mode of transport that would reduce congestion and pollution. The
benefits of such expenditure to leisure users and city communities is
self-evident, and I therefore ask the Minister to consider adding to
the current proposals for cycleways in national parks and to fund an
extension of the cycle route from Matlock—he will be familiar
with Matlock, as it is in the constituency of the Secretary of

here this afternoon, I was impressed to hear so many local examples of
good practice, and I would like to add a few of my own from Brighton
and Hove. Brighton and Hove is a very cycle-friendly city, so let me

illustrate some of the tremendous benefits that could be unlocked by
acting on the report and through meaningful political leadership at
national level, too.</hs_Para>

example, Brighton and Hove Albion football club is constantly
encouraging, promoting and facilitating cycling to the stadium, which
is about five miles from the city centre. “Bike train”
rides are organised by experienced volunteers to help cyclists to take
up a good amount of road space and benefit from safety in numbers. All
that helps cut air pollution, so it is not just those on the bikes who
are reaping the health benefits. I have taken part in bike train rides
on a number of occasions and have experienced how incredibly helpful 
<?notus-xml column=121?>such schemes are, particularly for getting less
confident people on a bike and ensuring that they enjoy the experience
by making it feel normal and

there is to be an exciting new cycling hub at Brighton railway station,
which was approved in July by the city council. This will increase the
number of bike spaces by 420 to a total of 670, and provide shower and
changing facilities, a bike shop, a café, a cycle repair outlet
and bike hire—with these all in one place right at the station,
which is great for new and experienced cyclists
alike<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T21:15:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000146">Thirdly,
we recently introduced a new 1.8 km cycle lane that separates bikes
from motorised traffic along Old Shoreham road. People feel much safer,
cycle journeys have rocketed by 30%, and it has been praised by many.
Such “Copenhagen-style” improvements are crucial for
cyclists to feel safe, especially those who are new to cycling or less

response to requests from residents, the city council is now consulting
on a second phase of a programme to introduce 20 mph speed limits.
Again, this is not just about cyclists, but about improving the street
environment for all road users, including car drivers, by reducing the
number and severity of collisions and casualties, improving traffic
flows and making the city a safer and better place to live in. A
default speed limit of 20 mph is a key recommendation of the report,
which I think Ministers should not dismiss so quickly. Changing speed
limits is not expensive, and if we are serious about “cycle
proofing” all roads, adequate long-term funding is needed for
schemes such as new cycle
lanes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T21:16:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090229000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090229000148">Finally,
let me say a few words about the great environmental gains—both
for local air quality and cutting carbon
pollution—that would follow from the UK becoming a true cycling
nation. I end by emphasising that there are also very good economic and
social reasons, which would alone provide ample grounds for
full implementation of all the report’s recommendations. For
example, according to a Sustrans report last year, 1.5 million people
are in transport poverty. These people are unable to get to jobs,
shops, health care or school because they cannot drive or run a car,
while public transport is inaccessible and they cannot use bikes
either. More investment in bikes would help them
tremendously.</hs_Para>

guarantee that I would be able to speak, or able to speak for long. I
think that, in general, the British public underestimate 
<?notus-xml column=123?>the extent and seriousness of the House’s
interest in cycling. Debates on the subject have been greatly
over-subscribed, at least during the time for which I have been a
Member of Parliament, and I think that that is a huge step
forward.</hs_Para>

that a debate which has been so well supported will not receive much
publicity. It will not, I suspect, feature on the front pages of many
newspapers, despite our best endeavours. That is probably because it is
too consensual. The British public, or perhaps the media, are sometimes
a bit odd in that respect. We are always being urged to be more
consensual, but when we are more consensual, we tend to be ignored, and
what we say is not considered very important. I hope that at least some
attention will be paid to this debate, because—as was pointed
out by the hon. Members for Totnes (Dr Wollaston) and for
Gloucester (Richard Graham)—it is important for us to mention
not just the problems but the fun and enjoyment of cycling.</hs_Para>

important for people to realise that Members of Parliament are human
beings who “get” cycling. The hon. Member for Rugby (Mark
Pawsey) said that we might not look like MPs if we turned up sweating
from cycling, but MPs are people as well. When I was first a councillor
and cycled around my ward all the time, my constituents initially
thought that I was a touch eccentric, but as they got to know me, they
realised that that was actually a very sensible thing to do. Cycling
gets us to where we want to be very quickly and efficiently, especially
in cities. Sadly, in rural areas cycle use is falling rather than
rising, and that is clearly an issue that we should think
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090230000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0003.htm#13090230000010">When
I was a young trainee solicitor, I was asked to deliver an offer.
Housing offers had to be delivered by a deadline of noon, and this was
before the days of fax and e-mail: they had to be delivered physically.
When my boss said that the offer must be delivered by 12
o’clock, I said “I will just go and get my bike”,
but he threw me the car keys and insisted that I take the car. Of
course, taking the bike would have been much more efficient. Once you
get the car to the destination, assuming that was in time, there would
be nowhere to park it, and in parking it five minutes’ walk

in a city such as mine, where generally, as I indicated in an
intervention, a lot of money is being spent on cycling and there is a
lot of support for it, the proposal for how to deal with Princes street
once the trams arrive and start working was, disappointingly, to have
an only one-way cycle route, along that prime street of the city. One
argument for that was that the alternative route, which would have had
a two-way cycle route, was on one of the big national cycle routes and
people would want to go through it. I greatly admire people who do
long-distance cycling, but I am not one of them; for many of us we are
talking about a daily event, and people want to go from A to B easily.
Perhaps Edinburgh council is listening, along with other councils,
because they have to make it easy for us to get to where we want to be,
as that will encourage a lot of people to get
cycling.</hs_Para>

With families facing a cost of living crisis, making more journeys by
bike is a good way to reduce the impact of rising fuel costs on the

they brought focus to efforts to improve safety. The THINK! road safety

we must end the stop-start approach to supporting cycling, which means
that we need long-term funding of the infrastructure needed for
dedicated separate safe cycling routes. Ministers recently set out
annual budgets for rail and road investment up to 2020-21, but they
failed to do so for cycling infrastructure, which means that while
there is a £28 billion commitment for roads, we have only a
one-off £114 million from central Government for cycling, and
that is spread across three years. It is time for a serious rethink of
priorities within the roads budget with a proportion reallocated to
deliver a long-term funding settlement for cycling
infrastructure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090230000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#13090230000030">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T21:36:52"></hs_TimeCode>
priority for investment to support cycling must be dedicated separated

painting a thin section at the side of the road a different colour.
Genuinely separated cycle routes are vital not only to improve safety
but, as we have heard from many hon. Members, to build confidence and
to encourage those who are not used to cycling to make the switch to
two wheels. It is also important that a commitment to new
infrastructure does not become an excuse not to improve the safety of
cyclists on roads where there is no separation. The priority should be
redesigning dangerous junctions where almost two thirds of cyclist
deaths and serious injuries due to collisions take place. We need a
much greater use of traffic light phasing to give cyclists a head

we need to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, so I
propose a cycle safety assessment before new transport schemes are
given the green light. In the same way in which Departments have to
carry out regulatory impact assessments and equality impact
assessments, there should be an obligation to cycle-proof new policies
and projects. We need new enforceable design standards and measures to

we need national targets to cut deaths and serious injuries to be
restored, but they should sit alongside a new target to increase levels
of cycling. The number of cyclist deaths is tragically at a five-year
high. Of course, targets alone are not the only answer, but they help
to focus minds and efforts, so Ministers are wrong to reject them.
However, it is vital to ensure that targets do not perversely lead to
local authorities and others seeing the way to cut deaths and injuries
as discouraging cycling. In fact, cycling becomes safer when more
cyclists are on the road, so we should learn from the success that has
been achieved in European countries that have set clear goals to
increase levels of cycling alongside the policies necessary to achieve
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090230000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#13090230000033">Fourthly,
we should learn from Wales and extend to England its active travel
legislation, which sets out clear duties on local authorities to
support cycling. Local authorities are central to devising,
prioritising and delivering measures to support cycling, so it is
important that additional support from central Government is matched by
clear obligations. To assist councils, we should provide them with a
best-practice toolkit to boost cycling numbers that is based on what we
learned from the cycling city and towns programme and evidence from
abroad. Councils 
<?notus-xml column=128?>should be supported to deliver 20 mph zones, which should increasingly

we must ensure that children and young people have every opportunity to
cycle and to do so safely. The Government should not have ended
long-term funding certainty for the Bikeability scheme, nor axed the
requirement for school travel plans. Those decisions can and should be
reversed. Sixthly, we need to make it easier for cycling to become part
of the journey to work, even when the commute is too far to do by bike
alone. Employers can play an important role in providing access to
showers, changing facilities and lockers. However, our public transport
providers need to step up and do much more too. Instead of the
Government’s approach, which has been to propose a weakening of
franchise obligations, we should toughen up the requirement to provide
station facilities and on-train space for bikes in rail
contracts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090230000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#13090230000035">Seventhly,
we need to ensure that justice is done and seen to be done in cases
where collisions lead to the death of cyclists and serious
injuries. I welcome the recent commitment from Ministers to initiate a
review of sentencing guidelines. It is vital that this is a
comprehensive review of the justice system and how it protects
vulnerable road users, and it should be concluded without delay in this

we need tough new rules and requirements on heavy goods vehicles that
are involved in about a fifth of all cycling fatalities, despite the
fact that HGVs make up just 6% of road traffic—there is clearly
an issue there. We should look at the case for taking HGVs out of our
cities at the busiest times, as has happened elsewhere in Europe,
including in Paris and Dublin. As a minimum, we should require safety
measures on all HGVs, including sensors, audible truck-turning alarms,
extra mirrors and safety bars, as well as better training and
awareness. I have previously suggested to Ministers that the £23
million that is expected to be raised annually from the new HGV
road-charging scheme could be used to support the road haulage industry
to achieve that. I hope that that idea will be taken seriously and
considered by Ministers, along with all those clear proposals. Taken
together, I believe that that would be a significant improvement in the
Government’s current approach, and it is something that all
parties could support across the

has the potential to be a huge British success story, but it needs a
new approach and a shared commitment across Government, councils,
schools, employers and public transport providers. Most of all, it
needs Ministers to cut the spin and instead give cycling infrastructure
greater priority within the existing transport investment plans that
they have set out. It is time to end the stop-start approach that is
getting in the way of progress and agree a cross-party, long-term
commitment to
cycling.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-02?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_02_PT_1/D0304817C146F903C1E2BD0E091469E59E8DEBB3" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="2 September 2013">Monday

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman

was also engendered by the all-party group on cycling. I pay particular
tribute to 
<?notus-xml column=129?>my colleague, my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert), and
the hon. Member for Dudley North (Ian Austin), on their leadership of
that group, and, indeed, to all members of that group for a very good
report. I welcome the fact that this has been a well-attended debate,
and that the contributions from Members from all parts of the House
have, almost without exception, been positive and constructive. I am
particularly pleased to hear the news of individual MPs taking up
cycling. That is now on the record in <I>Hansard</I>, and doubtless
their constituents will hold them to that commitment.</hs_Para>

Government wants more people to cycle more often, more safely. We are
determined to drive that forward. We have a good record to date, but I
want to make it clear that we want to go even further. I believe that
we have the most pro-cycling Government that the country has ever had,

further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090230000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#13090230000040">Cycling
is good for the environment, good for individual health, and good for
the economy. It is good for the environment, because it cuts carbon
emissions, noise and air pollution. It is good for individual health,

contribution that the Department of Health has made towards to cycling
efforts in government, including the financial contribution that it has

is also good for the economy. Last week, I was in Cambridge, where 47%
of adults cycle at least once a week. I congratulate the three councils
there: Conservative Cambridgeshire county council, South Cambridgeshire
district council, and my Lib Dem colleagues on Cambridge city council,
who are working together to promote cycling. The lesson there is that
whereas the population of Cambridge has risen from 105,000 to 125,000
in a decade, car travel is flat because the councils have incentivised
cycling. If the three councils together had not done that, there would
be gridlock in Cambridge as a consequence. So the lesson is that those
who want to help the local economy will help the local cyclist. Those
who advocate anti-cycling policies damage the local
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090230000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#13090230000042">It

we are funding cycling more than the Labour Government did. Between
2005 and 2010 the previous Administration spent £140
million—£200 million with match funding—on
cycling. Under this Administration, £278
million—£375 million with match funding—will be
spent in our five-year period. That is almost double what the Labour
Government spent in the previous five years. When Opposition Members

entirely agree with the comments made by hon. Members that it is
important not to neglect rural areas. That is why the Government has
committed £600 million to the local sustainable transport fund,
which equates to £1 billion with match funding. That local
sustainable transport fund has funded 96 projects, 94 of which have
cycling elements. A further £100 million capital and
£78 million revenue funding has been allocated for
the LSTF in 2015-16. We have seen £44 million committed
throughout this Parliament to support cycle training for
schoolchildren. I might say to the shadow Secretary of State that the
first thing we did on cycling as a coalition Government was to commit
to Bikeability funding throughout the whole Parliament to give the

are a barrier to walkers and communities. All new roads and improvement
schemes on the strategic road network will be designed with cyclists,

a further £15 million for such improvements in 2015-16.
Officials are currently planning a conference on cycle-proofing roads

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T21:54:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

take action. The hon. Gentleman was very nice to me today but lamented
the fact that I was, he implied, dealing with this without support.
That is not the case. There is support from all my colleagues in the
Department for Transport and from different Departments across
Government, and the Prime Minister himself made a statement in August.
That clearly indicates the importance that the Government as a whole
attaches to the matter. If any colleagues across Government were not
taking it seriously, I am sure that the Prime Minister’s
appearance in August will ensure that they take it more seriously than
they did
previously.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090230000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#13090230000065"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T21:55:11"></hs_TimeCode>There

hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick) talked about

Minister as well—not just the Member for Poplar but a popular
Minister. He asked whether I am the national champion for cycling. I
hope 
<?notus-xml column=133?>that I am a national champion for cycling, but so are my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, my other colleagues in the
Department for Transport, and the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime
Minister. We want to make sure that this is owned across Government by
all Departments. The danger of having one person identified in the role
is that others do not feel the need to participate in the same way. I
am not particularly keen to use the word “tsar”, by the
way. The history of tsars at the end of imperial Russia is not a happy
one, and we can probably do without it.</hs_Para>

Russell Brown</B> (Dumfries and Galloway) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful
for the opportunity to raise in the House an issue that has,
surprisingly, been subject to very few debates over the years, namely
the plight of Romanian orphans, children and young adults living in
institutions and, in particular, the charitable support work for them
over many
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T22:01:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309031000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#1309031000004">Few
of us will ever forget the awful images in the 1990s of the horrors of
Romanian orphanages, which were exposed following the collapse of the
Ceausescu regime in 1989. The world was stunned by the television and
newspaper images of half-starved, abandoned children tied to their
beds. Aid agencies rushed to help and Governments throughout the world
condemned what they saw.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T22:02:07"></hs_TimeCode> am sure that
many Members will know someone who answered the call to offer help to
those children and young adults. One such person was a constituent of
mine, a lady called Linda

we called the institutions in the images orphanages, the reality was
that most of the children in them had parents, but those parents were
simply not able to afford to feed and care for their large families.
The aim of the Ceausescu regime had been to increase the population of
Romania to 30 million by 2000, with women required by law to have at
least four children—a number that was later increased to five.
Families who had fewer than three children were taxed heavily. That
policy weighed heavily on the Romanian nation, and the long-lasting
consequences of such a policy cannot easily be
rectified<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T22:03:03"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T22:02:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309031000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#1309031000006">The
orphanages were staffed by the minimum number of people required to
keep the institution operational, but no consideration was given to the
developmental needs of the children. Children in the institutions grew
up without any mental stimulation or physical activity, without any
loving human touch and often without sufficient food, clothing or
health

the young adults, the consequence of growing up in state institutions

<?notus-xml column=137?>and some attempted to fit into society, but most found themselves
homeless. It should be recognised that post-Ceausescu, great
improvements were made by the authorities and support for the children
and young adults came from many parts. The improvements were made
possible in no small measure by the work of the many organisations and
charities that developed within Romania and across the world, as

my area, Linda Barr, who has worked with children and young adults in
Romania for more than 20 years, along with her colleagues in the health
service, set up the Dumfries Hospitals Romanian Support Group and then
established the RAP Foundation. I know that the Minister is very much
aware of the work of the foundation. It has successfully developed
direct working links with colleagues in Romania to advance the
education of children and young people with disabilities in the
country, particularly in Bucharest, and to relieve their suffering and
distress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309031000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#1309031000011">In
July 2007, the foundation officially opened its first supported
accommodation apartment, providing a family-style home for four young
people: Aurel, Florin, Razvan and Virgil. The foundation works with its
project partner, the Romanian Angel Appeal, and other agencies to
support the apartment and to develop similar
projects.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309031000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#1309031000012">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T22:06:45"></hs_TimeCode>
17 years, the foundation has arranged for children and young adults
from Bucharest to go on seaside holidays of a lifetime on the Black sea
coast. However, as the Minister is aware from the correspondence that I
have sent him, this year’s holiday was in danger of not going
ahead. It would appear that because concern was expressed by members of
the foundation and others over the treatment of a number of young
people with disabilities in the Gheorghe Serban district of Bucharest,
the general directorate of social assistance and child protection of
Sector 2 sought to put in place what can only be described as a number
of hurdles to prevent this year’s holiday from taking place. It
delayed agreeing to the holiday to the extent that the original
bookings had to be cancelled. It demanded that the RAP Foundation be
registered as a “provider of social assistance”, even
though its work as a sponsor does not require such registration and
despite its long-standing collaboration with the Romanian Angel Appeal,
which is a well-known non-governmental organisation working in Romania
that is registered as a “provider of social assistance”.
The general directorate also sought to block members of the RAP
Foundation from attending the holiday as
volunteers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309031000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#1309031000013">Due
to the foundation’s persistence and, I have no doubt, the work
of the British embassy in Romania after I raised the issue with the
Minister, a way was found to allow the holiday to go ahead this year. I
place on the record my thanks to the Minister and the British
ambassador and his staff for their assistance. This year’s
holiday was another major success for the young people, but it was not
without its difficulties. Sadly, this is the second year in which the
RAP Foundation has found the authorities in Sector 2 unwilling to be
co-operative. It saddens me to say that when the young people
eventually set off on this year’s holiday, the comment was made
that it seemed as if it was the first time that many of the young
people had been out in the fresh air since the previous year’s
holiday.</hs_Para>

conditions in Romanian orphanages. You will know, Mr Speaker, that the
promotion and protection of human rights are at the heart of UK
Government foreign policy objectives. All hon. Members would agree that
orphaned children have a right to be cared for appropriately and with
compassion, and that we in government should do what we can to support
work to that end. I am grateful for what the hon. Gentleman has said

hon. Gentleman remarked on the fact that we first became aware of the
unspeakable conditions that prevailed in Romanian orphanages in 1989,
when the regime of President Ceausescu was overthrown. Thousands of
children lived in appalling conditions in state institutions. It is
good to be able to say that, since that time, a large number of
substandard institutions have been closed, and that many of the
remaining institutions have improved both their services and their
standards. As the hon. Gentleman has said, there is work to be done,
but we should acknowledge the progress that has been made and the part
played in that by British charities, which have actively worked towards
such improvements in Romania ever since the
revolution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309031000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#1309031000026">Charities
from this country have provided support and facilities to Romanian
orphanages, and have helped to raise awareness, both nationally and
internationally, of the poor conditions still encountered there. I
shall refer to the list of such charities. The Hope and Homes charity
for children has its largest programme in Romania, and has worked with
national and local authorities there to improve services in certain
orphanages, and to close substandard ones where appropriate. It has
worked with the Romanian Government and its partners, Absolute Return
for Kids. Hope and Homes has pledged to end institutionalised care for
children in Romania by
2020.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309031000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#1309031000027">Other
British charities operating in the field include SOS Children’s
Villages, the Foundation for the Relief of Disabled
Orphans—FRODO—Children in Distress and Muzika. FARA has
worked in Romania since 1991.

charities operate to help not only orphaned children but children more
widely within Romania. Those charities include The Little People, which
helps children with cancer; Hospices with Hope, which has been building
palliative care facilities; Light into Europe, which works with the
blind; and Nightingale’s, which works with orphaned children and
young adults who have HIV. That is just a snapshot; it is not an
exhaustive list of what the British charity sector does in Romania.
Like the hon. Gentleman, I pay tribute to Baroness Nicholson of
Winterbourne for her energy and dedication in championing at the
highest level the fight to improve conditions for children in
Romania.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309031000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#1309031000029">The
UK Government, too, are active. We have supported and worked with the
Government of Romania to improve conditions in their state-run
facilities for both vulnerable children and adults. To give a few
examples, our embassy in Bucharest, with Romania’s National
Authority for the Protection of Children’s Rights, has
facilitated workshops for 90 practitioners from all over Romania on
handling disabled children in their care. We have also helped to foster
links between Romanian and British non-governmental organisations
through a networking event held at the Romanian Prime Minister’s
office. The fact that the Prime Minister of Romania was willing to host
such an event indicates that the Romanian Government, at the highest
levels, recognise that there have been and continue to be problems with
the conditions for children in at least some Romanian orphanages, and
that the Romanians are determined to continue to drive through further
improvements.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309031000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/debtext/130902-0004.htm#1309031000030"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-02T22:19:31"></hs_TimeCode>Earlier
this summer, the Romanian Ministry of Labour, through its national
agency for social inspection, carried out an inspection of 51
neuropsychiatric recovery and rehabilitation centres throughout
Romania. As part of that exercise, it visited the two facilities with
which the RAP Foundation has had such difficulties, including the
Gheorghe Serban centre. Gheorghe Serban received 19 specific
recommendations for improvement from the Romanian inspectorate,
including the need to provide more space for patients and more
nutritious food. The inspector’s report says that the centre is
currently undergoing maintenance to improve living conditions. I

Labour visited the centre in June this year and was made fully aware of

reduce social exclusion, to support higher standards of care and to

subsequently instructed the British ambassador to meet the local mayor
as a matter of urgency. That meeting took place on 24 July, and on the
following day the mayor granted permission for the holiday to go ahead.
I was very pleased to hear that Linda Barr wrote to the British Embassy

know too, as the hon. Gentleman has told the House, that the RAP
Foundation has had difficulties with Social Services—the
DGASPC—in Bucharest Sector 2, in gaining access to
two facilities, especially the Gheorghe Serban centre. Under Romanian
law, services within state institutions can be provided only by a
registered provider of social care. That means that RAP has no legal
right to insist on access to these institutions. As the hon. Gentleman
said, it has traditionally worked through its Romanian partner, the
Romanian Angels Association. It is also the case that while the central
Government in Romania have responsibility for overall policy regarding
state institutions, including orphanages, individual institutions fall
under the responsibility of local government within Romania. For that
reason our judgment is that difficulties are usually best tackled, at
least in the first instance, by direct contact between our embassy team
in Bucharest and the local mayor and others at local authority level,
because they are the people who have direct responsibility for the
surveillance and management of those Romanian state
institutions.</hs_Para>

have asked the British Embassy to continue to support the work of RAP
and to try to mediate dialogue between the foundation and the social
services in Bucharest Sector 2. I very much hope that, following the
successful holiday this year, the relationship will be put back on the
right footing and developed further in an effective manner, and above
all in a way that provides the greatest possible opportunities to the
children, whose interests should lie at the heart of all our
considerations.</hs_Para>

conclusion, I am aware that the scale and complexity of the problem of
Romanian orphanages have been reduced significantly since the 1989
revolution, but there is still cause for concern about the standards of
care in some Romanian facilities and a lot still to be done. The
efforts of the Romanian Government—combined with the
contribution and support of British and international charities, and
with the encouragement of the international community to improve the
situation—remain necessary to ensure that the work to drive up
standards continues.</hs_Para>

diagnosis. Despite this, there is evidence that around 50% of claims

Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice (Damian Green):</Member></B>
Trial by a jury of one’s peers is a crucial and long established
feature of our justice system and jury service is one of the most
important civic duties that anyone can be asked to perform. Currently
the Juries Act 1974 specifies that the upper age limit for jury service
in England and Wales is 70. The upper limit was last amended by the
Criminal Justice Act 1988, which raised it from 65 to
70.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090225000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/wmstext/130902m0001.htm#13090225000180">The
previous Government consulted on changing the age limit. We have spent
time considering the responses to that consultation, and the views of
those who have written to us (and asked parliamentary questions) about
this. We have now come to the conclusion that the age limit should be
increased.</hs_Para>

health and well-being of those over 70 has improved significantly since
the age limit was last set 25 years ago and it is right that this
should be reflected in a higher upper age limit for jury service. Data
from the Office for National Statistics show that, on average, people
in England and Wales can expect to be “disability free”
until they are 75. We believe that it is fair to expect people below
this age to sit as
jurors.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090225000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/wmstext/130902m0001.htm#13090225000182">Over
the age of 75, an increasing number of people would find it difficult
or impossible to sit as jurors and would therefore seek to be excused
from jury service. Rather than put them through the process of applying
for excusal, and spend taxpayers’ money dealing with this
additional administrative burden, we are increasing the upper age limit
to
75.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090225000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/wmstext/130902m0001.htm#13090225000183">Existing

the main motivation for increasing the upper age limit is to make
juries more representative of all the people who are playing a full
part in their communities, we do expect some savings to result from a
reduction in the number of jurors in full-time employment. This will
reduce the number of employers who have to pay staff who are on jury
service, and the costs to Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal
Service of paying for loss of earnings. The only costs involved in
implementing this policy will be minor changes to our systems, and to
the relevant forms and

show that between 2009 and 2012 money raised by society lotteries for
good causes increased from £100.57 million in 2009-10 to
£103.46 million in 2010-11, £132.05 million in 2011-12

potential future income to the good cause from introducing a new player
against the initial recruitment cost is a matter for the society
lotteries concerned. However, for each lottery draw they must ensure
that those short-term costs do not cause the overall amount given to
the good cause to fall below the statutory minimum of 20% of their
ticket sales and that any expenses (including those related to player
recruitment) are reasonably
incurred.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1309032000042" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0001.htm#1309032000042">Legal

policy proposals to simplify non-geographic numbers. Their main
proposals included making freephone 080 and 116 numbers free to call
from all landline and mobile telephones. Also, revenue sharing ranges,
084, 087, 09 and 118 numbers, where a portion of the retail charge is
passed back to the receiver of the call, will have a common simplified
structure. The proposals are subject to a final consultation on the
legal instruments, which will put them into effect, and this process is
expected to be completed by July 2013. Following the confirmation of
the legal instruments, there will be an

to help the poorest and most vulnerable people in Nepal to secure
better justice. As the project is still in its design phase, the
implementing partners have not yet been identified but, these are
likely to be a mixture of national justice sector institutions and
non-governmental organisations. The intended results are to make the
police more responsive to the communities they serve, to support a
well-functioning and independent justice system and to tackle sexual
and domestic violence. It is envisaged that up to £35 million
will be set aside to fund this programme. The impact of the programme

For the year ending March 2013 figures, the Office for National

reflect the fact that the force is responsible for policing the capital
city of Wales. The request and accompanying report was carefully
considered, but the Policing Minister concluded that Cardiff did not
face the same challenges and responsibilities as those that come with
policing London. The Policing Minister set out his decision not to
provide additional funding in a letter to the chief constable in May

the public rightly demands full transparency and accountability for all

commercial funding arrangements. I pay tribute to Sir Neil Thorne, the

Dunne:</Member></B> The movement of cargo by sea is primarily provided
through the private finance initiative (PFI) strategic sealift service.
The review of the Ministry of Defence's (MOD) strategic sealift
requirement, in autumn 2011, concluded that better value for money
would be achieved if the number of vessels contracted as part of this
PFI was reduced from six to four. This reduction became effective on 27
April 2012 following detailed discussions between MOD officials and
representatives of Foreland
Shipping.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309037000296" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0002.htm#1309037000296">All
