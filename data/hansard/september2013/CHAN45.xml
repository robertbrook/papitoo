make technological advances, this new industry is fast becoming a
reality, and I am keen that Britain should be at the forefront.

Murray:</Member></B> Deep-sea mining takes place at great depth in
specific areas of the ocean. I do not think that the warps, bridles and
trawl doors on my late husband’s boat were long enough to trawl
the sea bed. We should not excavate in a non-environmentally friendly
way, and I will come on to discuss that. This is one of the reasons why
the UK needs to amend the 1981 Act, so that we can impose stringent and
clear environmental conditions. The UK takes part in the council
meetings, which are considering—this was started at the last
meeting in July—what conditions should be applied to the
exploitation. These are very early days—we are talking about
exploration at the moment and not exploitation, which is still some way

growing interest in polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich crusts.
There are now agreed international regulations for the exploration of

would involve the excavation of rock. Mining for those materials is
even further off than mining for polymetallic nodules, and the
principles that might apply to nodules would have to be reconsidered
for sulphides and crusts. 
<?notus-xml column=597?>We are determined to ensure that the highest environmental standards are

the face of it, this Bill is rather dull, and to a casual observer it
could appear uninteresting. However, it is one that could open up the
high seas—or, more accurately, our deepest oceans—to what
could turn out to be the 21st century equivalent of the 19th-century
gold rush. It is like the Klondike. The ocean depths contain some of
the last unexplored areas on our planet. The Bill seeks to update the
existing statute, which, as we have heard, dates back to 1981. It
perhaps needs to be explained why an Act passed 32 years ago as a
temporary measure is now not only being amended, but turned into a
permanent fixture. Indeed, the original Act was so clearly intended to
be a temporary measure that its official title included the words
“Temporary Provisions”, while section 18(3) made

is a danger that they will go and seek some other jurisdiction with a

would supersede the national provisions contained in the 1981 Act. It

our own supplies of minerals such as nickel, cobalt, copper or
manganese from the sea bed was understandably regarded as a very
welcome prospect indeed. Furthermore, the prospect of UK companies
participating in the new industrial activity of sea-bed mining promised
an economic opportunity for the benefit of the companies involved and
the wider British economy.</hs_Para>

the Member for South East Cornwall described them, but as like charred
potatoes that varied in size and, where they occurred, were like a
carpet on the sea bed in a single layer. We do not yet fully understand
how and why the nodules form, but it is clear that they apparently
require the undisturbed conditions that are found only in the deepest
areas of the ocean. Although the nodules were found in various parts of
the ocean, only very few areas contained sufficiently rich deposits to
justify the enormous costs of establishing commercial mining
operations. The deposits of nodules are beyond the limits of national
jurisdictions and were consequently treated as resources of the high
seas, which any nation could attempt to recover.</hs_Para>

is perhaps worth considering what exactly it is envisaged will be mined
as a result of the Bill. There are essentially three types of minerals
involved. First are the polymetallic nodules, which contain manganese,
copper, cobalt and nickel. As my hon. Friend mentioned, they either
occur on the surface or are partially buried, and are discovered at
depths of 3,000 to 6,000 metres—in other words, some 4 miles
deep, so we are not talking about something that one can undertake
lightly. It is estimated that the global reserves of deep-sea manganese
nodules are in the order of 10 billion tonnes. Those of greatest
economic interest are made up, on average, of about 30% manganese, 1.5%
nickel, 1.5% copper and 0.3% cobalt. However, I understand that the
presence of traces of other, rare earth elements might also attract
interest in these resources, particularly as the supply of such metals
from land-based resources is
reducing.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_06_PT_1/C4DF28577BCD8A48210E0EBD31973352DBC09F35" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="6 September 2013">Friday

1981. They still mainly comprise the Clarion-Clipperton fracture zone

and the central Indian basin in the Indian ocean.

to impose a complete moratorium on deep-sea mining until international

answer was that that Government were keen to pass an interim measure

contained a provision for the convention not to become effective until
60 states had ratified it. That was the threshold set in the
draft agreement. It was therefore clear that, even if agreement were

November 1994—one year after Guyana had become the 60th nation
to ratify the convention—that it actually came into force.
Members might wonder why it was signed at Montego Bay. The answer is
that that is where the headquarters of what is now the International
Seabed Authority are
situated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T11:09:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0001.htm#13090627000178">Another
concern expressed at the time was that the delays and uncertainties in
the international arrangements left the developing deep-sea mining
industry in a difficult and uncertain position. The industry was in its
infancy and had to carry out costly development work before being ready
to embark on commercial operations. Understandably, mining companies
were not prepared to invest the huge sums required to undertake this
development work without a reasonably stable legal framework in which
to operate. If the 1981 Act had never been passed, the Government
feared that mining companies would allow their development programmes
to run down, and if they did run down, there was no guarantee that they
would ever be built up
again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T11:10:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0001.htm#13090627000179">A
further reason why legislation was required was that the companies that
had pioneered the development of sea-bed mining had already expended
considerable efforts on prospecting large areas of the ocean floor.
They wanted to secure their claims to potential areas of exploration
and exploitation—the areas that they had identified as worthy of
further investigation, particularly when other countries were already
pressing ahead with their own national
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T11:10:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0001.htm#13090627000180">The
key concern was, of course, ensuring that the exploitation of the
valuable mineral resources did not result in damage being caused to the
marine environment. As already mentioned this morning, section 5 of the
1981 Act provided for protection of the marine environment, which was a
central part of the legislation at that time, and it is the one
section, incidentally, of the Act that is hardly altered at all by my
hon. Friend’s Bill.</hs_Para>

essentially two types of licence: exploration licences and exploitation
licences. The provisions apply to UK

mechanism enabling the Secretary of State to repeal it, but of course
that never came to pass, although, as we have heard this morning, the

both the licensing regime established by the Bill and the fact that,
thanks to the actions of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, they will
benefit from one of the most competitive corporation tax regimes and

that the debate must have been fairly consensual and that
the issue had not been particularly controversial, I was astounded to
discover how heated the discussion had become on some occasions. If I
detected accurately what was said earlier by the hon. Member for Brent

reservations that have been expressed about this Bill are similar to
those expressed

not necessarily agree with the Greenpeace stance, but I think there are
certain points that are worth putting on the record. The concern is
that problems we are not yet aware of may arise from deep-sea mining.
It is always difficult to counter such arguments: if we are not aware
of the problems, how can we give reassurance on them? I suspect we
cannot. Sometimes we have to take a leap of faith, however; otherwise,
we would never do anything. We would never do anything in this country

would like clarification on a further point, which relates to the heart
of why it is important that we have a competitive system, particularly
when it comes to time scales. What happens when different companies in
different countries all want to explore or exploit the same area at the
same time? That must be a fairly common situation. It is a bit like
supermarkets really: when one company 
<?notus-xml column=613?>decides it wants to open a store in a particular place and its
competitors get wind of it, all of a sudden two or three applications
are made for the same place, because all the companies think,
“That’s a good area. We all want a slice of that
action.” Presumably the same things must apply in this field, so
if different companies in different countries are all looking to
exploit the same area, is the company that can do so decided on a
first-come, first-served basis? Is the company that gets its licence
first and gets a contract agreed with the ISA the one that gets to do
the exploring? Or are more rigorous criteria used? If this is done on a
first-come, first-served basis, it is crucial that we process these
licences as quickly as
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T11:44:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0001.htm#13090627000235">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T11:44:38"></hs_TimeCode>

pleasure to follow
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friends
the Members for Shipley (Philip Davies) and
<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>for Bury North
(Mr Nuttall), who have been, for a Friday, most amazingly
reticent and brief in their remarks. I am worried that this Bill may
not therefore get the scrutiny that it deserves, given that people who
normally go into every detail have skated over some of the more
important points—perhaps that will come at a later stage,
however.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090627000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0001.htm#13090627000239"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>The
great thing that we should bear in mind as a nation is that our
companies and our businesses should never be disadvantaged against
foreign businesses and foreign companies. Any regime we have of
licensing and of regulation should be as light-touch as possible,
particularly when this enormous and exciting resource 
<?notus-xml column=614?>is available for us. We have heard of the metals that there may
be—of molybdenum, of rare earth metals. It occurs to me that at
the depths of the ocean there may even be gold, and it might be
possible for us, through the ingenuity of British companies, to go down
fathom after fathom to explore and find the gold that could be used to
replace that which was sold by a former Chancellor of the Exchequer at
an extraordinarily low price and against the advice of the Father of
the House, my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T11:48:20"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Friend the Member for Louth and Horncastle (Sir
Peter Tapsell), who thought it was very unwise to sell that gold at a
rock-bottom price. That is what it is really about: exploring these
resources that could add to the wealth not only of the nation but of
the globe at large. As we have seen the emergence of the new
economies—of China, India, Brazil and Russia—so we have
seen demand for resources grow extraordinarily. The demand has been for
steel, obviously, and all that goes into manufacturing it: the
components and the other metals that make steel of a particular
strength to ensure that the skyscrapers that have gone up across Asia
can be built safely.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090627000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0001.htm#13090627000240"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T11:49:13"></hs_TimeCode>As
demand increases we will find that the traditional sources of metals
and minerals can be exhausted. We will then find that economic growth
across the globe slows down because the prices of commodities will
rise. As you know, Mr Speaker, the laws of supply and demand would come
into effect and if the supply is limited in relation to the demand, the
price rises. If the price rises, the burden of higher prices will
ultimately fall on the consumer and standards of living in the country
at large and, indeed, in the world at large would be reduced. There
could be an exciting resource in the depths of the ocean in an area
where mankind has hardly dared go before—there have been limited
efforts, and cables have been laid, but we have otherwise been able to
do very little in terms of exploration. If we find on the base of the
ocean little things the size of golf balls, or possibly even cricket
balls, that could add to our wealth, that would be exciting, but we
want British companies to be at the forefront. We do not want to allow
the Americans, who are not following this regulatory path, to get ahead
of us as they have on other
occasions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0001.htm#13090627000241">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T11:50:34"></hs_TimeCode>
hope that the Minister will focus on international law. I am always
very suspicious of internationalism. I think that the nation state is
the right way of dealing with problems. It is the right way of
legislating, of representing a democratic mandate and of ensuring a
fair and better economic outlook for the country. If there are
international agreements to which major countries are not signed up, in
what position are those countries and their companies left?
International law is only enforceable by the acceptance of the people
on whom it is enforced. There is no equivalent to this Parliament that
can pass a law for the whole world nor is there a court that can lead a
judgment against a country that refuses to accept what international
law proposes.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090627000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0001.htm#13090627000242"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T11:51:31"></hs_TimeCode>Indeed,
we discussed how, by the 17th century, the oceans were viewed as owned
by everybody and as free, but we did not go on to develop how that
freedom was protected. It was protected by the might of one great
nation and one great navy, the Royal Navy, which went across the world
ensuring the freedom of the seas. Although the argument was that the
seas were global, they were global by the fiat of the British empire,
which enforced internationalism and the security and safety of 
<?notus-xml column=615?>those travelling on the high seas. Indeed, it was a deliberate change of
British policy. In the reign of Elizabeth I, letters of marque were
issued to allow piracy on the high seas as a means of getting at the
Spanish wealth. We changed our policy to internationalise and that is
the situation that we are now in, but sadly our Navy is not what it
was.</hs_Para>

we have the hundreds of capital ships that we used to have? Do we have
the dreadnoughts that we used to have ready to save the high seas from
dangers? No, we do not. So, we must think about who will enforce the
freedom of the seas. Which great navy is left today that can patrol
those open spaces? The US navy, of course. Which state is not a party
to the agreements that will regulate mining at the depth of the ocean?
The United States, of course. So we must consider who will act against
an American company that has not come along dutifully to get a licence
from the Secretary of State and applied to an international body for
confirmation of that licence. What if an American company goes out? Who
will say no<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T11:53:27"></hs_TimeCode>?
Perhaps the Russian navy might go out, but I doubt it. The British Navy
would certainly be unwise to take on the United States in such
circumstances.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T11:53:35"></hs_TimeCode>We must consider
what we are imposing on our companies and our fellow subjects that is

somewhere, they should just get on with it irrespective of what any

Rees-Mogg:</Member></B> That is an exciting way of looking at
it—to adopt a real free-market approach, which allows companies
to go out to prospect, as they did in California in the 19th century,
and as Cecil Rhodes did when he went to South Africa. He found great
acres of space and he made a claim and he dug and he dug and he dug,
and he found gold, diamonds and platinum, and he put them into a great
company, and he made millions—in modern money,
billions—of pounds by doing that. That was not through state
regulation, not through international bodies, not through the United
Nations reaching an agreement to say, “You may do this,”
or “You may do that,” but by enterprise, hard work and
energy—by all those great British virtues of which we should be
so proud. Why not say that of the oceans? Why not mount expeditions? We
could launch one together, Mr Speaker, to try and find the lost city of
Atlantis, which we would expect to have all sorts of
valuables—metals, gold, excitements—in it.</hs_Para>

other companies, perhaps, doing more careful geological surveys to
locate those metals—the rare earth metals. An interesting fact
about rare earth metals is that they are not particularly rare. The
Chinese sold them very cheaply to start with, but they became a
monopolist and then they raised the price. In doing so, they showed
absolutely classic monopolistic behaviour. Those metals are not
particularly rare, although they are quite expensive to gather
together. People could go off as a free-enterprise endeavour, without
having to pay for licences and regulations.</hs_Para>

that is spent on a licence is a pound that cannot be spent on
exploration, or on exploitation of the asset once it is found. How
relieved I was to hear from <I>Mining Weekly</I> about the speed with
which the sea bed—the mighty sea bed—restores itself to
pristine condition after someone has been down and done a little
digging. That conjures up wonderful images. I was delighted to hear my
hon. Friend the Member for South East Cornwall (Sheryll Murray) say
that there is always a Cornish miner involved, and that they go down
and dig, even at the depths of the ocean, to find valuable assets that
we may be able to exploit for the benefit of the British people. That
is a free-enterprise
endeavour.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0001.htm#13090627000248">Interestingly,
those who spoke in the debates in the early ’80s thought there
would be a great expansion of activity at the depths of the ocean. Why
did that not happen? Is it not obvious, Mr Speaker? The dead hand of
legislation and bureaucracy came crushing down on those who wanted to
be enterprising in their prospecting activities. So there was no
equivalent of the Californian gold rush. There was no shout of,
“There’s gold in them there hills,” or anything of
that kind, of the undersea hills.</hs_Para>

two concerns. First, if the hon. Gentleman leads a lengthy sojourn,
either accompanied or unaccompanied, in the terms that he describes, he
may be sorely missed in North East Somerset. Secondly, I feel sure
that, ere long, notwithstanding the quite legendary eloquence that the

Rees-Mogg:</Member></B> Because so many other Members are keen to speak
in the debate, I shall keep my remarks short. I know the Benches are
not currently filled, but people are waiting in their offices to come
racing down into the Chamber the minute the Minister has said a few
words, such is their excitement to talk about the details of the
Bill.</hs_Para>

of the Bill are of course crucial. Its worst aspect is that it removes
the Secretary of State’s ability to repeal legislation. If there
is one thing that I take particular exception to, it is the idea that
legislation that was temporary and could be removed is now to become a
permanent burden on our statute book. When we look, in the No Lobby, at
the statutes of this great nation, we see one volume covering the first
few hundred years of the existence of Parliament, and now we see a
volume barely doing a Session of Parliament. How glorious it would be
if more Bills gave Secretaries of State power to take them off the
statute book—to deregulate. I would urge that the Bill should
have a more deregulatory ambition, and therefore in the early stages of
its consideration we should delete the conversion of the 1981 Act from
temporary to permanent, because the temporary nature of legislation is
one of the pious hopes that all legislators should have. We should wish
our legislation to deal with a temporary problem and 
<?notus-xml column=617?>then restore the liberties of the British subject as soon as possible.
That would be my first concern over the Bill and the regulations within
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T11:59:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0001.htm#13090627000253"><B><Member ContinuationText="Philip Davies" PimsId="4767" UID="13090627000732" xid="887" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0001.htm#13090627000732">Philip

Rees-Mogg:</Member></B> If only that were true. I would hope that Bills
would be repealed at any time, but sadly the House is much keener to
pass new Bills than it is to repeal old and defunct ones. Every so
often a Session will pass 20 repeals of ancient Bills. I think we had
one earlier in this Session or at the end of the last Session, which
repealed some Bill relating to the purchase of the Isle of Man from
whoever previously owned it to make it part of the Crown territory.
That does happen, but not often enough.</hs_Para>

sunset clause in this Bill would be particularly attractive, especially
if the Americans are not part of this. I rather like the American
approach to internationalism; that is to treat it with the deepest
caution, and not to sign up to every international body that comes
along. My hon. Friend mentioned what Sir Teddy Taylor said about the
Foreign Office. It is interesting that in the United States the State
Department almost always wants to sign up to any bit of
internationalism that is going. But the sensible people in the Senate
who have to ratify treaties almost never do, because they do not think
it is in the interests of the American people. Because of our system,
we seem to be rather too keen to sign up to international agreements,

that preamble and my concerns about the nature of the Bill and
internationalism, including the risks that that has for democracy and
the problem of it being a dead hand on enterprise, if we are to have
this type of regulation, the Bill is obviously sensible. It is
obviously wise to extend it from purely metals to include gas and
liquids, because there may be all sorts of exciting things at the
depths of the sea. There may be endless supplies of gas. There may be
oil spurting out as if Saudi Arabia was on the sea bed rather than in
Arabia where it is more normally located, and therefore one would find
that there is this enormous wealth that could reduce the price of oil
to the enormous benefit of our constituents, particularly those in
rural seats where the price of petrol is a serious problem. These
resources, liquid and gas, could be sucked out of the earth and used to
the benefit of our constituents.</hs_Para>

refer to a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North East
Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg), getting the balance right between what is

free, as it were, is difficult.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T12:24:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Shipley spoke about the freedom of the seas and the
like. Access to the sea and freedom to roam on the seas is important,
as is the enforcement of such rights to freedom. However, the world
recognises that the resources of the sea and what lies on the sea bed
and below are genuinely precious. Hon. Members are aware how resources
can be badly exploited—I am sure
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T12:24:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for South East Cornwall knows that some countries have badly
exploited resources through their fishing practices. That gives us
pause to say, “Simply having a free-for-all will not
work.” My hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset can be
assured, however, that the attitude of the United Kingdom is to ensure
that, if international regulation does curtail freedoms, it must be
because that is the right thing to do. We have to take our
responsibilities seriously, and our responsibility to the environment
and the need to ensure that the regulations cover that adequately are
as important as ensuring that opportunities for prosperity are not lost
through over-regulation or complicated
bureaucracy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0001.htm#13090627000305">The
“area”, or the common heritage of mankind, is the area
beyond the limits of any coastal state’s continental shelf.
Under article 76 of the UN convention, a coastal state is entitled to a
continental shelf of at least 200 nautical miles from
coastal baselines, and more where the slope 
<?notus-xml column=623?>of the continental margin meets certain specified criteria. This
entitlement is without prejudice to the question of delimitation of the
continental shelf between states with opposite or adjacent coasts. The
exception to the rule is for a small islet or rock that cannot support
economic life. Under the UN convention, such rocks only generate a
territorial area—a maritime zone up to 12 nautical miles from
coastal
baselines.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000306" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0001.htm#13090627000306">The
UK has one such rock which is sometimes the subject of academic debate.
That is Rockall, some 186 nautical miles west of St Kilda in the Outer
Hebrides of Scotland. Anyone who has seen this rock, or seen pictures,
will well understand why we could not claim that it could support
economic life, being only a jagged spike of rock jutting up some 60
feet above sea level. Therefore, and contrary to some of the sometimes
ill-informed comments about Rockall, the United Kingdom does not regard
Rockall as capable of generating a continental shelf of its own. Does
this mean that deep sea mining could take place in the vicinity of
Rockall? No. While the UK uses a baseline on St Kilda—which,
coincidentally, is uninhabited but has in the past supported a human
population—the UK claims a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical
miles in a westerly direction, way out into an area known as the Hatton
Rockall plateau. Other states have overlapping continental shelf claims
in the same area, but while the claims exist and their validity is yet
to be considered by the appropriate international body, the area does
not fall within the definition of one</hs_Para>

be clear, deep sea mining as provided for by the Bill, would not take
place anywhere near the coast of the UK, or the UK’s overseas
territories, or any other coastal state for that matter. Indeed, most
of the current applications relate to areas in the Pacific ocean, as my

have described the “where”, now let me explain the
“what”. As hon. Members appreciate, we are not talking
about hydrocarbons, at least not at the moment. My notes suggest that
it is safe to say that many hon. Members will be unfamiliar with the
mineral types, but the debate suggests that they have made themselves
very familiar with the mineral types we are discussing. Those minerals
currently being explored for in the deep sea are composite mineral
deposits, in formulations unique to the sea bed, which is why they are
so special.</hs_Para>

there are international regulations in place for the exploration of
three mineral types in the deep sea. The first, polymetallic nodules,
have already been the subject of discussion today. Polymetallic or
manganese nodules contain manganese, copper, cobalt and nickel, and
are—as far as the FCO is concerned—potato-shaped balls
generally found on the sea bed surface. I have no information about
whether they may be tennis-ball sized, and it is the official view of
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that they are potato-shaped balls.
They are generally found partially buried in sediment, and cover vast
plains in the deepest areas of the sea bed.</hs_Para>

there are polymetallic sulphides. These, mainly sulphide deposits, are
found in ocean ridges and seamounts, and often carry high
concentrations of copper, zinc  
<?notus-xml column=624?>and lead, in addition to gold and silver, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T12:29:55"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North East Somerset will be pleased to hear. Not for the
first time, he is right on the ball—the tennis ball-sized ball.
Such deposits are associated with previous volcanic activity, where the
deposits have built up over time via plumes from vents. Where such
vents are active, they tend to be places of unique fauna and flora.
However, mining would take place only when such sites were extinct, not
least because of the very high temperatures associated with live vents.
That deals with one of the questions that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T12:30:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Shipley raised. There is no question of mining such
areas when they are live, because frankly the temperatures would make
it impossible.</hs_Para>

cobalt, manganese, lead, tellurium, bismuth and platinum. Such minerals

regulations are already based. There is already a double lock. The
reason that UK legislation provides for licences is to ensure that
those whom the UK sponsors for licence applications to the ISA have
already passed the standards that this House, and this country, would
expect from those involved in mineral extraction and exploration.
Once<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T12:35:57"></hs_TimeCode> the UK has
been satisfied, the second lock comes into operation. That involves the

is no difference between us on the importance of this matter. In answer
to some of the hon. Gentleman’s previous questions, there has
not, to date, been any challenge to the existing arrangements. Only two
licences have been granted under the 1981 legislation. The original
reason for introducing those temporary provisions was that the
possibility of Klondike-type activity was in the minds of companies in
the early 1980s. That proved to be a false expectation, however, and
the pace of exploration has been slow. The reason for introducing this
legislation now is that we anticipate the pace picking up, given the
increase in information and technological
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T12:36:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000322" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0001.htm#13090627000322">In
the interim, however, the environmental protections in section 5 of the
1981 legislation have proved entirely sufficient, as have the
inspections. If the hon. Gentleman does not believe that and wishes to
raise a challenge to what we have done, he is entitled to do so. He is
right to be concerned about this, but I am genuinely not aware of any
challenges to those who have taken licences through the United Kingdom.
We must protect for the future, however, and I will go on to explain
how that is being covered by the ISA, how we are dealing with
negotiations as we look forward four or five years to mineral
exploitation—which is not anticipated yet—and how we are
involved with the ISA in relation to that.

immensely expensive. If a company is to get down and explore the
resources in deep sea, that will mean a very expensive financial
commitment. Companies have not come forward because it has not been
worth their while to do so, but the world is moving on. There is no
evidence to suggest that anything in UK regulation has been in any way
off-putting; indeed, quite the contrary. The most recent company to go
through the process made reference to the helpfulness of the British

me make a little more progress. When one thinks of the offshore, what
inevitably springs to mind first is the search for oil and gas.
However, industry has yet to express an interest in possible supplies
of hydrocarbons in the deep sea, which is why no international
regulations have been developed for their exploration. That is not to
say that it will not happen. It may sound odd to suggest that
international regulations for the exploration of hydrocarbons would be
needed when exploration for hydrocarbons is not new. Multinational
corporations are exploiting hydrocarbons all around the world, often in
very deep water, but the point is that when we talk of the deep sea and
“the area”, we talk of the role of the 
<?notus-xml column=627?>International Seabed Authority in managing the resources. So any
exploration or exploitation would need to be under those ISA

assurance, however, that there is no question of the UK ceding any
powers to the EU, which is represented on the ISA for two reasons.
First, a number of states without maritime interests want the EU to
represent them, and secondly, a number of areas in the convention on
the law of the sea fall within Community competence. They are listed in

in minerals and fishing, and there is no intention to go any

minerals or anything else. As far as we are aware, however, the issue
does not arise at present. The legislation has encouraged companies to
operate in accordance with the rules because it is in their interests
to do so. The costs of exploitation of resources in the deep sea are
such that a company would not wish to be involved unless it was

have been involved if there were disputes. We have moved on from that,
although it is still a first-come, first-served business as the
licenses are processed. The ISA is the stakeholder and once it has
granted a licence for a particular piece of the sea bed, that is it.

hon. Member for Brent North raised some environmental concerns. We have
made it clear that the ISA should consult relevant NGOs in developing
mining regulations. That goes to the heart of the issue of where we go
from here. As has been made clear, the expectation is that the licences
being sought will be for exploration. There is a distinction between
exploration and exploitation. Exploitation under the wider scope of the
legislation is not expected in the next four or five years. At present
the ISA is consulting member states about what their regulations should
be for that mining and exploitation. The UK has a crucial role to play

me again deal with the point about section 5 of the 1981 Act to which
we may return in Committee. My note from my colleague says that nobody
has suggested before that section 5 is inadequate, and that although
the Act can change the duties imposed on the Secretary of State, it is
for the ISA to establish environmental standards for applications from
other countries. We have our own standards, but a double lock and a
double check are in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T12:55:04"></hs_TimeCode>. I am

have answered a number of specific questions, but  I have not
dealt with some key parts of the Bill that I would like to address. Of
course, if hon. Members have further questions, I am happy to take
interventions. The 1981 Act was passed at a time when the prospects for
a United Nations agreement on deep-sea mining were uncertain. The
United Kingdom, along with a number of other countries, therefore
decided to enact its own legislation to enable the Government to
license British companies to undertake deep-sea mining. That was
coupled with a system under which the various other countries that had
enacted legislation would reciprocally recognise each other’s
licences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000352" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000352">The
1981 Act provides for the Secretary of State to issue exploration and
exploitation licences, and for licences issued by reciprocating
countries to be recognised. It also made provision for the revocation
of licences where, for example, there was a threat to safety or the
welfare of persons, or there was a need to protect the fauna and flora
of the deep-sea bed—even then, such issues were a matter of
concern to this House. As we have discussed, the Act also included
provision in section 5 to place a strong obligation on the Secretary of
State, in exercising his or her powers, to have regard to the
protection of the marine environment. That is likely to be unchanged by
the new Bill, but I have given a commitment to the House that we will
take a hard look at whether there is 
<?notus-xml column=631?>genuinely any need to consider that further, and we will do so. The
Government expect any company that we sponsor, as well as those
sponsored by other states, to comply with the highest environmental
standards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000353" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000353">Although
certain UK companies were interested in deep-sea mining, in fact no
mining was conducted in accordance with the licences issued under the
1981 Act. The UN convention on the law of the sea was adopted in 1982,
with part XI dealing with deep-sea mining. However, the United Kingdom,
again in the company of a number of our allies, did not find those
provisions acceptable. We did not believe that they were conducive to
encouraging commercial companies to engage in deep-sea mining. We
therefore did not become a party to the convention at that time, even
though most of the other provisions were acceptable and, indeed,
welcome, to us.</hs_Para>

that I very much endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for South East
Cornwall said about the importance of the convention; it has rightly
been called the “constitution of the oceans”. The United
Kingdom is a strong supporter of the convention, which we believe,
overall, provides an appropriate balance between the rights of the
various users of the seas. As a maritime nation, it is especially
important to the United Kingdom that the international rules on the law
of the sea should be clear and fair. A number of colleagues have
mentioned that our good friend—and our closest or oldest ally,
whichever is the current term—the United States has not yet
ratified the convention. I know that the Administration in Washington
have expressed an eager desire to do so, and we wish them well with the

I have said, the UK, in common with other industrialised countries, did
not feel able to participate in the original convention because of the
terms of part XI. There was a general recognition that it was
unsatisfactory for the industrialised countries to remain outside the
convention. So in 1990 the then Secretary-General of the United
Nations, Mr Perez de Cuellar, convened informal consultations, which
continued for several years. The UK played a key role and the result
was the adoption by the United Nations General Assembly 
<?notus-xml column=632?>of an agreement on the implementation of part XI of the convention in
July 1994<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T13:01:18"></hs_TimeCode>. Such

part XI agreement is particularly pertinent to the Bill. It remedied
the major defects of the original convention and, in particular, it
addressed the costs to states parties and ensured that they were kept
to a reasonable level. It clarified and streamlined the procedures for
the approval of applications to explore for or exploit the mineral
resources of the deep-sea bed. The agreement reduced the possibility
for the so-called Enterprise, an international organisation composed of
states parties, to participate in exploitation or exploration. It
emphasised that decision making in the authority should normally be by
consensus. It resolved satisfactorily the problem of how to ensure
equitable representation of all states in the council, including the
industrialised and developing states, as well as the consumers of
metals and land-based producers.</hs_Para>

commercial principles. It emphasised that the system of payments to the

adoption of the part XI agreement paved the way for the United Kingdom

convention. At the time it was concluded that it did—although,
as I think it is fair to say, only just. Obviously the intention behind
the 1981 Act was not to implement the convention, which had not even
been adopted when the Act was enacted, but the essential elements were
thought to be sufficient. In particular, as we have seen, the Act
provided for the issue of licences to prospective contractors and we
are satisfied that that gives the United Kingdom sufficient powers in
relation to such contractors to comply with the requirements of the

engineering and marine science, and how it would give British companies

Bill is really about the balance between commercial companies’
need to find the resources that the world seeks and environmental
protection. It is also about saying, “The United Kingdom is open
for business in this sphere.” We can say to any company that
seeks the United Kingdom’s sponsorship of an application for
polymetallic sulphides or cobalt-rich crusts, “Yes, we can
sponsor your application.” But at present, without this Bill,
because of the changes in technology, if they were applying for
minerals outside the scope of the legislation, we would have to turn
such companies away. That is why the change is necessary.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T13:12:07"></hs_TimeCode> Government
simply do not believe that that would be the correct position for our
country to be in. At its heart, the Bill is designed to enable the

we have discussed this morning, the Bill is quite a technical measure,
with all the substantive amendments to the 1981 Act being set out in a
schedule to the Bill. I could say a good deal about each of the
amendments, but that might stretch the patience of the House, so I will
not go through them in any great detail. We have covered a lot in the
interventions and discussions that we have had. The point to make is
that the Act is being brought up to date in relation to the sort of
minerals that are now available for exploitation and in relation to
changes in the law. It deals with some of the technical aspects
relating to Scotland and other jurisdictions, but it keeps at its heart
the need to balance commercial opportunity with environmental
protection, which has already proved to be
successful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T13:13:23"></hs_TimeCode>. But
none of us is naive, and none of us can forget that there are states
that operate differently. Without being absolutely certain that
international regulation will follow the sort of intentions that we in
this House would have, the Government will not be happy. In our
dealings with the ISA, we will look to ensure that that works its way
through.</hs_Para>

reciprocal recognition is brought up to date. They provide for

we have heard, despite the Bill’s title and the 1981 Act, no
mining or exploitation has been conducted in the deep sea by a UK

this is probably five years off for polymetallic nodules and longer for
other mineral types.</hs_Para>

Indian ocean. Exploration regulations for polymetallic sulphides were

this year’s annual meeting, the ISA’s council discussed a
paper on the process towards development of a regulatory framework for
the exploitation of polymetallic nodules. As I have said, so far the
activity in relation to deep-sea mining has been confined to
exploration, but the time for exploitation—that is,
mining—is coming. I know that the secretariat to the authority
is acutely aware of the challenges that will be posed by the
development of regulations for the exploitation of polymetallic
nodules. It has, therefore, sensibly engaged a well-respected team of
consultants to look at the issues. I have here a copy of the
consultants’ report, which is on the authority’s website.
It sets out clearly and carefully the issues with which the authority
will have to grapple. It is entitled, “Towards the Development
of a Regulatory Framework for Polymetallic Nodule Exploitation in the
Area”, and I commend it to the House and to colleagues who have
expressed their interest in the affair
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T13:17:13"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T13:17:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000389" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000389">It
is worth reiterating two points that the UK made clear in our
statement. First, we emphasised that polymetallic nodule exploitation
must be conducted in accordance with the highest environmental
standards. Secondly—I believe we were alone in the states that
spoke to make this point—we called for full engagement with all
stakeholders, including contractors, technology providers and
non-governmental organisations, in the development of a regulatory
regime. I hope that that is of interest to the House and its
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T13:17:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000390" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000390">I
repeat those points because they are essential and lie at the heart of
our approach. It is only by working together to develop a regime that
we will be able to strike the right balance between protecting the
environment and encouraging commercial enterprises. Stakeholders need
to pool their knowledge and expertise, including that in the economics
of deep-sea mining, the technology available and the biology of the
environment involved, in order to begin to understand the full picture
and reach the best solutions. We see environmental NGOs as important
contributors in that process. Officials already engage with NGOs at
authority meetings. I had a meeting with officials in advance of this
Second Reading debate and have promised more consultations in advance
of future meetings. We see this as an ongoing
collaboration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T13:18:30"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T13:18:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000391" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000391">The
Government believe that, given the advances in technology, a likely
increase in future demand for mineral resources and a steady if not
increasing cost for those resources, deep sea-bed mining is inevitable.
It is a question of when, not if. In other words, deep-sea 
<?notus-xml column=637?>mining is going to happen and we could not stop it even if we wanted to.
The fact that companies have started to take up exploration licences
from the ISA when previously they were the domain of research
institutes is a sign of a new phase in development. A UK-registered
company is one of those that have taken up a licence and it is our
clear intention to be at the forefront of this emerging industry. It is
important that the UK should be in that position. This is an
opportunity for us to ensure that our values, particularly in the
protection of the environment, should be taken into
account.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000392" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000392">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T13:14:52"></hs_TimeCode>

place to influence developments. We believe that, as a responsible
sponsoring and licensing state, we will be able to fulfil our
obligations to ensure that the highest environmental standards are
adopted and applied by our licensees in the work that they carry out. I
can also assure the House that we will make use of our leadership role

rather like the Grand Old Duke of York, the Prime Minister has since

Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling), the last
Labour Chancellor, reduced the budget deficit by about a third by the
end of 2010 through his stimulatory measures, but it has now been stuck
at about £120 billion after flatlining for most of the past
three
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000418" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000418">The
current Chancellor has, through his enormous expenditure and benefits
cuts, persistently squeezed virtually every last drop of demand out of
the economy. That is a counter-intuitive and self-destructive policy if
ever there was one, because it has plainly not reduced the deficit, but
extended austerity indefinitely. A policy that will reduce the deficit
significantly is patently needed. The obvious way to do that is to take
public sector-driven stimulatory measures to kick-start real growth,
but as the Chancellor has a fetish for cutting and is adamantly opposed
to giving the public sector any role in promoting growth, I submit that
my Bill is the next best
option.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000419" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000419">First,
following the revelations of which we have heard repeatedly in the past
few months of colossal tax scams perpetrated by US multinationals
Starbucks, Apple, Facebook and Amazon—I recognise that those
scams are more or less exactly the same as those perpetrated by a great
many UK multinationals—the Bill proposes that the tax details
and implied tax liabilities of both the wealthiest individuals and the
biggest corporations are made public, and that the beneficial owners of
companies 
<?notus-xml column=641?>who hide behind nominee shareholdings are also made known. That has
repeatedly been discussed but never done. My Bill proposes that it
should now happen. The tax enforcement that will result from what is
revealed will raise tens of billions of pounds for the Exchequer and
significantly deplete the deficit and interest payments on the debt.
Therefore, the Bill tackles the extreme opacity in the tax affairs of
both the largest companies and the wealthiest individuals in the UK by
requiring that the tax returns of the top 250 in each group are put on
public
record.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000420" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000420">Four
criteria are used to define the 250 largest companies, starting with
the FTSE 100. The Bill will ensure that other companies with
substantial sales, profits and numbers of employees are also required
to disclose. As a result of my Bill, companies that seek to avoid UK
corporation tax but that still have a significant undertaking in this
country will, for the first time, be required to disclose the full
range of their tax dispositions. On individuals of highest net
worth—to use the commonly used phrase—the Bill will
reveal how income is commonly shifted into capital gains, and in turn
reduced by allowances and relief. In respect of both companies and
individuals, the data will enable the tax abuse that, according to Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and Treasury data, costs this
country at least £35 billion a year, to be effectively addressed
for the first
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000421" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000421">Secondly,
multinational corporations have, as hon. Members know, hidden their
activities behind complex and often secret corporate networks that
conceal their tax liability—the networks are set up to do
that—especially if a subsidiary is incorporated in a tax haven.
The Bill requires any multinational corporation to publish the accounts
of all its subsidiaries on public
record.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000422" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000422">Thirdly,
the Bill requires that companies identify their beneficial owners and
pass the details to Companies House. That is important because the
registered legal owners can easily disguise who is behind a company,
and thus present an entirely false view of its structure. For example,
many quoted companies list only some of their shares on the stock
exchange; the rest are in beneficial ownership. Limited liability
partnerships are widely used for tax abuse, because members of an LLP
are taxed, but not the partnership itself. If the details of ownership
are known and put on the public record, the tax liabilities can be
correctly assessed. Unlimited companies are almost routinely inserted
into major corporation group structures in order to disguise ownership
or control, often in ways that are designed to mislead about the true
nature of transactions being undertaken. Obviously, foreign branches
must be included if an enormous loophole is not to be created in the
disclosure of beneficial
ownership.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000423" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000423">I
would be the first to recognise that to presume that a company bent on
tax avoidance or other dishonest purposes will necessarily comply with
its obligation to disclose its beneficial owners is, frankly, naive.
The Bill would therefore also place a new obligation on UK banks to
report the information they collect on their limited company clients
under money-laundering regulations, including the real trading address
of a company, who its directors and beneficial owners really are, and
where they are located. The banks would be required to submit that
information to Companies House, which would then be required to publish
it. The banks  
<?notus-xml column=642?>would also have to supply the information to HMRC, which would then be
required to demand a tax return from any company with a bank
account.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000424" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000424">The
sanctions—and sanctions are the only thing that will make the
legislation work—for failing to supply any information demanded
from the company by Companies House or HMRC would be either the removal
of limited liability status or making directors and beneficial owners
liable for the debts. Under the Bill’s provisions, HMRC would
also be granted the power to access the company’s bank account
data, so that estimated tax assessments could be raised if the company
refused to supply accounts. Again, the directors and beneficial owners
would be held responsible and would have to pay the consequential
tax.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000425" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000425">In
order to avoid an obvious loophole, the requirement for a company to
have information on its beneficial ownership and its accounts on public
record—on its own website, or wherever—would be extended
to the tax havens in Britain’s Crown dependencies and overseas
territories, although of course only if the company in question had a
beneficial owner outside that
territory.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000426" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000426">Finally,
the Bill deals with the question of trusts and would require that they,
too, declare the true identity of their settler, the trustees and
beneficiaries to HMRC. If they do not, the sanction would be that the
trust property would pass to the Crown. Trust data will also be placed
on public record, but only in the case of those with significant assets
or income, and those that control companies—I am not worried
about trusts that are relatively trivial in their economic impact.
Those measures are necessary to enforce the requirements. The
information has always been available to the Government, but under both
parties there has been an unwillingness to use the measures that are
patently available to ensure that tax is paid in accordance with what
Parliament has
determined.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000427" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000427">It
is no exaggeration to say that the effect of these measures on the UK
system’s capability would be nothing less than transformational.
We have repeatedly been shocked by multinational corporations and their
armies of City lawyers and accountants regularly running rings around
the UK tax authorities—sometimes, one might think, with the
apparent complicity of Government—but that is not inevitable or
irreversible. My Bill will redress a massive injustice in tax burdens,
put a stop to enormous tax abuse by large companies which has persisted
for far too long and make a huge contribution to reducing the budget
deficit. I commend it to the
House.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_06_PT_1/04163093475FED7E5AAEDA2E6A6C7EC1F30AC42B" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="6 September 2013">Friday

Rees-Mogg:</Member></B> That is a complete non-sequitur. The issue is
bad regulation, not too much or too little. It is perfectly logical to
argue that there was too much bad regulation prior to the financial
crisis and not simply think that we need more to solve the problem. I
would argue that the Governor’s eyebrow is not something that
can be regulated particularly effectively. No Act of Parliament,
powerful though Acts of Parliament are, can determine how the Governor
should raise his eyebrows or not; on the other hand, that was an
effective way of regulating banking and ensuring that banks did not
become overextended.
Ticking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T13:42:09"></hs_TimeCode> boxes to
comply with regulation often ensures that people obey the detail of it,
but get away from the spirit. That is certainly what happened with some
of the bank capital regulations prior to the financial crisis and some
of the behaviour of financial institutions, which followed the letter
of the law but got into a great deal of trouble. It was not that there
was too much or too little regulation; it was that there was bad
regulation.</hs_Para>

almost impossible to get taxation at much more than 38% of GDP. The
issue was that spending was so high, not that taxation was too low. The
ability to squeeze imaginary rich people to get a lot of money coming
in was simply not there. Such fiscal tightening 
<?notus-xml column=644?>on the taxation side as was possible was undertaken by the Government,
but had they gone as far as the right hon. Gentleman proposes, any
prospect of economic recovery would have been postponed. The tightening
would have been too great, which would have harmed the economy. It
would have taken money out of the economy simply to put it into the
Government’s coffers. That would have led to a shrinkage of the
economy, not least because people would have changed their affairs so
as not to pay that extra burden of
taxation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T13:45:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

sector is waiting to encourage the recovery as it begins and as the

set out my broad-brush objection in principle to what the right hon.
Gentleman has proposed, I want to move on to the details of the Bill.
And here it gets worse. The Bill is an astonishing, fundamental attack
on some of the basic principles that we ought to enjoy. As a
taxpayer—I am sad to say that I am not in the top 250, although
I would not mind if I were—I have a right to privacy. The
Government do not have a right to publish my financial information;
that is my private, confidential affair. I am not advocating tax
evasion, which is a criminal activity. It is quite right that it should
be criminal, and the Government should enforce those laws. However, the
prevention of that crime does not require the Government to deny people
their fundamental right to privacy.</hs_Para>

most personal and intimate financial details, as set out in their tax
return, should not be made available to all and sundry, and it is quite
right that the tax authorities should maintain vigorous rules of
confidentiality, even when appearing before Select Committees of the
House of Commons. It is a right that we all enjoy as British subjects
that our financial affairs are a private matter. Yes, we have to pay a
degree of taxation and, yes, we have to make declarations to the
Revenue, but we do so on the understanding that they will be kept
confidential. Once this begins with the top 250, the next stage will be
the top 1,000 and it will develop further so that nobody has the right
to maintain privacy of their own financial affairs. I thus oppose this
provision very

oppose less strongly the requirements for disclosure by public
companies because they have exchanged a right to privacy in return for
limited liability, so they are expected to make disclosure and are
obliged to do so to their shareholders. Clause 1 deals with
“Disclosure of financial information by large companies”
and from the perspective of a shareholder as an investor, I believe
that I am entitled to such information anyway; and with large public
companies, the shareholder list is so extensive that, once that
information is given to shareholders, it is effectively in the public
domain.</hs_Para>

add at this point that my background and career have been in investment
management, so I know that the more information we get from listed
companies, the easier it is to do the job of an investment manager and
the better the investments it is possible to make. Perhaps
inadvertently, then, the right hon. Gentleman will help the investment
community in that, if clause 1 were introduced, financial analysts in
the City of London would practically be dancing with joy at their
ability to find out every single financial statement of large private
companies. It might be quite helpful in stopping them from hiding
unwelcome, loss-making subsidiaries somewhere at the bottom of the
balance sheet, tucking them away under a contingent liability. Because
this is essentially dealing with already public companies, I would make
no objection to the clause, but I would maintain the privacy of
individuals—and of
trust<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T13:51:52"></hs_TimeCode>s.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000446" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000446">I
do not think that trusts should be attacked in this way. Trusts are, in
fact, one of the glories of the British legal system. They are much
less understood on the 
<?notus-xml column=646?>continent, but they allow many protections to be built into ownership.
Trusts allow the protection of minors in how they are structured and
they allow continuity in the holding of assets, including allowing some
of this country’s great historic treasures to be kept within the
country through the trust structure of ownership. Putting unduly
onerous charges on them and requirements to report would, I think, be
unreasonable.</hs_Para>

at the detail, the idea is that, if trusts do not meet the
requirements, their income should go to the Crown. That is what
happened in the Court of Wards in the 17th century. It was one of the
things that caused such trouble between Parliament and the King because
the Crown was able to take the estates of minors and effectively ruin
them during the minority of the beneficiary. We moved away from that
type of arbitrary rule of giving power to the Crown—in this
context, it is not a personal Crown; the Crown is the
Executive—to do things such as take funds from private property,
not in the form of tax, but in a regulatory way, squeezing income for a
certain period until onerous requirements are met.</hs_Para>

think that would be an extraordinarily unsatisfactory way of
proceeding. It would undermine the right of property—again a
fundamental right that we ought to enjoy. Going back to the Magna
Carta, the Crown cannot take property away from people unless there is
a judgment—a judgment in a court—against them; it cannot
be done on the basis of some failure to meet some bureaucratic
standard. This seems to me to illustrate where the Conservative, a
believer in the rights of property and a believer in the individual,
stands up against the socialist, a believer in the collective and the
rights of the collective to override the rights of property. I stand
four-square in favour of the rights of property and four-square, too,
in favour of the rights of the Crown dependencies, by and large, to
regulate their own affairs.</hs_Para>

Bill is again onerous in what it requires to be done, by Order in
Council, for territories that, by and large, are no longer treated as
mere colonies. The Crown dependencies are allowed to develop and run
their own affairs and have their own elective councils to take charge
of those affairs. The Bill is a throwback to how this country behaved
in the 19th century when we felt we had a greater right to order about
the non-dominions—with dominions starting, first with Canada, in
the latter part of the 19th century. We seem to be taking the Crown
dependencies back to a period before dominion status started to be
granted. I consider that to be undemocratic, and unfair on them. It
attacks their fundamental livelihoods, namely, their ability to provide

written. It seems to me that, when people are being accused of avoiding
tax, it is the job of Parliament to pass good laws that make that
avoidance difficult, and to make the tax collectible by Act of
Parliament, rather than turning the position the other way round and
saying “We are not very good at writing tax law, and therefore

sensible understanding of the tax law that “aggressive tax

to scrape things back rather than charging people.” I should
prefer to see Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs using the law as

tax. Sometimes they allow people to do that because, although they do
not much like it, they cannot stop it. Let us take, for example, people
who bring cigarettes into this country from abroad. There is an
agreement with the European Union that, if people have bought
cigarettes in another member state, they are entitled to bring them in.
In that way they collectively avoid, probably, billions of
pounds’ worth of tax. Duty 
<?notus-xml column=648?>free is tax avoidance, a form of tax avoidance that some of us rather
enjoy when we have been a bit further afield than the European Union.
Pension funds are tax avoidance. Individual savings accounts are tax
avoidance. All those elements of tax avoidance are elements of which
the Government approve. It is, I think, unreasonable to say that people
should arrange their affairs so as not to take advantage of legitimate
tax avoidance that is in the legislation—and who is then to
decide whether the tax avoidance provided by pension contributions is
legitimate or the tax avoidance provided by some business start-up
scheme has suddenly become illegitimate? It is the law that should be
deciding these things, and the best way to solve the problem is not by
denying people the right to privacy, not by confiscating their
property, not by excessive and onerous burdens on the taxpayer, but by
having a much simpler and clearer tax system without the Government

Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher) has introduced this Bill
with the very best of intentions. I am sure he wants to achieve for the
people of our country the same as I want to achieve for them: improved
conditions and high-quality public services. However, I am by no means
convinced that the way to do that is by introducing measures such as
those contained in the snappily titled United Kingdom Corporate and
Individual Tax and Financial Transparency

I first read this Bill, I did not know where to begin in expressing my
thoughts as to just how bad a piece of proposed legislation it was. I
do not criticise the

sure that Richard Murphy, who prepared it, has done an excellent job,
and I have read the article he wrote about it. I am sure that he, too,
had only the best intentions when he put this Bill together. However,
it does absolutely nothing to increase the wealth of this nation. It
does nothing to help generate new industry and new services, or to
promote economic growth. I am prepared to accept that the Bill is born
out of intentions that were good, but I fear that it will have nothing
but the opposite effect.</hs_Para>

Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher) for bringing the Bill to

concern I share. Does my hon. Friend agree, however, that a better way

Nuttall:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. My
view—I suspect it might well be that of my hon. Friend,
too—is that if the Government wish to increase the tax yield on
behalf of the nation and to make it easier for individuals and
companies to abide by their obligations, the way forward is to pass
simpler tax legislation that we can all understand. I am sure that my
hon. Friend has greater expertise in these matters than I do, but I
have always found tax legislation particularly difficult to follow. I
do not know the latest figures for Tolley’s tax guides, but when
I was in practice in the legal profession they were substantial volumes
and I suspect that they can only have grown in the past few years. Each
one, on one tax alone, is a substantial
doorstop<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T14:11:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000472" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000472">It
is no surprise that loopholes are discovered by accountants and tax
advisers because the law is so complex and convoluted. There are so
many different taxes, some of which overlap, that there is scope for
tax loopholes to arise by accident. Governments do not set out to
create tax loopholes other than those that are set out in legislation
by design, they are precisely what they are called—tax
loopholes.</hs_Para>

has been mentioned, it is often the Government’s desire to
create what might be called loopholes, such as ISAs. I have been
waiting to get to this point, as it gives me my second opportunity this
morning to refer to ISA. This time, I do not mean the International
Seabed Authority but the individual savings account. Before I looked
into deep-sea mining, that was the only form of ISA I had heard of.
ISAs are a form of tax avoidance set up to replace personal equity
plans and were established as a means of encouraging people to save.
They were set up to encourage private individuals to save in a
tax-efficient manner in that they would not have to pay income tax on
the income their account had earned. That could be called a tax
loophole, but it is a legal tax loophole set up by the
Government.</hs_Para>

me return to the Bill. We must draw a distinction between tax evasion
and tax avoidance. Let us be clear: tax evasion is already illegal, but
almost weekly in this House I hear the two terms being confused. People
say that someone has been a tax avoider, suggesting that they have
acted illegally. Well, if they have, they are not a tax avoider; they
are a tax evader, and they should be brought to book and prosecuted. I
have no sympathy with them whatsoever. If someone has deliberately
under-declared their income, I entirely agree that they should be
brought to book by the Revenue and Customs, that they should be
prosecuted and, in certain cases, sent to prison. Let us not beat about
the bush. I am sure I am in agreement with my hon. Friend the Minister
on that. I do not want to go easy on people who have deliberately
avoided their obligations to society by breaching our 
<?notus-xml column=651?>tax legislation in such a way as to avoid paying their dues and
demands under the law. That increases the burden on
everyone
else.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000475" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000475">Of
course, we already have measures in place to provide the mechanism for
the Revenue to ferret out these people. It can open up inquiries into
their tax affairs, and it frequently does. A whole industry exists
around dealing with inquiries into people’s tax affairs. My
accountant sent me details of an insurance policy that I could take out
for that very occasion. I could pay a premium, and then if my tax
affairs were investigated by the Revenue, the policy would cover my
accountancy costs while the inquiry was dealt with.</hs_Para>

returning to the Bill, our Government have already taken a great deal
of action on tax avoidance and tax evasion. Since 2010, the Government
have collected over £23 billion in extra tax by challenging the
tax arrangements of large businesses. I am informed that, by tackling
transfer pricing alone, the Government have collected £2 billion
since 2010. It may well be that the right hon. Member for Oldham West
and Royton is introducing the Bill because he thinks that those figures
are not high enough. If the measures in the Bill are such a good idea,
why, in the 13 years of the previous Labour Government, under Tony
Blair and the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr
Brown), was none of these measures introduced? If it is such a good
idea now, why was it not such a good idea then? I do not know whether
my hon. Friend the Minister ever went to the Treasury team at the time
with this Bill and said, “Look, here is the answer to our
problems.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000477" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000477"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Deputy Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="1050" UID="13090627000815" xid="293" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000815">Mr

incorporation; its company number; the jurisdictions in which it
trades; the trading name it uses in each jurisdiction if that is

hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset, there may well be merit
in respect of a public company putting this information in the public

This clause gives the revenue just one month to complete the task. The
tax returns need not be in until 31 January, and within one month it
has to have carried out this rather complicated calculation, which I
will not go into the details of. Subsection (2) requires HMRC to
publish, no later than 15 March each year, the 250 tax returns for the
previous tax year ended  on 5 April that ranked
highest on the listing produced in accordance with the provisions of
subsection (1). Subsection (3) requires that they should not
be anonymised, and this is the crucial point about this

wealth and the income it produces. To return to the point with which I

the wealthiest individuals in our country and all the tax they pay

may be reading this wrongly, but there does not appear to be any
question whatsoever about the size of the company. It does not say that
the company has to be of a certain size; it simply says that if a
company opens a bank account, it has a duty to report it. That covers
literally thousands and thousands of bank accounts. It would increase
enormously the burden on our financial institutions and banks at a time
when we want them to concentrate on the much more important task of
getting the British economy moving again and on lending to businesses.
I do not want our bankers to have to fill in forms and write down the
names and addresses of companies and the addresses to which they write.
That would stop them doing their primary task, which is to play their
part in getting the British economy moving and growing. As we know, it

Gilmore</B> (Edinburgh East) (Lab):</Member> I welcome this opportunity
to raise an important aspect of employment and support allowance and
the work capability assessment. This is my fourth Adjournment debate on
the subject. In each debate, I have started by highlighting the scale
of the problems with the benefit. Although many people who listen to or
read this debate will be familiar with the procession of figures, it is
important to put them on the record
again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T14:32:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000508" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000508">Between
the introduction of the assessment in October 2008 and May 2012, 1.47
million new claimants were assessed and 846,800 were declared fit for
work. Of those, 332,300 appealed the decision and 123,700 were
successful and were awarded employment and support allowance. That
means that nearly one in 10 of the assessments has been overturned.
Although the proportion of the assessments that are overturned has
started to fall a little, the overall number remains very high. Those
are the figures for new claims. They do not include the regular
reassessments of those who are already on ESA, nor do they cover all
the incapacity benefit claimants who are being migrated to ESA—a
process that is due to be completed in
2014<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T14:33:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000509" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000509">I
will briefly summarise the progress, or lack of it, with regard to the
other concerns that I have raised in the past 18 months. In May last
year, I argued in favour of a new set of mental health descriptors that
had been drawn up by Mencap, Mind and the National Autistic Society. An
evidence-based review was commissioned to evaluate those descriptors
and I understand that the report is due to be published imminently. In
December, I highlighted the fact that claimants were regularly being
called back for reassessments just months after their previous claims
had been granted on appeal. I regret that that is not being properly
addressed by Ministers. I continue to meet constituents who are still
on that stressful and unnecessary
merry-go-round<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T14:34:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000510" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000510">Just
before the summer recess, I secured a commitment from the Minister that
claimants would be informed that they could have their assessment
recorded, and that the time limits that were preventing that from
happening would be dropped. I continue to urge the Minister, when
assessing whether audio recordings improve the quality of assessments,
to consider the rate of successful appeals, rather than just the demand
among claimants for audio
assessments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000511" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000511">Before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T14:34:40"></hs_TimeCode>
I move on to the specific issue that I want to cover today, I must
highlight the announcement that the Minister made on 22 July. He
admitted that some Atos reports were so poor that staff were being
retrained and additional providers brought in. Given that the
Government now acknowledge that there are major problems with the
assessment process, it is even more important that we ensure that
financial support is available to those who are wrongly found fit for
work. That is what I want to focus on
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000512" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000512">To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T14:35:11"></hs_TimeCode>
put the matter into context, as soon as a claimant contacts the
Department for Work and Pensions to claim ESA, they are paid it at what
is known as the assessment rate, which is equivalent to
jobseeker’s allowance. 
<?notus-xml column=656?>That lasts until they go through the first assessment and a decision is
made on their claim. If they are declared fit for work and believe the
decision is wrong, they can ask the decision maker, who is a DWP
official, to reconsider it before they lodge a formal written appeal
with HM Courts and Tribunals Service. I want to focus on that
in-between period, which is referred to as reconsideration but is
effectively an informal
appeal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000513" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000513">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T14:35:57"></hs_TimeCode>
claimants are not automatically paid ESA at the assessment rate during
that in-between period, they are entitled to it and can apply for it if
they know about it. That entitlement continues if the decision remains
unchanged and the claimant decides to appeal. However, following the
passage of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 and subsequent regulations, that
is set to change. Claimants will have to apply for reconsideration
before they can lodge an appeal, and they will no longer be entitled to
ESA at the assessment rate during that period.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090627000514" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000514">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T14:36:55"></hs_TimeCode>
Minister’s colleague Lord Freud admitted in the other place on
13 February that, as a result of that change, there would be a
“gap in payment”. Initially, that might not appear
problematic. Claimants will be told that they can simply apply for
jobseeker’s allowance instead while their reconsideration
request is being considered, then go back to claiming ESA at the
assessment rate if they go to formal appeal. Leaving aside all the
procedures involved in doing that, there is a serious problem for
people in that position in claiming JSA. It comes with a great degree
of conditionality. In particular, claimants have to be available for
and actively seeking work. They must attend regular work-focused
interviews, undertake job searches and make a minimum number of
applications every week. That in itself may prove tiring or stressful,
and it could exacerbate people’s existing physical or mental
conditions. More importantly, those who apply and fail to meet those
conditions can be sanctioned or refused benefit altogether. I have
encountered situations where Jobcentre Plus has advised claimants that
they cannot claim JSA because they are not fit for work, for example
because they have a fit note—what used to be called a sick
note—from their doctor.</hs_Para>

is not new, but the new mandatory reconsideration stage will interact
with it to have an adverse effect on people who are ill or disabled and
have to apply temporarily for JSA while their ESA claim is undergoing
reconsideration. The state will effectively be telling those people
that they are too fit to claim ESA but too sick or disabled to claim
JSA<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T14:38:29"></hs_TimeCode>—a

mandatory reconsideration has yet to come into full effect, my
constituent Ms Rose Burgess already faces that predicament in a related
situation. She suffers from arthritis and depression, and she applied
for ESA earlier this year. She underwent a face-to-face assessment and
was declared fit for work. She appealed, and the judge upheld the
DWP’s original decision. However, when she then claimed
jobseeker’s allowance, she was told she was ineligible because
she had a fit note from her GP. She was not entitled to ESA, and she
was told that she was not entitled to JSA either. Her condition has
since deteriorated further and she has now reapplied for ESA and is
awaiting the application of her fresh application, but her example
shows how easy it already is for people to slip into the limbo between
ESA and JSA, even without the mandatory reconsideration
period.</hs_Para>

another constituent who suffers from back problems was claiming JSA.
His problem flared up when he was due to attend his work-focused
interview. When he arrived at his jobcentre and explained that he would
be unable to manage to climb up the stairs to where the interview would
take place, he was told that his claim would be ended because he was
not fit for work. He raised the matter vigorously and the situation was
rectified fairly quickly, but that example demonstrates the emphasis
placed by jobcentres on JSA claimants being fit and available for
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000518" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000518">For
people whose claim to ESA is marginal and whose health problems are not
too great—some people might believe that is what I am
describing—a brief period on JSA might be just about manageable.
However, Camberwell Myalgic Encephalomyelitis Support Group has told me
that it currently works with many people who score zero points on their
initial assessment, but who, after appeal, are placed in the support
group. The appeal shows that they have serious health conditions, but
they might find themselves in that position. The Camberwell group says
that many of those whom it helps find that they cannot physically get
to a jobcentre on certain days, as is required under
JSA.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000519" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000519">The
scale of the problem that people are likely to face is exacerbated
because there is less discretion on sanctions than previously. A leaked

claim would be backdated should they appeal and have their fit-for-work
decision overturned. 
<?notus-xml column=658?>However, in many cases, the damage will have been done. With no income

Minister can do a number of things to address the problem. At a
minimum, it would be helpful if he provided the House with information,
first to confirm exactly when the new system of mandatory
reconsiderations will begin. Secondly, he could give the House
information on what alternative sources of income people have if they
cannot claim either ESA or JSA. Thirdly, he could tell us what internal

changes would help at least to alleviate the worst effects of this
policy. One example would be to reintroduce a degree of flexibility
into the sanctions system, so that ESA claimants declared fit for work
and having their claim reconsidered are not subject to normal JSA
sanctions. Alternatively, the Minister could put a statutory limit on
the time DWP can take to conclude the reconsideration process. But the
one thing that would resolve this issue entirely would be to amend the
regulations to allow ESA claimants to continue to receive ESA at the
assessment rate during the reconsideration period. Otherwise many
people who the state will later conclude should not be available for
work will be required to claim a benefit that explicitly requires that
they should be. Many people will end up without any support from the
state, being too fit for ESA, but too sick or disabled for
JSA.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_06_PT_1/1AE02532B3646EBDBDEC853134A3F6F4874AC78F" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="6 September 2013">Friday

regard, I intend to address her main concerns on the length of time a

put the matter at its simplest, the current disputes process does not
work for benefits in general or ESA in particular. The introduction of
the ESA in 2008, and particularly the conversion of incapacity benefit
awards to ESA, has—as the House will know—resulted in a
high volume of appeals, with more than 500,000 last
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000529" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000529">The
Government have taken a series of steps to improve the WCA process but
we accept that people will appeal. The Government do not believe that
it is acceptable to write people off to a lifetime on benefits because
they have a health condition or impairment. Many people with health
conditions are able to sustain 
<?notus-xml column=659?>and progress in employment. Evidence points to the negative impacts of
being without work and that work is generally good for people
regardless of whether they are disabled or
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000530" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000530">The
Department therefore needs to ensure that people currently receiving
incapacity benefit and ESA are supported in preparing for a return to
work where some form of employment is a possibility. Claimants are
being reassessed using the WCA. This is based on the principle that a
health condition or impairment should not automatically be regarded as
a barrier to work. It has been designed to be a more accurate
reflection of an individual’s capability for work, taking
account of modern workplaces, health care and
legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000531" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000531">The
volumes of appeals are placing some strain on the appeals system. We
also recognise that the process can put pressure on claimants too. That
is why a claimant can ask for a decision to be reconsidered. It was
intended that people would ask for this reconsideration in the first
instance if they felt their decision was wrong. In practice, however,
many people do not do so and instead make an appeal from the outset.
This is more costly for the taxpayer; more time consuming and more
stressful for claimants and their families; and, for a significant
number of appellants, unnecessary. I say unnecessary because a
significant number of decisions are overturned on appeal because of new
evidence presented at the tribunal—more than 55% in recent
months. This is mainly oral evidence, which accounts for 70%, but also
includes written evidence that has not been considered by the decision
maker.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000532" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000532">I
hope that hon. Members will agree that we need a process that enables
this evidence to be seen or heard by the decision maker at the earliest
opportunity. Mandatory reconsideration does just that. Another decision
maker will review the original decision, requesting extra information
or evidence as required via a telephone discussion. If this means a
decision can be revised, there is no reason for an appeal—an
outcome that is better for the individual, the Department and the
Tribunals Service. We hope that, because of the robust nature of the
reconsideration and the improved communication, the process will result
in either decisions being changed or claimants making an informed
decision not to escalate their dispute to an appeal

Hoban:</Member></B> The hon. Lady has looked into this matter in
detail, and I am sure she will recollect my comments about where we
seek further medical information from health care professionals, as
nominated by the appellants themselves. The problem is straightforward.
Too often, either the information is not supplied by the health care
professionals from whom we have sought additional medical evidence or
it is supplied too late to 
<?notus-xml column=660?>be taken into account. Where we seek medical evidence, there is a
broader responsibility on those from whom we seek it to respond in a
timely manner. That, too, would help the process.</hs_Para>

to the concerns raised by the hon. Lady. The first was the time it will
take for a reconsideration. Although we are not introducing a statutory
time limit for decision makers, I assure the House that we will have a
process geared to timely decision making. Anything less would be
frankly unacceptable. We owe it to claimants not to delay their right
to exercise their right of appeal. However, the time taken will depend
on whether the claimant intends to provide new
evidence—obtaining it could take some time, as I said in
connection with the first request for further medical
evidence—and whether the decision maker needs to seek further
advice on that evidence from Atos. If there is nothing new for the
decision maker to consider, he or she can get on and make that
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T14:52:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

the key is quality, not speed. There would be no benefit to anyone in
rushing the process, effectively forcing an appeal and then having it
allowed at a hearing some time later. The new process is aimed at
getting decisions right, not simply passing disputes to the tribunal to
resolve.
Equally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T14:52:22"></hs_TimeCode>,
however, it is in no one’s interest for this to be an open-ended
procedure. We will monitor the introduction of the change for the first
six months. In April 2014, we will look at the times taken and consider
whether we have enough information to introduce realistic internal
targets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T14:52:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000537" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000537">During
the mandatory reconsideration phase, when someone is fit for work and
not in work, they will be entitled to jobseeker’s allowance. I
accept that someone seeking a reconsideration is likely to protest to
the jobcentre that they are not fit for work. However, that does not
rule out entitlement to jobseeker’s allowance. That is the case
even where the claimant presents a fit note. Disability employment
advisers, trained by specialist staff from the Department, will work
with those who identify themselves as having a health condition or
disability. They will take into account individual circumstances,
including any advice given by the claimant’s doctor, and will
consider placing limitations on a client’s availability or
modifying their conditionality. There is nothing new about
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T14:53:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000538" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000538">The
hon. Lady also expressed concerns about claimants being sanctioned
while on JSA. Let me address that point. To reiterate, the modified
conditionality militates against a sanction being imposed. If the
adviser has agreed to modify conditionality, it would be perverse if
they then took a heavy-handed approach. As I have previously informed
the House—let me take the opportunity to repeat
this—there are no sanction targets. It was this Government who
removed the sanction targets—they were in place under the
previous Government. We continue to monitor to ensure that sanctions
are applied consistently and only where appropriate. The hon. Lady
asked what would happen if a claimant were subject to a sanction. She
will know—I think she might have served on the Delegated
Legislation Committee that dealt with this—that a claimant can
still apply for hardship payments.</hs_Para>

health condition or impairment should not automatically be regarded as
a barrier to work; in fact, there are many people who juggle work and a
health condition. Such claimants might be disputing their decision, but
at that time they have been through an 
<?notus-xml column=661?>assessment process and are, in the eyes of the law, fit for work. The
appropriate benefit is jobseeker’s allowance, and it is
appropriate that we apply conditionality that is tailored to
claimants’ needs so that we can move them closer to the labour
market and, we hope, back to
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-06T14:54:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090627000540" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/debtext/130906-0002.htm#13090627000540">It
has been suggested that we should pay employment and support allowance
during that period because of the standard of decision making on ESA,
as evidenced by the number of decisions overturned on appeal. Let me
just remind the hon. Lady of the statistics that demonstrate the
quality of the decisions made. Between October 2008 and February 2012,
around 800,000—about 15%—of those decisions that found
the claimant fit for work were overturned on appeal. She will know,
having looked into this, that a significant proportion of decisions are
overturned at tribunal because of oral or written evidence being
presented at the tribunal that has not been discussed with or seen by
the decision maker. It is that new evidence that is the reason for the
overturning of a decision. As I stated earlier, we hope that mandatory
reconsideration will allow that new evidence to be discussed at an
earlier stage, leading to a decision being revised if necessary. We
need to try to accelerate the process so that we can get the decision

They included proposals for improving the ESA forms to encourage

adding an extra two weeks to the process. I am not sure that that would
be in the interests of claimants, as they would face a longer
assessment phase that would take them further away from the market if
they were fit for work. I question whether it is the right approach to
lengthen the process rather than to improve it by making it shorter and
more effective, where possible.

conclusion, the aim of the modifications that we have introduced is to
get the decision right first time, but if claimants believe that we
have not done that in their case, we need a step to put things right

claimants that opportunity. It seeks to address two concerns: the
length of the appeals process and the fact that new evidence can be
brought forward which has an impact on a decision. It is in the best

PSED, which was introduced through the Equality Act 2010, came into
force across Great Britain on 5 April 2011 and comprises a
general duty (s149 of the Act) and specific duties set out in
regulations which vary across England, Scotland and Wales. It was
introduced to ensure that public bodies take account of equality when
carrying out their day-to-day work—in shaping policy, in
delivering services and in relation to their own employees—and
to address the bureaucracy associated with the previous duties on race,
disability and gender. The review was established to examine whether
the PSED is operating as
intended.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090628000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/wmstext/130906m0001.htm#13090628000014">The
Government appointed an independent chair, Rob Hayward OBE, and
steering group to oversee the review. Over the course of 2013,
supported by officials in my Department, they have led an extensive
programme of engagement and evidence-gathering, including a series of
roundtables with experts, site visits to public bodies, an open call
for evidence, and independent qualitative
research.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090628000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/wmstext/130906m0001.htm#13090628000015">The
Government are grateful to the chair and steering group for their
thorough work and welcome their report. The review has not considered
repeal of the PSED. We agree with its conclusion that a full evaluation
should be undertaken in 2016 when the duty will have been in force for
five years. The review has however identified a number of issues
associated with the implementation of the PSED and makes
recommendations for the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC),
for contractors, for public bodies and for Government. We would like to
see these recommendations implemented fully by all relevant parties, in
particular to reduce procurement gold-plating by the public
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090628000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/wmstext/130906m0001.htm#13090628000016">In
relation to the specific duties which apply in England (and
non-devolved bodies in Scotland and Wales), we note there was not
consensus from the steering group but nonetheless accept the
chair’s recommendation to consider the operation and
effectiveness of these duties. Public authorities must be transparent
about their objectives and performance on equality, and it is vital
that the specific duties support this aim. We will therefore keep these
duties under review and work closely with the EHRC as it conducts its
more detailed assessment of the specific
duties.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090628000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/wmstext/130906m0001.htm#13090628000017">We

means, other than judicial reviews, there may be to enforce the PSED.
Recognising 
<?notus-xml column=34?>that many of the concerns identified in the report are not unique to the

judicial review is an important part of the Government’s
programme to tackle public burdens, promote growth and stimulate
economic recovery. I am clear that judicial review is, and will remain,
an important means to hold Government to account where it is acting
unlawfully, but I remain concerned that too often it is being used
either as a campaign tool or to delay or frustrate decisions that have
been properly made. I am also concerned that legal aid resources should
be targeted at those judicial review cases where they are needed most
if the legal aid system is to command public confidence and
credibility.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090628000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/wmstext/130906m0001.htm#13090628000047">A
number of reforms have already been made to the procedural aspects of
judicial review, including removing the right to an oral renewal in a
case certified by the judge as “totally without merit”
and aligning the time limits for bringing a planning or procurement
judicial review with the relevant statutory challenges. A new fee will
soon be introduced for an oral renewal. While these reforms are a
worthwhile first step, it is right that we test the potential for
further substantive reform.</hs_Para>

that end, the paper makes proposals in a number of areas: the
courts’ approach to cases which rely on minor procedural
defects; rebalancing financial incentives; speeding up appeals to the
Supreme Court in a small number of nationally significant cases, which
would extend beyond judicial review; and planning challenges. I also
think it makes sense to explore the potential for reforming the test as
to who can bring a judicial review, as well as whether there are
mechanisms other than judicial review for resolving disputes related to
the public sector equality duty, following a recommendation by the
Public Sector Equalities Steering
Group.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090628000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/wmstext/130906m0001.htm#13090628000049">Having
listened to concerns raised in the Transforming Legal Aid consultation,
which closed in June, this package also includes a proposal in relation
to the payment of legal aid providers in judicial review cases. In
addition to our original proposal that providers would only be
guaranteed payment for their work on a judicial review where permission
is granted by the Court, this consultation proposes that the Legal Aid
Agency will have a discretion to pay providers in certain genuinely
meritorious cases where the provider has been unable to secure a costs
order or costs agreement as part of a

proposals I am publishing today are intended to deliver a much needed
rebalancing of judicial review so that it operates in a more
proportionate manner without undermining how Government are held to
account, allowing scarce taxpayer-funded resources to be focused where
they should be. The consultation will close on 1 November, and all
responses will be considered carefully before I

consumers in Wales benefit from the security of supply provided by a
large integrated power network and from competition amongst all
generators and suppliers across the wider market in Great Britain,

recent years a number of new psychoactive substances have been
controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. These include
gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and its precursor gamma-butyrolactone
(GBL), piperazines (benzylpiperazine—BZP and
trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine—TFMPP), pipradrols such as
desoxypipradrol, and cathinones such as mephedrone. These types of
drugs have been mentioned in association with the term
‘novel/new psychoactive substances’, and although they
are also sometimes referred to as ‘legal highs’, many are
now controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. A full list of drugs

Laws</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 2 September 2013]:</I> Prior to
2012, no protection at all existed to prevent schools putting school
buildings on playing fields. Schools could build over playing fields
without seeking consent and with impunity. This led to the
disappearance of thousands of playing fields—Fields in Trust
(formerly The National Playing Field Association) estimated 2,540
playing fields, or 26 sites a month, were lost between 1997 and 2005.
This Government has introduced protections on playing fields where
there were none before, so that schools and local authorities now have
to seek permission if they want to change the use of public playing
fields by putting school buildings on them. We now require schools to
apply for consent even where the buildings are being used for education
or recreational
purposes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090633000357" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/text/130906w0001.htm#13090633000357">When
considering applications to place school buildings on playing fields we
take into account the amount of playing field a school will be left
with after the building work, whether there will be any impact on sport
and play, and the reason for the proposed
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090633000358" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/text/130906w0001.htm#13090633000358">Since
February 2012, there have been 128 applications to change the use of
school playing fields by putting school buildings on them. Of these:
104 applied to build classrooms and 24 applied to build other
structures such as an extension to the school kitchens or the widening
of a cycle
path.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090633000359" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/text/130906w0001.htm#13090633000359">As

vast majority of these applications seek consent to use small areas of
outdoor space not used for sport, to extend school facilities in areas
of severe pupil place pressure or to improve the school facilities,
with no effect on the delivery of the curriculum or pupils' space to
play. The average amount of playing field built on by the 88 schools
given consent to do so since the new rules came into effect in February
2012 is 3.90% of their total playing field space. In every case the

improve the scheme, we have introduced a new, joined up system across

it regularly engages with licensed operators on this issue and has
worked with them, on particular cases, to improve effectiveness. The
Gambling Commission requirements are that operators have effective

Robertson:</Member></B> All commercial gambling in Great Britain is
subject to extensive regulatory controls, based on the three statutory
objectives of keeping crime out of gambling, making sure it is fair and
open and protecting children and vulnerable people from being harmed or
exploited. All licensed gambling operators are required to put in place
effective policies and procedures to achieve these objectives. While we
recognise that gambling problems can have a very serious impact on
individuals, their friends and families and their communities, our
system of gambling regulation has contributed to a relatively low rate
of problem gambling in the adult population of around 0.9%.
Nevertheless, we will continue to bring pressure to bear on the
gambling industry to ensure the right balance is struck between the
need to protect the vulnerable and the position of gambling as a
mainstream leisure
activity.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13090634000011" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/text/130906w0001.htm#13090634000011">Internet:

Barker:</Member></B> The Government publishes an annual estimate of the
impacts of all climate change and energy policies on energy prices and
bills for households, medium-sized businesses and energy-intensive
industries. The most recent report was published in March
2013<Sup>1</Sup>, showing the estimated impacts on prices and bills for
2013, 2020 and
2030.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090634000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/text/130906w0002.htm#13090634000132">We
do not have estimates of the total costs to consumers of all policies
in each year since 2002. However, Table 1 provides cost information
that is available for policies which place obligations into energy
suppliers, who pass the costs onto consumers through their energy
bills.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090634000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/text/130906w0002.htm#13090634000133">This
is the most up-to-date information available, but for some policies
this is not available on an annual basis and costs are shown over the
entire lifetime of the policy. Costs are shown for calendar years or
financial years depending on the policy in
question.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090634000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/text/130906w0002.htm#13090634000134">In
terms of how these costs fall on different consumers, the Government
does not dictate whether and how policy costs are passed on through
energy bills and it remains up to the energy supplier if and how to
recover these costs. Therefore it is not possible to be definitive
about how these costs have been recovered across different consumers
(i.e. households and businesses) over a number of years.</hs_Para>

assumption however is that companies will pass on the costs the way
they are levied, typically on the basis of relevant units of energy
supplied. For those policies that apply to both households and
non-domestic consumers (eg the renewables obligation and
feed-in-tariffs) our assumption is that, approximately one-third of the
costs fall on households and two-thirds on the non-domestic
sector—reflecting their respective shares of total electricity
consumption.</hs_Para>

also some policies (eg energy supplier obligations such as CERT) which
only apply to households and are only assumed to be levied on them,
while others (eg the climate change levy) only apply to non-domestic
consumers. However, taken as a whole, approximately one-third of policy
costs faced by energy suppliers are assumed to be passed directly onto
household
bills.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090634000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/text/130906w0002.htm#13090634000137">There

households save energy more than offset the necessary cost of investing

from avoiding climate change will exceed the cost of co-ordinated
global action to tackle climate change by helping to avoid the
potentially catastrophic implications of failing to act. Most notable
of these studies is the Stern review, which found that the global costs
of climate change could be between 5% and 20% of GDP per annum if we
fail to act, dwarfing the costs of effective international action,
estimated at 1-2% of global per capita consumption by 2050<Sup>l</Sup>.
Most published analysis also suggests that current UK ambition on
climate change can be achieved without large impacts on overall
short-term economic
output.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090634000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/text/130906w0002.htm#13090634000192">The
Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) does not possess an
analysis of the historical impact of climate change and energy policies
on the UK's gross domestic product (GDP). However, as part of the
Carbon Plan, the impacts of the policies to meet the first three Carbon
Budgets and illustrative measures to meet the fourth budget were
modelled using the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) Computable General
Equilibrium model<Sup>2</Sup>. It should be noted that there is
substantial uncertainty around the results of this modelling, and this
is inherent in all similar
analyses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090634000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/text/130906w0002.htm#13090634000193">The
HMRC model estimated that the first three carbon budgets could be met
at an average cost of around 0.4% of GDP over the period 2011-22 (i.e.
the level of GDP is on average 0.4% lower compared to a baseline
scenario without carbon budget policies), and the fourth carbon budget
could be met at an average cost of around 0.6% of GDP over the period
2023-27. The actual impacts on GDP will depend on a range of factors,

costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090634000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/text/130906w0002.htm#13090634000194">As
stated above, there is significant uncertainty around these estimates.
Furthermore, certain potential costs and benefits were not reflected in
the HMRC model at the time of the Carbon Plan. Importantly, innovation
benefits and the productivity improvements from energy efficiency were
not captured, nor are the benefits on future UK growth of the avoided
risks from global climate change. Furthermore, it should be noted that
the modelling largely assumes that the UK acts unilaterally. Potential
welfare costs of resulting behaviour changes are not accounted for, or
any cost or time overruns in policy delivery. Each of these excluded
factors also has a high degree of uncertainty with regards to

individual export licences for sodium fluoride and potassium fluoride
were revoked in July 2012—before any of the goods had been
exported—as a direct result of an expansion of the EU sanctions
regime for Syria. The consideration of the licence applications against
the Consolidated Criteria included an assessment of the risk that they
would be diverted to be used as precursor chemicals in the manufacture
of chemical weapons. But there was no evidence that these exports would
be so diverted, and the quantities concerned were consistent with their
stated end use for commercial purposes. No subsequent evidence has
arisen to cast doubt on the assessment made at the

Government remains committed to reducing the deficit and addressing the
permanent structural deterioration in the public finances caused by the
lasting impact of the financial crisis. Implementation of the fiscal
consolidation plans is well under way. As a result, the Government has
made significant progress in reversing the unprecedented rise in
borrowing between 2007-08 and 2009-10. Public sector net borrowing has
fallen by over a third, from 11.2% of GDP in 2009-10 to 7.0% in
2012-13. Cumulative debt interest payments from 2010-11 to 2015-16 are

contracts. Those not meeting minimum levels will be issued with formal

contracts if they fail to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090634000589" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130906/text/130906w0002.htm#13090634000589">Providers
are also required to deliver at least the minimum standard of service
they promise for each participant. To ensure promised service standards
are being delivered, the Department conducts a monthly review of a
