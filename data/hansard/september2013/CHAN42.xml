week failed to vote for a motion condemning the use of chemical
weapons, and to back an international response to the crisis in Syria.
That was an outcome that neither the Government nor the Opposition and
their leader should have wanted to see. That same evening saw reports
that the Assad regime had firebombed a school. It seems that our
inaction will possibly only embolden Assad and his forces. Will my

We have promoted a second conference in Geneva, as have other nations.
The Prime Minister discussed that with President Putin last week, and I

attends the G20 summit in St Petersburg at the end of the week, he will
have further opportunities for discussion. There is still an

Iran being involved, but by Iran playing a constructive role in trying
to bring about a settlement at such a peace conference. I think nearly
all of us who participated in the first Geneva conference last year
where Iran was not present came to the view that we could not even have
reached the conclusion we did on the need for a transitional Government
in Syria had Iran been there. So it depends on the role Iran is
prepared to play. I had a conversation a few weeks ago with the
outgoing Iranian Foreign Minister. I have offered to meet the new

no lack of urgency either on the part of Her Majesty’s
Government or many other Governments around the world, and he will know
that Secretary Kerry has applied himself very hard in recent months to
trying to bring about the Geneva peace conference and, 
<?notus-xml column=146?>along with America’s partners around Europe, trying to work
closely with Russia on this. As I was just saying, the test for Iran is
whether it is really prepared to play a constructive role, because we
must remember that Iran has, from all the evidence presented, been
actively supporting the Syrian regime, including in the killing of so

all the access is there. British aid is, through non-governmental

British aid is being widely distributed inside Syria, as well as
outside it. But there have often been, and continue to be, severe
problems on humanitarian access, which is often not permitted by the
regime. It is another testimony to the callousness of this regime
towards its own people that not only has it killed so many tens of
thousands, but it obstructs the delivery of aid, including medical
supplies, to people in its own country who desperately need

important part of the future of Gaza, because its economy cannot
deliver more unless this issue is dealt with. Essentially, however, the
future economic prospects of Gaza are also closely bound up with a
greater relaxation by the Israelis of the restrictions currently placed
on Gaza and, of course, an overall settlement in the area, which will

light that, despite all the difficulties, people’s interest in
coming together and realising what they have in common can sometimes
overcome the most difficult things. History is full of situations where
those who have been the bitterest enemies have, over time, developed
into friends. It will take time in relation to some in Israel and in
what we hope will be a new Palestinian state, but the efforts of those
who have made opportunities for co-existence in the years of difficulty
will be seen as even more important in the years to

is only one piece of the educational jigsaw and it is not right for all
youngsters. Some children are not inspired by academic study. Yes, they
need basic numeracy and literacy, but we must ditch the snobbery that
looks down on vocational alternatives to getting a degree. That
lingering prejudice serves neither the economy nor youngsters looking
to equip themselves for an increasingly competitive labour market.
With<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T12:38:48"></hs_TimeCode> the raising
of the school-leaving age to 18, we risk compounding this mistake
unless it is flexible enough to accommodate an early transition into
work. Youngsters need wider options and the absence of choice is
particularly stark for those from lower income households who have less
financial support to fall back on.</hs_Para>

coalition Government have made huge strides in promoting the

truancy rates spike by 75%.

is at that age that the number of half-days missed by persistent
truants doubles. It is the critical moment when increasing numbers of
children become dislocated from school. We know why: research from the
Department for Education in 2007 found that many youngsters became
disaffected with school because they question its relevance, find it
too conceptual rather than hands-on and find it demoralising persisting
with academic learning if that is not where their talents lie.
According to research by the Prince’s Trust, one in three
youngsters leaving school with poor GCSEs believe that they will end up
on benefits. That is a tragedy. Today, a report by the Centre for
Social Justice highlights the acute underperformance of white
15-year-old boys from poorer backgrounds.</hs_Para>

apprenticeships were first introduced by Tony Blair’s Government
back in 2004, to plug precisely the gap that I am talking about. They
offered a two-year programme, combining English and maths with optional
subjects such as engineering or construction, along with various
others. Crucially, pupils spent two days each week in the workplace,
gaining hands-on experience and gathering practical skills. That route
rapidly became immensely popular, with the numbers rising from 1,000
pupils at the outset to 9,000 just three years later. Young
apprenticeships went on to win praise from Ofsted, following reviews in
2007 and 2012. Ofsted noted the strong personal development of
students, high attendance and positive feedback from
employers.</hs_Para>

2010, the Young People’s Learning Agency found that 78% of those
in young apprenticeships achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C,
compared with the national average of 64%. Above all, and perhaps most
interestingly, participants with lower levels of prior attainment
appeared to gain most relative to peers outside the programme. Of the
cohort evaluated, virtually all went into further education, training,
full apprenticeships or a job. Just 1% became unemployed. The success
of young apprenticeships also mirrors international experience. They
are popular in Australia. In Switzerland, youngsters can spend two days
a week in school and the rest in company training. Germany also has a
dual system from 15, balancing time in the classroom with hands-on,
workplace experience.</hs_Para>

Nevertheless, there remains substantial cross-party support for
reviving young apprenticeships, both on the Government Benches and
among many in the Labour party—those who really get the

people not in active employment being supported by those in work is
economically unsustainable. We need to be promoting a wider range of
routes into the workplace, including youngsters with the right skills.
For all the soul searching about the emergence of an hourglass economy
in Britain, too few recognise the opportunity to nurture the vocational
route into well-paid jobs,

said it wound down young apprenticeships because of cost, and it is
true: they cost about £3,000 a student more than if they had
been in school. At their peak in 2007-08, young apprenticeships cost
just under £34 million. That might be because the scheme was
never allowed to develop the economies of scale achieved by
apprenticeships for those over 16, but in any case that cost is dwarfed
by that of the failure to provide suitable educational options for
teenagers. Research carried out for the Audit Commission found that
each teenager between the age of 16 and 18 not in education, employment

the last election, I think that only a couple  of charities
registered for this purpose and the levels of expenditure were
relatively modest. Other third parties—a larger number of
them—that were not charities engaged in such third-party
expenditure, but charities by and large did not. That does not mean
that they cannot campaign during an election period, because they
campaign on policies and issues and they interact with political
parties on those issues, and they will continue to be completely free
to do so. All the Bill does—it is the right thing to
do—is, first, to make sure that the limit is more appropriate
for the future so that it does not allow those third parties to engage
in distorting activity during elections; and, secondly, to extend the
definition of controlled expenditure so that it includes advertising,
rallies and such like, as well as electoral material, and to
disaggregate the total into parliamentary constituencies so that third
parties cannot disproportionately concentrate their spending in
individual constituencies. I think that all of that is perfectly

It is accurate because at the last election, relatively few
organisations—only two, I think—spent a sum of money that
was above the proposed limit. It is conceivable that a whole range of
organisations might try to spend large amounts of money to influence
directly votes for candidates and political parties rather than
campaigning on policies and issues. It is important—election law
already provides for this—that elections are fought essentially
between political parties, and the expenditure undertaken to support
candidates of political parties should be authorised by them. That is
why many people donate to political parties to support the campaign at
a constituency level.</hs_Para>

responsibility of the Charity Commission, where charities are

together to ensure the soundness of the definitions in the Bill.

purposes—<I>[Interruption.] </I>The definitions on controlled
expenditure and on the appropriate limits are changed, but the
definition that relates to spending being for electoral purposes if it

I believe that absolutely nothing in this legislation would prevent
those who campaign on issues relating to the High Speed 2 rail route
from making their case as forcefully as they wish. However, if at the
time of an election they went further and spent money on trying to
procure or prevent the election of particular candidates, and if that

required, by existing legislation as well as by this Bill, to register

register of lobbyists that would enable us to see how third parties
seek to influence the political system through consultant lobbying, but
of the existence of further issues relating to third-party influence in

specifically to the principles of exclusive cognisance and

included exclusions in the Bill which we believe make it clear that MPs

having to say he will come back to the House to address our concerns
shows that this Bill is incredibly badly drafted, but the point I want
to make is that recent freedom of information requests reveal that
Treasury officials met fracking industry representatives 19 times in
the last 10 months about their generous tax breaks, yet the public are
denied any further details of that lobbying on the grounds that it
could prejudice commercial interests. Is the Leader of the House not
ashamed that this Bill will drastically curtail the ability of
charities to campaign in the public interest on issues such as fuel
poverty and energy but do nothing to curb such secretive corporate

of charities to campaign. Let us look back at 2010. Only two charities
registered for expenditure for electoral purposes and they spent very
little. The campaigning by third parties at the last election was not
in any substantial way undertaken by charities. It was undertaken by
other third parties—trade unions, companies, campaign groups and
so forth. The idea that charities are in any way constrained is
completely wrong.</hs_Para>

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T13:18:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
makes a very good point. The public might well think that many of the
organisations that registered for electoral purposes were charities,
but in fact they registered because they were seeking to undertake
expenditure which would not have been regarded as charitable and would
not have been lawful from the point of view of the Charity
Commission’s guidance. It is overwhelmingly the case that
charitable activity by charities does not constitute expenditure for
electoral purposes and therefore is not in any sense constrained by
this legislation. There are, however, other organisations that people
might think are charities but which are not charities, or charities
that set up campaigning arms that expressly do not have charitable
status in order for them to undertake that activity. The law is already
clear that where they seek directly to influence electoral outcomes,
they should register. The Labour party’s reasoned amendment
accepts that that is right and there should be such
regulation.</hs_Para>

Bill does change the activities in respect of which spending may count
towards the third parties’ spending limits. Those activities are
being more closely aligned with the type of expenditure that is
regulated for political parties, a change that the independent
regulator, the Electoral Commission, advocated to us in June. I
understand that that particular provision has caused concern within the
charitable sector. Charity law prohibits charities from engaging in
party politics, from party political campaigning, from supporting
political candidates and from undertaking political activity unrelated
to the charity’s purpose.

will still be able to give support to specific policies that might also
be advocated by political parties if it helps to achieve their

simply engage with the policy of a political party. It does not prevent
charities from having a view on any aspect of the policy of a party and
it does not inhibit charities attempting to influence the policy of a
party. Such activity would be captured only if it was carried out in
such a way that it could be seen also to promote the election of a
political party or candidate or otherwise to enhance their standing at
an election. The situation is the same as under the current legislation

first, because the expenditure limits are tighter and will be policed,
enforced and regulated in a different way and, secondly, because
included in the normal expenditure envelope is stuff that has not been
there before, such as staffing. In effect, that reduces
charities’ ability to campaign. That is part of the rich
diversity of our political life leading into a general election and it
is being reduced. If the Leader of the House feels that

overwhelmingly undertake expenditure for electoral purposes, so we are
not necessarily principally talking about charities. We are talking
about third parties—by and large, they are not charities. The
Electoral Commission asked us to include a different and wider
definition of controlled expenditure to bring it more appropriately
into line with the definition of controlled expenditure for political

Bill also introduces a provision whereby third parties will be
permitted to spend only up to a certain amount of their controlled
expenditure in individual constituencies. That is to prevent a third
party from directing a large proportion of its national spending limit
at only a small part of the UK, thereby focusing the full force of the
considerable spending available to it on a small geographical location.
That would, and indeed does, allow disproportionately large amounts of
money to distort election campaigns and the political
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T13:34:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090336000324" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0001.htm#13090336000324">A
number of third parties campaign in a way that supports a particular
political party or its candidates. That is entirely legitimate, but it
must not be allowed to become a vehicle for evading party spending
rules. We believe that it is right that the political party should be
able to oversee which organisations offer it significant campaign
support. The Bill introduces a new measure that will require third
parties that spend significant sums campaigning in a way that can
reasonably be regarded as supporting a particular political party or
its candidates to be specifically authorised by the political party to
campaign in that manner. That spending will then be counted towards
both the third party and the political party’s spending
limits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T13:35:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090336000325" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0001.htm#13090336000325">The
transparency of the regulatory regime is enhanced by the Bill. When
third parties campaign to support political parties, expenditure will
now be more fully recorded and disclosed. Donations to third parties
will now have to be published in advance of an election, rather than
after it. Third parties will have to provide a statement of accounts.
Those measures can only be good for maintaining public trust in our
political
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T13:35:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090336000326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0002.htm#13090336000326">The
Bill also clarifies the importance of the role to be played by the
regulator, the Electoral Commission. The commission will now have a
clear duty to monitor spending and donation controls and to ensure
their compliance with the law. We want to prevent our political 
<?notus-xml column=184?>system from becoming one in which unaccountable groups spend millions
attempting to influence the outcome of an election. The Bill is an
important step towards achieving that, without undermining the ability
of third parties to engage more broadly in the political

me now turn to part 3. Trade unions are influential participants in
public life. They have an important role representing members’
interests both with specific employers and in wider public debate. The
Government support that role. We also believe it is important that the
public is confident that, when a union decides how to exercise its
influence, all union members may choose to play a part. That is what
the third part of the Bill is about. It will require trade unions
visibly to demonstrate that they know who their members are and can
contact them. The principle that unions must be able to contact their
members is well established in legislation. We are building on an

some key issues for coalitions of charities. The shadow Leader of the

differences between the parties on some of these issues and there could
be a chilling effect on a coalition of, say, health and social care

to put it in our Standing Orders that normally—apart from
emergencies, when the Speaker writes a warrant stating that, because

that all too often it means we can iron out some of the unintended
consequences? A classic one that I think we are likely to come across,
in relation to part 1, is that when the Government or Parliament face a
big issue many small charities decide to form a joint committee and
employ someone specifically to act on their behalf and represent them.
They would be caught by this Bill, whereas the bodies that they would
probably be fighting against, the big commercial interests, would not.

the Bill came as a complete surprise to all those in civil society who

Government designed the changes in secret and sprung them on everyone
in a baleful attempt to bounce them quickly on to the statute book.
They have not even bothered to consult those affected. Discussions I
have had during meetings with stakeholders on all three parts of the
Bill suggest that time after time e-mails, letters and calls requesting
conversations with Ministers were left unanswered. The Government did

have two key points to make about the proposals on lobbying set out in
part 1. The first relates to the laughably narrow definition of
“consultant lobbyist”. Under the Government’s
definition, someone will count as a lobbyist only if they lobby
directly Ministers or 
<?notus-xml column=194?>permanent secretaries and if their business is mainly for the purposes
of lobbying. It is estimated that that will cover less than one fifth
of those people currently working in the £2 billion lobbying
industry, and the Association of Professional Political Consultants
estimates that only 1% of ministerial meetings organised by lobbyists
would be covered.
Moreover<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T14:07:05"></hs_TimeCode>, it
would be extremely easy to rearrange how such lobbying is conducted to
evade the need to appear on the new register at all. The Bill is so
narrow that it would fail to cover not only the lobbyist currently
barnacle-scraping at the heart of No.10, but any of the lobbying
scandals that have beset the Prime Minister in this
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090336000413" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0002.htm#13090336000413">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T14:07:22"></hs_TimeCode>
second point is that there is a real risk that the proposals will make
lobbying less transparent than it is now. The Government’s
proposed register would cover fewer lobbyists than the existing
voluntary register run by the UK Public Affairs
Council<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T14:07:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Thurso</B> (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross) (LD):</Member> I
rise to broadly support the Bill and to urge my colleagues to resist
the amendment tabled by the Opposition. I do so with some reservations,

begin by picking up the point that has been made by a number of hon.
and right hon. Members about pre-legislative scrutiny. I have always
been in favour of pre-legislative scrutiny. I think virtually every
Bill is improved by it, although this time last year—or maybe
the year before; how time flies—I had the rather sad experience
of serving on the Joint Committee on the draft House of Lords Reform
Bill, and look where that got us. Nevertheless, I have to say that
pre-legislative scrutiny and proper scrutiny of legislation is the best
way to defuse potential misunderstandings and to come to the true
nature of what is being
proposed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T14:28:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090350000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0002.htm#13090350000003">The
reason why I think the House should support this Bill’s Second
Reading is that I truly believe it is a step forward, although it is
not entirely the step forward it could be. I believe there are a number
of misunderstandings, and that has certainly been true of some of
today’s interventions. I think that pre-legislative scrutiny
would have provided the opportunity to address them such that they
might have been dealt with and we might have had clarity prior to
proceedings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T14:29:08"></hs_TimeCode>.
Although this is by no means a perfect Bill—what Bill ever
is?—it is a reasonable start in the direction of transparency on
lobbying. Therefore, I prefer to vote for it and then, I hope, see
changes made during its consideration in Committee, rather than vote
against it at this stage.</hs_Para>

want to make it absolutely clear, as I did in the Opposition debate
some 10 weeks ago, that lobbying is a good and integral part of the
political process. When somebody comes to lobby me because they are my
constituent or because I sit on a certain Committee, I consider that to
be an important part of how I inform myself so that I may take
reasonable decisions, ask good questions in Committees or act in the
interests of my constituents. I would be very concerned if I felt that
anything stood in the way of my doing that on behalf of my constituents
or with regard to my work on a Committee. As far as I can see, nothing
in the Bill will do that. I understand that some Opposition Members
feel differently, but I believe that those issues can be worked out
during the passage of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T14:32:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090350000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0002.htm#13090350000012">We
are proposing something relatively small and light touch. I would
describe it as a good start. When an independent lobbyist—a
company that lobbies for profit and is not associated with a particular
company—is lobbying in a relatively secretive way and has the
power to influence what is happening in our lives, it is right that
those people should be registered and that we should be aware of what
they are seeking to do. The Bill will not do that entirely, but it will
not do anything that stops that from happening. It is a building block

1 of the Bill provides for a statutory register of lobbyists, which was
in our manifesto and the coalition agreement. The Liberal Democrats

that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House is involved in
introducing the Bill. The register is something that we very much

third-party lobbyists and

overly helpful to have a series of entries that say “general

or the political classes the ability, to produce something that would
tackle the scandals that appear in our newspapers and on our
television. Nothing in this Bill addresses that concern: “You

lobby the civil service do not go to the permanent secretary but talk
to the desk officer or the director general. Those people are outwith
the concept of the Bill. Let us also redefine who the lobbyists are. At

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T14:54:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Nottingham North (Mr Allen) made exactly that point when he said
that we are the strongest lobbyists. If something is not right in our

want to point out a worrying grey area that is not covered in the Bill
but that could be captured as we work on the Bill in the next few days.
I have been trying to track the influence of lobbyists on a major
project in St Albans. I have made no bones about the fact that I am
completely and implacably opposed, as is my council at every level, to
a strategic rail freight interchange on 300 acres of green-belt land. I
am concerned that lobbying behind the scenes may have led to a shift in
the decision-making process, and have made every effort to try to find
out how hon. Members, as representatives of our constituents, can find
out who or what has gained the ear of influential people. I fully
accept that that does not always mean the Minister—it could be
someone in the Minister’s office. Members need to have a clearly
defined route to find out what has gone on. Our constituents do not
have that
opportunity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090350000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0002.htm#13090350000067">The
project has been led by Helioslough. One of its key lobbyists is Mr
Simon Hoare, who operates under various guises—it is therefore
pertinent that we have a full register. We have been fighting the
proposal since 2006. It has been turned down twice—once by
the previous 
<?notus-xml column=208?>Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, and once by the
current one. There have been two refusals, but now there is
a minded-to-approve decision, which has set off my radar.
What has altered? The plans are the same, so has pressure
been applied behind the
scenes?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090350000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0002.htm#13090350000068">The
last refusal was quashed by the High Court in 2011, and the process has
become murky and opaque—it is very much the sort of thing that I
believe the public want hon. Members to clamp down on. In this world,
personal connections and relationships can come in very handy. I have
dug very deep to try to get to the bottom of how much access the
developer of the rail freight proposal has gained via his lobbyists.
The proposal has implications for planning and transport, and for the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Not only one Department
is involved, but
many.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090350000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0002.htm#13090350000069">Like

what happens here, but the reality is that if a Government relations

firm turns up here, it is perfectly obvious that they will be trying to
influence policy on behalf of that firm. That is fair enough. It is the

naive in my first six or seven weeks here. I did not understand why so
many people wanted to meet a mere Back-Bench MP. I actually saw the
same lobbyist three times in one week, expressing three different
views. I then decided never to meet a lobbyist again. Anyone who wants
to meet me has to be the chief executive of their organisation or to be

want to move on to part 2 of the Bill, the part that has elicited the
most consternation today. I understand that charities will still be
able to support specific policies advocated by political parties if
that will help them to achieve their charitable purposes, and that the
law currently prohibits them from engaging in party politics or party
political campaigning, from supporting political candidates or from
undertaking political activity that is unrelated to the
charity’s purpose. The Bill seems to be dealing with trust. The
Government trust the charities to engage in the policies that they want
to engage in, and to do so responsibly. There also seems to be a lack
of trust on the part of the charities, however, which is
understandable. They are regulated by the Charity Commission, and a
number of concerns and grumbles have been expressed about that over the
years. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T15:25:26"></hs_TimeCode>
charities are asking for more specific guidance. Many of the issues
that have been brought to my attention will be relevant under the
current law. The charities are already having to make a judgment call
under the existing law about whether their activities would affect the
outcome of an election and whether they are dealing with regulated
expenditure. Many of those issues are already relevant today.</hs_Para>

Bill represents a positive step forward because it allows us to discuss
the issues that matter to the public, such as the need for greater
transparency in politics. One Opposition Member stated that he had
previously worked for Oxfam, and some of the earlier speakers said that
the problem with lobbying was that it did not involve Ministers, but
that it involved civil servants, desk officers and day officers. Well,
that is news to me. I genuinely think that if I had wanted to get
something done when I was in business, I would have gone to the
decision maker to get the deal done. We have to do it in the most
transparent way possible; otherwise, we get sued. I would have thought
that that was how it worked. As I said earlier, apart from what

those questions and get responses from the Minister on the Floor of the

concerned, too, about whether staff costs should be included. If they
are spending £800,000 on staff costs and £20,000 on
leaflets, I do not how long those charities are going to exist; if they
were a business, they would not be in business for very long. It is in
their own interests to gain a greater understanding of how many of
their staff are involved in these campaigns. I agree with what they say
about aggregate spending, and I agree that the “Enough Food for
Everyone” campaign was a very important one. I believe that, as
some of the charities have set out, they should be involved only for
the amounts that they have popped in. The final issue relates to the
levels of expenditure, and I said earlier that I agree about

the Bill is allowed to proceed, we shall find that when we try to
repair some of the damage caused by its current construction, we shall
be working on very shaky foundations. A Member suggested earlier that
we could build on the existing provisions, but the Bill has a
particular scope, and if we get it wrong when trying to build on those
shaky foundations, something will come tumbling down at some point in
the future. That is what the voluntary organisations and charities are
so concerned about.</hs_Para>

primarily on the lobbying aspect of this Bill, having provided media
advice to a public affairs company back in the 1990s. Ironically, I

certainly support parts 2 and 3, but I cannot say the same about part
1.</hs_Para>

Government’s reputations that will suffer when people discover

may not be the oldest profession, though some may feel that it shares
some of the same attributes, but it has certainly been around for as
long as there has been a Parliament. Naturally, those wanting to
advocate an interest or to make a case will gravitate towards the
decision makers gathered together in Parliament. As a former Member for
Enfield, Southgate, Michael Portillo, once said in respect of lobbying,
every great city needs its sewers. He was right. Some in this House
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T15:44:40"></hs_TimeCode>may not
particularly like lobbyists, but they provide a service in contributing
information to our debates and policy making. Crucially, we may choose
to accept or reject this information as we see fit. Of course, the
right to be heard is an integral part of our democratic process, and
surely any individual or business is entitled to retain an advocate to
make their
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090350000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0002.htm#13090350000160">That
is not to say that legitimate concerns have not been raised about
malpractices in the past, but the industry responded to
those by establishing its own code of conduct and register,
which have, so far as I am aware, been effective. After all, the
existing register includes names 
<?notus-xml column=221?>of all lobbyists employed by a consultancy, as well as the names of all
the clients on whose behalf they work. It may not be perfect, but it
provides a great deal more transparency than is proposed in the Bill,
because fewer companies would be required to register under this Bill
than under the industry’s own voluntary code. Whereas now almost
all lobbyists declare any clients for whom they provide political
advice, under this Bill they would only declare clients on whose behalf
they have had direct communication with Ministers or permanent
secretaries. The Bill seems to suggest that humble Back Benchers, and
members and even Chairmen of Select Committees, carry little influence.
I know that Back Benchers are sometimes described as “Lobby
fodder”, but it seems harsh to enshrine such a view in

some large companies whose business encompasses a wide variety of
interests, but we will not know, thanks to this Bill, which bit they

us remind ourselves of why this Bill, so long in gestation, has been

in place. More importantly, the activities uncovered by the media would
not have been registrable under this Bill, because none of the

also note that 38 Degrees is on the list. It spent either £10.8
million or £10.9 million—I do not know which because of
my poor eyesight, but it was a sizable amount. I reflect on the e-mails
that I have received about the Bill. The hon. Member for Wansbeck (Ian
Lavery) said that it was not just the unions that had written to him,
but other constituents more generally. The vast majority of the people
who have written to me about the Bill have been from one of the
third-party funders: 38 Degrees. It was said earlier that the Wikipedia

a union movement, and quite rightly that movement recognised that
workers needed representation in Parliament because they were not
getting a fair crack of the whip or fair representation here, but I

goes, “He who pays

Executive that key decisions are made. There is a strong need to

those of us who were completely clean were cast in the same light. For
most of us, being elected was one of the proudest moments of our lives,
but after the expenses scandal we almost had to apologise for 
<?notus-xml column=232?>being an MP. Then we legislated, we had an election, large numbers of
new people came into the House, and we thought we had put the issue
behind us. However, the Prime Minister was right to say that the next

was most depressing and angry-making—I was furious—when I
saw the films of Members of Parliament offering their services to
lobbyists for money, so when the Government said they were going to

acutely depressing that this Bill does nothing of the sort. By
excluding the vast proportion of lobbyists—the in-house
lobbyists—we are making ourselves a laughing stock.</hs_Para>

on from what the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:26:59"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for St Albans (Mrs Main) said. I have experience of
in-house lobbyists. In my constituency, the third runway campaign, BAA,
did not use external lobbyists; it used generally in-house lobbyists
who not only lobbied but had passes to the Department for Transport.
They were not bothered about meeting Ministers; they wanted to meet
junior civil servants who wrote the projections of growth in passenger
traffic and so on. That is how effective they were. When he was the
Minister responsible for aviation, Chris Mullin asked how many BAA
staff were in the Department for Transport on a daily basis. On the day
he left, he was told that dozens of people had passes to come to the
Department to influence people. I think that is corruption in any other
terms, and the sort of thing we want to tackle.</hs_Para>

examples of what goes on. Bizarrely, however, the Bill does not tackle
that level of corruption but gags the very people from whom we want to
hear. It even gags them during the general election period when they
can be most influential. I find the proposed legislation not only
contradictory but shameful, and it is important to listen to what
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:28:14"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

reach cross-party agreement on this issue, the Bill will not stand up
in the long term. Once again the House will be brought into disrepute

McDonnell:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. The Leader
of the House would win the respect of the House if he took time to
bring those organisations in to hear from them. He argues that gagging
is not within the legislation. The impact of the legislation per se
will not gag those organisations, but self-gagging will take place,
because, as other hon. Members have said, people will not want to risk
their charity’s or organisation’s funds on lawyers to
advise them or to defend them when things go wrong. I therefore ask the
Government to stand back, pause and consult, and introduce adequate
legislation on which we can reach consensus. I am sure we can do
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090350000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0003.htm#13090350000243">Part
3 of the Bill is about trade unions. The reality is that, since Mrs
Thatcher’s day, the Conservatives have wanted to introduce
legislation that bans trade unions, but have realised they could not
get it through the House. They have therefore successively introduced
legislation to ensure that they impede the activities of trade unions
as best they can. That is why we have had extensive discussions on the
technicalities of balloting, registrations and so on.</hs_Para>

is yet another way in which the Conservatives are trying to encumber
trade unions with unnecessary bureaucracy to impede them in
representing their members. Unions already have membership lists, which
they must regularly update, because if they ballot for industrial
action or on consultations, they must ensure the list are
accurate—otherwise, they will be in court yet again, because
employers can take legal action against them to prevent industrial
action or any other form of action before strike
action.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090350000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0003.htm#13090350000245">The
legislation is therefore unnecessary, but I find it offensive because
it applies only to trade unions. Why just trade unions? The Leader of
the House’s argument is that trade unions influence public
policy, but so does the CBI, the Institute of Directors and a large
number of organisations that are not encompassed by the legislation.
That betrays the real agenda: the measure is an attack on trade
unions—yet again—by the
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090350000246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0003.htm#13090350000246">I
hope the Government see sense on that measure. All they will do is
introduce another mechanism that sours the industrial relations climate
in this country—another opportunity for litigation, meaning more
time spent in the courts. That does not enhance the relationship
between workers and employers, or the development of industrial,
manufacturing or other economic policy by bringing people together; it
simply increases antagonism. I believe it will therefore be
counter-productive. I urge the Government to think again on the
measure. It is petty, and they are introducing it now simply for
short-term party advantage following debates before the summer recess.
The measure will do nothing for the Government’s standing or for
the relationship between trade unions and
employers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090350000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0003.htm#13090350000247">Finally,
this is no way to legislate. I fully agree with much of what has been
said by hon. Members on both sides of the House on that. This is no way
to introduce a major constitutional reform. At the end of the day, if
it 
<?notus-xml column=234?>is forced through by the Government, we will be back to amend it.
However, while it is in place, it will undermine democratic engagement
in this country across the

If the Bill interfered in the procedures of this House I would oppose

story and this absurd idea of firestorms. That is not what is
happening. Charities are not allowed to campaign in general elections,
and quite rightly so. Political parties fight hard to raise their
money, whether it comes from unions, business or individuals. Why
should they not have charitable status, when charities may intervene in
elections using the tax they have reclaimed—the extra funds and
the status they have as charities—but without standing for
election fully? And they cannot: the law does not allow charities to be
directly involved in general elections.</hs_Para>

is surely right, and it is why this Bill has caused a storm that is
quite unnecessary, because charities will be able, as they are now, to
put forward the views they hold dear, but not to back individual
candidates. With all the tax and fundraising advantages that charities
have, they should not be involved in the election process. That is the
standard of the Charity Commission as it is today; it should remain so.

is being changed is the position on third parties—those
organisations that lack the courage to stand for election, but wish to
intervene in the election process by spending money up and down the
country. They should be subject to the same requirements as political
parties. If we are to have a cap on total spending for political
parties that openly stand for election, a lower cap should be applied
to third parties that do not have the courage to put their names
forward to stand. If we do not have that, the alternative is to go down
the American route, for which I have some sympathy, of completely
unlimited spending—people can spend as much as they can raise.
Opposition Members would not like that, because I can tell them that we
on the Conservative side would raise a good deal more money on that
basis than they do. We would outspend them a great deal, so they should
be pleased about the caps, which are given by benign Conservatives to
level the playing field with our socialist friends. That is a good way

concerns about the Bill relate to part 2 and the issue of third
parties. The rallying cry from Government Back Benchers seems to be,
“This is better than doing nothing,” but a large part of
the Bill is not better than doing nothing, and the rest of it probably
is doing
nothing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090350000283" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0003.htm#13090350000283">Government
Members appear to be very worried about charities. According to the
hon. Member for Ealing Central and Acton (Angie Bray), charities do not
do politics. Things are clearly a lot quieter in Ealing during the
run-up to an election than they are in Darlington, where organisations
such as Stonewall, Shelter, and even the NCT and Age UK devote much
time, effort and creativity to trying to persuade candidates to sign up
to some cause or pledge. I can understand why the Deputy Prime Minister
may be keen on reducing that kind of activity before an election, but
it is nevertheless crucial in encouraging vibrancy and participation in
our electoral process by people who may be largely sceptical about
politics. I think that such campaigning by charities is good for our
democracy, because it helps more people to engage in political debate
and enlightens candidates as well. I myself knew nothing of
badgers—among other issues—before I was lobbied about
them, and I found that lobbying immensely
helpful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090350000284" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0003.htm#13090350000284">The
Leader of the House seemed to be attempting to inject some ambiguity
into the position taken by the voluntary sector, but every piece of

that the Bill may introduce. He said that he had met representatives of
the National Council for Voluntary Organisations yesterday, and that
everything 
<?notus-xml column=240?>was fine, but that is not what those organisations are telling me. For
the time being, I remain concerned about the impact of the Bill on

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T17:09:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for St Albans (Mrs Main) made an excellent speech in which she set out
the extent to which lobbying seems to have made a substantial
difference in her constituency on a particular issue close to her
heart. Of course, such lobbying not only cannot be included under the
definitions in the Bill but has been designed out of it. The title of
the Bill includes the phrase “transparency of lobbying”,
which will mean that people think the Government are doing something to
sort it out, but the long title shows that it is only about
“consultant lobbying”, excluding 97% of the real lobbying
that goes on in and around this place.</hs_Para>

some of the discussions this afternoon, one might think that the

considerable regulation under the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000. The Bill states that people can be caught
retrospectively for undertaking 
<?notus-xml column=244?>action, particularly at a local level, in the year before an election
and can be judged for so doing by the Electoral Commission. Believe me,
the last thing the commission wants to do is to get involved in
political judgments about who has been doing what at a local level and
in local elections. Those people will be subject to all sorts of
penalties as far as registration is concerned, which they never thought
they would have to undertake.</hs_Para>

has been substantial and careful thought about third-party campaigning.
Nevertheless, the Bill has been the subject of no consultation, not
even with the Electoral Commission on how it would carry out this

called lobbying is because of the lobby outside St Stephen’s
chapel, where the House of Commons used to sit. That is why
when Paris lost the bid to host the 2012 Olympic games,
Bertrand Delanoë complained passionately in French that the
British had engaged outrageously in lobbying—“doing the
lobby,” as he put it.</hs_Para>

when the Clerk of the House was given a very sumptuous breakfast to

worry is that the Bill will mean that those organisations, which
created an alliance because none of them had a large lobbying

big pharmaceutical companies that also came to lobby us—it was
legitimate that they did so. The small charities will have to declare
that they have effectively set themselves up as a lobbying consultant,
but the pharmaceutical companies, which have vast arrays of lawyers and
in-house operatives, will not have to declare, and that is
fundamentally unfair. I hope that is an unintended consequence of the

would prefer it if you voted for the following people who have a
three-star record on those issues as we see them.” My worry is
that, yet again, this Government Bill will prevent that important part

important to remember that campaigning civil society organisations that

election periods they are already restricted in the kinds of activities
they can undertake. In my experience, charities take those
responsibilities extremely seriously and are careful about the public
statements and activities they undertake ahead of elections. The

is working well, and we should not be looking to increase the
regulatory burden on charities through the Bill. Part 2 of the Bill

whether their objectives are appropriate. Now we are bringing in the
Electoral Commission. Under the proposed legislation, if the Charity
Commission says that it is perfectly acceptable for an organisation to
pursue a particular line of policy and the Electoral Commission says
that it is not sure, which body will regulate the charity? Where does
the charity go for a definitive statement on the pursuit of its
charitable objectives? I hope the Minister has a lot to say when he
stands up, as opposed to the chuntering from the Front Bench we have

the Government which, if any, of those scandals this Bill seeks to
prevent from happening again. The harsh reality is that part 1 of the
Bill would have avoided none of them, because the Government have
drafted it so narrowly—I suspect deliberately—that the
only type of activity covered is direct communication with a Minister
of the Crown and a permanent secretary. Therefore, if a lobbyist or
even a consultant lobbyist communicates with a private
secretary—I would suggest that the Prime Minister’s
private secretary has a great deal of influence, perhaps more than the
Deputy Prime Minister, on certain areas of policy, such as tobacco
packaging and other things—that will not be covered. If, as

official in the Department for Transport, that is okay, provided it is
not the permanent secretary. If a lobbyist speaks to the special

that would okay. That is a failure of the Bill; it is one that I cannot

problems with the Bill are so fundamental that even the impact
assessment is wrong. The civil servants who drafted the
Bill—who, ironically, would not be covered by the lobbying Bill
they are seeking to introduce—have failed to understand the
lobbying industry. That is not surprising, given that they failed to
meet anybody, from either side of the argument, in the last 12 months.
They have not met Spinwatch, Unlock Democracy, Charter88, the charities
or the Association of Professional Political Consultants—I could
go on. Those civil servants have met nobody. They have stuck their
fingers in their ears and produced a Bill that no one in the industry

servants who drafted the Bill have also misunderstood how to calculate

want to return to the point raised by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T18:06:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for St Albans, and to take it slightly further. As I said to Ministers
this morning, there was a case recently in which a Minister of the
Crown met a third-party consultant—a commercial lobbyist, as I
think they are called—to discuss a planning application in their
constituency. The Government seem to define that as a private
discussion. If that consultant had chosen to raise other issues at the
meeting, that activity would not be covered by the Bill because the
consultant would say, “I am meeting the Minister not in their
role as a Minister of the Crown but in their role as a Member of
Parliament. I just happened to raise a general issue of Government
policy that might be of interest and over which the Minister might have
some influence.” That would be ludicrous.</hs_Para>

that reason, if for no other, the rules should apply to all
parliamentarians. Ministers of the Crown—whether in the House of
Lords or the House of Commons—are all parliamentarians.
Extending the rules would avoid any double standards. Many Members of
Parliament are members, and chairs, of influential Select Committees.
They have a greater amount of influence in shaping the early stages of
Government policy than those who serve as Parliamentary
Under-Secretaries of State. Anyone who has read Chris Mullin’s
excellent book, “A View from the Foothills”, will
remember the ceaseless slog of the life of an Under-Secretary. I see a
Parliamentary Private Secretary smiling at that suggestion. Select
Committee Chairs are hugely influential. Similarly, Members of
Parliament who sit on Bill Committees help to shape our legislation.
They are the people who should be protected from unscrupulous
lobbyists, and if we did that we would provide the public with far
greater confidence in the process. The rules have to apply to all those
who exert influence.</hs_Para>

rules cannot only be about those who directly communicate with those in

the Scottish Parliament it was best to

consultation with the affected parties has not yet taken place.
Secondly, this Bill was meant to concentrate on the negative impact of
non-transparent commercial lobbying, but it seems instead to be being
used as a Trojan horse to introduce a range of measures that will
impair the functioning of civil society and third-sector organisations.
It will change the nature of campaigning on important issues that

they be about welfare reform, health, education, community care,

hear and listen to its views on social and economic issues. If this
Bill is enacted unamended, I fear it will not only restrict the role of
charitable bodies, but have a severe impact on wider civic society,
which will be prevented from communicating and engaging directly with
politicians and political parties. This could make more members of the
public even more disillusioned and isolated from the democratic
political process at a time when the number of people not registering
their mandate is increasing. The vote is gradually reducing. Do we want
that? Do we want to marginalise people from the democratic process? Do
we want to marginalise those members of civic society who undertake
such an important role for us? After all, the Prime Minister has told
us in recent years that he wants to underpin “the big
society”. By virtue of this very Bill, however, he will
undermine both the big society and civic society, making more members

received one of my largest ever postbags since becoming an MP, from

critical of the Government’s attempt to muzzle civil society and
close down democratic debate while failing to get to the heart of the
lack of transparency and undue influence that are present in some parts

a campaigner with World Vision, one of the world’s leading
Christian international development and relief organisations. Like so
many other organisations, we had played a crucial role in the Make
Poverty History campaign, and I truly believe that our work had an
impact on the willingness of the United Kingdom Government, and other
G8 Governments, to take crucial steps in cancelling debt and increasing
our support for 
<?notus-xml column=261?>the world’s poorest countries. Later in 2005, I travelled to
Malawi to speak at a gathering of campaigners from countries across
southern and central Africa. I shared with them our experiences of that
campaign here in the UK, and told them what we had achieved together. I
explained that we had been able to secure cross-party support and

recall that many of my colleagues at that conference, from countries
such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe and Kenya, were
amazed not only by what we had achieved, but by how freely and openly
people were able to debate and engage with others in Britain. They were
amazed by the fact that ordinary civil society, churches and
citizens’ groups had access to the highest levels of Government
and Parliament, and by the fact that, while that access and openness
might not be funded to the same extent as traditional big interests
such as business, energy and defence companies, it was at least on a
par with them in
principle.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090354000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0003.htm#13090354000016"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Tom Clarke" PimsId="2626" UID="13090354001867" xid="117" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0003.htm#13090354001867">Mr

near-achievement, of the target of expenditure of 0.7% of gross

and, as I have said, it involved all parties. The campaigners from
those other countries who did not benefit from the same open,
democratic ways, and from the strengths of civil society, found it
particularly striking. They shared with me their experiences of
fighting for rights in places such as Zimbabwe. I am sorry to say this,

question. In 2005, when he conducted his campaign with World Vision,
electoral law required any expenditure for electoral purposes to be
registered. Was any part of that expenditure registered for electoral

party or candidate in his campaign, in which case all the expenditure

Doughty:</Member></B> The real issue is that many charities will
observe the lack of clarity in the Bill, and, unable to gain access to
the legal advice and expertise that is needed to deal with it, will
effectively be muzzled. That is what is really going on: a clampdown on
charities and community organisations. At the same time, the Bill does
not deal with the likes of Lynton Crosby—the rich and already
powerful members of

I have said, the main issue is that the Bill does nothing to clamp down
on the activities of the big lobbying industry and make them more
transparent. 
<?notus-xml column=262?>In fact, it excludes most of the lobbyists and most of the
lobbying, which strikes me as completely pointless. We have all heard
how the Bill will capture only 1% of the meetings organised with
lobbyists. The idea that the only crucial lobbying that goes on is in
meetings with Ministers and permanent secretaries is, frankly,
ridiculous. Without wanting to be disrespectful, it is often the least
experienced and most junior officials and advisers in Government who
are the most susceptible to undue influence, whereas, in contrast, most
of the Ministers—of all parties—and most of the permanent
secretaries whom I have dealt with have taken a critical-thinking
approach to the lobbying and approaches they receive, whether from

have heard from many colleagues on both sides of the House of the many
organisations and causes that are worried about this Bill. I know from
personal experience how seriously charities and campaign coalitions
take their existing obligations. I believe they already often err on
the side of caution, rather than risk being seen to be operating in any
way that could open them up to allegations of partisanship or undue
influence. I am therefore very worried on a number of fronts about the

staff costs and overheads could be included in what has to be declared,
meaning that larger charities might have to pull back to avoid hitting
the lower spending limits set out in the Bill. Secondly, I am deeply
concerned about the possible impact on smaller charities, a number of
whom have commented during the course of this debate about how they
will not be able to cope, from a legal perspective, when they are less
well resourced. I was lucky to have the support of an excellent and
experienced legal department when such questions arose in Oxfam, making
sure that we met our legal objectives. That is simply not available to
many smaller charities and community organisations and that will
result, essentially, in their

In particular, I want to draw the House’s attention to the

this week. It is deeply concerned that not only could the Wales TUC
conference cease to be lawful in 2014, but that this Bill’s
provisions could undermine the special social partnerships the Wales
TUC has with the Welsh Government, as enshrined in the Government of
Wales Acts, and that it could damage their anti-racism campaigning work

code of conduct. Loopholes mean that lobbyists will still keep their
client lists secret. Lobbyists will not have to register if they have a
business that, it can be argued, is mainly a non-lobbying
business—that will give lawyers a field day. The Bill will not
require consultant lobbyists to declare how much they spent on their

omission is the lack of a code of conduct backed by sanctions, which

it is obvious that the real motive behind this part of the Bill is that
the Government are eager to help employers to mount injunction
proceedings when union members have voted for industrial action,
seizing on minor, if not miniscule, details which the Court of Appeal
had previously regarded as de minimis or accidental. That whole process
of inserting minor, minute, technical, bureaucratic obstacles and
hurdles in the path of unions that are carrying out their perfectly
legitimate and proper functions is really behind part 3.</hs_Para>

needed is for the Leader of the House to have the courage to withdraw
this Bill, in the light of the fact that there is almost no support for

and negotiation in the Select Committee on Political and Constitutional

Mann</B> (Bassetlaw) (Lab):</Member> I have some questions for the
Minister to answer, if he will. Under the Bill, will paid transport
provided by the South Cambridgeshire Conservative association for
people to go to the London mayoral election be covered as third-party
expenditure? Will the Tatton patrons’ club, as an independent
body, be required to declare those who have contributed to its
expenditure and where that expenditure has gone? Will that also apply
to other patrons’ clubs of other Conservative associations
across the country?
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T18:30:43"></hs_TimeCode>When money from
Tatton, Witney, Surrey Heath and many other patrons’

right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr Barron), the
Chairman of the Committee on Standards and Privileges, made a point
about the role of MPs as lobbyists. I eventually but successfully took
43 different firms of solicitors through the Law Society for
misconduct, but I named a number of them publicly in advance without
having had constituents come to me. I suspected that I had constituents
who had been wrongly charged by them, but I did not have a mandate from
a specific individual constituent. Would that action categorically have
been permissible under the Bill? If there is a legal challenge in a
comparable situation—that case involved firms of solicitors and
there were many that might have done that at the time—will there
be indemnity for Parliament and for Members of Parliament? I hope that
the Minister who replies will give precise answers to those
questions, because I think the House deserves to know.</hs_Para>

the general points, there is nothing in the Bill about the imbalance in
party funding. The Conservative party wasted £250,000 trying to
get rid of me, which had no impact whatsoever. Nevertheless,
the unfairness in the democratic system remains. Do the Liberal
Democrats intend to introduce an amendment on that point, so
that we can support it if the Bill proceeds to its next
stage?</hs_Para>

cash for access, we have seen MPs declaring that they are like taxis
and we have also seen the recent scandals. Do the Liberal Democrats
intend to introduce specific additional proposals to bring such
activity into the scope of the Bill? It is wholly missing at the
moment. As other Members have demonstrated, bodies such as BSkyB are
excluded. Do the Liberal Democrats intend to introduce a specific
clause that would bring the major lobbyists under the remit of the
Bill, should it be passed today?
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T18:33:46"></hs_TimeCode>Or is this a
flawed attempt at gerrymandering, a half-cocked Bill that does not give
anything to anyone other than confusion?</hs_Para>

let me answer one point for my colleagues on the Opposition side of the
House who wanted information about why the Bill might be being
introduced. There are 
<?notus-xml column=266?>figures for the membership of the Conservative party, so let me give a
couple of examples. In South Cambridgeshire, membership has gone down
by 21 and they are down to just 13 friends this year. In Tatton,
membership has gone down by 43 and in Witney, it has gone down by more
than 100. Surrey Heath has lost 350 members—a third
of its membership—in the past three years. That might show the
crisis in the Conservative party and might be why we have this attempt
at gerrymandering today.</hs_Para>

Gilmore</B> (Edinburgh East) (Lab):</Member> In the very short time

there has been plenty of time to get part 1 absolutely right. The
Political and Constitutional Reform Committee was unequivocal in its
criticism of the original consultation paper. Unusually, one of the
recommendations was to withdraw the whole thing and start all over
again, because it was so bad. Having sat through the evidence that we
took at that time, it was clear to me that no one on any side of the
debate on lobbying was satisfied. The people who wanted more regulation
thought that the proposal was not good enough; the people who perhaps
did not want regulation also thought that it was very
bad<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T18:39:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090354000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0004.htm#13090354000055">For
a whole year, there was no proper response from the Government.
Normally, the Government respond to Select Committees with a detailed
report that comments on and argues their position. There was none of
that. The issue was kicked into the long grass. A lot of people outside
the House noticed that there was nothing on lobbying in the
Queen’s Speech. Then, all of a sudden, in a panic, the Bill
comes forward. It is not a good Bill. We should not go ahead with it,

decisions. They all warned that the legislation is simply inadequate in
its present form and needs to be amended. Indeed, the Leader of the

Bill simply fails to live up to the demands of the epoch through which
we are living. We live in a time of great flux and of distrust in the
ruling political and commercial elites. We live in a democratic century
in which—rightly, in my view—the wider public long ago
abandoned deferential attitudes to the people at the top. They want to
know how decisions are taken and on whose behalf. A quiet revolution is
taking place in our country, with the growth of active citizenship,
which this House would be foolish to ignore. People are much more
active in taking control of their lives, which partly explains the
explosion in the number of campaigning organisations, not-for-profit
groups and charities. It is not simply that the Government
misunderstand the zeitgeist I am describing; in truth, they
consistently make the wrong decisions because they are too tightly
bound up with the interests of the most rich and powerful in our

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T18:50:35"></hs_TimeCode>let me remind
Members of what this Bill is intended to achieve. It will push this
Government’s culture of openness and transparency further by
creating a statutory register of lobbyists, which the Government
promised to do in the coalition programme. It will ensure that third
parties that campaign at elections do so openly and within a fair
regulatory framework. It will provide assurance that trade unions, as
increasingly large and diverse membership organisations, know who their
members are and can engage effectively with them. Those are all
reasonable and valuable changes to our political system.</hs_Para>

me now address some comments, concerns and myths. The Bill is not about
closing down charities’ ability to influence policy, as many
Members claimed. I want to put on record the following so that it is
clear to Labour Members, because I think there is some confusion. At
present, a charity can undertake non-party political activity where its
trustees can show that it supports the charity’s purposes and
will be an effective use of the charity’s resources. Charity law
prohibits charities from engaging in party politics, from party
political campaigning, from supporting political candidates, or from
undertaking political activity unrelated to the charity’s
purpose. Charities, and indeed all other organisations, currently need
to register as third parties only if they are spending money on
campaigning to procure or promote the electoral success of a party or
candidates. That test will remain under the Bill.</hs_Para>

under the current provisions, charities can still give support to
specific policies advocated by political parties if that would help to
achieve their charitable purposes. Provided that charities continue to
campaign as they currently do, maintaining their political neutrality
and independence, expenditure incurred by them is unlikely to come
within the definition of “controlled expenditure”. It
does not now and it will not under our proposals. Of course, the
Government have on a number of occasions expressed a willingness to
work with charities to ensure that this is clear, and if more guidance
is needed we will certainly ensure that it is in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T18:53:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090354000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/debtext/130903-0004.htm#13090354000072">Before
dealing with the myths, I want to touch on scientific theories. Today
we have had a very significant scientific theory proven—that
there are parallel universes. Labour Members are debating a Bill that
will gag charities and destroy trade unions; we are building on the
transparency already created by this Government in relation to
Ministers reporting their meetings by establishing a register of
consultant lobbyists, by reducing the risk of super-PACs, or political
action committees, and by ensuring that trade unions have up-to-date
membership lists.</hs_Para>

Leader of the House spoke for 44 minutes during which she made no
reference to her own party’s policy. We had high-octane rhetoric
that was very low in calorific value. She talked about furious
displacement activity—reference, presumably, to what happened in
the 13 years of Labour Government, when there was furious displacement
activity on lobbying but no lobbying legislation. This Government are
now acting on that. I wonder whether the hon. Lady feels any
embarrassment about her wildly inaccurate allegations about what the
Bill will or will not do. I am not sure whether she is doing that

misunderstood it. I will give her a couple of

today, I was contacted by a councillor in Grantham, Councillor Davies;

before, and visited Margaret’s birthplace, which is now a health
spa. The place is very humble; it certainly was a humble little shop
that she used to run, but obviously Grantham has changed and the place
is right opposite an Asda. If Margaret had been born in my

can think of no other British politician whose legacy is as lasting or
far-reaching as Margaret’s. There can be no doubt that her

a member of the Conservative party for 45 years and I would never have
joined it all those years ago were it not for Margaret. I was a
resident in the London borough of Newham, which contains the
constituency that produced the first ever Labour Member of Parliament,
Keir Hardie. I was 
<?notus-xml column=288?>sick to death of people reminiscing about how the good old days were and
how to get out of poverty. I wanted someone to inspire me with a

missed our earlier debate here, but I did attend the ceremonial
funeral. I thought that Margaret’s funeral was an absolute
tribute to those who organised it and to this country. It was a
privilege for me, and for so many of my colleagues who did not really

trebled during Margaret’s decade. Historically, long-term

course, there is also the fundamental legacy of privatisation and
economic policy. That policy was never reversed by
successive Governments and has been copied all over the world. As late
as 1977, the UK Government were still nationalising
industry—aerospace and ship building—and Baroness
Thatcher had to reverse the trend to resuscitate our country, which was
then known as the sick man of Europe. More than 50 companies
were put back into the hands of the people, including huge companies
such as British Gas, British Telecom and British Airways. Not only was
£50 billion raised for the Treasury, but competition was birthed
and private shareholding grew. The consumer benefited, with gas prices
falling by 25% in 1995 and telecom charges falling by 40%. The basic
rate of tax fell from 33% in 1979 to 23% by the time Margaret left
office. A strong pro-aspiration message was heard. Incredibly,
29 million working days were lost to strikes in 1979,

As Prime Minister, she offered schools a chance to come out of direct

essentials: maths, English and the sciences. The current Secretary of

Thatcher’s tangible legacies are found where I was born: the
east end of London. She, through her dynamism, absolutely changed the
docklands, which everyone enjoys now, and as we particularly did during
last year’s Olympic games. <I>The Daily Telegraph</I> recently
ran a story asking, “Will Canary Wharf be Baroness
Thatcher’s greatest lasting legacy?” I know that it will
be one of them. After designating the London docklands as an enterprise
zone and offering tax breaks to local businesses, the then Prime
Minister phoned Paul Reichmann to kick-start the project and persuaded
him, as only she could, to take on the project. None of this could have
happened without the lifting of exchange controls, which Baroness
Thatcher did when she was first elected. Finance from abroad poured
into London, and it became the most prominent city in the

because of the financial pressure that built up during the old, broken

private companies to tender for contracts in 1981. Just nine years
later, the tunnel was built. It was part of her wider vision to build
up Britain again and to revitalise our economy. Even the roots of

I think it is best to draw a line under that. I will just say to my
Conservative colleagues in the Chamber that we should never air our
dirty linen in public. The greatest leader I have even known should
certainly have been treated differently. Considering that I represented

Thatcher was a remarkable Prime Minister and an inspiration to any

us men, but—this is certainly the experience in my

the same Prime Minister who revitalised east London, the place where I
grew up, successfully restructured the whole economy, dragging Britain
away from the danger zone, leaving the physical marks of her success
in, for instance, the Eurostar and the London docklands.</hs_Para>

do, Mr Speaker—may the army of unelected decision-makers take
note. She stood up for Britain in Europe and liberated the Falkland
Islands from the Argentine invaders. She stood up for freedom and
democracy against the tyranny of communism. She defeated socialism. She
believed that Government should create the conditions under which 
<?notus-xml column=293?>every human being should be given the opportunity to make the most of
their lives. She made this country and our world better places in which

hon. Friend was entirely right in talking about her legacy. We are all
painfully aware as politicians that very few of us who pass through
this place leave any traces that stand the test of time. His central
point was 
<?notus-xml column=294?>that the legacy she leaves is as lasting and far-reaching as
anyone’s, and I totally agree. I think that the only point of

my hon. Friend, I was very proud to be at St Paul’s

my father, who, as my hon. Friend kindly mentioned, served Margaret
Thatcher for such a long time. It did feel like the passing of an era.
Much has been said, and was said there, about her strength and resolve.
Personally, I was very pleased that in all the tributes so much was
said about her personal kindness and courtesy, alongside the
Boadicea-style tributes. It was hard not to be moved by the concern
that she showed for the families of British soldiers, not least those
who died in the Falklands. My father still speaks of his admiration for
the way in which she handled herself in the incredibly difficult
situation after the Hillsborough tragedy, walking round the hospital
with him and talking to families as they stood round the bedsides of
young lads from Liverpool, many of whom were to go on to die. He said
that she was absolutely magnificent. In a situation that he found
personally very awkward, she did not find it so; she knew exactly what

addiction. Cigarettes are the only legal product sold in the UK that
kills consumers when used exactly as the manufacturer intends. Why
should any company be allowed to promote such a product 
<?notus-xml column=6?>through advertising and marketing? The tobacco industry has made a great
fuss about its intellectual property rights, but why should we allow
any such claimed rights to trump the requirements of child protection

much agree with what was said in the earlier exchanges: if it is such a
terrible product, have the honesty, as many in the health industry do
not, to say that the whole product should be banned. I would accept

it clear at the outset: I accept fully that tobacco is addictive, but
it is a legal drug for adults. I am the father of two young
children—a son of five and a daughter of two—and I would
not want them to take up tobacco, not least because my late father also
died of lung cancer. In passing, it is worth making the observation
that our coalition partners and the Opposition would allow 16 and
17-year-olds to vote, but not to purchase cigarettes. The age
restriction for tobacco, of course, has risen from 16 in recent
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:03:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000078">I
accept that tobacco smoking is subject to commensurate regulations and
restrictions. No one should sensibly want to see children take up
smoking or should encourage them to take up the habit. I believe that
we should do all we can to discourage, to educate and ultimately to
prevent those under the legal age from taking up smoking. However, I
also believe passionately in the concept of freedom of choice. The
decision of whether or not to smoke should remain that of an informed
adult, without gratuitous interference from the
state<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:03:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000079">One
should not forget that tobacco is already one of the most highly
regulated products in the world. The introduction of plain packaging
would almost certainly amount to a regulation too far, and the
so-called “denormalisation” of tobacco is not a
sufficiently valid policy decision to justify such action. Any decision
by the coalition Government must be unequivocally evidence-based. To
contemplate taking such a significant measure for a legal product, the
evidence base must be rock solid and reliable, with a guarantee that it
will have the outcome intended.</hs_Para>

confess that I am very pleased that the Department did not place a bid
in this year’s Queen’s Speech, and that the Government,
with a very libertarian junior Minister as we know, have sensibly

Paisley:</Member></B>
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:07:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
makes an excellent point. I shall deal with the evidence on three
issues. First, the Republic of Ireland has the tightest, harshest laws
on public smoking. When it introduced those laws 10 years ago—it
set the trend on this—smoking stood at 30% of the public. After
10 years of enforcement, enforcement, enforcement, today the number of
people who smoke in the Republic of Ireland is 30%. There has not been
one single change to consumption, yet we are told that this drive is
all about reducing consumption. It does not actually work.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090332000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000087">How<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:08:06"></hs_TimeCode>
do we address consumption? We do what the hon. Member for Banbury (Sir
Tony Baldry) says: educate young people. In Germany, they have done
that and consumption has fallen to 16%. Why? Because they educated the
very young and persuaded people that smoking was not the course of
action they should take. They educated them away from cigarettes.
They<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:08:17"></hs_TimeCode> also do
another thing: they enforce. In other words, an adult cannot go into a
shop, buy fags and give them to a 16-year-old. They enforce against
adults who do that. Unfortunately, many people in this country go into
shops and purchase cigarettes, or purchase illicit trade cigarettes out
of the back of someone’s car, and then give them to young
people. We should enforce against that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090332000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000088">I also want
to deal with the myth about illicit trade.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:08:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Harrow East (Bob Blackman) should know much better. To suggest that
HMRC is on top of the illicit trade in this country is to put
one’s head in the sand. Last year, HMRC gave evidence to the
Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs about illicit trade, and
tobacco was dealt with. HMRC is fighting a tsunami of counterfeit trade
in this country.</hs_Para>

my country, 25% of all cigarettes smoked are illegal. In Scotland, the
figure is about 27%. If we are pretending today that the authorities
are on top of the 
<?notus-xml column=12?>issue, we are absolutely, totally and completely wrong. We have to
recognise that counterfeiters are rubbing their hands with glee at the
prospect of their job being made easier. They will be able to get a
simpler package cover that is standardised across the whole UK and push
it out across the UK, getting people to smoke brands that are
counterfeit and illicitly brought into the country. Remember that the
people doing that are not Sunday school teachers; they are serious
organised criminals who are involved in serious criminal
endeavours.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:10:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

tobacco industry clearly has a desperate fight on its hands to keep its
profits. Over many years—many decades—it has resorted to
a range of techniques. One story that used to be told was that if
someone smokes, they are less likely to get Alzheimer’s disease.
That is absolutely true, as has been
sai<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:13:43"></hs_TimeCode>d—but
the main reason is that they are quite likely to die before they get
Alzheimer’s disease. I am not sure that that is quite what was
intended<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:10:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000092">The
question that we must ask when thinking about proposals to introduce
plain packaging, which I completely and utterly support, is this: will
it work? Study after study shows that with plain packaging, the packs
will be less attractive to adults and to children and that that will
reduce the number of people taking up smoking. Some 200,000 children
take up smoking each year. We could make a real change. Smoking is
presented as cool, but that is not the type of cool that we want to
see. We can make a
difference.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000093">In
Australia, there is already research on what the effects of plain
packaging have been. It is very clear that plain packaging increases
smokers’ urgency to quit and lowers the appeal of smoking. It is
going the right way; it is having the right results. That is why I was
so disappointed to see the Government’s decision to wait until
we have a clearer view of the impact in Australia.</hs_Para>

scientific perspective, it always makes sense to wait for better
evidence. We could wait another year, five years, 10 years or 100 years
and we will get more and more evidence, but in the meantime people will
be taking up smoking and dying as a result. We simply do not have the
luxury of waiting for ever to get the most perfect possible results.
Australia has understood that and taken action, and many countries
around the world, from Ireland to India, are following that lead. As
the Australian Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, highlighted, the laws
are “anti-cancer, not
anti-trade<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:12:14"></hs_TimeCode>”.

He is right. Labour did many good things. We curtailed advertising. We
introduced the ban on 
<?notus-xml column=14?>smoking in public places. But we did not do enough and we need to do
more. When I spoke about this package at an anti-smoking do in
Parliament, JTI—Japan Tobacco International—had a spy in
the room and wrote to me afterwards, saying, “Mr Ruane,
you’ve got it all wrong. These are called 14s because there are
14 cigarettes inside the packet.” It was a Miss Laura Oates who

not doing enough on proxy purchasing.</hs_Para>

for Salford, I want to speak because smoking, smoking-related deaths
and lung cancer rates are all too high there. One in four of the
population in Salford smoke, which is a much higher rate than the
average of one in five people in England as a whole. Consequently, we
have much higher rates of smoking-related death and a higher incidence
of lung cancer, with 175 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed each year.
The worst statistic is perhaps the Cancer Research UK estimate that
around 1,000 children in Salford start smoking each year; that

smokers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000143">Early<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:29:25"></hs_TimeCode>

associated the following words with designer packaging: popular, cool
and good-looking. With cigarettes in plain packaging, they associated
the words boring, geeky and cheap. In 2012, another survey found that
young people felt that if they smoked stylish packs they would be
“better and more popular”. The evidence is there. We do

packaging”. That is what we are talking about. We have seen
today examples of the sort of packaging that has been used, and in the
evidence submitted as part of the preparations for the debate we have
seen how those who lead tobacco companies talk about the value they
place on packaging as a tool to solicit more custom and get more people
to take up smoking in the first place. Big tobacco needs to recruit
more smokers because it has to replace those who quit and, more
chillingly, those who die as a consequence of taking up smoking. That
is why we must have a bias towards action to protect the health of
children and young people from the harm that smoking
does.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000162">In
its systematic review of evidence, published as part of its
consultation, the Department of Health gathered absolutely clear and
strong evidence of the impact of standardised packaging on reducing
smoking. The evidence is there; what is lacking is the political will.
The Minister has that will, but the Government as yet do not.
Parliament should take a leaf out of the book of the previous
Parliament, when it came to smoking in enclosed public places. It was
not the then Government who led on that; 
<?notus-xml column=21?>they hid behind many of the same arguments that are being used now. Yet
again, it took the leadership of the Health Committee—having an
inquiry, producing a report and publishing the evidence—to make
the case for the ban, and the Government being prepared to allow a free
vote.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000163">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:39:15"></hs_TimeCode>

for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry) quite moving. For me, the image of a
child on his father’s ward with all those men dying from lung

and foremost, I will deal with the bogus idea that we can compare the
packaging of cigarettes with that of sweet or fatty foods, alcohol and
so on. If people consume alcohol and packaged sugary or fatty goods in
the quantities indicated on the packaging—all packaged goods now
have information about calories and what proportion of people’s
diets should be made up of particular food groups, and all alcohol
packaging tells people the advisable level of consumption—the
effect on health is marginal. If they consume tobacco in the way
manufacturers indicate, half of lifelong smokers will die—no
ifs, no buts. Tobacco is the only legal substance for which, if
consumed as indicated, half of consumers will die. In relation to
packaging, that makes tobacco a wholly different case from alcohol and
sugary and fatty foods. In my view, it is a dishonest argument to try
to make that
comparison<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:42:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

know that half of lifetime smokers will die from smoking, that it
remains the largest preventable cause of cancer, that it causes one in
four deaths from cancer and eight in 10 deaths from lung cancer, and
that smoking is the biggest cause of health inequality. That is what
makes tobacco packaging different and makes the measures so

children, the key to the debate is not whether a change in packaging
would make established smokers alter their habits, but the attraction
that packaging holds for children. The question is one of child
protection: although adults can make their decision about smoking,
society has a responsibility, which some speakers have ignored, to
protect children. Even Members who do not accept that must agree that
we have a responsibility to bear down on the millions of pounds a year
that it costs the NHS to deal with the consequences of
smoking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:44:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000172">We

locally, which is why it is so important to move public health to local

of those issues on which what is done upstream—Government
measures—has the most impact. In the lifetimes of everyone in
the Chamber, levels of smoking have gone down, and attitudes to smoking
have changed. When I was a child, people smoked on the television, in
films, in meetings and in offices, none of which is now acceptable.
That shows what we can do in public health with a mix of moral suasion
and legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:44:51"></hs_TimeCode>,

is the last brick in the

is important to make the point that we are discussing UK packaging. As
part of my role as shadow public health Minister, I have been to
Europe—to Brussels and so on—to talk about the issue. In
Brussels, people are clear that one reason why the tobacco industry is
so exercised about packaging is not profits in the UK, but the example
that UK legislation would set to the rest of the world, including the
huge markets in China and Africa. What is at stake is not a marginal
decrease in profit here; it is the big problem of profits forgone in
the huge markets elsewhere. That is why it is so important for us in
Parliament to set the right example—not just for the health of
British people or because of the costs to the health service, but for
the rest of the
world<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:45:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000175">In
closing, I congratulate such organisations as Cancer Research UK and
Action on Smoking and Health that have been ceaseless in bringing the
facts before the public and MPs. We know that the issues are difficult
and that the Government face the money and power of big tobacco. To be
candid, that is why my Government in the end allowed a free vote. If
this debate can get one important thing rolling, it should be pressure
on the Government at the highest level to allow Parliament to discuss
the question: let us debate and decide. The health of Britain’s
children and the general population depends on it and the spiralling
cost of the NHS depends on it, as does the health of people all over
the world, to whom we can set an example with exemplary legislation on
cigarette packaging.</hs_Para>

died at the age of 56 from lung cancer. I do not think that there was

tobacco—to smoking. I say with considerable shame, if I may put
it that way, that until just over five years ago, I, too, was a smoker;
both my brothers continue to smoke. I am not for one moment saying that
if people are not or have not been smokers, they cannot engage in the

some weakness within us, which I think is the power of nicotine. It is
often said that nicotine is more addictive even than heroin. Although I
have never directly experienced heroin, when I was a criminal barrister
I had enough clients to know how powerful heroin and cocaine are.
Goodness me, even they would say that nicotine is a dreadful substance

an occasional basis. Indeed there is evidence that it can help certain
people with their health. I am talking about the gentle consumption of
alcohol or sugar. Indeed there is nothing wrong with eating sweets for
goodness sake or even chips and other fatty substances. It is all a
question of how much one eats; it should be part of a sensible and
well-balanced diet. There is nothing in support of cigarettes or
tobacco. It is about as barmy as saying, “If you want to help
yourself after a stressful day, have a fag.”

Soubry:</Member></B> May I make some progress, because it is really
important that I make the matter clear? The coalition Government have
made no final decision. As I have said, we wait to see the evidence as
it emerges from both Ireland and Australia. It is important to say

<?notus-xml column=25?>standardised packaging is no silver bullet. There is no simple solution
to the problem of persuading both the remaining 20% of the population

up smoking. He is right to say that we need to do more research. We

know, for instance, the power of parents. If a child is brought up by
parents who smoke, they are likely to smoke because they will see it as
the norm. One of the great benefits of the legislation that was
introduced by the previous Administration—I pay full credit to
them for introducing that ban on smoking in open places—was that
it made smoking less socially acceptable. Effectively, it turned many
of us into modern-day lepers. If we wanted to smoke, we were reduced to
standing outside, ostracised from our workmates, and that was a
powerful reason why so many of us gave up smoking. Many of us remember
with shame, as I do, sitting in restaurants thinking that we had some
God-given right to smoke next to people who rightly found it deeply
offensive, and who were trying to enjoy their meals. It is astonishing
to look back at films and television programmes of only a few years ago
to see how acceptable smoking was and how the previous Parliament
changed that.</hs_Para>

absolutely agree with all those who are trying to nail the falsehood in
two important parts of this argument about standardised packaging. The
first is whether it is plain. I concede that one of the great failings
of this debate is to explain what we mean by
“standardised”. That goes back to the point that was
inaccurately made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:57:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

glamorous or glitzy, but that, as I think
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:57:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Harrow East also tried to say, under the regulation and

<?notus-xml column=26?>holograms can be put on standardised packaging—not to be

being a counterfeiter’s charter and dream, standardised
packaging is a counterfeiter’s nightmare. I wish that I had with
me some of the packets that have been produced by Australia. If we had

they have colour in them, but they have the standardisation, which

Soubry:</Member></B> I think I have explained why we have waited. My
understanding of the statistics is that it is 20%, but it differs in
different parts of the country. I also want to make the point that the
Government have not stepped away from taking action against the harmful
effects of tobacco. We have a tobacco control plan for England that
sets out our national ambitions and our comprehensive evidence-based
strategy of national and local actions to achieve them, including
high-profile marketing campaigns. Our Stoptober campaign, which was
hugely successful last year and which we will be running again this
year, provided help and assistance to smokers, the majority of whom
want to quit.</hs_Para>

Government’s position absolutely clear. I congratulate again
everybody who has spoken in this debate. My own views are clear, but it
is right to wait to see the evidence. I assure Members that the wise
words from so many different parties today will be taken back to the

standardised packaging will be

titled this debate, “Social Enterprise and the Wider UK
Economy”, because I wanted to focus on the economic dimension of
social enterprise. Social enterprise is often considered by politicians
solely in the context of charitable and voluntary organisations, under
the umbrella title  of voluntary community and social
enterprises. That  is understandable, of course. Social
enterprises are community-focused organisations designed to fulfil a
certain social purpose, and, because of that social purpose, they are
often confused with charities or voluntary
organisations.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:01:44"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

I see social enterprises as being much wider and much more than that. I
see the social enterprise model as a way of reforming our economy so
that we combine competitiveness and profitability with social justice
and fairness; a way of spreading growth across the country, so that all
communities can benefit; and a way of engaging with parts of our
society that have found it difficult to get involved in our economy,
and allowing their talents to shine. In short, I see social enterprise
in the mainstream of the British economy, powering a socially and
economically sustainable
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:02:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000201">That
potential for economic and social renewal was highlighted by the recent
state of the sector survey compiled by Social Enterprise UK. The
survey, which was excellently titled, “The People’s
Business”, showed that social enterprises are not only growing
faster than traditional small and medium-sized enterprises, but are
more resilient, focused on our most deprived communities and create a
more diversified business leadership.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090332000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000202">According<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T10:22:36"></hs_TimeCode>
to the survey, 38% of social enterprises saw an increase in turnover
compared with 29% of SMEs, and only 22% of social enterprises
experienced a decrease in turnover compared with 31% of SMEs. Also, the
number of social enterprises that expect to take on more employees in
the next 12 months is double the number that traditional SMEs have
indicated in similar surveys. In addition, 38% of social enterprises
worked in the most deprived 20% of our communities in the UK, compared
with just 12% of SMEs; 38% of social enterprises had a female leader,
compared with 19% of SMEs; 91% of social enterprises had at least one
woman on their leadership team, compared with less than half of SMEs;
and, finally, 15% of social enterprise leaders are from the black,
Asian and minority ethnic
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:03:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000203">Those
are not merely isolated statistics. There is evidence from other
sources that social enterprises are growing rapidly. The Royal Bank of
Scotland Social 
<?notus-xml column=28?>Enterprise 100 Index, which follows the growth of the social enterprise
sector, shows the top 100 social enterprises growing by 60% in the past
year. Although down from 90% growth in the previous year, a growth rate
of 60% is still very
commendable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:04:21"></hs_TimeCode>.
Also, the Cabinet Office’s research into the sector indicates
that social enterprises are likely to be larger than traditional SMEs.
Therefore, increasing the number of social enterprises is likely to
lead to greater job
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:04:35"></hs_TimeCode>. Given
the focus that is being placed on growth and job creation across
Government, the evidence suggests that, if we want to achieve those
objectives, we have to place social enterprise at the very heart of our
economic
agenda<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:04:48"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:04:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000204">However,
this issue is not just about micro-economics. I know that the Treasury
and other Departments are often in the grip of the macro-economic
debate. Since the mid-1970s, wages as a percentage of GDP have fallen
considerably, from more than 64% of GDP to around 55%, creating a gap
of £7,000 between the potential for earnings if they had stayed
at the same percentage of GDP as in the mid-1970s and the current
percentage. That has been mirrored by a fall in investment during the
same period, but there has been a rise in profits, particularly in
financial services. The increasing financialisation of our economy has
reduced growth, with profits being creamed from the real economy, which
in turn has led to reduced investment in new products and lower
wages<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:05:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

need a new model of business that is unlikely to succumb to that
process, and to ensure that growth does not merely lead to higher
profits but is reinvested in our communities and comes back into the
pockets of our people. I believe that social enterprise is that
model<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:05:59"></hs_TimeCode>. The
principles of social enterprise see profits reinvested in communities,
and the focus placed on engaging with staff and improving their lives,
not only because of the productivity benefits but—most
importantly—because it is the right thing to do. So, whether it
is micro or macro, the case for social enterprise is very
strong.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000206">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:06:20"></hs_TimeCode>
should not be afraid of new business models. In the 19th century, many
of our major businesses and employers were family-run firms or
partnerships. Then we saw the emergence of large publicly traded
companies, where the discipline of the market would lead to growth. As
that model appears to be flagging, we should look to the next structure
that can achieve our aspirations, both for social progress and economic
growth. Social enterprise is that next
step<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:06:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000207">I

heart of our strategy in the years ahead. Now I believe that we need to
focus on the practical steps we can take to achieve
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:07:07"></hs_TimeCode>. We should
focus on a number of areas. First, the Government need to take several
steps to improve the way that they engage with social enterprise. As I
mentioned at the start, social enterprises are often just lumped
together with charities and voluntary organisations. Although the
social enterprise sector has strong links to civil society as a whole,
ultimately we need to consider social enterprise in the same way as we
consider other forms of
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:07:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000208">In
the same way that policies targeted at SMEs are developed in the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, we need to do more to
have social enterprise considered in BIS policy making and to ensure
that this type of business is considered alongside SMEs and 
<?notus-xml column=29?>other key areas. That would be useful for a number of reasons.
Primarily, it would ensure that, when policies directed at supporting
businesses are created, social enterprise is considered as part of
that.</hs_Para>

enterprise investment scheme and the venture capital trusts scheme were

of our economy. However, the structure of those policies was such that
social enterprises were often unable to take part in
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:08:27"></hs_TimeCode>. I cannot
help but think that, if social enterprise was being equally considered
in BIS as well as in the Cabinet Office, social enterprises would have
been fully integrated into those important policies at a time when
those enterprises needed them most. It would also send out a strong
message to social enterprises and to the wider economy about the role
that the Government see social enterprise as possibly

I said, I believe that social enterprise could be in the mainstream of
our economic strategy. However, placing social enterprises just under
the “civil society” banner suggests that social
enterprise is not being considered in the same light as traditional
business. That is not the right message, and if we want to support the
sector more widely, having BIS lead equally on social enterprise would
be
helpful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:09:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000211">Moreover,
when budgetary and spending decisions are made, social enterprise
should be considered for not merely its social but its wider economic
impact. I believe that having social enterprise at the heart of BIS
would help ensure that that was the case. I understand that the
Minister covers part of the Government’s social enterprise
brief, but correspondence with the Department suggests that that
relates only to community interest companies rather than to the sector
as a whole. One might argue that, given the Cabinet Office’s
role in social investment, social enterprise should remain in its
portfolio, but I do not believe that to be necessary.</hs_Para>

social enterprise is at the centre of discussions about social
investment, many of the problems that face social enterprise relate to
traditional forms of finance, tax and regulation. Social investment is
a special kind of investment, which also covers charities and voluntary
organisations, and although it is appropriate for social investment to

enterprise, social enterprise is much broader than social

Government can assist the sector by better data collection. Social
Enterprise UK currently undertakes the largest dedicated survey of the
social enterprise sector, which is useful for policy makers, but to

variety of good research exists, there are still many things that we do
not know about the social enterprise sector. The Government should use
their strong statistical organisation to fill those gaps and create a
comprehensive picture of the sector, working with organisations such as
Social Enterprise UK and regional bodies like Social Enterprise West
Midlands to capture as much knowledge as possible. Doing so would
enable the UK to remain a world leader in social enterprise and

about such business and its rich potential.</hs_Para>

can also assist by creating strong social investment tax relief. I
appreciate that a consultation is under way to examine how such tax
relief might be created, and I look forward to contributing to that in
due course. I urge the Minister to ensure that the Treasury considers a
tax regime that is as broad and extensive as possible. Across the
country and across the world, members of the public, banks, pension
funds and businesses want to generate returns on their investments. At
a time of low interest rates when good returns are hard to find, we
have a chance to encourage investors to consider social as well as
financial returns.</hs_Para>

investment tax relief regime that made it easy for investors to invest
and took into account the particular challenges facing social
enterprises—around equity finance, profits and
governance—could help boost the sector and institutionally
ingrain an understanding of social investment. I hope, therefore, that
the Government will listen to organisations that have contributed to
the discussion, including Social Enterprise UK, the social investment
forum and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, and
establish a tax regime that lasts for the next decade and helps meet
the real need for finance that holds back many fantastic social
enterprises.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000217">Alongside
tax relief, the Government would be wise to consider a new form of ISA
for social investment. There is growing public appetite for ethical and
responsible investment. According to a YouGov poll for national ethical
investment week last year, 55% of adults in Britain who have
investments want their bank or financial adviser to tell them more
about how they can generate both social and financial returns. Other
polling indicates that the vast majority of the public want their banks
and pension funds to think about environmental, social and governance
issues when deciding in whom to invest. The creation of a social
investment or social impact ISA would open up billions of pounds for
social enterprises and feed the appetite of the public for socially
responsible investment. The structure of the ISA would have to
compensate investors for the likelihood that the risks would be higher
and the returns lower, but we must tap into the much wider pool of
personal savings and make people feel part of the social enterprise
movement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000218">I
could touch on other areas that affect social enterprise, such as
public sector contracts and access to finance, but I have raised such
issues previously and the ground has been well trodden. I hope that,
during this short speech, I have been able to outline the potential
that social enterprise has for our economy and the need for it to be
considered as part of the mainstream of the economic debate. If we are
going to grow in the years ahead, the UK needs to develop a resilient
economic model that uses all our communities’ talents. To do so,
we require a different type of business and a more socially responsible
model, and BIS must work with the Cabinet Office to achieve
that.</hs_Para>

enterprise is challenging, because it stands as a bridge between civil
society and the traditional private sector. The fact that it crosses
those boundaries is its greatest strength, but it can be a weakness in
public policy making. We need a joined-up approach that recognises that
social enterprises are not only catalysts of social action, but
businesses that can help create jobs, spread growth more fairly across
our communities and bring about a sustainable economic
recovery.</hs_Para>

am confident that the Minister appreciates that and works with her
colleagues in the Cabinet Office, such as the Parliamentary Secretary,
Cabinet Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip, Northwood and
Pinner (Nick Hurd), who has responsibility for civil society. However,
I urge her to do more to ensure that social enterprise is at the heart

present economic and political situation represents a unique window of
opportunity. The social enterprise sector is keen to take the lead in
driving growth in our economy and improving our society. New movements
such as the social economy alliance indicate the interest and support
that exists across the country for a new way of doing business and
structuring our economy. The Government have an interest in seeing that
happen, and I hope that we can focus on removing barriers to social
enterprise and establishing practical policies to support its growth. I
look forward to the Minister’s comments on the matter, and I
hope that she and her colleagues in BIS and across Government will
continue actively to engage with the social enterprise sector to ensure
that we achieve our shared social and economic
objectives.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_03_PT_1/BAE67A97566A18D6AC1B9FB313DA5466BE1733C2" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="3 September 2013">Tuesday

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills (Jo Swinson):</Member></B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the
Member for Warwick and Leamington (Chris White) for securing this
debate on the important issue of social enterprise. I start by paying
tribute to the work that my hon. Friend has done and will continue to
do on the matter, in his role as social value ambassador and as chair
of the all-party group on social enterprise. He raised several
important issues in his speech, which I look forward to debating. As a
Minister with a keen interest in social enterprise, I look forward to
working with him in future, because we must drive progress and help
social enterprises not only to become successful in themselves but to
develop into an attractive model for other organisations to
adopt.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090332000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000223">My
hon. Friend described the numerous advantages that flow from social
enterprise as a business model, including resilience in tough times,
increased turnover and improved diversity in comparison with more
traditional business models. He focused, importantly, on the fact that
social enterprise is a new model of business, which offers an exciting
opportunity. The financial crisis of 2008 was a huge shock to our
economy. We all want our economy to grow, to recover and to get back on
to a sure footing, but simply to return to business as usual in exactly
the same way as we did before the downturn would be a mistake and a
wasted opportunity. We have an obvious opportunity to consider new ways
of doing business that might better serve not only our economy but our
communities and our society. Business is inextricably linked with the
communities and societies in which it operates, because its customers
and staff are based in that society. Many more enlightened businesses
recognise the need to hold on to that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090332000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000224"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>It
was also right to highlight that growth should help to lead to higher
profits, which can increase wealth and improve living standards.
However, it is also important to ensure that, as businesses grow, they
can, as my hon. 
<?notus-xml column=32?>Friend said, reinvest in the community in which they operate. Many MPs
on both sides of the House are interested in supporting local
businesses in their areas so that more of the money spent in the local
economy can stay there and help local people to thrive. There is also
the issue of the investment organisations make in their
people.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090332000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000225"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>Social
enterprise is a good model from a business and a productivity point of
view. As my hon. Friend said, however, it is also often one way of
doing the right thing. He highlighted the fact that customers and
investors are more and more interested in the way in which businesses
operate. The issue is not just the return businesses provide or the
price people pay at the till, but the way in which businesses operate
in wider society. Through the Trading for Good website, my Department
has been supporting initiatives to enable small businesses to showcase
the great things they are doing, such as employing apprentices and
dealing with youth employment in their area, as well as their
environmental credentials and their support for fair trade and
developing countries—there is a whole range of ways in which
small businesses take their responsibilities seriously. There is,
therefore, an increasing appetite for a different approach.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090332000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000226"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:21:26"></hs_TimeCode>That
very much dovetails with an issue I have championed in the House for
many years. Before I was a Minister, I was a co-founder of the
all-party group on wellbeing economics, which recognises my hon.
Friend’s point about how we see the importance of growth. Is GDP
the be-all and end-all? If we ask most people what they want from life,
they will talk about the health and happiness of themselves and those
close to them, but we have a system that has until now deified the
pursuit of GDP growth above all else. That is why I was pleased to see
the Government working with the Office for National Statistics on
measuring national well-being so that we can assess policies and the
impact of Government decisions against a much wider range of metrics
than purely GDP. Although GDP remains an important tool, we should also
be able to analyse social and environmental impacts, which might even
lead to some more innovative policy proposals. That is an important
approach in business, as well as in Government policy
making<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T11:22:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090332000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0001.htm#13090332000227">While
it is important to extol the benefits and virtues of social enterprise,
it is worth noting in passing that businesses can use different models
in taking their responsibilities seriously. Many businesses out there
may not meet the definition of a social enterprise in terms of where
their profits go and what their prime purpose is, but they none the
less take great pride in conducting their affairs with a degree of
responsibility we would want others to copy.</hs_Para>

only to promote social enterprise, but to encourage other business
models to embrace corporate responsibility. Indeed, as part of a
consultation, a call for views is currently ongoing on how to develop a
corporate responsibility framework so that businesses representing a
range of different models can showcase what they are doing on corporate
responsibility. I encourage interested hon. Members to contribute to
that call for views before it closes later this month. Indeed, for the
benefit of those watching on BBC Parliament or reading the record of
our proceedings in <I>Hansard</I>, I should say that that offer is open
not only to MPs.</hs_Para>

is vital to recognise the clear benefit of social enterprise to our
economy. While it puts social and environmental concerns before profit,
it also plays a significant role in our economy. In 2012, the BIS small
business survey found that there were 70,000 SME social enterprise
employers. The figure is as high as 283,000 if we include sole traders,
and it is even higher if we include larger companies. Many of the 1,700
registered housing associations are social enterprises, and they spend
£13 billion a year in the UK. Social enterprise creates
employment for about 1 million people in the UK economy, and it makes
an overall contribution of £18 billion, so it already plays an
important role across the wider economy.</hs_Para>

public sector contracts, we need to improve the way in which smaller
social enterprises can win business, and there is an opportunity to
enhance further the role social enterprise plays. However, we would not
be doing social enterprise justice if we viewed it purely through the
lens of the role it can play in public sector contracts, because it
also plays a vibrant role in the private sector, and its main source of
income is trade with the general public.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend was absolutely right when he made the key point that BIS
has a key interest in this area. Like him, I do not want social
enterprise just to be lumped in with charities and civil society,
important though they are. This is a business issue, so BIS is rightly
involved. Back in June, we reaffirmed our commitment to helping SMEs
succeed, and we will launch a strategy on that in the autumn. One of
the key stakeholders we will be working with in developing it is Social
Enterprise UK, because social enterprises are an important part of the
SME sector.</hs_Para>

would like to outline a few of the ways in which the Government are
supporting social enterprise. Community interest companies were
mentioned, and they are a new and exciting way of forming a company. As
my hon. Friend said, they are covered by my Department. Such companies
are the world’s first legal form for social enterprises, so we
are pioneering on this matter, which is the right place for Britain to
be. That model is very helpful.</hs_Para>

also have the regional growth fund, which will provide £60
million of funding over six years for lending to small and
micro-businesses that create or safeguard jobs, with a significant
impact in communities in parts of the country that most need that
funding, some of which goes to social enterprises.</hs_Para>

is also the European regional development fund. We secured £3

is important to talk about the social investment market, which has now
passed the £200 million mark, so it is rapidly growing. That
figure is up from £150 million just three years ago,
and we want to grow the market further so that it is measured in
billions, not millions. The proposal for tax relief on social
investment, which my hon. Friend mentioned, is a key part of that. The
Prime Minister launched it at the G8 social impact investment
conference on 6 June. Again, I encourage people to send their views
into the consultation on this issue.</hs_Para>

Friend encouraged me to ensure the Treasury did the right thing, and I
am flattered by his view that  I have the power to require it
to do anything. However, I know my Treasury colleagues are also
committed to this issue, and the intention is that we will introduce
tax relief in 2014. The consultation is open until Friday, and I hope
my hon. Friend will contribute; the more voices there are encouraging
the Treasury, the better.
<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>The proposal

Act 2012, which I am sure my hon. Friend is proud to have introduced in
the House. Not every MP gets to take legislation through the House, and
it is not easy to do, so I congratulate him on his success. The Act
means public sector organisations must take account of economic, social

the vibrant mix of business models in the UK economy. The goal is to
look beyond simple measures of GDP, which do not capture everything
that determines society’s well-being. As we still come to terms
with the financial crisis of 2008, the contribution of social
enterprises will no doubt be more important than ever. I hope
today’s debate has encouraged us all to think more carefully

While I welcome the Government’s and his commitment on new

in the law as such. When I have sought advice from people who are
legally qualified—I have a deal of service in local government,
and we often dealt with guidance on housing benefit and so
on—the advice that I have got is that the legal status of the
revised guidance is the same as that of the old guidance, which was

for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams) is formal training for
police officers who deal with firearms licences. The issue was noted by
the coroner in his report on the Horden shootings. No formal training
was available to officers in 2006-07 in Horden, where the perpetrator,
Michael Atherton, applied for shotgun and firearms licences. More
concerningly, it is evident that even today, after the lessons from
Horden and other incidents around the country, little formal training
is offered to police officers. The expectation is effectively that
police officers learn on the job, presumably from more experienced
colleagues. That could be hugely problematic and lead to enormous
variations around the country.</hs_Para>

Durham or the hon. Gentleman’s constituency are suitably trained

that the guidance is not fit for purpose and could, relatively

those the hon. Gentleman has talked about, but I emphasise that such
incidents involve a mere 0.01% of firearms licence holders in this
country. Such cases are dreadful and dramatic, but involve a very small
number of those who legally hold firearms and shotgun certificates. In
this debate and in Parliament we are discussing giving the police more
time to deal with those cases and to ensure that such people never hold
a firearms certificate. I totally agree with the hon. Gentleman on
that, but I do not agree that the way of dealing with the matter is

provisions to ensure that individuals with a history of domestic

guidance, police offers are told that they should speak to the 
<?notus-xml column=42?>family of any applicant with a known history of domestic violence and
that speaking to an applicant’s spouse or partner might be
considered essential. Such discussion would be in complete confidence
and a partner would not be asked to approve or not approve a firearms
licence. That guidance will ensure that the correct consultation takes
place when anyone with a history of domestic violence applies for a
firearms

specific case, but domestic violence was cited by the officers who
sought to revoke Atherton’s shotgun licence. A senior officer
looked at case law and, because a firearm was not used in the four
earlier recorded incidents of domestic violence, the judgment was made
that the courts would not support revocation of his firearms licence.

I think it is often easier for police officers to grant or re-grant a
firearms or shotgun certificate than risk the possibility of judicial
review. In fact, they should be more robust and say no if they believe
that someone should not be granted a shotgun or firearms certificate
and should, if necessary, defend the case robustly at judicial review.
In my experience that does not always happen and it is when it does not
happen that there are problems such as the Atherton case. There was
clear evidence, which I will come to later, that the police should have
decided to revoke the certificate. In any case, I think the new
guidance that was published at the end of 2012 will help. I have no

officers would not have to rely only on actual convictions of domestic

talked about. We need to have proper arrangements in place so that
doctors are required to pass on any related health developments to the
police. One way of achieving that may be to negotiate such an
obligation into the GP’s contract. That duty must be done on a
continuous basis, and not just at the application or renewal stage of a
firearms licence. That is because a very small number 
<?notus-xml column=44?>of people’s medical circumstances can change dramatically; for
example, if they become a severe depressive, or addicted to alcohol or
drugs. That should be reported to the police by a medical professional
and should lead to serious consideration of a revocation of a licence,
which in normal circumstances, only occurs every five years. There
should also be a robust check when a licence is granted or re-granted
to assess whether any information is being withheld by the applicant
from the doctor or police.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for North Herefordshire (Bill Wiggin) after his

driver’s licence. Although there is no legal obligation on the
medical profession, there is a strong public duty on a doctor to report
a change in a driver’s medical condition. Doctors can report
their concerns to the DVLA. GPs are able to do that at any point and
are not expected to wait until a licence is due to be renewed. I
understand that the DVLA follow up medical investigations that are
reported to it. Indeed, it has its own medical team to carry out
medical investigations and assessments. There should be a similar,
although perhaps stronger, obligation on doctors in relation to
firearms certificates.</hs_Para>

licensing authority—it will be easier for their firearms
licensing officers to interpret exactly who should have a certificate

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T15:14:43"></hs_TimeCode>The actions of
Michael Atherton, in
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T15:14:46"></hs_TimeCode> constituency
of the hon. Member for Easington, were appalling under any
circumstances, and no one wants to see them repeated. He should never
have been given a firearms licence, given his history. Indeed, in
September 2008, following an incident where he threatened to commit
suicide, his guns were taken away from. However, they were returned to
him later. I heard what the hon. Gentleman said about the possibility
of judicial review in the courts, but if the police reckon that they
had the grounds to take them away from him in the first place, surely
they had the grounds to ensure that he did not get them back again,
unless there was compelling evidence that something had changed. As far
as I am aware from the case’s circumstances, nothing had
changed. It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T15:15:30"></hs_TimeCode> was
a catastrophic error on the part of the Durham constabulary, as his
licence should have been permanently revoked, as it almost certainly
would have been in similar circumstances under a different police. Had
the guidelines been followed by the Durham constabulary and
Atherton’s licence revoked, we would not have seen the tragic
events in the hon. Gentleman’s constituency.</hs_Para>

case highlights the importance of police forces using published
guidance, because that clearly was not used in the Atherton case. That
was highlighted during the inquest, which the hon. Gentleman referred
to, following the tragedy, where officers dealing with
Atherton’s licence claimed never to have seen the Home Office or
ACPO guidance. Those guidelines had been published 10 years previously,
so there is little excuse for a firearms licensing officer to be
unaware of them. It is obvious that if a police force does not use the
guidance given to it, these tragedies will
occur.</hs_Para>

only employ one or two firearms licensing officers—so we are

firearms. There are 570,726 shotgun certificates in existence. That is
up 1.4% compared with the year before. This is where the 0.01% of

important point, which we need to reflect on. However, other domestic
violence deaths occur because of the use of the body—the
hands—or of day-to-day items around the house, such as knives.
We cannot control or legislate for such potential activity, but we can
reduce the risk posed by access to shotguns, which are not day-to-day
items readily available around the house, where there is substantiated
evidence that people—this is not about all the hon.
Gentleman’s constituents or all my constituents—are
guilty of violent conduct, domestic violence, or drug or alcohol abuse.

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T15:32:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for The Cotswolds, about improving the licensing procedure, that
sparked some interest in me. It may come as a surprise to hon. Members
that only this year ACPO gave the net cost to police forces of shotgun

three examples. North Wales police spent more than £417,000 on
issuing licences, but recouped only £113,000 in licence fees,
which means that taxpayers in my constituency faced a net cost of
£303,000 for supporting the issuing of police licences. In Devon
and Cornwall, a £1.2 million total cost generated only
£514,000 in revenue. In Thames Valley, £928,000 of cost
generated only £148,000, leaving a net cost to the local

when we are potentially asking more of the police in relation to
shotgun licensing, with legislation at hand, this is an appropriate
moment for the Minister to reflect on the cost of licences, and whether
taxpayers and ratepayers should continue to subsidise people who apply
for them to the tune of £18.6 million this year. The figure is
worthy of examination. ACPO has said it would like the fee for a
shotgun licence to rise to about £94. That would not mean full
recovery of costs, but given that the figure for a licence has not
changed in 10 years, there is scope for the Minister to
reflect on the matter, or to explain why he is happy for £18.6
million of ratepayers’ money to be taken from police budgets to
support the cost of issuing licences to be used for work or
sport.</hs_Para>

discovered, having questioned the two police officers who were the

account for fewer than 0.2% of all recorded offences. Provisional

I, like everyone else, am deeply concerned by the fact that Atherton
had been permitted to continue to possess guns despite a history of

clear that, although each case must be assessed on its merits, evidence
of domestic violence and abuse will generally indicate that a person
should not be licensed to possess a gun. To that end, on 31 July we
published new firearms guidance on domestic violence as a specific
issue. It sets out how the police should handle firearms applications
where it may be a
factor<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T15:44:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000123">It
has been proposed that it should be mandatory that the partners of
firearm applicants are directly involved in the process and that they
should be interviewed to establish whether they support the
application. We sought views on that proposal, including those of
domestic violence organisations, and our collective conclusion is that
we should not adopt that approach. We are concerned that it could put
victims of domestic violence at greater risk, particularly if an
application is subsequently refused; or they may feel unable to speak

that new guidance is not enough and that we must go further and change
the law. The hon. Gentleman co-sponsored the new clause that was
debated during the Committee stage of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime

Firearms Act specifies that, before a licence can be issued, the police
must be satisfied that the applicant can possess a firearm or shotgun
without danger to public safety or the peace. As I said, the revised

that must be considered in more
detail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T15:47:56"></hs_TimeCode>. I
believe that the law is sound in this respect and there is no need to
change it. In fact, inclusion of that level of detail in the firearms

necessary. I invite the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman to

been suggested that the firearms guide should be statutory or an
approved code of practice. I do not think that that would be the right
way forward, either. The law provides the police with discretion in
recognition of their responsibility for issues of public safety in
local areas. That is important because each application is different
and needs to be considered on its merits. I have not seen any evidence

middlemen who supply firearms that are used to harm others,

Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill will increase the maximum sentence
to life imprisonment for illegal importation and exportation. We are
also creating a new offence of illegal possession of a prohibited

that we are in discussion not only with colleagues at the Department of
Health, but with the British Medical Association, the police and, as he
knows, shooting organisations over the role GPs can play in ensuring
that the licensing process is as effective as it can be. The police
generally now contact an individual’s GP when a firearm or
shotgun certificate is granted or renewed. That means the GP has the
opportunity to raise any concerns they may have, and has resulted in a
number of revocations of firearms licences. We now want to explore
whether we can build greater safeguards into that arrangement by making
the consultation with GPs part of the application process. In doing so,
we obviously need to ensure that there is balance around burden and
cost. Those discussions continue.</hs_Para>

McCabe</B> (Birmingham, Selly Oak) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful, Mr
Sheridan, for this opportunity to talk about a dispute that has been
going on for three years, and which highlights serious concerns about
the work and responsibilities of the Legal Services Commission. At its
heart is an issue about the role of the commission in relation to duty
solicitor slots and the application of the 2010 standard crime contract
and section 6 of the contract
specification<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:00:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000150">My
constituent, Mr Majid, suffered when the Legal Services
Commission—the LSC—launched an investigation into
fraudulent activities at Knights Solicitors, which resulted in its
terminating Knights’ unified contract for crime. My constituent
is the son of immigrants and he has represented this country as an
Olympic sportsman, winning world and European championships in
weightlifting. Through his own honest endeavour and hard work, he has
achieved the position of solicitor and advocate of our Supreme
Court—something of which one might think we would be proud.
Instead, today I am telling the story of how the LSC set out to wreck
Mr Majid’s career and
reputation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:01:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000151">I
want to highlight two main points: first, the injustice suffered by my
constituent and the reluctance of the LSC to deal with the matter,
admit its errors and seek to put them right and, secondly, the
appalling performance of the LSC, and of other agencies one might
reasonably expect to call upon in such circumstances, such as the
Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman—the PHSO—the
Law Society and the Solicitors Regulation Authority. The last two
bodies have distinguished themselves by washing their hands of concerns
about the treatment Mr Majid received. The intervention of the PHSO
leaves a great deal to be desired, and the behaviour of the LSC in
dealing with the fraudulent activity of Sajjad Ahmed Khan of Knights
Solicitors needs a great deal of scrutiny. It is not Mr Majid who
should be suffering as a result of this affair. He is an innocent
victim<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:03:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000152">Mr
Majid’s experience involves a catalogue of unsatisfactory
behaviour by the LSC and an insipid response from the PHSO, which calls
into question why we pay public money to support the two agencies. Mr
Kamran Majid has done nothing wrong, but he has been dismissed as a
nuisance and a pest by the agencies, because he is unwilling to accept
their flawed reasoning, inadequate investigations and failure to
address the core of his
complaint<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:03:53"></hs_TimeCode>. The
matter has still not been resolved, despite three years of battling on
Mr Majid’s part. During that time, my constituent has suffered
unemployment, loss of income and damage to his reputation, and has been
forced to accumulate considerable debts—he estimates that he is
approximately £45,000 out of
pocket.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000153">Let
me clarify a point that seems to have escaped the LSC, despite so many
of its communications being mired in legal gobbledegook. Mr Majid was
never an employee of Knights Solicitors. He was a freelance duty
solicitor, an arrangement that the LSC approved and encouraged. The
commission approved Mr Majid’s application to work as a
freelance duty solicitor through 
<?notus-xml column=58?>Knights Solicitors, and on 7 May 2010 it approved his electronic
registration for a CDS12—the duty solicitor application form. At
that time, the LSC knew that Knights Solicitors was under investigation
for legal aid fraud, and had been since 2009. On 27 May 2010, it
terminated Knights Solicitors’ unified legal aid contract,
having previously placed a contract sanction on the firm’s
accounts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000154">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:05:33"></hs_TimeCode>
Mr Majid complained to the LSC about how he had been disadvantaged as a
result, Mr Ross Lane of the commission attempted to muddy the waters by
claiming that Mr Majid knew that Knights Solicitors had been under
investigation since 2009. Mr Majid discovered details of the
investigation only through a subsequent county court order, but the LSC
attempted to use that as a reason for dismissing his claim. Mr Lane, of
course, knew that the LSC was doing everything it could to resist Mr
Majid’s freedom of information requests, which would have shed
light on the fact that it negligently registered him with a firm that
was under investigation for fraud and that it withheld that
information.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000155">Mr<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:06:36"></hs_TimeCode>
Majid has a further complaint about the LSC. When he discovered that
Knights Solicitors had lost its contract, he asked if he might be able
to transfer his slots to another law firm. The LSC was quick to deny
him the opportunity, and drew his attention to section 6 of the
standard crime contract specification. It is unable, however, to offer
any explanation as to why 14 other solicitors, identified by Mr Majid,
have been given that same opportunity. I could name those
people—people to whom the LSC afforded an opportunity it denied
my constituent, people who have suffered no financial loss and no
damage to their reputation or career—but I will not, because Mr
Majid has no desire to cause them distress. I am happy, however, to
share their names with the Minister, because the time for trying to
brush what has happened under the carpet is at an
end.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000156">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:07:57"></hs_TimeCode>
me further point out that some of those people benefited from the
opportunity to transfer their slots before Knights Solicitors lost its
contract, and some afterwards, so the LSC’s attempts to argue
that it was an error that it has now put right do not stand up to
scrutiny. It allowed flexibility in contract arrangements to safeguard
the finances and reputation of 14 other people, but denied the
opportunity to my constituent and attempted to cover that
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000157">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:08:38"></hs_TimeCode>
also need to ask some wider questions about the LSC. For how much
public money is it responsible? I believe it is about £2
billion. To whom is it accountable? Can the Minister say in all candour
that it is an agency in which he has confidence, or that its transition
in April of this year to the Legal Aid Agency will have a significant
impact on its behaviour? Mr Sajjad Ahmed Khan of Knights
Solicitors—the real villain—is involved in a fraud that
might run into millions of pounds, as a result of claiming legal aid
fees for services that were never provided. It would appear that, after
four years, Sajjad Ahmed Khan is finally likely to be brought before
the solicitors disciplinary tribunal, but as yet there has been no
effort to recover the millions he fraudulently obtained, and he still
practises as a
solicitor.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000158">No<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>
wonder that the Government are being forced to make swingeing cuts in
legal aid, which risks bankrupting thousands of small, decent law firms
and calling the whole of our legal system into question. If the Legal
Services Commission and its successor are allowed to 
<?notus-xml column=59?>cover up a multi-million pound fraud and penalise the innocent, because
they dare to bring that fraud to the attention of the authorities and
get too close to the truth, something rotten is going
on.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000159">I
have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:10:37"></hs_TimeCode> attempted
to assist my constituent since the summer of 2011. I have had numerous
exchanges of correspondence with the LSC and the PHSO. Gina Brady of
the LSC’s complaints handling team replied to my inquiries with
a rather curt note confirming that the LSC was of the opinion that Mr
Majid had received a full response to all his complaints and that it
would not respond to any further inquiries. I am here today because the
LSC is judge and jury—not willing to engage with a Member of
Parliament, and not accountable to anyone. When it comes to
malpractice, misuse of public funds, incompetence and cover-up, that
agency might be top of the
list.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000160">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:11:42"></hs_TimeCode>
also find it shocking—I hope the Minister does as
well—that the PHSO comes out of this case as toothless and
hopeless, and all too ready to drop Mr Majid’s case on the say
so of the LSC, whose arguments simply do not stack up. On 5 January
2012, PHSO’s assessor Michelle Yore wrote to me that it had now
concluded its investigation. It used a familiar approach: it asked the
LSC about Mr Majid’s complaint. The LSC denied there was any
substance to it and, relying on that, the PHSO told my constituent that
he had no grounds for his complaint. When he objected, and argued that
it had not looked properly at the substance of his complaint, the PHSO
investigated its own procedures and concluded that it had complied with
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000161">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:12:44"></hs_TimeCode>
hope that the Minister can see how unsatisfactory that is, and what a
waste of public funds. The whole thing is all process and expensive
form-filling. Like too many investigations we have come across
recently, this is yet another example of investigators being more
interested in process than in getting at the truth and delivering
justice—wasting public money in endless hours of process, rather
than finding out who did what wrong and what is required to put it
right. I cannot believe that these people accept their bloated salaries
and can sleep at night. No wonder there is a crisis of confidence in
our public
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000162">Who<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:13:35"></hs_TimeCode>
is the responsible person? Is it the current chief executive or the
former chief executive, Carolyn Regan, who, I understand, departed with
the usual large pay-off after questions were asked about financial
controls at the LSC? I do not know how many people work for the agency
and its successor, but so far I have come across Stephen
O’Connor—he seems to have played a major role in not
enforcing section 6, other than against my constituent—Mr
Rimmer, Mr Williams, Mr Forrester, Ross Lane, Sarah Aylwin, Natasha
Hurley and Gina Brady. With so many fingers in the pie, it might be
better if one person had set out to get to the bottom of the
affair.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000163">The
Legal Services Commission has sought to deny that Mr Majid has a valid
complaint. It must know perfectly well that it should not have accepted
his registration, given that it knew that it was investigating the firm
and that action was imminent. The LSC was wrong to allow 14 other
solicitors to transfer business between law firms before and after the
action against Knights Solicitors, to attempt to disguise what had 
<?notus-xml column=60?>actually happened and to quote a contract specification that it had
failed to follow in other cases, but insisted on using against my
constituent. Mr Majid suffered compared with his contemporaries. The
LSC told the PHSO that Mr Majid knew about the investigation into
Knights, which was not true, and it deliberately sought to avoid
explaining that it was responsible for sitting on FOI requests that
would have confirmed the basis of his complaints. It also behaved
appallingly in the way that it handled the Sajjad Ahmed Khan fraud, and
it gives no confidence that it is fit to discharge its public
duties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000164">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:15:58"></hs_TimeCode>
would appreciate anything that the Minister could do to recognise how
much my constituent has suffered and that he deserves to be
compensated. I would welcome a thorough investigation into the agency.
I believe that there is a precedent for a judicial review in a similar
case, because too many people are gaining from the public purse who are
not doing the job for which we are paying them. Someone is getting away
with a cover-up, and it is plain
wrong.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13090344000276" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000276">4.16

Gentleman’s specific points, but I note at the outset that an
entirely independent body, the PHSO, has rejected Mr Majid’s
case. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says in criticism of that body,

of the Government more
widely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000167">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:17:46"></hs_TimeCode>

hope that he agrees that we should be very proud of our legal system:
it is a valuable contributor to our society, and the Government
recognise that legal aid is a vital component of the system. I am well
aware of the important role that duty solicitors, such as his
constituent, play in the criminal justice
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000168">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:18:06"></hs_TimeCode>
have always made it clear that defence lawyers are central to the
criminal justice system. Throughout this year, I have taken their views
on how to make the system more efficient and on what we can do to help
them work more efficiently. Today, there are about 6,500 duty
solicitors—qualified professionals who can offer advice and
assistance to those who, without their own lawyer, are being questioned
by the police or facing charges before the
courts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:18:34"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:18:37"></hs_TimeCode>.

ensuring that the criminal justice system can operate
efficiently.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000169">Last<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:18:49"></hs_TimeCode>
year alone, there were 734,000 acts of assistance to people being
questioned by the police, at a cost of £160 million to the
taxpayer. A similar scheme for solicitors in the magistrates court
operated at a cost of almost £22 million, providing help to
individuals in courts across England and Wales. The Legal Aid
Agency—as the hon. Gentleman correctly said, that is what the
Legal Services Commission has become—has a statutory
responsibility to run and maintain both the 
<?notus-xml column=61?>police station and the magistrates court duty solicitor schemes in
England and Wales, which it does by entering into contracts with firms

by the hon. Gentleman is that his constituent raised a concern with him
about how the then LSC dealt with his complaint regarding the
allocation of duty solicitor slots in the summer of 2010. From his
contribution, I can appreciate that the period in question and since
has been extremely distressing for his constituent. What I can usefully
do now is explain a little more about how the process works so that we
can understand more about how the issue arose in the first
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:20:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000171">The
first point on which to be clear, and this directly addresses one of
the hon. Gentleman’s points, is that contracts are not awarded
to individual duty solicitors, but to legal aid firms. The proportion
of slots that each organisation receives is determined by the number of
duty solicitors that it has registered with the LAA, formerly the LSC.
The allocation of slots is typically refreshed every six months, and
organisations are required to submit the necessary forms to demonstrate
how many duty solicitors they employ.

have talked about the deadline for slot allocation, and there are two
advantages to that approach. First, it ensures that firms have six
months of stability of duty solicitor slots, enabling them to plan
their workloads. Secondly, it provides administrative benefits to the
LSC as rotas are issued at fixed points without the need for many
amendments. That is essential given the scale of the task in assembling

for all firms to submit their list of duty solicitors by 14 May 2010.
It would not have been possible to accept new submissions in June 2010
without treating firms differently in the tendering process. Owing to
the finite number of slots available, late additions would affect the
allocation set for all firms that work on those schemes. No other firm
was requesting an extension to the May deadline. If a firm wishes to
challenge its duty slot allocation, there are options available to it
to appeal under the terms of its contract. However, the approach to
slot allocation has been the subject of attention during 2013 as part
of the debates that have been taking place following the publication in
April of the Government’s proposals to transform legal
aid.</hs_Para>

proposals have focused on criminal legal aid, which accounts for around
£1 billion of the overall legal aid budget of just under
£2 billion. Obviously, no sensible Government can overlook such
a sizeable portion of Government spending, which is why we have
embarked on the proposals to transform legal aid to deliver a more
credible and efficient
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000177">The
Law Society, as part of its response to the consultation, has
highlighted some inefficiencies within the current system. In
particular, it has focused on the precise issue that the hon. Gentleman
has raised today—that of the duty work allocation methods. The
Law Society has described the current approach to slot allocation as
inefficient. In its response to the consultation, it described the
incentive that firms have to employ more and more duty solicitors to
gain more slots, even though the total size of the market is declining.
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman recognises that that is not a
sustainable approach. The Law Society has also highlighted a practice
that it calls “ghost solicitors”, which refers to
solicitors who have minimal links to a firm receiving a payment that is
neither a salary nor linked to work done for the
firm<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:24:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000178">The
Law Society has called for a new method that no longer allocates work
to firms on the basis of the number of duty solicitors employed. The
Government have been working with the Law Society to explore those
proposals and are considering all the other responses to the
consultation. There is a real general issue here. I appreciate that
most of the hon. Gentleman’s speech was about the specific
things that his constituent suffered, but it is worth putting that in
context. I will deal briefly with some of his individual points now,
but I will also take them away and look at them further.</hs_Para>

approved his electronic registration for a CDS12. Mr Majid did not
personally make an application to the LSC to work as a freelance duty
solicitor for Knights. The LSC accepts only applications from firms,
and those firms are required to declare that the solicitors are
employed by them. Therefore it cannot be said that the LSC approved of
any specific employment arrangement between Mr Majid and Knights in May

hon. Gentleman also said that the LSC negligently registered Mr Majid
with a firm that was under investigation for fraud and withheld that
information. Again, I have to be clear that the firms themselves submit
their own lists of duty solicitors. The LSC simply received the
application in May 2010. On the allegation of withholding information,
I should be clear that this was a police investigation, so the LSC was
not acting inappropriately at the time.</hs_Para>

Gentleman also said that the LSC has behaved appallingly in the way in
which it has handled the fraud and therefore gives no confidence that
it is fit to discharge its public duties. It is fair to say that the
LSC acted promptly on concerns that Knights breached its contractual
duties, and that led to the termination of the contract. The LSC, or
the LAA as it now is, is always there to act to protect
taxpayers’

us that the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman always acts
robustly with organisations such as the LSC and on this occasion, 
<?notus-xml column=63?>it mounted a full investigation. It was completed without any further
action being required. We have all been in this situation, whereby our
constituents have gone to the parliamentary ombudsman and not had the
result that they required. I have heard what the hon. Gentleman has had
to say about the PHSO, but I can only repeat that sometimes it comes up
with a result that we regard as satisfactory and sometimes it does not,
but it is an entirely independent organisation. It is designed to be a
court of appeal outside governmental structures, so that people can
have some confidence that they are getting an independent response, and
that is what it did in this particular

have to say that on this particular topic I come as something of a
novice. I was regrettably unaware of many of the basic facts about
children in Britain who are afflicted by brain tumours until recently,
when I was approached during the summer by a constituent, Anne
Pickering, who is here in Westminster Hall today. On a family holiday
to the Isle of Wight in 2008, Anne’s daughter, Charlotte,
collapsed on a beach as a result of a brain haemorrhage. Charlotte was
rushed to Southampton general hospital. She underwent surgery, she
remained on life support for 10 days and she lay in a coma for five
weeks. Later she spent five months in rehabilitation at the amazing
Children’s Trust in Tadworth and this courageous young woman,
who is now 16, has made a full recovery.</hs_Para>

should say at this point that I have been down to the Children’s
Trust to see for myself the incredible work that it does. Witnessing
the tenacity of children with serious brain injuries from tumours,
haemorrhages and various other illnesses making the long, hard and
often uneven road to recovery is like watching someone crawl a
marathon, inch by inch. It is nothing short of heroic—both
heartrending and uplifting at the same time—and what is achieved
at the Children’s Trust is quite something to
behold<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:31:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000188">However,
the truth, of course, is that not all such stories end as well as
Charlotte’s did. During Charlotte’s treatment, her mum
Anne met Sacha Langton-Gilks, whose son, David, was fighting a brain
tumour that had been diagnosed late. Despite David’s herculean
efforts, he died aged 16. All anyone has to do is to google his name to
read the many accounts of this lad’s epic
bravery<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:32:00"></hs_TimeCode>. David
was diagnosed with a tumour the size of a golf ball on 24 October 2007.
He struggled for nearly five years, through chemotherapy, radiotherapy
and a stem cell transplant, stoically refusing to give up on life,
whether it was reading up on Buddhist philosophy or tobogganing in the
snow with his brother and sister. The term
“inspirational” does not even begin to do this young man
justice. Very sadly, David died on 14 August last year, but not before
he stood up in front of the full glare of the national media, despite
his terminal diagnosis, in a valiant effort to raise awareness of the
prevalence of brain tumours in children, in order to save
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:32:42"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:32:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000189"><Member ContinuationText="Neil Parish" PimsId="4943" UID="13090344000337" xid="1159" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000337"><B>Neil

tumours kill more children in this country than leukaemia does; only

also the issue of the delay between diagnosis and treatment. The thing

campaigns in this country. Think of the drink driving adverts; think of
the campaigns in the 1990s to “Just Say No” to drugs; and
more recently there have been the Vinnie Jones CPR adverts and the
campaign to identify the early signs of a stroke, which is particularly

most importantly, the HeadSmart campaign has made it a priority to get
its credit card-sized awareness cards into every school and nursery in
the country, as my hon. Friend the Member for Romsey and Southampton
North (Caroline Nokes) has mentioned. I have got one here. It can fit
into the smallest wallet or purse; it explains the early symptoms of a
brain tumour; it differentiates between symptoms depending on the age
of the child; it tells you what to do if you are worried; and it gives
contact details and a website to find out more information. If the
cards are handed out to children at school to take home to their
parents, that will go a long way towards heightening awareness and
ensuring that children and parents have an easy reference tool to
hand.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000219">HeadSmart is

carried out in Wiltshire, East Sussex, Sutton and Reading. Those areas

lead soon. I will be visiting Surrey county council with Sacha
tomorrow. To date, the campaign has benefited from local co-ordinators

cards through their internal mail system. Critically, because the Brain

the measure costs the councils
nothing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000220">What

chairmanship, Mr Sheridan. I have been called some bizarre things
today. I was called “very libertarian” in a debate in
this Chamber this morning, and I have been called something else this

as such.</hs_Para>

the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab) on securing this important
debate. As I have said on many occasions, the clock is always against

the Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Mary Macleod). She and I had a
very good meeting with some of her constituents on brain tumours in
adults, and many of the problems of diagnosis are also experienced by
adults who suffer from this unpleasant, horrible and often fatal
disease. I also pay tribute to

the Member for Cannock Chase (Mr Burley) and Trudy’s Trust. Some

We hear today of yet another tragedy that has occurred, but some good
comes out of every evil. One of the good things that comes out,
especially when a child dies from a brain tumour, is the great power of
a family to leave a legacy and make a great tribute to that child.
There is nothing worse than the loss of a child—it is every
parent’s nightmare—but to be able to turn that awful
situation into something good, and to use that power to great effect,
is something that we see in many instances. Today we have heard about
just some of them, and there are
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:51:06"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:51:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000239"><Member ContinuationText="Sir Gerald Howarth" PimsId="1032" UID="13090344000367" xid="291" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000367"><B>Sir

the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab) on securing this debate,
because HeadSmart is based in my constituency. Will
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:51:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend,
the Minister pay tribute to Neil and Angela Dickson? Their daughter
Samantha died of a brain tumour and they have done fantastic work, not
only to produce the kind of initiatives that have been mentioned by
several hon. Members today, but to raise funds that have contributed to
research that has produced results 
<?notus-xml column=71?>that have enabled the causes of brain tumours to be identified in part.
Neil and Angela Dickson deserve many congratulations on what they have

Soubry:</Member></B> I am more than happy to add my grateful thanks for
the work of Neil and Angela Dickson, and the work of all those who
support them. There are many such examples, and funds are often raised
for research and to support families or other bits of
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:52:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000241">As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:52:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) said, money that
goes into research often has the most powerful results. I pay tribute
to Headcase cancer trust in my constituency, as I am very much aware of
the great work that continues to be needed on brain cancer, which is a
pernicious and horrible disease that affects people of all ages, but it
seems somehow to be particularly cruel and wicked when it is inflicted
on
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:52:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000242">There
are a few things that I want to mention before moving on to some of the
substantive points raised by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:52:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Esher and Walton. We recognise that we need to do more
to bring cancer survival rates up to the level of the best in the
world—survival rates have been languishing in the wrong place
for too long—so we have an outcome strategy that sets out our
ambition to halve the gap between England’s survival rates and
those of the best in Europe through saving an additional 5,000 lives
every year by 2014-15. We know that the earlier a cancer is diagnosed,
the greater the scope for curative treatment, and our strategy
therefore prioritises addressing late diagnosis. To support that, we
have £450 million over four years going into early diagnosis,
which is part of the £750 million of additional funding from the
Government for addressing cancer over the spending
period<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:53:35"></hs_TimeCode>. That
funding will do much great work that I am happy to identify in a letter
to my hon.
Friend.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000243">On
direct GP access to diagnostic tests, my hon. Friend the Member for
Hexham (Guy Opperman) made a good point about having someone
within<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:53:46"></hs_TimeCode> each
clinical commissioning group who knows about not only brain cancers and
brain tumours but other similar afflictions. As he rightly identifies,
when a child has a headache, or when an adult has some other complaint
and they are not sure what it is, there could be a more specialist GP
who can say, “Maybe this is the sort of case that we need to
scan swiftly,” or, “Maybe it needs some other
treatment.” That is a very good point, but we need GPs to
recognise symptoms that could be indicative of cancer and, where
appropriate, to refer patients to more specialist
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:54:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000244">The
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has published
referral guidelines for suspected cancers, including a section on
children, to help GPs and primary care professionals identify children
with suspected cancer. The Department of Health published guidance in
April 2012 on the best practice for what we call “referral
pathways” for
GPs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:54:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000245">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:54:56"></hs_TimeCode>
GPs suspect a brain tumour, they are able urgently to refer patients
for special care using the two-week urgent referral pathway, and I have
been helpfully supplied with some figures that I hope will give comfort
and encouragement. Some 95.5% of patients were seen by a specialist
within two weeks of an urgent 
<?notus-xml column=72?>GP referral for suspected cancer—that is for all
cancers—in the first quarter of 2013-14, and 96.4% of patients
urgently referred by their GP for suspected brain or central nervous
system tumours were seen by a specialist within the two-week period. In
the first quarter of 2013-14, 96.4% of patients in England urgently
referred by their GP for a suspected children’s cancer were seen
by a specialist within the two-week period. I think those are good
figures, but of course we can always do
better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-03T16:55:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090344000246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000246"><B><Member ContinuationText="James Duddridge" PimsId="4769" UID="13090344000369" xid="881" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/halltext/130903h0002.htm#13090344000369">James

can best advance HeadSmart cards in schools. As he knows, of course,
public health is now devolved to local authority level. And as he also

Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Danny Alexander):</Member></B> The
Government have published the fifth paper in the Scotland analysis
programme. This series of publications is designed to inform the debate
on Scotland’s future within the United Kingdom ahead of next
year’s
referendum.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090334000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/wmstext/130903m0001.htm#13090334000010">“Scotland
analysis: Macroeconomic and fiscal performance” looks at
Scotland’s economic performance and finds that, as part of the
UK, Scotland is outperforming most other parts of the country and its
performance is comparable to many other independent European countries
as a result of the benefits of deep economic integration with the rest
of the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090334000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/wmstext/130903m0001.htm#13090334000011">These
benefits include free access to the larger UK market, a common
regulatory framework, integrated supply chains and a highly flexible
labour market. As a result, Scottish companies trade more goods and
services with the rest of the UK than with the rest of the world,
exporting £36 billion of goods and services to the rest of the
UK. Flexible labour movement between Scotland and the rest of the UK
allows businesses to recruit the best people from across the whole UK,
and the benefits of being part of the UK have made Scotland an
attractive destination for foreign
investment.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090334000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/wmstext/130903m0001.htm#13090334000012">The
paper finds that the absence of a border is key for economic
integration. Even where free trade agreements exist and physical
borders are weak, neighbouring countries with similar economies are
affected by the presence of a border. The analysis finds, for example,
that that trade between the US and Canada is thought to be 44% lower
than it could be as a result of the border between them. Canadian
provinces trade around 20 times more with one another than with US
states of a similar size and proximity, despite a free trade agreement
between Canada and the US. Labour migration between Scotland and the
rest of the UK is also estimated to be as much as 75% higher within an
integrated UK, allowing the sharing of skills and
knowledge.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090334000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/wmstext/130903m0001.htm#13090334000013">The
UK’s diverse economy protects Scotland from economic shocks and
the volatility of oil prices. An integrated UK and a broader and more
diverse tax base helps to maintain the stability of public spending in
Scotland and smooth the impact of volatile sources of revenue, such as
North Sea oil and
gas.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090334000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/wmstext/130903m0001.htm#13090334000014">The
paper shows that since 1999, Scotland’s onshore economy has
generated 8.3% of the UK’s tax receipts, while at the same time
Scotland has received an average of 9.4% of UK public spending.
Relative to the UK generating and spending £100, this means that
Scotland’s onshore economy has generated £98 for the UK
Exchequer, while receiving £112 of public
spending.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090334000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/wmstext/130903m0001.htm#13090334000015">Integration
is at the heart of the UK’s current economic and fiscal union.
Independence would fundamentally transform and fragment this
relationship, ending the pooling of resources and risk-sharing between
Scotland and the rest of the UK, and erecting a border where one 
<?notus-xml column=18?>does not currently exist. Research in the paper concludes that remaining
part of the borderless United Kingdom could boost real incomes in
Scotland by as much as 4% after 30 years,
equivalent to £5 billion in 2012 prices or £2000 per
household, compared to the outlook if Scotland were to become
independent.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090334000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/wmstext/130903m0001.htm#13090334000016">Future

support housing and commercial development. Our investments to date are
helping to bring forward new homes, boosting the construction industry
and stimulating economic growth. Through the Growth and Infrastructure
Act, we have enabled developers to request reconsideration of the
affordable housing component of any section 106 agreement, to ensure
development is not being made unviable by unrealistic requirements. We
have also taken steps to boost the housing market by improving access
to mortgage finance through initiatives such as the funding for lending

October 2012, a temporary measure introduced by the previous Government
that enables applicants to seek more time to implement a planning
permission was extended by 12 months. To encourage developments to

the £1 billion Government are investing to get stalled sites

generous redundancy scheme for local staff employed in Afghanistan.
Qualification for this scheme is limited to those staff who were in

2012 (when the Prime Minister announced the drawdown of UK forces), and
who have served more than 12 months

allow reliable estimates of the numbers who might be eligible if the
criteria included alternative or additional criteria of a qualifying
period of 30 months service, or service that ended before 19 December
2012: The scheme has been put in place to support these individuals who
lose their employment as a result of UK drawdown in Afghanistan and the

intimidation are investigated by a locally employed staff welfare team

family that can not be resolved through any other means, the welfare
team will relocate the individual and their family within Afghanistan.

under a statutory duty to secure a place for any eligible two-year-old
should their parents wish them, to take up a place. The early years
market is already responding positively to the increase in demand for
early learning for two-year-olds. In April 2013 reports from local
authorities suggested that more than 50,000 two-year-olds were already
accessing a place. The Government will continue to monitor take-up
closely.</hs_Para>

Truss:</Member></B> On 16 July 2013 we launched a public consultation
on the regulation of childcare. This has been placed in the House
Library. We propose to streamline registration processes while
maintaining and strengthening safeguarding and welfare requirements for
registered providers. The types of provision the questions refer to are
not currently required to register with Ofsted. We are not proposing to
change those arrangements which provide essential flexibility for busy,
working parents. The consultation will close on 30

people access good mental health services through the Improving Access
for Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme, which is the
responsibility of NHS England. The Department of Health have funded
Children and Young People's IAPT with £54 million, and
underlined that commitment by emphasising the importance of children
and young people's mental health through the NHS Mandate. This will
encourage local clinical commissioning groups to invest in children and

is best practice for CAMHS to offer a triage service so they can more
quickly identify children and young people who need specialist
provision very quickly, or where needs are less urgent, signpost them
to a more appropriate source of support. Many schools and colleges
offer pastoral support, including access to counselling sessions to
support their students' mental health and
well-being.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090369000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0003.htm#13090369000198">Increased

Truss:</Member></B> The Government believes that schools are best
placed to decide which professional development meets their needs to
support successful implementation of the new national curriculum, and
to secure these accordingly. We therefore expect schools to identify
their own priorities for action, and to identify appropriate sources of
support. We recognise that the high expectations set by the new
national curriculum will present some challenges for schools. To assist
with this, existing opportunities funded by Government in core subjects
are being adapted to reflect the requirements of the new curriculum.
For example, the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of
Mathematics (NCETM) has a range of support for schools on implementing
the new curriculum, and Myscience.co Limited, who run the Science
Learning Centres, are also refocusing their support. The match funding
scheme of £3,000 for phonics materials and training has been
extended until October 2013. We have made £2 million available
to recruit 400 master teachers in computer science over the next two
years. We also announced a further £2 million to support
teaching schools to take forward the delivery of the new curriculum in
their alliances. In March we announced £150 million a year of
ring-fenced funding for primary school
sport.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090369000541" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0003.htm#13090369000541">We
are also working with subject experts, publishers, educational
suppliers and others to identify what support for schools is already in
place, any gaps that need to be filled, and how that might be done.
This will also support providers in adapting their initial teacher
training to take account of the new curriculum from 2013/14 onwards. In
addition, we have given prominence to national curriculum subjects in
our bursaries for teacher training commencing in September
2013.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090369000542" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0003.htm#13090369000542">We
have made considerable efforts to make sure that both teachers and the
general public are aware of the changes we are making to the national
curriculum. Our consultation on the new programmes of study between
February and April this year attracted over 17,000 responses, many of
which were from teachers. When the final version of the curriculum is
available in September, we will use a range of communications channels
to make sure that schools are aware of the changes, and where they can
access quality support to prepare to introduce them.</hs_Para>

remains that when schools are undersubscribed, there is no cap

are oversubscribed, they can offer up to 50% of places on the basis of

academic year 2012/13 we introduced a bursary system which awards
higher bursaries to trainees with good degrees, and this system is
continuing in the academic year 2013/14. For priority subjects,
including maths and physics, we offer a bursary of £20,000 for
trainees with a first class degree, £15,000 for those with upper
second class degrees and £12,000 for those with lower second
class degrees. For other subjects we offer a bursary of £9,000
for trainees with first class degrees and £4,000 for trainees
with upper second class degrees. Under this bursary system, initial
teacher training (ITT) candidates holding third class or ordinary
degrees are no longer eligible for a training bursary. This approach
will help raise the status of teaching as a career choice and
incentivise the best graduates to become teachers.</hs_Para>

Timpson:</Member></B> In 2009/10 and 2010/11, the Government spent
£6 million a year on a behaviour and attendance programme
through the then National Strategies, before the contract ended in
March 2011. Ofsted's review of the National Strategies raised
considerable doubts about the effectiveness of its programmes. Our
assessment was that this programme did not provide good value for
money. Instead the Government has taken what Ministers believe to be
more effective action to reduce truancy: increasing fines for truancy;
reducing the amount of time parents have to pay truancy fines; and
reducing the threshold for persistent absence so that schools tackle
the problem sooner.</hs_Para>

be effectively and consistently applied if those responsible for the
animals concerned are convinced of the efficacy of the

potential nationally for the livestock industry to be more actively
involved in the process of defining appropriate standards and to reduce
the burden of bureaucracy by them entering into voluntary commitments
(underpinned by robust science and veterinary expertise). Our intention
is to encourage a similar approach at global level through .the OIE

Benyon:</Member></B> Part 9 of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009
imposes a coastal access duty on the Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Natural England. This has the
objective to secure a coastal route for open-air recreation around the
English coast along with an associated coastal margin. The Act allows
the Secretary of State and Natural England to fulfil the duty in stages
over a number of years. One stretch of the coast path at Weymouth Bay
was opened last
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309041000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0005.htm#1309041000239">The

network around the English coast. We have recently approved Natural
England's proposals for a further two stretches of the English coast
between North Gare and South Bents in Durham, Hartlepool and Sunderland

establishment works are expected to be completed in time for the two

Due to the length of time it takes to complete a coroner's inquest, it
can take months or even years for a death to be registered. The median
delay for deaths due to accidental drowning in 2011 was 169 days,
therefore figures for 2011 and 2012 may be incomplete due to
registration delays. Further information on registration delays for a

rape are currently very limited. This is due in part to the historical
availability of a range of insecticides, and therefore an
underdeveloped research area in identifying non-chemical methods.
Additionally, for those pests with the greatest potential for causing
significant yield losses, high levels of control are required,
particularly in those seasons favourable to population development. A
range of cultural techniques and the awareness of the value of natural
predators do already form a very important component in the overall
integrated control
programme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309041000364" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0005.htm#1309041000364">DEFRA-funded

cover: examining prospects for natural, semi-chemical-based
alternatives and for biological control of pollen beetles and examining
possibilities for improved habitat management (including conservation

issues in the UK and developing advice on resistance management. It has
a wide-ranging membership across industry and regulators. Guidance is
produced regularly, via the IRAG website, disseminating grower body
outputs. An example is the collaborative approach and joint advice
given in response to the development of pollen beetle resistance to
pyrethroids in oilseed rape. HGCA research refined existing historical
thresholds, and this is included in their information sheet (18) on
monitoring and control of pollen beetle in oilseed rape. This includes
IRAG advice, which is reviewed and updated each year, and also gives a
risk assessment, and advice on the importance of natural predators.
HGCA information sheet 12 mentions opportunities for enhancing natural
control through agronomic practices such as trap cropping. A knowledge
of the insect pest's biology and making use of the optimum sowing rates

on this issue from farming groups and other interested parties. Because
of the concerns that people have about the possible impacts of sky
lanterns, DEFRA and the Welsh Government commissioned an independent

brings together and evaluates the available evidence, including
submissions from the farming sector and the results of a survey of
stakeholders. While farmers have lost livestock due to ingested wire
from sky lanterns, this research suggests that the risk of injury and
death to cattle and impact on the environment is low.</hs_Para>

the impact that cumulative, distorted and unrealistic images can have
on people's self-esteem and wellbeing. Since 2010 we have run a Body
Confidence Campaign, which works with the media, advertising, retail
and fashion industries. The campaign promotes positive and diverse
representations of appearance in the media and other cultural forms,
strengthens individual media literacy and resilience to low body
confidence, and supports young people's aspirations and confidence in
their contribution to society. The programme is evidence-based and

key issue for Government is to ensure that consumers in financial
difficulty know where to go for free and impartial advice on the
various debt remedies available to them, both formal insolvency
procedures and informal debt management plans. Some debtors will prefer
the formality that an individual voluntary arrangement, for example,
will bring; for others, the more informal debt management plan will be
the preferred route. In developing the debt management plan protocol

by using the March retail prices index (RPI) figure, and applying that
rate of interest for 12 months commencing 1 September until 31 August.

locally managed magistrates courts committees were responsible for
managing magistrates courts and were not required by statute to inform
the Department of any magistrates courts closures. We therefore do not
have these figures for revenue savings for this period. Between 2005
and 2010 there were 25 courts closed outside of the Court
Estate Reform Programme. These were delivered as part of new build
schemes or implemented through business as usual and the Department is
unable to obtain revenue savings without incurring disproportionate
costs.</hs_Para>

2013 the net revenue savings under CERP totalled £19.34 million.
As of 6 August 2013 a total of 40 buildings have been sold so far
attracting disposal receipts of £17.16 million. The total
cumulative gross benefits are expected to be £99.2 million over
the SR10 period. This consists of resource savings, including reduced
property costs and pay bill savings resulting from court closures of
£60.6 million, and gross capital proceeds of £38.6
million from the sale of buildings.</hs_Para>

Wright:</Member></B> The Crime and Courts Act 2013 created the offence
of driving with a specified controlled drug in the body above a
specified limit. The existing offence of driving whilst impaired
through drugs (section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 1988) is difficult to
enforce due to the need to show that the driver was impaired and the
impairment was due to a drug. The maximum penalty for the new drug
driving offence is the same as that for the current drug driving
offence (and drink driving): this remains at six months imprisonment, a
fine of £5,000 and disqualification. However this offence is
designed to increase the likelihood of conviction of those who drive
under the influence of drugs, thereby enabling the court to punish
these drivers. Where culpable 
<?notus-xml column=166?>poor driving is involved, and death or injury are caused, a range of
more serious offences may be charged, with long terms of imprisonment
available.</hs_Para>

offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with.
When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is
the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same

the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter>

<I>Official Report,</I> column 110W, the identification of potential
victims of trafficking, including where they have been found, is a role
undertaken by the National Referral Mechanism which is operated by the
UK Human Trafficking Centre. The Salvation Army collects information on
the organisation or agency that discovered the victim and made a
referral to the Salvation Army. Publishing information more detailed
than the region could put both the rescued victim and any other victims
harboured by their trafficker in danger. It would also inform the
traffickers that the authorities are undertaking law enforcement
activity in those areas.</hs_Para>

LAA does not record the number of people who receive legal aid. Instead
it records the number of ‘acts of assistance’. One
individual may receive a number of separate acts of assistance, and one
act of assistance can help more than one person. As the categorisation
of legal aid has changed over the last 20 years, acts of assistance
relating to representation in court cannot be accurately compared over

Wright:</Member></B> The opening and full occupation of HM Prison
Oakwood, which is by far the largest new prison to be built in recent
years, was delivered safely and on schedule. The rate at which
prisoners were received was agreed between the National Offender
Management Service (NOMS) and G4S, the prison's operator. This was to
ensure that the prison opened in a safe a secure way, maintaining good
order and control and recognising that HM Prison Oakwood was a
newly-built prison with newly-recruited and trained staff. As a result,
it was agreed between NOMS and G4S that the increase of capacity and
prisoners would be kept under review and would be slowed or stopped if
there were considerations about safety or security. Full operational
capacity was available from January
2013.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309041002314" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0007.htm#1309041002314">The

The priority is to provide enough prison places for those sent there by
the courts—and to do so in a way that gives taxpayers the best
possible value for money. In the current spending review period
covering the years 2011-12 to 2014-15, a total of approximately
£219 million will be spent on new prison places. This includes
investment to complete a previous prison capacity programme, four new
house blocks and to start the recently announced new prison in North
Wales. Across the country we are reducing the cost of prison by
replacing old, inefficient buildings with newer accommodation that is
cheaper to run. The new prison in Wales allows us to continue this work
while providing a significant and rapid investment in the Welsh
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309041002514" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0007.htm#1309041002514"><I>(b)</I>

period (2011/2012 - 2014/2015), NOMS has taken a wide-ranging strategic
approach to meet the financial challenges set including: a
comprehensive restructuring of Headquarters and the wider
organisational structure; significant frontline efficiencies across
public prisons and probation, whilst maintaining safe, decent and
secure offender services; reconfiguring the prison estate and the
closure of prison establishments; clear, specified front-line services,
with comprehensive costing information to identify efficient cost
models and challenge and eliminate expensive delivery; and reduced

successfully delivered £475 million cashable savings against the

Information relates to Public Sector Prison Service establishments and
regionally organised staff directly providing services to
establishments. NOMS HQ is not included. The definition of NOMS HQ has
recently been altered to exclude more regionally based units. This
means that the totals given in this answer do not necessarily agree
with previous answers which used the more wide-ranging definition of
headquarters.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>2. In April 2012 a new
system of pay-bands was introduced for new recruits. The figures
relating to 2012 and 2013 therefore include some staff working in the
new banding structure. For the purposes of this table those staff are
allocated to the equivalent grade
grouping.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>3. In October 2011 HMP
Birmingham transferred to the private sector causing a reduction of 639
staff.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>4. Over the period being
reported the number of healthcare staff directly employed by NOMS has
fallen as a result of the transfer of staff employment to primary care
trusts.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>5. As with all HR databases,
extracts are taken at a fixed point in time, to ensure consistency of
reporting. However the database itself is dynamic, and where updates to
the database are made late, subsequent to the taking of the extract,
these updates will not be reflected in figures produced by the extract.
For this reason, HR data are unlikely to be precisely accurate, and to
present unrounded figures would be to overstate the accuracy of the
figures. Rounding to 10 accurately depicts the level of certainty that
is held with these figures.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>6. All
figures are rounded to the nearest 10. Totals and changes are formed
from unrounded parts and may therefore not equal either sum of or
difference between the rounded
totals.</hs_TableFooter></entry></row></tfoot></tgroup></table></TableWrapper><hs_Para UID="1309041002689" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0008.htm#1309041002689">Private

risk assessed on an individual basis following conviction and
sentencing. This assessment considers the likelihood of their
attempting to escape or abscond, the risk of harm to the public should
they do so and any other issues that impact on the security and good
order of the prison. The assessment takes account of factors such as
the nature of the offence, sentence length and previous convictions.
Prisoners are then assigned to the lowest security category appropriate
to managing the level of risk presented. The prisoner's security
category is subsequently reviewed at regular intervals or whenever
there is a change in circumstances affecting the prisoner's risk
levels. The aim is to ensure that the prisoner continues to be held in
conditions of the lowest security consistent with managing
risk.</hs_Para>

Wright:</Member></B> On 30 April 2013, we announced significant changes
to the Incentives and Earned Privileges (IEP) scheme. The purpose of
the IEP scheme will change so that not only are adult prisoners (over
18) expected to behave well, but they will also be expected to actively
work towards their own rehabilitation and, to reach the highest level
of the scheme, demonstrate both an active commitment o their own
rehabilitation and provide help or support to other prisoners and/or
prison staff. Gaining additional privileges will require not just the
absence of negative behaviour, but also the demonstration of positive
behaviour targeted at rehabilitation. We have announced a review of
the scheme as it applies to young people. We are currently
exploring how and to what extent the principles of the review of IEP
for adult prisoners can apply to young
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309041004698" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0009.htm#1309041004698">Access
to in-cell televisions is not provided at cost to the taxpayer. The
provision of in-cell television is entirely self-financing from the
rental payments made by prisoners, and all costs related to the
purchase and provision of televisions and the digital switchover
programme are being recovered from this charge. Where prisoners are
permitted to purchase DVD players, under local IEP schemes, this is at
their own expense. Prisoners are no longer allowed 18-rated DVDs since
they were banned by the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for
Justice, my right hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris

to games consoles is limited and only available, in the adult estate
(over 18), to prisoners who are on the highest level of the IEP scheme.
Games consoles are purchased at prisoners' own expense. Individual
access to games consoles in the young people's estate is only available
to those on the enhanced level of the scheme. Young people on enhanced
level are permitted to purchase computer games and a games console for
their own use and from a pre-determined list of approved consoles.

accounting system does not record separately expenditure on wages
relating to providing external auxiliary services at each public sector
and private prison in England and Wales. To establish such costs would
require an individual establishment-wide survey to identify those
staff, prisoners and others employed in the provision of external
auxiliary services. This would be a significant exercise and could be
done only at disproportionate cost.</hs_Para>

Wright:</Member></B> Operation Tornado is the code name used by the
National Offender Management Service to describe mutual aid
arrangements across the prison estate in England and Wales. These
arrangements are in place to assist establishments response to serious
incidents, such as concerted indiscipline, mass evacuation, etc., by
providing specially trained resources above and beyond those already
available at an establishment. The size of a prison determines the
extent to which it is able to 
<?notus-xml column=207?>contribute to Operation Tornado. A full Tornado Unit consists of two
section commanders and 12 staff. Smaller establishments provide what is
called a “half team”, being half this
deployment.</hs_Para>

public sector and private sector estates are not directly comparable,

public sector establishments compared with 14 in the private sector.
All of the High Security prisons, which typically have some of the
highest number of staff are also in the public sector. The figures
provided for the Public Sector Prison Service also include staff in
regional support teams for which there is no equivalent in the private
sector. The number of private sector establishments has increased over
the period from 11 in 2008 to 14 in 2012. Included in the increase in
private sector establishments was the movement of HMP Birmingham from
public to private sector management in October 2011.</hs_Para>

The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons
for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more
offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed.

offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty
is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>2</Sup>
Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate
and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have
been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the

taken into account when those data are

for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more
offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed.

offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty
is the most

March 2013, 155,498 of those released on licence were recalled to
custody for breaching the conditions of their licence, eg failing to
report to their probation officer. Of all those recalled to custody,
less than 1% (998) had not been returned to custody by the end of June

are various reasons why offenders are recalled to custody for breaching
their licence conditions besides committing a further offence. For

Hoban:</Member></B> The Health and Safety Executive (HSE)'s role in
planning is advisory only; it cannot formally object to planning
consents. As a statutory consultee, HSE provides advice to the relevant
local authority on the risks of certain types of development in the
vicinity of major hazard sites and pipelines. The local authority then
weighs these risks against the other relevant planning considerations
to reach a
decision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309041006282" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0010.htm#1309041006282">When
a planning authority in Scotland is minded to grant planning permission
against HSE's advice, the application is automatically referred to
Scottish Ministers for a decision. HSE provides further safety advice
to Scottish Ministers during this process. In England or 
<?notus-xml column=237?>Wales, the planning system allows HSE to request a review by the

assessment makes greater use of appropriate evidence than did the
assessment for disability living allowance, including evidence from
claimants, from supporting professionals and from the face-to-face
consultations that most individuals will attend. The face-to-face
consultation gives the claimant the opportunity to put across; their
own views of the impact of their impairment. Individuals are encouraged
to bring with them a relation, friend or a professional who supports
them. We recognise that information given by their companion can be
useful, particularly in cases where the claimant may lack insight into
their condition, understate the challenges they face or have difficulty
communicating.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="1309041006353" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0010.htm#1309041006353"><B><Member PimsId="2384" UID="1309041007329" xid="84" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0010.htm#1309041007329">Paul

McVey:</Member></B> We had always intended that being unable to walk
more than 50 metres should lead to entitlement to some rate of personal
independence payment's mobility component. However under the second
draft of the assessment criteria being unable to walk 50 metres did not
automatically entitle claimants to the enhanced rate. Within the group
who could walk up to 50 metres we wanted those who face the greatest
barriers to mobility to receive the enhanced rate and the remainder the
standard rate. In the second draft of the assessment criteria we
differentiated by the type of aid and appliance an individual needed.
In the final version of the criteria we differentiate by distance,
which we feel is
clearer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309041006355" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0010.htm#1309041006355">In
the final draft individuals who cannot walk 20 metres can be certain
they will receive the enhanced rate, regardless of whether they need an
aid or appliance. Individuals who can walk distances longer than 20
metres could still receive the enhanced rate, depending on whether they
can do so safely, to an acceptable standard, repeatedly and in a
reasonable time

not define care needs in this way. From April 2015, subject to the
passage of the Care Bill, there will be a single set of criteria to

in England. On 28 June, we published a discussion, document,
‘Draft national minimum eligibility threshold for adult care and

the implications for implementing the new national eligibility
criteria. The £72,000 cap would apply to charges for care and

in significant breach during February 2011 for financial reasons
(FRR2). The trust is required to develop and deliver a recovery plan.
This has been on track in 2011-12 and in 2012-13 but the trust still
has an FRR2. The recovery plan has the trust moving to an FRR3 by Q4
2013-14. Monitor required the trust to commission a review of quality
governance and this was completed in November 2011. A follow up review
in November 2012 found that the trust had generally made good progress.
Regular risk summits that had been held between Monitor, CQC and the
Strategic Health Authority (SHA) ceased in September 2012 when CQC and
SHA agreed the trust was successfully addressing quality issues. The
trust commissioned a peer review of nursing from University Hospitals
South Manchester in February 2012. The review was very critical of
nursing leadership and the nursing director was replaced in June 2012.
Monitor has requested CQC to review aspects of quality of care a number
of times, each time no major issues were identified (most recent May
2013).</hs_Para></entry></row><row><entry colsep="0" rowsep="0"></entry><entry rowsep="0"></entry></row><row><entry colsep="0"><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1309045000214" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0011.htm#1309045000214">North

to the Customer Led Network Revolution (CLNR) programme, of which
British Gas is a partner with Northern Powergrid, Durham University and

Ofgem's Low Carbon Innovation Fund. DECC was approached by Ofgem and
the project consortium to provide support within the CLNR's work
programme on heat pumps (to understand the potential benefits to the
distribution network of integrating heat pumps with thermal storage).
The grant was approved since the objectives of this project aligned
closely with the priorities of DECC's innovation programme and at the

years ahead on its web site since December 2009; no update to the

not intended to predict a particular year's global temperature as

effects of the El Nino Southern Oscillation, which is not predictable
more than a year ahead. Instead, they aim to forecast slow fluctuations

of the pathways, including associated estimates of full energy system

tool which allows users to examine the full range of physically
possible scenarios for meeting the 2050
target:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="1309045000836" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0011.htm#1309045000836">http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk/</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="1309045000530" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0011.htm#1309045000530">The
costs of technologies out to 2050 are uncertain, however the following
table shows our best estimates for the four pathways, which vary
between £4,735 and £5,329 per person per year on average
between 2010 and 2050. These costs include all capital, operating and
fuel costs for the whole energy system including cars, trains, planes,
power stations, boilers and insulation, but exclude the damage costs of
climate change and the costs of changing people's behaviour, such as
encouraging them to turn down their thermostat. The table also shows
that if climate change wasn't tackled, the cost would be £4,690
per person per year on average between 2010 and 2050; however, if
climate change damage costs were also included, the cost-would be even
higher.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309045000531" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0011.htm#1309045000531">These
are just some of the possible scenarios. It might be cheaper to meet
the carbon target than not, even if the costs of climate change damage
are excluded. This depends on the future cost of fossil fuels, the
extent to which technologies such as electric vehicles fall in cost and
the extent to which people are willing to change behaviour. Using the
tool, members of the public can explore these uncertainties.</hs_Para>

properties' energy performance certificate (EPC) ratings and the price
at which they are sold in the market. This is based on analysing data
from the Land Registry and Landmark available for properties sold. In
addition to its EPC rating, information is available on: a property's
actual sale price; its size; its characteristics (e.g. detached,
terraced etc.); its age; and its
location.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309045000567" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0011.htm#1309045000567">The
study covered property transactions for 325,950 dwellings between 1995
and 2011. It found that, in addition to other factors, EPC ratings were
significant in explaining price differentials in most regions and for
most property types. It also found that revealing EPC ratings had a
positive impact on energy efficient properties. It did this by tracking
the same properties that were sold before and after 2007 (when EPCs
were mandatory), and compared their price premiums them to those that
were less energy efficient, according to their
EPC.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309045000568" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0011.htm#1309045000568">DECC

defence exhibition like the Defence and Security International
Exhibition in London (DSEI). Respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms are mandatory considerations undertaken in the process, and we
also consider how invitations will impact on bilateral engagement
including on issues like human rights. In addition, we review
invitations in cases where the situation in any one country changes
significantly prior to an exhibition. Invitations do not imply that Her

equipment that may be displayed, and any subsequent sales are assessed
