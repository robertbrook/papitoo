Bill is brief and to the point—it has just two clauses. It seeks
to amend the British Nationality Act 1981 to ensure that foreign and
Commonwealth citizens in the forces who wish to apply for
naturalisation as a British citizen under section 6(1) are not
disadvantaged because of time served overseas. In order to apply for
naturalisation as a British citizen under section 6(1), a person must
have been resident in the United Kingdom for the previous five years.
The Secretary of State has the discretion to disregard time spent
outside the United Kingdom during that period, but an applicant must,
in all cases, have been in the United Kingdom at the beginning of the
period. That means that foreign and Commonwealth citizens in the armed

enshrinement of the armed forces covenant into UK law in 2011 was a
good moment in the three years that I have served as Member of
Parliament for Woking, and I am sure that many Members across the House
feel the same. The Government and Parliament have a moral obligation to
their servicemen and women, who are asked to risk their lives for our
country. That obligation extends well beyond the time when each of them
leaves the Army, the Royal Navy or the Royal Air Force. Parliament
chose to enshrine two key principles into law: first, that it is
desirable that members or former members of the armed forces suffer no
disadvantages arising from their time served in the military; and
secondly, that special provision for them may be justified in certain
circumstances. These are fundamental principles that reflect our
country’s high esteem and value for the military and its
personnel, and the important and sometimes difficult and dangerous work
they do.</hs_Para>

Lord:</Member></B> I hesitate to use up all our available time
discussing the regulations. As I have said, I have notes on the
naturalisation routes to citizenship for ordinary civilians and for
armed services personnel. The clear intention of the Home Office and
our immigration services is to ensure that there is a level playing
field, and that the armed services are not disadvantaged in relation to
civilians. I believe that that is what the House would like to see. Of
course, cases of dishonourable discharge or criminality would count
against a member of the armed forces, just as breaking the law would
disadvantage a civilian seeking to become a citizen of this country.
The same rules will apply regarding the amount of money a person will
need to earn in order to support himself, and his wife and his family
if he has one. Those rules will be the same for armed services
personnel as for civilians from a foreign or Commonwealth background. I
hope that that reassures my hon. Friend. The Home Office and our
immigration services take a fair-handed view in this regard, but
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T10:28:36"></hs_TimeCode> major

way in which our armed forces tend to be arranged into smaller units,
many of which have a distinguished history behind them and a wonderful
record of service ahead of them, are all very important. That should
make us reflect on how the relevant armed service personnel must think
when they fill out a form and find out that they are disadvantaged
because they were posted abroad five years ago in the service of their
regiment or battalion. The whole ethos of this country, the battalion,
the regiment and unit goes out of the window the moment these people
put pen to paper on that form and realise that, by a quirk of
bureaucracy and a small defect in the British Nationality Act 1981,
they are at a disadvantage in comparison with other service personnel
who served here or, indeed, any other ordinary citizens with a foreign

Lord:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. There are
more than 9,000 foreign and Commonwealth personnel in our armed forces.
A little later in my speech, I shall go into more detail about some of
the nationalities that the Bill is most likely to affect. I think it
important for young British men and women to see the merits of serving
their country, and I would certainly encourage them to sign up, but I
would also say that some of our bravest and best soldiers in the past
have been from the Commonwealth or even occasionally from
non-Commonwealth foreign countries.</hs_Para>

attended a morning of prayer at the Muslim burial grounds in my
constituency. This event was for soldiers from India who had served in
the first world war, when the Germans had put around the rumour that if
those people were killed in battle, they would not receive a proper
burial. In my constituency it was clear even that long ago that there
were brave men and women of what later came to be called Commonwealth
origin fighting just as hard on European battlefields for Queen and
country, democracy and the rule of law and against aggression as we
have seen in more recent years. Clearly, this history and tradition of
service in our armed forces of foreign and Commonwealth personnel goes
back a long way, and I do not think that our Army should discriminate
unduly against these incredible young men and women from overseas who
want to carry on that tradition. As I shall explain later, it is mainly
just a

risked their lives serving in the British armed forces abroad, no
member of the armed forces family should be at any disadvantage in the

Second Reading debate offers us an opportunity to try to tease out more
information from the Minister about exactly how many people will be
affected, how much further we can go in terms of the military covenant,
and how we can improve morale and recruitment. A considerable number of
people will potentially be involved. As of 1 April last year, 8,510 of
the 166,110 members of the trained UK regular forces were non-British,
constituting 
<?notus-xml column=1296?>approximately 5.1% of our nation’s armed forces. That is quite a
lot. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister whether he
thinks that it is the right number, and what is the Government’s

perhaps there were too many foreign nationals serving in our forces.
The Minister, who is far more knowledgeable than me, will be able to
confirm or correct that, but I suspect that the 5.1% figure is fairly
constant. It seems a reasonably healthy percentage, but one would not
want it to rise too far. It is important, particularly in times of
economic difficulty and high unemployment, for our armed forces to
consist overwhelmingly of British
citizens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T10:56:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0001.htm#13091338000188">Of
those 8,510 forces, about 520 were Nepalese, and nearly 8,000 were
citizens of the Republic of Ireland or Commonwealth countries. About
4.5% of the armed forces intake at the end of 2011 consisted of black
and ethnic-minority personnel. I may be wrong about this, but according
to my research, there are currently no statistics stating how many
non-British members of the UK regular forces currently desire to gain
British citizenship. I suspect that the number is relatively low.

the Member for Woking mentioned a figure, but I do not know where he

should like to hear a bit more from the Minister about the armed forces
covenant. The covenant states that the Government’s aspiration
is that no armed forces personnel be disadvantaged in “dealings
with wider society”. Those are the Government’s words,
and I think that they are rather vague, but they could extend to
applications for British citizenship. Clearly, what we are doing today
is entirely in accord with the covenant.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T10:58:21"></hs_TimeCode>Although the

suspect that what we are doing today will not be enough for the

Edward Leigh:</Member></B> The Bill’s promoter is unavoidably
absent from the Chamber for a few moments, but he will have to answer
that question. My understanding, however, is that the answer is yes. We
are creating a special dispensation today because we say,
“Surely if someone has served their country for five years, they
should not be disadvantaged in getting British citizenship just because
they have been serving in Afghanistan or elsewhere.” That may be
a controversial statement but what greater qualification is there to
become a citizen of a country than to have served that

armies in history have done that. The quickest and best way to become a
citizen of the Roman empire was to join a Roman legion, and there was
very good thinking behind that. I do not think we should be in a
different position, but, again, this is for the Minister to answer. I
am still not clear, however, not only about exactly how many people
will be involved, but whether, if this Bill becomes law and the 1981
Act is still in place, someone who has joined the armed forces, behaved
well and served for five years but has never set foot in this country
will pretty well have an automatic right to become a British citizen.
They will have to go through the normal processes, of course, but is
that the thinking? I am not sure whether I have had an answer to that
yet. I know some people watching this debate may not agree with that,
but I just ask the question—I am not sure I have an answer
myself. Are we now moving to a situation where someone who joins the
British forces, serves overseas all that time and never sets foot in
this country can become British citizen? Will the Minister please make

our armed forces and what is happening to our armed forces. I am now
ranging a bit wide of the narrow point we are discussing. It has been a
turbulent time in the Ministry of Defence, with a report due on the
Defence Reform Bill at the end of October. A budget cut of 1.9% for
2015 will add to the large-scale cuts that have already been taking
place, including recent reductions in the number of senior military

Speaker, but I could not resist the opportunity to try to expound on
what is happening to our armed forces. I will not say any more about
total defence spending, but, on personnel, I will make the following
point. As of 2012, there were 750 non-UK citizens serving in the Royal
Navy, which is relatively few of the 33,190 trained personnel; 7,640
non-UK citizens were serving in the Army, out of a total of 94,000
trained personnel; and only 120 non-UK citizens were serving in the
Royal Air Force, which is a very small proportion of the 38,000. Intake
of black and minority ethnic personnel at the higher levels of the UK
regular forces is incredibly low, with only 20 officers joining in 2011
out of a total of 1,070. In the context of the wider armed forces
debate, this is an opportunity for the Minister to talk about
recruitment and his policy on attracting—or not
attracting—people from Commonwealth countries to join the armed
forces<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T11:13:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0001.htm#13091338000222">I
also hope that the Minister will say a bit about that context and how

ending June 2013 was at a five-year high, with 204,541 applications
having been accepted, with the figure having risen steadily to an
average of an extra 7,000 successful applications a year. I know that
the Minister cannot give too wide a discourse on the whole immigration
debate, but it is important that we reassure people 
<?notus-xml column=1301?>watching this debate that we are very conscious of not only the need to
remove discrimination against the armed forces, but the wider

certainly have, that one of the perverse consequence of this
legislation might be to encourage the armed forces to do more overseas
and foreign recruiting, rather than concentrating on trying to recruit
at home? We know that it is difficult to recruit reservists at the
moment—the Government are hard up against the issue of how they
will meet the target on reservists—but it seems that this could
be an agenda whereby we will fill our armed forces with people from
overseas instead of from our own

an intervention that just needs to be answered; we do need to reassure

but who serve in our armed forces, with the Gurkhas being the most
famous case, but he is making a fair point. I hope that the Minister
will reassure my hon. Friend, me and those watching this debate that
nothing in the Bill encompasses an attitude of, “It is difficult
to recruit here in the UK and therefore the proportion of non-UK
citizens serving in our armed forces is going to have to rise.”
I suspect that my constituents would not necessarily welcome such a
position. That is not to make any criticism of those serving or to
disagree in any way, shape or form about the huge sacrifices made in
the past century—mention has been made of the first world

relation to the questions asked by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T11:25:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Gainsborough, a situation might arise in which, as we
heard, a Jamaican citizen who joined our armed forces abroad and served
with great courage with them in other parts of the world decides to
settle in Gibraltar, or perhaps closer to Jamaica, in the Cayman
Islands. From there, could that person apply for naturalisation as a
British citizen, without ever having resided in what we might more
naturally think of as the United Kingdom? I particularly want
clarification on that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T11:26:41"></hs_TimeCode>. I
understand that the 1981 Act requires people to spend five years
resident in the UK, but does the territorial extent in the Bill define
the UK more widely? I look forward to hearing from the Minister about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T11:26:58"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T11:26:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000237" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0001.htm#13091338000237">The
first residence requirement in the 1981 Act is that applicants must
have been resident in the UK for at least five years, and I am again
interested in the Minister clarifying the territorial extent of the
United Kingdom in that regard. The second requirement is that they must
have been present in the United Kingdom five years before the date of
application, which is the provision that we are tackling; the third is
that they are free of immigration time restrictions on the date of
application; and the fourth is that they are free of immigration
restrictions for a period of 12 months before making the application.
Will that remain in force when the Bill is passed?</hs_Para>

fifth requirement is that the applicants have not spent more than 450
days outside the United Kingdom during the five-year period. I
understand that that is covered by the Secretary of State’s
discretion with regards to serving members of the armed forces. The
sixth is that they have not spent more than 90 days outside the United
Kingdom in the last 12 months of the five-year period. The final
requirement is that they have not been in breach of the immigration
rules at any stage during the five-year
period<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T11:28:20"></hs_TimeCode>. Can the

refer, of course, to the UK citizenship test. I do not know whether you
have ever had the chance to see whether you can pass it, Mr Speaker,
but in preparation for this debate, I thought that I would see whether
I could do so. I looked at some 
<?notus-xml column=1304?>sample tests, and I regret to inform the House that in the first sample

me give some examples of questions that I did not answer successfully.
I will not put you on the spot, Mr Speaker, although I know you are an
encyclopaedically knowledgeable man. The following question stumped me:
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T11:34:20"></hs_TimeCode> which year
did married women get the right to divorce their husband? To help the
applicant there are four possible answers, and I am happy to take an
intervention from anyone who can answer the question correctly. The
options are 1837, 1857, 1875 or 1882. I do not know the correct answer,
but I know I got it wrong. I am glad to say that I did know that it is
not the Prime Minister who calls a by-election and that we have two
Chambers in our national Parliament, so I sailed through some of the
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T11:31:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0001.htm#13091338000241">Here
is another question that I failed miserably to pass: what is the number
of children and young people up to the age of 19 in the UK? Again, Mr
Speaker, I will help you out, but I will not put you on the spot. I
will take interventions from colleagues who know the answer. The four
possible answers are 13 million, 14 million, 15 million and 16
million. I failed on that one and I can see that the House has also
failed on that measure of citizenship. I was getting rather depressed
with my results from the test until I discovered a crucial fact. I
compliment my hon. Friend the Minister on any involvement that he may
have had in this crucial fact, which is that this Government have now
introduced a much more sensible citizenship test. Those examples were

the people who go through the process will, as a result of these

that we define on a page in legislation, such as the number of days,

next line of questions for the Minister relates to the Secretary of
State’s discretion, which I understand is a crucial part of the
legislation. That discretion is vital because someone serving in our
armed forces might get into trouble with the law, either civilian or
military, and might—I am sure that the numbers are very
low—have to go through the ignominy of a dishonourable
discharge. If a member of the armed forces has been dishonourably
discharged, would that almost invariably mean that they would not meet
the new criteria for applying for naturalisation? Perhaps the Minister
will confirm that from the Dispatch

former member of the armed forces might have lived a blameless life for
many years since, their dishonourable discharge having been some time
in the past, so to what extent will the Secretary of State’s
discretion be used in that example? Would it be the case that, however
much time had elapsed and however honourable the person’s life
had been since, the fact that they had been dishonourably discharged
would be sufficient to count against their application for
naturalisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T11:43:30"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000262" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0001.htm#13091338000262">Will
the Minister, when he responds, clarify exactly how the Secretary of
State’s discretion might be used in other situations? What other
aspects of that discretion might be required? For example, if the
person had had a magnificent period of service, left the armed forces,
lived in one of the overseas dependencies I listed earlier and was then
perhaps convicted of rape or murder, would that be something the
Secretary of State would 
<?notus-xml column=1307?>see automatically as a red line? My understanding is that it would,
because being of good character is a
requirement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000263" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0001.htm#13091338000263"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T11:44:34"></hs_TimeCode>The
other area of discretion I would like clarified relates to the
requirement to be able to communicate to an acceptable degree in
English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic. Someone might have exemplary
military service and fulfil all the conditions, and they might be one
of the people who will be helped by the Bill, because at the beginning

the Secretary of State’s discretion be needed—perhaps the
Minister will clarify this—in relation to the characteristics of
being of sound mind? That is an extremely important point, because
sadly people who have served in our armed forces can suffer from
post-traumatic stress disorder. The Secretary of State might feel that
it was appropriate to use discretion in relation to soundness of mind
on compassionate grounds, perhaps for someone who has given great
service to our armed forces and been helped by the Bill because they
were not in the United Kingdom at the beginning of the five-year period
because they were serving Her Majesty in our armed forces and might be
suffering as a direct result of that active service. To what extent
could the discretion be used in schedule 1 to the 1981 Act in relation
to the applicant’s soundness of mind? We as a society are making
enormous progress on tackling the stigma associated with mental
illness. Indeed, the stigma that attaches to a Member of Parliament in
relation to their mental capacity is something that this House has
discussed at length during this Parliament. I want to see a great deal
of progress on this in our society so that we accept that one of the
consequences of time served in our armed forces may be post-traumatic
stress that requires the Secretary of State to be more understanding in
his or her use of discretion as regards this aspect of

fighting for us on the front line, often in direct defence of our

am sure that in its support the AFF and other charities are mindful of
the fact that the people who join the armed forces are subject to
service law. That distinguishes them from people in other occupations,
in that once they are committed to a career in the armed forces, they
have no choice about being deployed overseas, often at short notice. It
therefore comes as no surprise that there have always been, and, unless
the Bill is passed there will always be, individuals who are in the
wrong place at the wrong time in the service of our country while
putting their lives on the line.</hs_Para>

would like to talk a little more about the military covenant, as it is
the basis for the legitimacy of the Bill. I was interested to read the
armed forces covenant annual report published last year. There was a
lot in the report—if Members are interested, it is
available in the Library—about the challenges facing people from
the Commonwealth serving in our armed forces when they come to apply
for citizenship or exercise their rights. The report received many
contributions from charities such as the Naval Families Federation, the
Army Families Federation and the RAF Families Federation.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T12:08:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Woking cited in support of his Bill many of the
charities that have contributed to the report and to the ongoing
monitoring of the military covenant in practice. He mentioned, of
course, the Royal British Legion, with which all Members work in their
constituencies, particularly on key dates of the year, such as national
Armed Forces day and, most importantly, Remembrance day. These groups
have given their time to monitor the progress of the military covenant.
When my hon. Friend takes the Bill through Committee, as we all hope he
will, he might consider some related issues on nationality.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T12:09:15"></hs_TimeCode>The charities
that contributed to the report, particularly the Army Families
Federation, receive regular, continued complaints about families
receiving inconsistent advice from the  
<?notus-xml column=1312?>UK Border Agency. I am pleased that the Government are listening to
those complaints and that changes are in train that should allow those
families to be treated like any other family applying for visas. That
is
crucial.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000293" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0001.htm#13091338000293"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T12:10:09"></hs_TimeCode>The
other matter that I want to raise concerns an issue that I mentioned in
brief earlier. In order to ensure greater consistency, there is a need
for guidance from the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence to
clarify, both for case officers considering applications for settlement
and naturalisation and for applicants, how people’s military
service will affect an application. As I mentioned earlier, at the
moment, applications for settlement and naturalisation can be rejected
on the basis of military offences, which I understand can be quite
minor in nature and which, importantly, would not incur a conviction in
civilian life. That is surely an example of a disadvantage of being a
member of the armed forces, which the military covenant is designed to
remove.</hs_Para>

military covenant has been successful at removing discrimination in
other areas and making special allowances for the fact that those
leaving the armed forces will be at a disadvantage for having served. I
am thinking, for example, of parents with primary school-age children
who move to an area where there is huge pressure on primary schools.
Such parents are being helped by the special measures that are now
being put in place. I cite that as an example of the
Government’s acknowledging that members of the armed forces are
at an inherent disadvantage by virtue of their former profession. The
Government are correcting that disadvantage. Indeed,
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T12:12:48"></hs_TimeCode> are many
other examples, which Members will know from their
constituencies—citing them would perhaps force me to stray too
far from the Bill—of where the Government have righted previous
wrongs. This is an important area that

Opperman</B> (Hexham) (Con):</Member> The Bill is about two of the most
important issues that we in the House of Commons debate—namely,
the armed forces and immigration. Most of all, however, it is about
justice and fairness, and that is surely what the armed forces covenant
is all about. The covenant is not just a piece of paper; it is a
priority for the Government. It is about fair treatment for our forces
and about having an impact on the lives of the military personnel who
serve in our communities. Its remit goes wider than that, however; it
is about justice.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T12:16:18"></hs_TimeCode>The armed forces
covenant is about an obligation on the whole of society. It involves
voluntary, charitable and other bodies, as well as private
organisations and it is about how all of us as individuals treat those
who put their lives on the line for us. We all need to recognise that
fact and to engage with it, so that we can implement the crucial
elements of the covenant.</hs_Para>

urge those who are in any doubt about the process that the Government
have entered into to study the covenant itself and to work their way
through its history. The covenant was established in May 2011, and it
was based on the principles of removing disadvantage from serving
personnel in relation to access to public and commercial services, and
of allowing special provision in some circumstances for the injured and
the bereaved. The Government committed to rebuilding the covenant and
established an armed forces covenant taskforce in July 2010. The
taskforce reported to the Government, and many of its recommendations
have subsequently been implemented. It produced two reports. The size
of the second report—the “Armed forces covenant annual
report 2012”, which runs to almost 100 pages—is testimony
to the seriousness with which the Government are addressing these
issues. It contains details of the specific measures that we are
taking.</hs_Para>

achievements are to be found in many discrete areas of the covenant.
Health care, for example, is a matter of prime importance for service
personnel. Investment has been made in areas such as medical equipment
in theatre and mental health care provision. Many of us have spoken in
the House about the importance of providing support for our servicemen
and women after they have been discharged from the Army, or when they
are merely returning home on leave.

to visit Headley Court, the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre,

Opperman:</Member></B> That is the case. We need to recognise that
there is a rich tradition of this country working with overseas
soldiers in pursuit of the aims and objectives of the Queen and this
country. One needs to think only of the battle of Britain. The Spitfire
was not manned to the greatest degree by Anglo-Saxon men and women, as
there were 145 pilots from Poland, 135 from New Zealand, 112 from
Canada and 88 from Czechoslovakia; 41 were Irish and there were 32
Australians, 28 Belgians, 25 South Africans, 13 French, 11 Americans

that dovetails into our consideration of this Bill is that Jamaica will
be particularly affected because its citizens continue to support and

face disadvantage for their decision to serve in the forces. The

happen if a person is injured in service? How will that affect their
ability to take advantage of the new provision if, for instance, they
could not complete a tour of service and left the armed forces early. I
have an example of a soldier from Ghana who arrived in June 2009 on a
visitor visa. He joined the armed forces in September 2010. At that
point he became exempt from the timings of the visitor visa, but
unfortunately he was medically discharged in August 2012 owing to
injuries contracted as a result of a military exercise. After leaving
the forces, he was unable to work or to claim benefits because he had
not completed his infantry training, which was a stipulation of his
visa. He was then detained, and removal directions were set in June
2013<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T12:30:25"></hs_TimeCode>. I

injury<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T12:31:09"></hs_TimeCode>? I should
also like to know whether there will be an appeal process. Again, I

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T12:32:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Woking (Jonathan Lord), because he quoted my remarks
earlier. I am grateful to him for presenting it. I had forgotten, until
I was prompted by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T12:33:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Central Devon (Mel Stride), that this was his second
private Member’s Bill in what has so far been a short, but I
know will be a very long, parliamentary career. He has been rather more
successful in the ballot than I have been during my time in the House,
and he has used his opportunities well. I know that his first Bill was
very good, and I hope that this one reaches the statute book as well. I
am also grateful to those who have supported the

hon. Friend said that part of his reason for presenting the Bill was
the fact that the Pirbright establishment was in his constituency and
was important to a number of his constituents. The 1st Battalion the
Rifles is based at Beachley barracks, on the southern tip of my
constituency, and I have spent a great deal of time supporting it. I
was privileged to be invited to join members of the battalion for their
pre-deployment, before they embarked on their first tour of duty in
Afghanistan in 2009. I was fortunate enough also to join
them—all too briefly—in theatre to observe their
operations. The battalion contains a number of foreign and Commonwealth
members, and I have provided many of them with advice on immigration
matters in my capacity as their constituency Member of Parliament. I
know this measure will be welcome, and I hope it will benefit one or
two of them as well.</hs_Para>

shadow Defence Minister and I had the opportunity to visit a number of
armed forces establishments and meet many people who serve in our armed
forces. From that, I know what a great contribution they make to our
country both here and overseas. It is right to acknowledge that some
Members of this House have served in our armed forces, including the
Whip who is present,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T12:35:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Milton Keynes North (Mark Lancaster). This matter is

it briefly. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T12:35:38"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge (Margot James) drew
attention to the fact—indeed, it was a public service
announcement—that each year we publish a thorough report that is
available in the Library. That report sets out very comprehensively the
purpose of the covenant with a foreword by the Secretary of State, and
it also sets out a range of measures we have taken across Government
policy to deliver benefits and to remove discrimination in respect of
serving
personnel<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T12:36:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000329" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0001.htm#13091338000329">I
also want to refer to the embedding of the work we do with external
groups as part of that process. There is a covenant reference group,
the successor to the original external reference group. It includes
service charities and those very knowledgeable about these areas. I
recently had the opportunity to attend a meeting of the ministerial 
<?notus-xml column=1318?>committee looking at these matters and the covenant reference group. It
was held at No. 10 Downing street and the Prime Minister attended for a
period. That close working between Government and the service charities
means we have been able to deliver on these achievements, and it is one
reason why this measure is supported by a number of organisations and
not, as far as we know, opposed by any.</hs_Para>

her party’s support for the work our armed forces do. That is a
good cross-party acknowledgment which we can never hear too often.
Secondly, she formally put on record the official Opposition’s
support for this private Member’s Bill, which I hope means it
has a relatively smooth passage through this House and the other place.

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T12:38:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin) referred to the
citizenship test and I am very pleased to say that she passed one bit

left it in my office so I will not be tempted to draw on it at length
or, indeed, at all. My hon. Friend brought her copy with her, however,
so she was not as disadvantaged as I am. I know that she did slightly
test the patience of Mr Speaker, but he clearly was not
upset with her, as he then referred to her “racy and
intoxicating” speech. I have never made one of those in this

The notes deal with that, but I will take the opportunity to discuss
it, although not at enormous length, because I know that that would

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T12:41:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for West Worcestershire referred. My understanding is that
the reference to “sound mind” in this context simply
means that the person has the mental capacity to complete the
application for naturalisation. I can reassure her that where a former
member of the armed forces has a mental health problem, such as
post-traumatic stress disorder, whether as a result of their service or
otherwise, that would not prevent them from successfully applying for
and securing naturalisation if they met the other rules. She rightly
says that both in the armed forces and outside we have moved on in our
understanding of such mental health conditions, and I am pleased to say
that we do not, in any way, discriminate against people, be it
deliberately or inadvertently, in this matter.</hs_Para>

Obviously, I would not go into a specific case in the House, and I do
not have all the details to hand either. As a general rule, there is
provision in the immigration system, outside the immigration rules, for
people to make an application for leave to remain on compassionate
grounds. The Secretary of State and I have the ability to allow that.

reason we were not able to make the provision is that there was a

up with the earned citizenship measures that the previous Government
wanted to introduce, and it is not possible, I am advised by lawyers,
to implement the armed forces provisions independently of the earned
citizenship measures because they contain references to the provisions
that are not being implemented. That is why it was necessary to
implement the provisions

announced in July 2010 that we would not be proceeding with the earned
citizenship provisions in the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act

under those regimes were considerably more complicated and bureaucratic
than the current arrangements and would have imposed unwelcome
administrative and bureaucratic costs on both central and local
government and voluntary sector partners. Both parties represented in

although there are measures on the statute book, they are bound up with

the Member for Christchurch the reassurance that he seeks, which is
that this provision is necessary. There is not a current provision on

us to achieve the aim. Although I know that he is normally and rightly
sceptical of legislating, I can assure him, given that he and others

asked whether that requirement can be waived. The Secretary of State
can waive the knowledge-of-life and language requirements for
citizenship only in very limited circumstances, which are set out. That
means someone who is under 18 or over 65 or someone with a specific
physical or mental condition that prevents them from being able to
fulfil the requirement. My view is that someone who has served for five
years in our armed forces will have no problem with being able to speak

suffered an injury in service that had damaged their ability to

became older and the question bank became out of date and the number of
questions reduced. Now that we have introduced the new test, the pass
rate has fallen a little, down to about 60%, so it is still quite a
challenge. But citizenship is something that people should have to work
for. She brandished a book earlier, and all the information required

extent of the 1981 Act. However, it remains for me to ask the Minister
whether, because this is a separate piece of legislation, it could have
a narrower territorial extent in order to address some of the points I
raised about the possibility that someone could not even live in the UK

<?notus-xml column=1325?>clock was ticking. Family members of armed forces personnel are not
exempt from immigration control, but, provided they have appropriate
leave under the immigration rules, the time they spend with their armed
forces sponsor, either in the UK or when they are on accompanied
service, is time they can count towards naturalisation. They need to
meet the residency requirements, but, as for service personnel, the
Secretary of State has the discretion to waive and overlook those
requirements if the absence from the UK was as a result of accompanying
a person on service overseas. I hope that that is helpful and answers
my hon. Friend. He is nodding, which suggests that that is the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T13:03:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000375" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000375">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T13:03:35"></hs_TimeCode>

For settlement applications, the requirement for four years’
service can be waived if an illness or injury is attributable to
service and is sustained in an operational theatre. If not, a number of
factors will be considered, including the severity of the injury,
length of service, the prognosis for recovery, and the
applicant’s ability to support himself or herself. We may give
limited leave where the applicant does not qualify for settlement but
needs a period of recovery before they leave the United Kingdom. A
member of the armed forces who is granted settlement following medical
discharge will be able to apply for citizenship after 12 months. I do
not know whether the specific case that the hon. Lady mentioned relates

the Member for Woking said in introducing the Bill. The Government
agree that it is wrong that a member of our armed forces should have to
wait longer to gain citizenship just because they happened to be posted
overseas at the relevant time. The service charities have told us that,
and it was recognised as a priority commitment under the armed forces
covenant. Once implemented, the Bill will enable us to overlook the

naturalisation in the same way that we overlook the requirement to have
resided in the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000377" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000377">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T13:05:27"></hs_TimeCode>

will not be retrospective in the sense that it will go back and alter
anyone’s existing naturalisation status. However, there is a
retrospective element in the sense that the Bill will look back at what
happened to applications five years ago and where people were. When the
Bill is enacted, not being in the UK at the beginning of the five-year
period will cease to be a disadvantage. To that extent, the Bill will
not be retrospective, but it will not alter the position of someone who

who will come. How many will be eligible as a result of the
retrospection?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000388" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000388"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Harper" PimsId="4788" UID="13091338000812" xid="841" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000812">Mr
Harper:</Member></B> The difficulty with answering that question is
that, technically, everyone who is a foreign or Commonwealth member of
the armed forces could potentially, depending on their circumstances,
be eligible. The problem is that the provision will make a difference
only if five years before the point at which someone makes an
application for naturalisation they were not in the UK because of their
service. It would be impossible to go through everyone’s record
of service and do that calculation, because we do not know how many
will apply for naturalisation or how many would have been delayed in
seeking naturalisation because of where they were five years before
making the application.</hs_Para>

the number who will not have to suffer a delay is in the order of 100
to 200, and that is based on the fact that most foreign and
Commonwealth personnel do not have this problem. Veterans Aid talked of
“many cases”, but that is more tens and hundreds, rather
than thousands. It also said that the Bill would help “quite a
few” of their clients, and our estimate of 100 to 200 is based
on our knowledge of the process and on talking to those service
charities that talk to people who have fallen foul of the existing
provision. It is our combined intelligence that enables us to say that
it is around 100 or 200. That is the kind of number that we are
thinking about. Those who are concerned about the numbers need not
worry that the Bill will extend to thousands of people. A relatively
small number of people will be affected, but it is important to make
the change for the benefit of those people who have served their
country. In the last decade, many of those people have served not only
in the armed forces generally, but in an active operational theatre, so
it is important that the House makes sure that they are not
disadvantaged.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000390" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000390">My
hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch also wanted some clarification
of the MOD’s general position on the number of foreign and
Commonwealth service personnel. This is largely an issue for the Army,
rather than the other two branches. The hon. Member for Kingston upon
Hull North also referred to the numbers. In a written statement on 11
July—relatively recently—made by the Minister of State,
Ministry of Defence, my right hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh and
Wickford (Mr Francois), the MOD said that it would now be enforcing the
five-year UK residence requirement when recruiting Commonwealth
personnel. The residency rules already exist for Commonwealth recruits
to the regular armed forces, but since 1998 they have been waived. My
right hon. Friend informed the House that from 11 July those residency
rules will be more strictly enforced, which means that applicants to
the armed forces will have to demonstrate that they have lived in the
UK for five years lawfully—with leave to remain. That
requirement will not affect Gurkhas, because they are recruited only in
Nepal under separate arrangements agreed with their Government. If my

criminality or good character provisions seriously, but we have made a
change, which was referred to by at least one Member. Any offences that
are offences in service law but not in normal criminal law will no
longer be treated in a way that is not subject to judgment. There were
a number of cases where it was felt that service personnel who had had
a conviction under military law that would not have had the same level
of seriousness in civilian criminal law had suffered, and that we had
had no ability to judge their case in the round, based on their
service. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T13:19:06"></hs_TimeCode>We do,

hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge gave a wide-ranging speech, in
which she referred to some of the service charities and the points they
have made about the service they received from what was the UK Border
Agency. It is worth putting it on the record that the splitting of the
UK Border Agency and the creation of UK Visas and Immigration, which is
the relevant part of the Home Office that deals with naturalisation
applications, means that we are focused on delivering better customer
service. Some of the changes we announced in the written statement mean
that we will be better able to look at applications from the armed
forces, which will be made on a special, separate application form, to
ensure that we can deliver a settlement on the day of
discharge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T13:21:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

issue cannot be dealt with in the forthcoming immigration Bill? Doing
so would enable us to consider, for example, the case that I raised of
a constituent who has been out in Russia for a long time, because she
has been married to a British citizen living out there, looking after

the Member for Christchurch raised earlier—to be fair, I said
that I would do so. His question was: why would it not have been
appropriate to deal with this issue in the immigration Bill? The short
answer is that that Bill addresses three topics: first, access to
public services; secondly, putting into primary legislation the rules
on article 8 that the House put in the immigration rules last year; and
thirdly, dealing with appeals and removals. That Bill does not make
changes to the nationality provisions of our
legislation,  
<?notus-xml column=1330?>because I did not want its scope to be that wide. I wanted to
focus on the Government’s priorities for reforming the
immigration system; I did not want us to get bogged down in the many
nationality questions that I know we might otherwise have
considered.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Woking has introduced a focused Bill,
dealing with a genuine problem. It is not a problem that affects
thousands of people; rather, it affects potentially hundreds of people,
but they are people who have done great service to our country. The
approach he has adopted, in introducing a very focused Bill that has
support from both sides of the House—the official Opposition and
the Government—is the right way to proceed. I very much hope
that the Bill will receive a Second Reading and a fair wind in reaching

have expressed concern on a number of occasions about the integrity and
comprehensibility of our statute book. The Minister said earlier that
the reason that we could not use the existing wording in section 39 of
the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 was that it was
“all bound up with the earned citizenship measures”. The
Government have said that they will not proceed with the implementation
of the earned citizenship provisions, so they will have to legislate
separately. If the Government do not wish to proceed with the earned
citizenship provisions in the 2009 Act, surely those provisions should
be repealed, rather than being left in limbo. If they are left in
limbo, it will be open to a subsequent Government to commence
them.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T13:28:25"></hs_TimeCode>The Bill seems
to be amending section 39 of the 2009 Act, rather than repealing it,
thereby compounding the felony of making the statute book even more
difficult to comprehend. I do not expect my hon. Friend the Minister to
respond to this point now, but at some stage during the Bill’s
progress, we need to work out why we are keeping on the statute book
provisions that the Government say they oppose. Why will the Government
not repeal them? Why are they seeking to amend a section of the 2009

respect of this frustration in many parts of the UK, there are three
concerns: the excessive charges for delivery to certain parts of the
UK; the lack of transparency about those charges; and the often
arbitrary nature of how those charges are calculated. There is a
long-standing campaign by many in Scotland to try and tackle the issue.
I am following in the footsteps of many others who have highlighted it,
especially my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and
Easter Ross (John Thurso) who has a classic example of the arbitrary
nature of this problem. Although his constituency is in mainland
Scotland, it has the KW postcode—Kirkwall, in Orkney—so
most websites classify him as coming from an island, and treat him as
such for delivery purposes. Retailers need to look more carefully at
how their systems allocate charges and identify areas that will be more
expensive to deliver to.</hs_Para>

is the excessiveness and lack of transparency of the charges. Citizens
Advice Scotland, in an excellent research paper entitled, “The
Postcode Penalty”, published in December 2012, made it quite
clear that 1 million Scots face surcharges, late delivery or are
refused delivery shopping online. The Bill would tackle the issue in
relation to online shopping by ensuring that people have a clear and
concise idea of what they face before starting the shopping

Scotland noted that it was possible for a delivery van to travel from a
retailer in England to Edinburgh via the borders, passing houses whose
occupants would end up paying excessive charges because they were
further away from Edinburgh, although the van was passing their front
doors and could have dropped the stuff off without having to go to
Edinburgh. A resident of Inverness had to pay a £25 delivery
charge despite living just two miles from the Inverness postal
depot<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T13:41:16"></hs_TimeCode>. Another
highlands resident was shocked to discover when ordering a gift
certificate from an electronics and camera retailer that there was a
£15 charge for delivery, although the certificate was simply a
postal card for which the normal rate could have been charged. That is
another classic example of the failure of retailers to think when
shopping around for delivery purposes.</hs_Para>

delivery in the shop. The nature of the exchange is more fluid. The
customer can set the agenda and get the information they want before
purchasing, whereas online, the information is not available until the

effort to get to that point of the maze and, having been led all that
way, will feel immense frustration and anger at being clobbered at the

is a major industry for the UK’s economy. It is not only the
economy as a whole that benefits; there are significant savings for
consumers in online shopping, and that should be spread around the
entire economy regardless of whereabouts in the UK people live. We know
confident consumers are key drivers of the economy, creating the demand
for goods and services that provides jobs, stimulates innovation,
creates wealth and contributes to the Exchequer. In a well-functioning
economy, knowledgeable, informed and empowered consumers can drive up

despite the economic benefits of access to the internet and the

online shopping. We discussed some of those issues just last week in

postcodes that allow people just outside Aberdeen to be charged as if
they lived on the islands of Scotland. It is reasonable, therefore,
that parcel delivery operators should do their utmost to provide a
clearer rationale for their pricing structure at the outset. Retailers
and parcel delivery operators should ensure that pricing mechanisms do
not arbitrarily give customers surcharges because

some cases, consumers find out that an item will not be delivered to

sometimes after that. Again, that goes against some customer
regulations already in place. We should be clearer about all the

key contradictions is that there are concerns about the universal
service obligation being difficult to deliver and maintain in a
privatised Royal Mail. If his intention is to offer the Royal Mail as
an alternative, that demonstrates the power of the universal service
obligation in rural areas. It is important that we highlight those
concerns when the flotation of the Royal Mail is undergoing its passage

us consider what the law already does in this area. It is clear in
requiring traders to provide all consumers, wherever they live, with
information on freight, delivery or postal charges when inviting
consumers to purchase 
<?notus-xml column=1340?>products. That wording is particularly relevant. The invitation to
purchase is the key point. There may be a difference in how some people
define that point in the process, or some retailers may just be
thoughtless, as my hon. Friend outlined. But if some retailers think
that invitation to purchase occurs only at the very end of the process
when the consumer clicks “Pay”, they might think that
that is an acceptable time to give the information about the delivery
charges. Clearly, others might interpret invitation to purchase as
occurring at a much earlier point, when the consumer is browsing the
website or the shopping app and is implicitly invited to
purchase<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T14:00:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000469" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000469">Specific

He reported the frustration of some of his constituents in Dunoon when
they telephone to ask why something could not be delivered or why it
was so expensive. Dunoon, of course, is most often reached by ferry,
and that information is clearly in a system somewhere, so the customer
service assistant would explain to the customers that it was because
they live on an island, which of course they do not, even if a ferry is
often the most efficient way to reach it. That could create quite a lot
of customer dissatisfaction. The important point for businesses to
remember is that an unhappy customer is far more likely to tell other
people that they are unhappy 
<?notus-xml column=1342?>than a happy customer is likely to tell them that they are happy, so it

for<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T14:08:31"></hs_TimeCode> the
legislation protecting consumers to be clear, simple and transparent.
Those are absolutely the qualities that underpin the consumer law
reforms that we have set out and that the House is considering in
draft. The draft Consumer Rights Bill is a fundamental reform of
consumer legislation that will ensure that consumers’ and
businesses’ key rights and responsibilities are clear, easily
understood and updated to take account of purchases involving digital
content. They are modern rights for a digital age. The Bill that we
will introduce, once it has been scrutinised, will contain new
protections for consumers, alongside measures to lower regulatory
burdens for business. The aim is to make markets work better, which is
good for consumers, good for business and good for growth.</hs_Para>

will just outline some of the core rights that our reforms will give
consumers. I think that it is important that they are straightforward
and in plain English. They are the right to clear and honest
information before you buy; the right to get what you pay for; the
right that goods and digital content are fit for purpose and that
services are provided with reasonable care and skill; and the right
that any faults in what you buy will be put right free of charge or
that a refund or replacement will be provided. The first of those is
central to our reforms, as well as to my hon. Friend’s Bill. I
absolutely support the aim of transparency of information for
consumers. The existing law and the reforms we are taking forward
through the consumer bill of rights will continue to make sure that
businesses cannot hide the charges they are levying on delivery costs
and that they are made clear when the trader invites the consumer to
buy. There is already a lot of good work on supporting compliance with
existing law. That is positive, but more can be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T14:10:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000485" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000485">Under
our reform of the consumer landscape, more enforcement work is being
done by local authority trading standards services, with a great deal
being done in the highlands. In Scotland, the Convention of Scottish
Local Authorities is responsible for co-ordinating the delivery of
significant national and regional cases that cut across local authority
boundaries. Of course, this issue does cut across local authority
boundaries, and across the entire United Kingdom, as hon. Members have
said. It might be worth involving the National Trading Standards Board
and the Consumer Protection Partnership, which aims to get together all
the enforcement agencies from different parts of the country, to see
whether these problems can also be addressed at that
level.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000486" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000486">The
Government significantly fund much of the work on this issue and have
allocated more than £1 million to enforcement in Scotland in
2013-14. As I said, trading standards services in the highlands have
done significant work, with some success, because some businesses have 
<?notus-xml column=1343?>eliminated or reduced surcharges for the highlands as a result. Others
have made changes to their websites to ensure that any surcharges that
they may have concluded were unavoidable are at least indicated early
in the buying process, so that no false claims are made. That was all
achieved under the existing legislative framework.</hs_Para>

to name but a few. All those factors, or in some cases only some, might

support my hon. Friend’s work on promoting clarity and fairness
for consumers, but I am not convinced that extra legislation is
necessary or the best option for us to pursue. What should we do if
this Bill is not the answer? I have been considering what more we can
do to help enhance transparency as much as possible, because he has
raised genuine concerns highlighting a specific problem that his
constituents and others are experiencing. There are limitations on what
can be specified in regulations about the timing of information
provided to consumers, because some of the legislation derives from EU
law and needs to be the same across Europe. However, we can play a part
in highlighting good practice and drawing it to the attention of
businesses. The work done by Citizens Advice and trading standards
services has shown that this can have some success.</hs_Para>

am glad that my hon. Friend suggested publishing guidance alongside the
new regulations that will implement the consumer rights directive in
the UK towards the end of the year, because that will draw
businesses’ attention to how important it is to alert consumers
to extra supplementary charges early in the purchasing process. Some
are already effective in this regard. In 2012, a study by Citizens
Advice found that two thirds of retailers made delivery information
very easy to find on their website. We need to use the opportunity
provided by the consumer rights directive not only to draw attention to
the good practice of those businesses but to draw attention to those
that do less well. Two thirds is good, but it also means that a third
of businesses are not making the information easy to find.</hs_Para>

would like to give my hon. Friend a couple of examples of where we
could take action to help improve the situation for consumers. First, I
would like to draw the issue to the attention of the British Retail
Consortium, which, as a trade body, has members that include, I am
sure, many of the companies that are causing some consternation to my
hon. Friend’s constituents. It would be helpful if the BRC
considered whether it can encourage its members to consider what hon.
Members have said and what it could do to address the problems. I would
be happy to bring retailers to a summit to discuss the problem with my
hon. Friend. It would be good to have a mix of attendees, including
exemplars—businesses that provide information at an early point
and that give alternative delivery options to customers. Perhaps we
could also invite businesses that were not doing well but that have
improved their game and made the situation better for consumers as a
result of the work of Citizens Advice and trading standards. We also
need to include offenders—those that do not give consumers the
right 
<?notus-xml column=1344?>information and for which the detriment exists. We could then have a
discussion on how businesses can solve the problem and recognise their
responsibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T14:16:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000491" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000491"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sir Robert Smith" PimsId="746" UID="13091338000850" xid="550" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000850">Sir

my parliamentary neighbour. The problem hits rural areas all over the

according to Citizens Advice research, more than 1 million Scots face
surcharges, late delivery or refusals to deliver when they try to buy
goods online. Consumers in Scotland’s island communities face a
postcode penalty of nearly £19 on deliveries, which is a
500% mark-up on the standard delivery price. Of the 534
retailers whose policies were investigated, 63% charged extra
for delivery to certain parts of the UK, and 72% of the
surcharges apply to consumers in Scotland, which indicates
that Scottish consumers are disproportionately affected by the
surcharges.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000498" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000498">Over
the years, there have been attempts to do something about the problem.
The Scottish Government held a summit—of the type that has been
discussed—with 
<?notus-xml column=1345?>retailers, trading standards and council officials to put pressure on
retailers. It would be good if that pressure continued, because of the
extent of the problem. However, one problem is that there is no
consistency in how retailers deal with it—they have different
delivery policies. For example, some charge extra for deliveries north
of the line that runs approximately from Aberdeen to Fort William.
Others do it by postcode, but that has ridiculous consequences. For
example, many will not deliver to postcodes DD8 to DD11, which covers
my constituency. I live in DD9 in Brechin, which is five minutes off
the main A90 dual carriageway from Dundee to Aberdeen. They will not

consumers, but it cuts both ways; businesses in rural areas are also
affected. Whether they are trying to get goods in or out, they cannot
get couriers to deliver or pick up, so they are thrown back on the very
good service that is currently provided by Royal Mail. It is, to put it
mildly, ironic that this debate is taking place the day after it was
announced that the Royal Mail is to be privatised, given the serious
fears about the continuation of many services in rural areas.
Notwithstanding what the hon. Gentleman said about this issue, those

example of the difficulties is given in the Citizens Advice report. One
business faced carriage charges of £15 for a £8 plastic
valve. That is uneconomic and mad. The company tried to get the
supplier to send by Royal Mail, but the staff said that they did not
have time to go to the post office, which seems a bit bizarre to me.
The company got quotes from carriers ranging from £9.60 to
£34. Part of the problem is the lack of
clarity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000503" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000503">The
report also looked at the main retailers and the views of their
customers. The retailer trusted most by consumers was Amazon, because
by and large it uses Royal Mail for its deliveries. The hon. Member for
Christchurch (Mr Chope) mentioned John Lewis, which came in second, but
way behind Amazon. If people order in store in John Lewis, it has
displays giving the delivery areas. John Lewis will also deliver in my

ridiculous sum that I am not prepared to pay. I hope that the Minister
will allow the Bill to make 
<?notus-xml column=1346?>progress. It is not perfect, and it would not reduce the charges, but it
would at least let people know what they face in charges. It would be a
small step in tackling a difficult problem for many areas in the UK. My

Of course, by shopping online one probably undermines the viability of
many of one’s own local retailers, and if we want to campaign
for small shops in rural areas we do not necessarily want to encourage
people to engage in online retail. However, I do not think that there
is anywhere in the retail world that is more competitive than online. I
recently visited a shop in Christchurch that supplements direct retail
with online retail. The proprietor told me about a product called
“Bananarama”. Unless the shop is the cheapest online
retailer of that product, they will not make any sales. The proprietor
showed me at least 20 or 30 examples of where the product was available
for sale, and the cut-throat way in which it was being sold. That shows
the benefits of healthy competition. If an online retailer is
alienating his customers by not providing clear information about
delivery charges, then he is unlikely to stay in business for very

we really going to start penalising online retailers by saying that if
they do not provide all the information upfront as soon as the customer
clicks on to their website then they will be subject to a criminal
assessment? Apart from anything else, common sense dictates that it is
only at the end of a transaction that one knows the bulk and scale of
the products ordered. The retailer may offer a range of different
products, some of which can be delivered by Royal Mail and some 
<?notus-xml column=1347?>that might need to be transported by an elephant. It is only at the end

believer in putting bad legislation out of its misery at the earliest
possible stage, so I have no compunction in saying that I will be doing
the House a great service if I ensure that the Bill does not have its
Second Reading. It is ill-conceived and the wrong way to address the
problem. I do not represent a rural constituency, but there are a lot
of online retailers and they do not want to be burdened with the
excessive regulations proposed in the Bill. Apart from anything else,
and as so often happens with such proposed legislation, it would be
counter-productive. Clause 1 requires that the online retailer sets out
what the charges will be.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T14:34:17"></hs_TimeCode>An outline
retailer would be able to avoid all the burden of this Bill by saying
at the beginning that it did not sell goods to islands in Scotland or
England, such as the Isles of Scilly or the highlands and islands, or
the Isle of Man. That could be counter-productive, because people who
live in those more remote areas want to have access to goods, but they
recognise that the other side of the coin of living in a remote rural
area is that delivery charges are higher. I do not think that anyone
has suggested yet in this debate, and perhaps in due course they will,
that there should be cross-subsidy of
those—</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13091338000599" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000599">2.30

I have to say to her that it is not a point of order for the Chair.

the debate this afternoon I want to focus on questioning
Argentina’s status as a G20 member, on the basis that it has
failed on all three of the organisation’s primary
objectives—namely, restoring global financial growth,
strengthening the international financial system, and reforming
international financial institutions. With non-members, including
countries such as Malaysia, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland,

Argentina appears in British public discourse, it is normally in
relation to one of the two Fs—football or the Falklands. The
behaviour of President Cristina Kirchner’s regime towards the
islanders is nothing short of disgraceful, and it is extremely
encouraging to see the British Government supporting the islanders in
the strongest possible terms. The Falklands, for obvious reasons, are
top of our agenda when it comes to discussion of Argentina, but that
issue should not blind us from other major problems affecting this
country as a result of Kirchner’s
belligerence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T14:36:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000540" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000540">Kirchner
makes no secret of her refusal to play by the same rules as everyone
else. Let me start with a few examples. Argentina has expropriated the
property of European companies. It provides a safe haven for drug
dealers bringing methamphetamine to Europe. It is developing a
strategic relationship with Iran. It deliberately falsifies its
economic statistics. It refuses to abide by international court
judgments. It refuses to pay its debt to other nations and
institutions, and even refuses to honour the most basic laws of
contracts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T14:37:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000541" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000541">A
major increasing concern is that of drug trafficking. A recent research
paper from the International Assessment and Strategy Centre found that
Argentina currently imports 30 times more ephedrine than is needed for
its legitimate pharmaceutical industry. Ephedrine is a key ingredient
in the production of methamphetamine, commonly known as crystal meth,
which is a brutal and destructively addictive drug that ruins many
lives on the streets of Europe and north America. That is not all.
Argentina is now estimated to supply 70 tonnes of cocaine to Europe,
which represents a third of the entire usage by
volume<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T14:37:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

worrying is Argentina’s growing friendship with Iran, a country
that is a major strategic threat to the interests of the UK and of the
west more widely. The Argentine Government’s blossoming
relationship with Iran has been highlighted in the US Congress, and was
evidenced recently when President Kirchner refused to allow a senior
Argentine investigator to travel to Washington to testify before
Congress on Iran’s role in the 1994 Buenos Aires bombing of the
Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, presumably for fear of what the
expert might

refusal to repay its debt obligations, even though it has billions of
dollars in reserves, sets a terrible precedent for other nations, such
as Greece, which might be tempted to follow that path of
irresponsibility. Courts have previously ruled that the Argentine
Government needed to pay all its creditors, which is exactly the kind
of sound legal principle that we in the developed world should uphold
and support, even if the Kirchner Administration have chosen not to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T14:38:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000544" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000544">On

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T14:39:13"></hs_TimeCode>the Secretary of
State for International Development took the important step earlier
this year of stating that the UK would vote against future loans to
Argentina from international institutions such as the World Bank and
the Inter-American Development Bank. US President Obama’s

is more we need to do: other European nations must be encouraged to
join the UK and the US. It is simply unacceptable for a country that is
a member of the G20—one of the most important and prestigious
international bodies—to behave in this manner. I believe that
Argentina’s membership of the G20 should be revoked. The country
has been named and shamed by Transparency International as one of the
worst in Latin America—even outstripping Venezuela—for
corruption, while the International Monetary Fund has starkly stated
that Argentina’s Government are lying about their economy and

country is in receipt of an IMF censure for falsifying inflation

is an important debate on an important international grouping. The G20
is the United Kingdom’s premier forum for international economic
co-operation. It represents over 85% of global GDP and economies from
all regions of the world, and it balances the interests of the advanced
with the emerging economies. The G20 also ensures that the views of
non-members are represented: the leaders of Spain, Singapore, Brunei,
Ethiopia, Senegal and Kazakhstan attended as guests at the most recent
summit in St Petersburg, as did leading representatives of the United
Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the OECD, the
Financial Stability Board and the International Labour
Organisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T14:42:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000550" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000550">Since
its creation at Finance Minister level in 1999 and at leader level
since 2008, the G20 has provided the space for key global economies to
come together on an equal basis to discuss and resolve economic issues
openly and by consensus. I believe that it can point to an impressive
range of achievements, agreed by all G20 members, including Argentina.
For example, in the midst of the financial crisis in 2009, the G20
trebled resources to the IMF to $750 billion, supported $100
billion of additional lending by MDBs—multilateral development
banks—and took action to avoid a slide into protectionism. As
the immediate crisis passed in 2010, the G20 put in place credible
plans for fiscal sustainability, agreed to a moratorium on new
protectionist measures and agreed reforms to safeguard the
international financial system. Progress has continued in the last two
years, too. In 2011-12, we provided much-needed impetus to policy
makers solving the eurozone crisis, and boosted the IMF’s
emergency funding by $456 billion. Thus the reasons for setting up the
G20 include the coming together of nations to combat problems
collectively, and its achievements are by no means small.</hs_Para>

recently, in St Petersburg, where the Prime Minister led the UK
delegation, all G20 countries signed up to the St Petersburg action
plan for strengthening growth and creating jobs, which contains all the
features of the economic plan that we have been following in Britain
since the coalition Government came into office. It also took forward
the agenda that we and the Prime Minister set at the G8 in Lough
Erne—the agenda that we call the three Ts.</hs_Para>

tax, the whole G20, including Argentina, adopted the Lough Erne vision
of automatic sharing of tax information, with a single global standard
to be finalised by February next year, and with a clear commitment to
show how developing countries can participate in sharing tax
information and build their capacity to collect taxes in the
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-13T14:43:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091338000553" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000553">On
transparency—the second T—the whole G20 is now taking
forward international standards on company ownership to help to ensure
that people cannot avoid taxes by using complicated and fake
structures. On trade—  
<?notus-xml column=1352?>the third of the three Ts—the G20 extended its commitment to
resist protectionist measures until the end of 2016: a hard-fought
commitment that will open the way to more British exports and safeguard
British jobs. G20 leaders also committed to show the necessary
flexibility to secure a deal at the World Trade Organisation
ministerial in Bali in December which will reduce red tape at borders,
worth £70 billion to the global economy. As the WTO ministerial
approaches, the Government will do all that we can to ensure that it is
a success.</hs_Para>

all that has been achieved without a formal legal basis setting out the
rights and obligations of member countries, and that is for good
reason. As the Prime Minister noted in his report “Governance
for growth”, the G20’s informal quality, combined with
its flexibility, has been its comparative advantage and its greatest
strength. It allows leaders to explore the scope for political
agreement outside the constraints of more formal, binding institutions.
It allows the G20 to work within the existing international governance
system rather than having to rebuild it. Importantly, it provides the
space for key global economies—advanced and emerging
alike—to come together on an equal basis to discuss and resolve
economic issues openly in the spirit of enlightened self-interest,
without the historical legacy of north-south divisions. Those features
have been the G20’s greatest assets, and accordingly we believe
that it should maintain its informal, consensus and leader-driven
character for the foreseeable future. That has a bearing on G20
membership.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13091338000555" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/debtext/130913-0002.htm#13091338000555">The
G20’s place as a consensus-driven forum where major and diverse
economies come together on an equal footing means that there are no
formal criteria for membership, nor any means of ejecting a member.
Indeed, the membership of the G20 has remained unchanged since its
beginnings in 1999, and there are no plans to change it. My hon. Friend
makes valuable points, and he is right that we should strive for all
G20 members, including Argentina, to be responsible players and to
uphold their commitments. We advocate a strengthened accountability
process for the G20, which will ensure that G20 members have stronger
incentives to live up to their commitments and play by the rules. We
also welcome the continued effective participation of non-members,
international institutions and others in the G20’s work, while
maintaining its efficiency. International organisations make a valuable
contribution to the G20, and we believe that the G20 should continue to
work with them in a transparent manner, respecting both those
international organisations’ own governance structures, as well
as their processes for dealing with members who do not fulfil their
commitments.</hs_Para>

judge that maintaining the space for leaders from key global economies
to come together on an equal and flexible basis is central to the
G20’s success. We therefore would not support more formal
structures for the G20, or propose a mechanism by which we would eject,
or seek to eject, one of its members. We would not of course rule out
changing the membership of the G20 in the future, but any proposed
change would need to have consensus agreement by all members of the
G20, balance the need for representation with the need for effective
decision making by leaders and Ministers, and retain the power of
informality and political consensus that has been the G20’s
greatest strength.</hs_Para>

its informality and the lack of formal procedures, let me turn to the

Government have always been clear that it would like a full bilateral
relationship with Argentina. As a country rich in natural resources,
Argentina has the potential to be a key trading partner for the UK in
the future. The people of the Falklands are British and wish to remain
British as clearly demonstrated by the referendum held in March. We
remain disappointed that, more than 30 years after their unjustified
and illegal act of aggression against the Falklands, the Government of
Argentina continue their policy of hostility towards the Falklands
people with attempts to strangle the economic livelihood of the
islands, and in their refusal to co-operate with the Falklands on a
range of issues that are for the common good of the region. None the
less, the United Kingdom continues to enjoy a healthy trade with
Argentina, amounting to £1.3 billion according to the last

deficiencies to which he drew attention. Argentina has taken a number
of trade and investment actions which are damaging to business
interests and which, in our view, undermine its economy by reducing its
attractiveness to international investors. We are taking action with
other partners to encourage it to adopt a different approach. The key
point that I should make to my hon. Friend is that, notwithstanding the
difficulties that he has raised in relation to Argentina, there are
forums other than the G20 in which it would be more suitable to take
appropriate action. However, none of the points that he has made are

articles of agreement is taken proportionately and appropriately. The

improving the process for charities and payroll giving agencies, making
it easier for employers and employees to use payroll giving, raising
awareness of payroll giving among employers and incentivising employers

support by sending unsolicited goodwill parcels. This has resulted in
huge volumes of mail, which have overwhelmed the system and have
prevented mail from families from getting through. British Forces Post
Office (BFPO) estimates that, in the eight-week period between

lethal weapons are those whose design and intention is to control and
then neutralise a threat without substantial risk of serious or
permanent injury or death. Such devices include baton rounds and the
laser. The review will examine whether there is a continuing need for
SACMILL’s function and its form and whether it should continue
to exist at arm’s length from Government. Should the review
conclude there is a continuing need for the body, it will go on to
examine whether the body’s control and governance arrangements
continue to meet the recognised principles of good corporate
governance. I will inform the House of the outcome of the review when
it is

the publication of Lord Justice Leveson’s report in November
2012, the Government accepted his
recommendation—endorsing that of Lord Justice
Jackson—that costs protection should be extended to defamation
and privacy claims. Costs protection protects parties from the costs
that they might have to pay to the other side in civil litigation.
Costs protection was introduced in April 2013 for personal injury cases
when the Government reformed the way in which no win, no fee agreements
operate. Those reforms, contained in part 2 of the Legal Aid,
Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (LASPO) Act 2012, were delayed
for defamation and privacy cases as a result of Lord Justice
Leveson’s recommendation until a costs protection regime has
been
introduced.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091341000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/wmstext/130913m0001.htm#13091341000059">The
proposals in the consultation are designed to help people and
organisations of modest means to be able to bring and defend defamation
and privacy claims without the fear of having to pay unaffordable legal
costs to the other side if they lose. The consultation also proposes
that those of substantial means (whether individuals or organisations,
such as national newspapers) would be excluded from the costs
protection regime, while those of less modest means might have to pay
something towards the legal costs of the other side if they
lose.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091341000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/wmstext/130913m0001.htm#13091341000060">The

the new costs protection regime in April 2014, at the same time as
implementing the relevant provisions in part 2 of LASPO Act for
defamation and privacy cases. Taken together, these

and still being embedded. It was designed to record cases where an
enterprise has progressed in its pursuit of overseas business
opportunities to the point of successfully winning contracts, whereas
much of the assistance provided to exporters by UKTI team in London and
in the English regions involves help at earlier stages in this export
development process. As it often takes a considerable time before
contracts are won, the number of enterprises reporting significant
assistance and benefit from this support is measured through UKTI's
independently administered Performance and Impact Monitoring
Survey.</hs_Para>

the political levy via check-off, but make no attempt to inform

nature have been held, although in the past year I have held two
roundtable meetings with representatives of
tele- communications companies, consumer groups and MPs to
consider possible measures to tackle the issue of unsolicited sales
calls. All companies, irrespective of sector, are required to comply
with the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) 2003.
These regulations forbid them from making an unsolicited telephone
sales call to a consumer whose number is registered with the Telephone
Preference Service (TPS), or if they have previously advised the caller
not to make further calls to them. The Information Commissioner's
Office (ICO) enforces the PECR and can issue a monetary penalty of up
to £500,000 for a breach of the
regulations.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13091339000497" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/text/130913w0001.htm#13091339000497"><B><Member PimsId="401" UID="13091339002310" xid="504" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/text/130913w0001.htm#13091339002310">John

allow telephone sales calls to a consumer, whose number is registered
with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), or if they have previously

for sponsoring a spouse or partner and dependent children of

family immigration rules. The level of the income threshold, which was
set in the light of advice from the independent Migration Advisory
Committee, reflects the level of income at which a couple, once settled

as part of the design process. Several such products are currently in

Wright:</Member></B> Youth offending teams (YOTs) are multi-agency
partnerships. Their budget comprises funding provided primarily by the
local authority and local statutory partners; including the police,
probation, health authorities and where relevant the Welsh Assembly
Government. Additional funding is provided by the Ministry of Justice
through the Youth Justice Board (YJB) in the form of youth justice good
practice grants to YOTs. Individual contributions vary but on average
this grant from the YJB represents around a third of a YOT's
funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091339000785" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/text/130913w0002.htm#13091339000785">The

may find their function improves whilst others adapt to their

direct payment of rent once we are satisfied that they are in a
position to manage their affairs. We expect that managed payments will
remain in place at least until the outstanding arrears have been
recovered. One of the failings of the current system is that decisions
to move claimants to managed payments of rent are not systematically
reviewed. How long managed payments remain in place beyond that will
depend upon individual circumstance but we expect most claimants would
not be switched back to direct payments for a further six
months.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13091339002051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/text/130913w0003.htm#13091339002051"><B><Member PimsId="4291" UID="13091339002508" xid="593" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130913/text/130913w0003.htm#13091339002508">Stephen
