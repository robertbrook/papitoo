capacity is a matter of national importance. It is vital that the
Airports Commission has sufficient time to carry out a thorough
investigation of the options, and to build consensus around its
long-term recommendations. The timetable set for its final report, by
the summer of 2015, will allow this to take place, and will enable a
stable, long-term solution to be

</B><B>Attlee</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, we welcome the report of
the Transport Select Committee but do not necessarily agree with all
its conclusions. It is important that we have a solution that will
withstand a change of government. The Crossrail and HS2 projects can
withstand a change of government. We need a policy for Heathrow and the
London hub that can also withstand a change of

Soley:</Member></B> The noble Earl wants a thorough inquiry, but we
have been having thorough inquiries since the Maplin inquiry, which was
about 50 years ago, so it would be quite nice if we could finish this.
Had the Government taken on board the last Government’s
position, we would be there now, which would be helpful. I put it to
the Minister that there is a danger of an unconsidered policy
developing on this, since we now have six London airports with seven
runways—or seven airports, if you include the newly renamed
London Oxford Airport. I do not know how far this is going to go on
until we actually get a proper
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T14:39:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306108000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Attlee" PimsId="3822" UID="1306108000264" xid="1061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000264">Earl

Bradshaw:</Member></B> On the subject of hub capacity, is it not
relevant to think in terms of which airlines bring people into Heathrow
who require the access to a hub? 
<?notus-xml column=1398?>Many airports cater for people who are coming to the United Kingdom for
short or long stays, and they do not need to interline. The
announcement this morning of Birmingham Airport’s massive
expansion, and the fact that it is going to be 35 minutes from the

Clinton-Davis:</Member></B> I speak as the life president of BALPA. The
inordinate delay in making a decision about the siting of a major
airport in London can only result in benefiting Amsterdam, Paris and
Frankfurt. Any alternative to Heathrow is bound to take a huge amount
of time to come into operation, whereas Heathrow, properly adapted, is
ready now. Is it not the most obvious choice for any Government to
enable them to make a speedy decision, which will not result in giving
an advantage to other airports in

the fact that a decision would not come until just after the next
general election. Is he aware that the Government, who keep pressing
for more economic growth, are in danger of being charged with
dithering, given that a speedy resolution to this will do more to
promote economic growth than many of the other things that we all read

that one of the difficulties of this open-ended discussion which has,

election. Of course, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, and I could
have a chat before the next election but, even though he and I have
solved a lot of problems together and we have rarely needed to seek the
opinion of the House, I suspect that this matter will be far beyond our
pay grade to
determine.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_10_PT_1/3884DDC6A768D359DDF9CC1F2861D2E6F2A1654E" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 June 2013">Monday,

upsurge in sectarian violence during the transition period. Foreign
Office Ministers have been clear throughout the events in Egypt that
have taken place since the revolution that the freedom of religious
belief needs to be protected and that the ability to worship in peace
is a vital component of a democratic society. We continue to urge the
Egyptian authorities 
<?notus-xml column=1400?>to promote religious tolerance and to revisit policies that discriminate
against anyone on the basis of their religion. We are also in contact
with representatives of the Coptic Church and other religious
groups<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T14:46:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

reply. Is he aware that since the downfall of President Mubarak there
have been attacks on Sufi shrines, the marginalisation of the
Baha’is, hostility towards Muslim secularists and a massive
escalation of assaults on Christian communities, including the Coptic
cathedral, when security forces stood by doing nothing to deter the
violence? In what specific ways have Her Majesty’s Government
encouraged the Egyptian Government to create an environment of social
cohesion, reduce tensions and promote mutual respect between adherents
of different faiths so that they can live together as equal citizens in

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, as we all know, it has not
been an easy transition, and one could add to the noble
Baroness’s list new laws that limit the role of NGOs and their
ability to accept foreign funding, arrests of bloggers and restrictions
on the freedom of the media. It is a messy transition, which is not
entirely surprising given how long the authoritarian Government of
Egypt had been in effect and given also the internal divide between a
relatively liberal urban elite and a much more conservative peasant
class from outside Cairo. We have intervened on a number of occasions.
My noble friend Lady Warsi made a major speech at the organisation of
Islamic states conference on the importance of freedom of religion and
belief, and my honourable friend and colleague, Alistair Burt, has
spoken to the Egyptian Government several times in Cairo and elsewhere
on the importance of respect for minority rights of all

tolerant Middle East is something that we would all love to have. At
present, in Iraq as well as in Syria and a number of other countries,
the question of religious minorities, be they Muslim or non-Muslim, is
very much in play. We know that the conflict between what one might
call moderate Sunnis and Sadaqua Sunnis is also acute. We do what we
can, and I have to say that Muslim leaders in this country also do what
they can, to influence the debate, but we recognise that the Middle
East is in turmoil. Coming out of this very long period of
authoritarian regimes does not make it easy to change habits
immediately.</hs_para>

case-by-case analysis of the drug in question. If there is a very
promising new drug that is a breakthrough medicine, where there is no
alternative treatment, there may be a case for considering that more
favourably than a drug for which there is a readily suitable
alternative. As I mentioned earlier, the menu of options available to
us, such as an early access scheme for unlicensed medicines and an
adaptive licensing scheme within European Union rules for licensed
medicines, can perhaps be tailor-made to suit the drug in

issues are distinct. It has always been the case that a doctor can,
under his or her own professional responsibility, in certain
circumstances, prescribe an unlicensed medicine. However, he is also

afraid, for the results of the current discussions that are going on
with the pharmaceutical industry

is our ambition that the price of a medicine should more fairly reflect
its benefit to the patient and society. Therefore, if doctors have
greater confidence that those two things apply when they are made aware
of the price of the medicine, we certainly hope that uptake will
follow.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_10_PT_1/99C902D62B2E7DED73FB01AA7CD43755DA1A030E" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 June 2013">Monday,

Answer. On 26 October, when the European directive comes into force, it
will preclude around 170 independent midwives from practising, and this
at a time when we have a burgeoning baby boom.
Many of these midwives actually work within the NHS. Is my noble friend
aware that many of these independent midwives are seeking a solution
but they require help, advice and support from the department and,
above all, a revision of the tariff for maternity services? Will my
noble friend ensure that this issue is a priority for urgent action by
his colleagues, the Department of Health and the other agencies
involved?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306108000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000056"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="1306108000315" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000315">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, as my noble friend knows, work has been
going on for a number of years, including going back to the
previous Government, to see whether there are viable ways of ensuring
that this small group of independent midwives can obtain suitable
indemnity or insurance cover. One of the difficulties we have had is
the absence of information on the potential barriers to independent
midwives moving to alternative governance and delivery practices in
order to obtain that cover—hence the consultation I have spoken
about. As I said, we are now analysing the 
<?notus-xml column=1405?>responses. However, I do not agree that there is no way through. We know
that some independent practitioners have opted for a corporate or
social enterprise model as a way of gaining insurance cover. We are
trying to understand what the barriers are to that among those who are
resisting the
idea.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306108000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000057"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Foulkes of Cumnock" PimsId="4875" UID="1306108000316" xid="1866" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000316">Lord

it, we are talking about 154 individuals as compared with 41,000
midwives on the register. If they work for the NHS, there is generally
no issue; they will be covered by NHS indemnity in one way or another.

from the department have been in discussion with stakeholders,
including Independent Midwives UK, on an ongoing basis for at least
four years with a view to identifying potential solutions to the issue.
Arising in part from these discussions, independent midwives can now
obtain affordable indemnity cover for the whole of the maternity care
pathway either in the NHS or in the private sector. However, it is
acknowledged that this is achievable only if they operate as part of
some form of social enterprise or corporate entity. That is the issue

require HEE to give attention to ensuring that, in educating and
training staff for the NHS, it also ensures that, as far as possible,
staff can  
<?notus-xml column=1407?>work across the health/social care boundary in an integrated way. I

would like to ensure that when separate regulations are made under
Clause 85 for particular groups of staff, Health Education England is
also required to try to use particular regulations to promote
integration in accordance with the Clause 88 provision. For example, if
there are to be regulations on community nurses or healthcare
assistants, the issue of training them or recognising qualifications or
registration, Health Education England should act in a way that
facilitates integration of services by enabling those staff to carry
their training and qualifications across employment in as wide a range
of settings as
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:09:47"></hs_TimeCode>. In

mouthing platitudes about integration and swearing undying fealty to

prevents staff from working in a range of settings, with qualifications
that are not always recognised by a range of employers. We need to do
our best when we have the opportunity to remove those blockages and
secure more people who are equally at home working in a predominantly
health or a predominantly social care setting and can easily move
between those settings for the benefit of services users. These staff
need to be alert also to the importance of integrating care for
individual service users across organisational boundaries. I want to
ensure that Health Education England is in no doubt that this approach
is important for tomorrow’s workforce. That is what my amendment

amendment. It is absolutely vital from the point of view of the patient
and the family that the workers with whom they come into contact have
an understanding of the whole of their situation. The training and
experience of such workers has to encompass that whole situation. For
example, a person who is admitted to hospital quite suddenly with a
stroke has contact with social care services, finance departments of
local authorities, charities of all kinds, reablement services, private
care providers, as well as all the health services concerned with the
actual condition.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=1408?>care systems are differently funded and that there is no commonly

do not have that pre-existing knowledge. If such a person is going to
have the opportunity for choice, to which we are all committed, it is
absolutely vital that the workers with whom they deal have the broadest
range of knowledge and experience. People’s experience of health
and social care does not come in discrete packages. It is vital that
the experience of workers does not come in discrete packages

words. My experience in all this is very much as a layman and as a
tri-weekly visitor to see my mother in a nursing home. In discussion
with health assistants working in the nursing home, I have found that
there is a transfer between hospital settings and social care, and
there are clearly disciplines and learning requirements that apply in
both settings. Sometimes, in either setting, you see people who would
have benefited from the training available in the other setting,
particularly in the area of elderly care. To take nutrition,
cleanliness and the changing of bedding, clearly the same standards
apply. Often, simple tasks require a common training programme. I hope

to work with integrated care delivery. I hope that he will concede that
my noble friend’s cross-reference in his amendment to Clause 85

continuing professional development. However, that is the broad answer.

85, as I understand it, is a regulation-making power. It seems to
envisage that the Government of the day will from time to time make
regulations that relate to very specific groups of staff. I have read
the provision carefully, and it could presumably make regulations that
exclude particular groups of staff. Somewhere along the way, there is a
very real possibility that we will get regulations that cover
particular groups of staff in a very specific manner. I am particularly
interested in those groups of staff who work at the sub-professional
level—the healthcare support staff. As my noble friend Lord
Campbell-Savours said, these are very much the people who work across
both these settings. At the moment, I cannot see why it will do
harm—indeed, it is likely do some good—if we require this
regulation-making power to take account of the kinds of issues which
foster integration that I and other noble Lords have spoken of. The
Minister mentioned the mandate. I know that mandates are
extraordinarily fashionable at the moment, but mandates come and
mandates go. Regulations tend to have a bit more sticking power than

Committee because, as we all know, there are huge
numbers of very frail people, usually older people, often
with multiple conditions, in our hospitals and care homes, and
indeed in the community now. The numbers are
growing. For all sorts of reasons—I think that some
of them could be tracked back to the European
working time directive—nurses are doing more and more
complex tasks in the care that they provide, some of it
electronic, that very often removes them from the day-to-day care of
some of these very frail people. The same applies in care homes. The
care that is provided is very often not provided by
qualified nurses but by healthcare assistants or care
assistants. There are many of those people who
are fantastically caring. They have a natural ability to relate to the
patients that they deal with or the residents in care homes. However, a
lot of the dreadful cases that we read about in the newspapers take
place because unqualified and unregistered care assistants are looking
after people without the necessary training and without the necessary
standard of care being insisted upon. This is extremely
worrying.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1306108000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000102">We

Cumberlege:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble
Baroness on the enormous amount of work that has clearly gone into this
amendment and on the way that she introduced it, drawing on a
lifetime’s experience in this field. My one reservation is about
having to consider what the fundamental purpose of Health Education
England is. As I see it, if HEE works well, then in future it will be
the engine that delivers a better healthcare workforce in England,
thereby improving the quality of care for patients. It is responsible
for the education, training and personal development of all NHS staff
and for recruiting, from our schools and into our universities,
suitable people to carry on these tasks within the NHS. It is
employer-led and it is there to provide the right workforce with the
right skills and values, in the right place and at the right time, to
better meet the needs and wants of
patients.</hs_para>

300 different specific jobs and more than 1,000 employees nationwide,
and the workforce needs to be educated and trained to
exacting standards. Its task now is to prepare students for
a very different NHS in the future: more care out of hospitals, more
focus on long-term conditions, greater integration of health and social
care, and new technology and techniques, all of which require
planning and changes to curricula, as well as more of a
focus on student choice towards NHS needs. It has an enormously
difficult and comprehensive job to do. As I understand it, Health
Education England accepts and supports the concept of mandatory
training for healthcare assistants and the introduction of some sort of
certification scheme that would allow HCAs to prove that they had
attained the required levels of education and training.</hs_para>

role of education and training. Therefore, although I very much

with.</hs_para>

Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, that Health Education England may not be the

about the regulation of healthcare assistants, because not only would
it reassure employers and patients that standards were being met but
being on a register gives individuals a degree of self-respect and
sense of identity and it boosts their morale. In a way, it is a pity
that we got rid of state enrolled nurses some time ago when we moved to
university-educated nurses. In effect, that has been very successful
and nurses have done very well—they do a marvellous
job—but we have left a gap where the SENs
were.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306108000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000109">Amendment

with all due respect, is a better amendment because it focuses much

to people receiving health and social care services and are fundamental
to promoting and protecting service users’ dignity and respect,
there have been—as we have debated on many occasions in this

clearly showed the failings at Mid Staffordshire Hospital and, while it
identified the trust management as responsible for the shocking quality
of care, it outlined incidences of poor care and inaction by
healthcare assistants in reporting concerns. At Winterbourne
View, people with severe learning disabilities were treated with an
appalling lack of dignity by care assistants and nursing staff, some of
whom have since been given prison sentences. A number of reports
looking at dementia care in hospitals have found unacceptable
variations in practice and high levels of dissatisfaction,
alongside incidences of unacceptable care. A number of reports looking
at home care provided to older people, including the
Alzheimer’s Society reports <I>Support</I><I>.</I><I>
Stay</I><I>.</I><I> Save</I><I>.</I> and <I>Home Truths</I>, as well as
an inquiry by the Equality and Human Rights Commission,

good-quality care to service users. There continue to be isolated
incidences of reported poor care and abuse of older people in care

legislate for things that we should actually leave well alone and that
do not need regulating, but then there are glaring omissions, such as
this, where there is an obvious need to regulate, yet we say that we do
not want to be seen as regulators and therefore do not take the
necessary action. I say “Courage” to my noble friend. The
time is now to regulate in this area. We have talked about it long
enough and I hope that he will have the courage to take this forward.

tend to focus on the elderly, but more and more people look to have
care packages within the environment of their own home. There are
thousands of people who are not elderly but who are just as vulnerable.
People with learning disabilities, autism, chronic mental health

their home. The grey line between what is healthcare and what is social
care merges even more as these packages become much more complex and as
technology and medication enable more people to maintain a degree of
supported independent living at home. We tend to think in boxes. When
people living at home in these circumstances need to engage the help of
care assistants, whether for healthcare or social care, those
assistants come through the statutory services or through agencies, and
we like to think—as a sort of comfort cushion—that all
the checks have been made to ensure not only that these people have

Emerton:</Member></B> My Lords, I will make a few comments on the
contributions made so far by noble Lords. During the passage of the
Health and Social Care Act I was very strongly in favour of the
regulation of healthcare support workers. We have moved on in time, and
in terms of the setting up of Health Education 
<?notus-xml column=1418?>England and the role that the other bodies are taking. There is no doubt
about all the points made by my noble friend Lady Greengross, and those
about Winterbourne View and people being given prison sentences; most
of them were registered nurses, not support workers. We want to ensure
the safety of patients. For various reasons the Government now take the
view that regulation is not possible through the Nursing and Midwifery
Council. Regulation is possibly a step too far at this
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:51:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306108000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000119">The
Francis report recommended the creation of a registration system, under
which no unregistered person should deliver care to a patient, whether
that be in the community or in hospital. I agree that we need to have
some form of certification, and some form of safeguard that will ensure
that anyone delivering care will be able to be examined. Amendment 23A,
which is grouped with Amendment 23, further sets out my view, which is
shared by the noble Lords, Lord Willis of Knaresborough and Lord Patel,
that basic training should be given with certification, and that it is
important that employers take that into

Campbell-Savours:</Member></B> My Lords, from what I hear and from what
I have been told, the problem seems to be that no one wants to do this
job. A number of organisations have been approached, and many of them
have made it clear that registration would be an impossible task.
However, when you talk to healthcare assistants in nursing homes or
wherever, you find that among them are some who strongly believe in it,
because they want to see weeded out the people who they believe should
not be practising. If they want it, and they believe that it
potentially defends their professional position, why can they not be
given some organisation, some kind of structure to which they can
belong and be registered with, which would give them confidence within
their working

understand that the Government’s response will be the vetting

system.</hs_para>

Sutherland of Houndwood:</Member></B> My Lords, as has been claimed in
the course of this short debate, this amendment should be seen in the
same context as Amendments 23 and 23A. However, together they have one
common difficulty, which I think has been highlighted. The first point
they make is that there should be proper training and education in this
area, which is absolutely right; it should be a matter for Health
Education England. Secondly, there is still a 
<?notus-xml column=1419?>residual concern, which is very real, that the presence of training does
not always guarantee that the care will be of the level and quality
that we reasonably expect. So there may be a separate question about
imposing some degree of regulation on employers. It is hinted at in
Amendments 23 and 23A that employers could suffer a liability were they
to put into the field, be they agencies or statutory employers, someone
who evidently is unable to provide a decent quality of care. So the
separation of these two issues is what I
propose<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:55:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306108000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000124"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Masham of Ilton" PimsId="1733" UID="1306108000347" xid="1341" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000347">Baroness

it comes to crisis intervention and physical restraint techniques, all

by three elements: a fragmented, unregulated training provider sector;

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Baroness takes us
back to our debates last year on the regulation of health and social
care support workers. We had some excellent discussions but, as the
noble Baroness, Lady Browning, said, the Government set their face
against the statutory approach without convincingly explaining to the
House why they did not favour such a move. As far as I can see, the
Government’s main objection appears to be cost; they are relying
on better training and a voluntary
register<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:57:19"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:57:19"></hs_TimeCode>.
But as the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, pointed out, this may not
be sufficient. As she says, unqualified care assistants are looking
after very vulnerable people without the necessary training and
support, and are being placed in a very vulnerable position. This is
probably not the time to debate the loss of state-enrolled nurses, but
my noble friend Lord Turnberg is absolutely right to say that the
essential removal of the SEN grade has left a gap which needs to be
filled<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:58:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306108000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000127">My
noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours points
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:58:00"></hs_TimeCode> that we are
absolutely reliant on support workers to provide care. Many or most of
them are actually very dedicated, but they are not being given
sufficient tools to do the job effectively. One has to have great
sympathy with the noble Baroness in her
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:58:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306108000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000128">Some
noble Lords have said that it is not readily apparent why Health
Education England ought to be the regulator. I certainly sympathise
with that point, but no doubt the noble Baroness could easily
substitute<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:57:52"></hs_TimeCode>
either the NMC or the HPC. We could no doubt come back to the question
of which regulator it should be. The HPC has been somewhat acquisitive
in past years in adding professions to its register, and would no doubt
be keen to add healthcare and social care support 
<?notus-xml column=1420?>workers to the large number of people whom it registers at the moment.
As for the NMC, we understand that it has been through some
difficulties in leadership and has a backlog of cases to be heard by
its regulatory committees. But it has new leadership, and I am
confident that it will be able to get through those
problems—and, if it was chosen, it could also register health
and support care assistants if that were to be
required<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:59:40"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:59:39"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:59:09"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:58:29"></hs_TimeCode>.

difficulty in organising the regulation of support

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, like my noble friend Lady Cumberlege, I
pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, for her very
carefully crafted amendment. It seeks to extend compulsory statutory
regulation to healthcare assistants and care assistants and to make
further amendments to legislation to account for this. I want first to
acknowledge the crucial role played by healthcare and care support
workers in the delivery of high-quality care to patients and service
users throughout the country. That much is a given. The vast majority
of workers give the very highest quality of care and are relied on and
valued for the way they improve people’s lives. However, we have
all seen evidence that a minority let patients down. This is a cause
for concern and it is right that there is discussion about how we can
ensure consistent, high standards of
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306108000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000132">My noble
friend Lady Cumberlege made some very compelling points on the terms of
the amendment but on the wider issue of principle the Government do not
believe that the case for regulation is proven. Compulsory statutory
regulation is not, of itself, an effective way to assure the quality of
care by these workers and it can detract from the essential
responsibility of employers to ensure that any person they appoint is
suitably trained and competent for the role.</hs_para>

existing tiers of regulation that protect service users, including the
standards set by the Care Quality Commission and the Disclosure and
Barring Service. We also need to be clear that professional regulation
is not a panacea. It is no substitute for good leadership at every
level and proper management of services. It can also constrain
innovation and the availability of services. Experience clearly
demonstrates that a small number of those workers who are subject 
<?notus-xml column=1421?>to compulsory statutory regulation from time to time fail to ensure that
their practice is up to date and delivered to the standard that we
expect. In these circumstances it is too often the case that regulation

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may ask the noble Earl a
question before he sits down because I am getting increasingly puzzled
by this debate. I agree with him that a list does not of itself do very
much to protect the public, particularly if it is a list of apples,
oranges, bananas, pears, cherries or whatever—and this is a list
of people with different qualifications or experiences. However, the
whole point about HEE is that it is meant to be a game-changer and to
standardise some of the training for particular groups. Is it the
Government’s view that the term “healthcare
assistant” will start to mean the same in Cornwall as in
Cumbria, because HEE has defined the training for those covered by that
terminology to be the same wherever the person is
trained<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T16:08:39"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

consistency of standards throughout the country and people should know
precisely what those standards are. The problem with this sector of the
workforce is that the standards have not properly been defined until
now—hence the work that Skills for Health and Skills for Care
are doing. However, we will see from that work and the work of Camilla
Cavendish where the gaps are and where we need to focus our attention.

Government have set for the Health Education England special health

Government recognise very clearly the importance of promoting research

the use of evidence from research in education and training activity.
In response to stakeholder views in consultation and a recommendation
from the Joint Committee that examined the draft Bill, we have
strengthened the wording so that it is a duty to promote research. This
has been welcomed by stakeholders 
<?notus-xml column=1428?>such as the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Association of Medical

shall now respond to the two other amendments to which noble Lords have
spoken. Amendment 37 would add to a local education and training
board’s main functions the promotion of research and the use of
research evidence in the health service. Amendment 39 would
require a local education and training board to support Health
Education England in exercising its function to promote research into
matters relating to social care services, primary care services and
other health services so far as it is exercisable. I wholeheartedly
agree that the local education and training boards need to take a
strong interest in research and the use of research evidence when
planning, commissioning and quality assuring the delivery of education
and training. As noble Lords know, we have placed the primary duty to
promote research on Health Education England but, as committees of
Health Education England, the LETBs will be required to support the
national body in delivering the duty through their workforce planning
and education and training functions. Therefore, we do not see that the
amendment is necessary in that sense. Health Education England will
ensure that the LETBs support the delivery of key national duties, such
as those in Clause 86, to promote research, support the NHS
constitution and improve the quality of education and training. I also
point out in this context that the appointment criteria that the Health
Education England special health authority has used to appoint the
existing 13 local education and training boards require the LETB to
demonstrate effective mechanisms for partnership working with academic
health science centres and academic health sciences
networks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306108000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000180">I am

the ISC’s work is one part of the strong framework of democratic
accountability and oversight that governs the use of secret
intelligence in the United Kingdom, which successive Governments have

I want to set out how UK law is upheld in respect of information
received from the United States and to address the specific questions
about the role of GCHQ. Since the 1940s GCHQ and its American
equivalent, now the National Security Agency, have had a relationship
that is unique in the world. This relationship has been and remains
essential to the security of both nations. It has stopped many
terrorist and espionage plots against this country, and has saved many
lives. The basic principles by which that co-operation operates have
not changed over time. Indeed, I wish to emphasise to the House that
while we have experienced an extremely busy period in intelligence and
diplomacy in the last three years, the arrangements for oversight and
the general framework for exchanging information with the United States
are the same as under previous Governments.</hs_para>

nature of threats from terrorists, criminals or espionage has only
increased the importance of the intelligence relationship with the
United States. This was particularly the case in the run-up to the
Olympics. The House will not be surprised that our activity to counter
terrorism intensified and rose to a peak in the summer of last year. It
has been suggested that GCHQ uses our partnership with the United
States to get around UK law, obtaining information that it cannot
legally obtain in the UK. I wish to be absolutely clear that this
accusation is baseless. Any data obtained by us from the US involving
UK nationals are subject to proper UK statutory controls and
safeguards, including the relevant sections of the Intelligence
Services Act, the Human Rights Act and RIPA. Our intelligence-sharing
work with the United States is subject to ministerial and independent
oversight and to scrutiny by the Intelligence and Security Committee.

mean that we do not have to work to strengthen public confidence
wherever we can, while maintaining the secrecy necessary to
intelligence work. We have strengthened the role of the ISC through the
Justice and Security Act 2013 to include oversight of the
agencies’ operations as well as their policy, administration and
finances, and we have introduced the National Security Council so that
intelligence is weighed and assessed alongside all other sources of

reporting and the insights of other government departments, and so that
all this information is judged carefully in deciding the

is no doubt that secret intelligence, including the work of GCHQ, is
vital to our country. It enables us to detect threats against our
country ranging from nuclear proliferation to cyberattack. Our agencies
work to prevent serious and organised crime, and to protect our economy
against those trying to steal intellectual property. They disrupt
complex plots against our country, such as when individuals travel
abroad to gain terrorist training and prepare attacks. They support the
work of our Armed Forces overseas and help to protect the lives of our
men and women in uniform, and they work to help other countries
lawfully to build the capacity and willingness to investigate and
disrupt terrorists in their countries, before threats reach us within
the United Kingdom. We should never forget that threats are launched at
us secretly, that new weapons systems and tactics are developed
secretly, and that countries or terrorist groups that plan attacks or
operations against us do so in secrecy. So the methods we use to combat
these threats must be secret, just as they must always be
lawful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306108000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#1306108000201">If the

who are among the very finest public servants our nation has, then I
believe that they would be reassured by how we go about this difficult

both Houses, and across all sides of both Houses, about the values that

<I>Guardian</I> newspaper has revealed information obtained from Mr
Edward Snowden, a former CIA contractor, that the National Security
Agency in the United States has, so far as we understand it, collected
huge quantities of information on telephone calls, e-mails and other
online information. Some, but by no means all, of this surveillance has
been focused on United States citizens. Much is said to have come from
Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Skype and other digital sources. It will
therefore include surveillance of people who are not US
citizens.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061025000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#13061025000003">While

said—that all the surveillance is directed not just against
terrorists but against many different kinds of criminals, such as
cybercriminals, paedophiles and people who wish to steal intellectual
property.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061025000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#13061025000005">We
need to focus on the issues for the United Kingdom and to allay the
plain anxieties of UK citizens and the UK media about the extent of UK
involvement, its character and the legal basis for anything that has
happened in our country. As Douglas Alexander put it on the
“Today” programme this morning in response to Simon
McCoy, “We need to be able to reassure the public ... there is
an understandable level of public concern, given the reports in the
newspapers over the last couple of days, and given how much we all rely
on the intelligence agencies here in the United Kingdom to keep us
safe”. There have been assertions and counterassertions. Today
we begin the process of understanding what has happened from the United
Kingdom’s point of
view.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061025000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#13061025000006">First, I
will deal with what might be called the straw dogs. I want, for
complete avoidance of doubt, to be clear about what we are not saying
today. I do not doubt for one second that in the complex battle with
terrorism or organised crime we need to collect data. It is an
intrusive but entirely essential task for our security services. I will
not accept from these Benches that we would ever willingly or knowingly
put UK citizens or others at risk. We, too, will give no comfort or
inadvertent assistance to terrorists, as the Foreign Secretary
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061025000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#13061025000007">Secondly,
we have no doubt whatever that this means that there will be
co-operation between friendly states trying to achieve the same
objectives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061025000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#13061025000008">Thirdly,
the balance between surveillance and privacy is a very hard one to
strike. Perhaps it is impossible to get it entirely right as
circumstances change. The Foreign 
<?notus-xml column=1434?>Secretary said, in replying to questions on the Statement, that mistakes
will always be made. I am not even saying that mistakes have been made,
but this is obviously something that we will all want to keep in mind.
Privacy will be compromised to some extent, whatever balance we agree.
However, there has to be a proper balance if we regard the proper
privacy of citizens as important—important not at the risk of
their life and limb but important none the less in a democratic society
where we enjoy private life within the law. The United Kingdom would
never have settled for a Stasi-style state. This weekend, the Foreign
Secretary described his approach as “necessary” and
“proportionate”. That is a matter of the balance. We try
to enshrine the balance as best we can in law, and I must return to
this point in seeking clarification from the Minister. We need better
to understand the terms that the Foreign Secretary has
used.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061025000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#13061025000009">Fourthly,
every Minister who has dealt with the intelligence services, including
GCHQ—and I am proud to have been one of them—knows that
we are dealing with people of the greatest integrity, and it is not any
part of my submission to your Lordships that we have grounds for
suspicion. They are excellent as a group and are outstanding in their
service to the United Kingdom. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord
Carlile, made essentially the same point on television over the
weekend, and it is a view that I share.</hs_para>

expression that law-abiding British citizens have “nothing to
fear”. We have probably all used that kind of phrase on one
occasion or another, but it often conceals more than it reveals. Of
course those acting within the law should not fear oversight but most
of us also value our privacy, at least to some extent, and can value it
without wishing to commit any acts of terrorism. I am never happy about
the extent to which search engines inspect my tastes, purchases, and
whereabouts and so on in pursuit of business, even when I do not want
them to. Prism is therefore a concern for honest reasons, not dishonest
ones. How we use it or perhaps contribute to it is also a concern for
honest reasons, not dishonest
ones.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061025000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0001.htm#13061025000011">On the
“Today” programme this morning, Sir Malcolm Rifkind said
that no access surveillance data of the kinds that I have described
could be collected without explicit ministerial approval. I think that
that was reflected in the Statement but I want to check. As I
understand it, Sir Malcolm was referring either to material that the
UK’s intelligence agencies may wish to collect for themselves or
to material collected by a foreign agency that the intelligence
services here might wish to access. He said, “The law is
actually quite clear. If the British intelligence agencies are seeking
to know the content of e-mails about people living in the UK then they
actually have to get lawful authority. Normally that means ministerial
authority”. I understand that the foreign agency might offer
material out of mutual friendship and concern for the well-being of our
or other citizens, and I repeat that this has an unavoidable impact on
privacy but is very important for our safety. However, Sir
Malcolm’s point was that there is an explicit law on
permissions. He was not making the point that we should never try to
catch terrorists by such means—quite the contrary.</hs_para>

might be a citizen of two or three countries, one of which might be the

“within the UK”, what is within the UK is a great deal
less clear than it was a few years ago. For all I know, the server

Combine that with an explosion in systems of communication which did
not exist before, and the graphic illustration that the Minister just
gave about London, Lagos and Aleppo, and there is a globalisation and
dependence on other countries for intelligence. The front line in the
defence of our country is intelligence. From my previous experience, I
pay tribute—as has already been done—to those

Malcolm Rifkind, who fortunately been long enough out of post. In

right about the explosion of communications and the speed of

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for those very
helpful words. However, it is not only all terrorism that is by
definition international. When I was covering the Home Office brief and
spent some time with the West Yorkshire Police I came to the conclusion
that all serious organised crime is now international. We therefore
operate in a world in which co-operation, not just with the United
States but with our European partners and others is nevertheless
essential in order to combat this global phenomenon—and, of
course, some of those with whom we have to co-operate are not the
easiest of partners. The noble Lord will know well that some of the
websites which those who have been radicalised in this country have had
access to are operated out of very distant

difference between public opinion and published opinion is, of course,
that public opinion very often wants different and contradictory
things. The public want security and privacy, they want the state off
their backs, but at the same time they want the state to protect them.
That is part of what politicians have to deal with. It is one of the
reasons why referendums are not always a terribly good idea, because
the way public opinion flies depends on which week the referendum is
held. Attitudes to privacy among the young are much more relaxed than
among the old. Whether as the young get older they become more
concerned about privacy is something we shall slowly discover as we go

Secretary’s Statement will have gone far to reassure people that
our very high standards of oversight are being upheld. However, the
problem for people is not so much about our own legal standards and
standards of oversight, but what happens internationally, in 
<?notus-xml column=1439?>other countries, and whether their standards are as high. In light of
that, will my noble friend tell us what attention Her Majesty’s
Government are giving, in the borderless cyberworld, not just to the
full implementation of the 2006 data retention directive, but also to
aspiring to have high common standards as we go forward into

I understand the full transition to cloud computing. A very small
number of people in this House understand it, and I run to them from
time to time to ask for their advice. Certainly, we will
find that the new global standards on attempts to regulate cloud
computing will be thrashed out in negotiations between the United
States and the European Union in the context of the
transatlantic negotiations. So far we are a long way from discovering
how those will turn out. I read in the <I>New York Times</I> the other
day that one of the differences across the Atlantic is that in the
United States most people distrust the state much more than they
distrust companies, whereas in Europe more people trust the state and
distrust companies. That raises implications for what sort of
regulation people really want. Clearly there will be some extremely
difficult negotiations, first on the EU data protection directive, and
then within the transatlantic

An enormous amount of information is flowing into the United Kingdom on
any day of the week from a range of other intelligence services.
Naturally, we trust the Americans far more than we trust some other
countries. But one has to listen to countries that may in many ways be
hostile to the United Kingdom but with which we may share some real
security interests. That is all part of the very delicate world in
which we live and have to operate. None of this is easy, but

have, however, decided that it is right that we should legislate in
this instance because of the importance of DE&amp;S to our Armed Forces
and in order to ensure that Members of both Houses, many of whom take a
keen interest in defence matters, have a proper opportunity to explore
and debate the
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061025000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061025000061">The
White Paper sets out the proposed model for a GOCO, its key features

Its purpose is to set in context the legislation that we are bringing

that the MoD Police have the appropriate jurisdiction to be able to
operate within the GOCO environment; extend to the new body certain
statutory immunities and exemptions enjoyed by the Crown, for example,

to the single-source procurement reform. The White Paper also sets out
reforms to how the MoD undertakes single-source procurement of defence
equipment. Open competition is our preferred approach to getting value
for money. But sometimes there is only a single provider of a
capability that we require. The need to maintain critical national
industrial capabilities or sovereign control of the intellectual
property in equipment programmes sometimes requires us to place
contracts with UK companies without a competitive
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061025000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061025000063">Single-source
procurement accounts for about 45% of the total MoD spend on
defence equipment and support, or around £6 billion per year,
and it is likely to remain at those levels for the next decade or so.
Without competition, suppliers can price, and perform, without being
constrained by the disciplines of the marketplace. There is a clear
risk to defence and to taxpayers, and ensuring that we get good value
for money in single-source procurement is a key part of my programme to
reform defence
acquisition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061025000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061025000064">The
MoD currently uses a framework for single-source procurement which has
remained largely unchanged for the past 45 years, despite the
far-reaching changes to the industrial landscape and to commercial
procurement practices that have occurred in that time. Under this
system, the profit that contractors can earn is fixed, but there are
few incentives for them to reduce costs. Such a system does not serve

to undertake an independent review of our existing approach and to make

transparency of contractor cost data, with much stronger supplier
efficiency incentives, underpinned by stronger governance arrangements.

policed by a stronger, independent, single-source regulations office to

On these Benches we support defence procurement reform. We are
open-minded about how this is achieved and we welcome a full and

Government’s case for the GOCO appears in considerable part to
be based on the view that the existing organisational structure of
DE&amp;S within the Civil Service acts as a deterrent to attracting
some of the kind of people and expertise required because of the need
to keep within Civil Service pay structures and cultures. There is, in
the Government’s view, a 
<?notus-xml column=1445?>need for behavioural change, and bringing in a few people from outside
is insufficient. If that is the case, are the Government saying that it
would not be possible to create the pay and incentive arrangements felt
to be needed in respect of the DE&amp;S without going down the path of
a GOCO as envisaged in the Statement

issue is behavioural change then, in more specific terms, what is the

the Government will have been sounding out outside organisations which
might be interested in taking over the procurement operation. It may
well be that no one company will have all the necessary skills or
expertise to take over the procurement function and we may end up with
a single consortium of companies. If that is the case, the Government
will need to satisfy themselves that any consortium will not, in
effect, become a monopoly provider of the service due to alternative
individual companies or consortia with the same levels of knowledge and
expertise not being available when the contract comes up again for
tender. How do the Government intend to ensure that when the contract
comes up for renewal, there will be competition? Can the Minister say

is a potential danger of the current expertise and knowledge within the

look as though any meaningful risk will transfer away from the Ministry

Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for the
general support given by Her Majesty’s Opposition for our
defence procurement reform. We also want to approach this in a
non-partisan way. There is general acceptance, including by the
Opposition, of the problems in defence acquisition. Where we differ is
perhaps in how we solve those problems. We have proposed a GOCO
solution because we believe that incentivisation, the hard contract and
the freedoms 
<?notus-xml column=1447?>that GOCO would offer are the right way to deliver sustained
improvement. Allowing the private sector, too, not only to share its
expertise but to be held accountable for delivery will, we believe,
deliver far greater effect than a wholly public sector set-up. We are
testing that right now. This is very much the assessment phase—a
decision will be made next year—and we are in listening and
learning mode. There are a lot of experts in this House who know a
great deal about this subject. We are very keen to hear any suggestions
they may have and we are open to all their
views<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T17:42:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061025000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061025000082">The
noble Lord asked me a number of questions. I was not able to write
quickly enough to be able to answer them all but I will
write to him and make sure that copies are also sent to noble Lords who
ask questions afterwards. The first question was about the Atomic
Weapons Establishment, which is a GOCO organisation, established to
deliver a nuclear weapons capability for the UK nuclear deterrent
programme. AWE Management Ltd is currently performing at or under its
targeted cost and budget and has successfully shifted the
organisation’s culture towards a more commercially focused one.
Since transformation, AWE has successfully delivered efficiencies while
increasing its salaries, and has allowed access to the necessary
calibre of talent from the nuclear markets. We recognise that the AWE
model may not entirely map to DE&amp;S needs but it is a useful model
against which to test our
thinking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061025000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061025000083">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T17:43:51"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Lord asked me a number of questions about the workforce. The aim
is to create an environment which supports more effective working at
all levels across and between the interfaces of the new DE&amp;S
organisation and the wider department where our staff are
more empowered and better able to carry out their jobs. This would
allow DE&amp;S better to support the Armed Forces and deliver better
value for money for the taxpayer in a much more rewarding place to
work. There would be more significant management freedom to run the
organisation, increased opportunity to grow talent, develop the skills
and the culture, and have the freedom and flexibility of management
practices. The noble Lord asked about the role of military staff within
the organisation. As is the case today, specialist military skills or
expertise would be required in addition to recent operational
experience to influence capability decision-making, delivery into
service and support, and military staff would be seconded to the new
organisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T17:44:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061025000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061025000084">The
noble Lord asked about the trade union position. We have been engaging
with trade unions on our proposals throughout. Clearly, there are many
questions that our workforce will wish to have answered as we develop
both options through the assessment phase. But we would expect our
workforce, and therefore the trade unions, to support our attempts to
improve the environment in which our staff work, including
the opportunity to improve skills, tools and processes. I have a lot of
other information relating to the workforce on which I can perhaps
write to the noble Lord. He asked how quickly we were planning to move.
Taking the 2009 Gray report as a basis for change, we tested the thesis
that the change we seek and the problems we are trying to solve could
be made only by committing to a fundamental shift in approach. 
<?notus-xml column=1448?>That detailed analysis led us to the two options: the GOCO model and
DE&amp;S plus<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T17:46:09"></hs_TimeCode>.
We have thoroughly analysed the business and the possible solutions and
looked at the scope and capabilities of the organisation and what it is
that we want. Now we need to assess who is out there who could actually
deliver the proposition. That means running a competition which takes
time, but we expect to make a decision next summer. I make no apology
that it has taken some time. This is important, and it is important
that we get it

managed through the commercial contract. The MoD is taking forward
plans to develop a customer construct that will be able to provide
robust contract management. As with any major change programme, there
are risks to its successful delivery. We will manage and mitigate these
as the noble Lord would expect. The contract will be constructed with a
number of break points, allowing the department to recompete the
contract, or if necessary bring DE&amp;S back in-house. A robust
contract will be put in place between the GOCO provider and the MoD.
The MoD governor function will monitor performance against the
contract, and key performance indicators will be defined in the GOCO
contract, covering the full spectrum of delivery, procurement, support,

Palmer of Childs Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, we on these Benches
associate ourselves with the condolences and tributes from the
Minister. I will be more direct and ask just one question, and it may
be easier to give just one answer. I am worried about the GOCO
proposals, as are many people, but I believe that the situation
appertaining to procurement in the MoD cannot continue as it is and
that something must change. GOCO seems to be the preferred solution and
gives us many worries that were expounded during the debate on the
Queen’s Speech. If GOCO proceeds, the question I want to focus
on is the identity of the contractor—the CO part of GOCO. From
Written Answers received from my noble friend the Minister, there is no
reason why this contractor may not be a foreign company. We are
apparently reassured that the foreign company’s UK arm will have
a Chinese wall between it and its US or European parent company. With
the experience in this country of industries such as water being sold
to foreign companies and how they then control those companies, is the
Minister not being over-optimistic in thinking that, if there were
secrets in the UK arm of these overseas companies, those secrets would
not somehow go—this sounds like the last question—to
those overseas

constructed to ensure the protection of UK national interests. In order
to safeguard UK national security, the contracting entity and the
operating company must be UK registered and the overwhelming majority
of the contract shall be performed in the United Kingdom. In addition,
there will be restrictions on passing information to parent companies.

question is this: to what extent was the Government’s motivation
based on the recognition that one of the key problems in procurement,
giving rise to over-costs and over-runs in time, is the rapidity of
cyclical innovation in cyber-related equipment? Put simply,
50 years ago, when we were dealing with the purchase of a platform,
whether an armoured vehicle, an aeroplane or a battleship, the cycle of
innovation of transformative and new products was 10, 15, 20 or
30 years. Now we are more concerned with what is on those
platforms, not only the kinetics but the communication and the
real-time analysis of situational awareness, and the cycle of
innovation in that cyber-related procurement is something like 14
months. In other words, there is a cycle which occurs three times
during the period of the normal procurement process. That on its own
will not be solved by structural, managerial or contractual
reformation. It would be interesting to know to what extent that was
considered in the background thinking to the Government’s

an internal tension in defence procurement because of the very length
of time that any procurement takes? The aircraft carriers, for example,
have been at the top of the agenda for about the past 14 years, so
inevitably these issues go from one Government to another. However, the
tension is between maintaining some competition in defence procurement

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to make sure that
the House is aware of my interest as chair of a foundation trust and as
a consultant and trainer with Cumberlege Connections. This group
concerns the objectives and priorities established for Health Education
England in Clause 87 and that of the LETBs as set out in Clauses 90 to
93. My Amendments 22, 52 and Clause 90 stand part really go 
<?notus-xml column=1454?>to the heart of the relationship between HEE and the LETBs. Past
experience indicates that unless one has strong leadership at a
national level on workforce issues, one can find that decisions are
taken locally, without national consequences being thought through. In
the past this has led to an unfortunate reduction in training
commissions despite national exhortations not to do so. I want to avoid
that happening with Health Education England. I appreciate that under
Clause 90, LETBs are appointed by HEE and, I suppose, exercise
functions on behalf of HEE. However, I would like to see it explicitly
stated in the clause that LETBs will come under the firm direction of
Health Education England.</hs_para>

that I have been taken to task for my amendments by the Foundation
Trust Network for undermining local provider autonomy. I stand
corrected. I sympathise, and understand that LETBs must have room to
breathe and innovate. However, ultimately, the integrity of a national
strategy must be maintained. I hope that the noble Earl’s
response on this and, on the ability of HEE to amend the training plans
of LETBs if they are considered to fall short, will be
positive.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061036000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061036000003">I
turn to Clause 92 and my Amendment 47 on the co-operation required
between LETBs and local providers. The clause ensures that
commissioners must require providers to co-operate with the LETB in
planning the provision of, and in providing, the education and training
for healthcare workers. Who could disagree with the need for NHS
trusts, foundation trusts and other providers to be called to
co-operate with the LETBs. But why is this being done through the
commissioning process?</hs_para>

listened to Ministers, when asked to intervene in the NHS, say that it
is a matter for commissioners. I do not want to argue the ideology of
commissioning and providing, but I wonder whether that is the right
approach in this case. If one thinks of the challenges facing clinical
commissioning groups, with small staffs and little experience, can it
be expected that they can devote time to ensuring that providers
co-operate with each other and the LETBs over education and training?
Realistically, I suspect they will have very little time indeed.
Therefore, as a minimum the HEE should be required to give guidance on
how commissioners are to undertake that responsibility. More
substantively, why not lay a direct requirement in the Bill on NHS
foundation trusts and trusts on the face of the Bill to co-operate with
the LETBs? That would be a signal of intent that NHS bodies could not
ignore. I hope the noble Earl might be prepared to give that some
consideration.</hs_para>

amendments in the group concern the organisations that LETBs must
involve in preparing their education and training plan as set out in
Clause 93(4). Overall, this clause is welcome, but it could be improved
by my Amendment 49, which adds local authorities to the list. I am sure
that the noble Earl will argue that this is covered by Clause 93(4)(c),
specifying that health and well-being boards must be involved. However,
the importance of these plans goes wider than that. I am sure that the
local authority in general in the area of the LETB would have much to
offer.</hs_para>

seeks to have patients and carers involved. With all the debate about
whether professionals trained to work in the health service are really
ready to give clinical care—I go back to the debate we had
recently about healthcare support workers—surely patients should
have a place round the table, where decisions that have a crucial
bearing on patient outcomes are made. Very similar amendments and
arguments can be made in support of the amendments of my noble friend
Lord Turnberg and the noble Lord, Lord Patel, which I support. However,
I hope that the noble Earl will be able to come back positively on the
need of patients or carers to have a place and be involved when the
training plans of the LETB are being considered. I beg to

friend’s amendments, which would ensure that local authorities
and, in particular, patients and carers can be represented on the
LETBs. I have three amendments in the group. Amendment 38 adds to the
list of bodies from whom LETBs need to seek advice—namely, the
local university medical and nursing schools. I know it is hardly
likely that their advice will not be sought since they are so
intimately involved in delivering educational programmes, but in case
that message is not clear, we need to have it clarified somewhere in
the Bill. I recognise that there has not always been unlimited delight
felt by the trusts about the way the universities, particularly the
nursing schools, have provided education suiting their products to the
trusts’ needs. Nevertheless, it would be clearly wrong to ignore
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061036000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061036000008">Amendment
41 draws attention to the need to include postgraduate deans in the
local education and training boards’ activities. It surprises
me, to say the least, that the deans are not mentioned at all in the

oversight of education and training. I am sure they will be involved

Pitkeathley:</Member></B> I speak in support of Amendment 51
on the patient and carer voice. I know that there is sometimes
resistance to patient and carer representatives on bodies such as this.
One often hears professionals say, “They only speak from their
own experience”. Yes, they do speak from their own
experience—and that is actually the powerful and most
informative bit. That is not to say that patients and carers can only
speak from their own personal experience; they speak from the wider
experience too of other patients and carers with whom they are in
contact. That is the most important voice and we should give it a
hearing, because very often it is a way 
<?notus-xml column=1456?>of approaching a situation entirely differently from the way in which
the professionals would come at it. I am sure that there is a great
deal that most professionals, either trained or in the process of being
trained, could learn from

Cumberlege:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to say a word about these
issues. There is a danger, when we are setting up on the face of the
Bill, the component parts of something like the LETB boards. As I
understand it, the principle was that the majority of members of the
board are local providers. That seems sensible because clearly they are
the people who are going to have the knowledge and will inform the
LETBs. Simply adding new members, each with a representative function,
does not really aid the ability of a board to make decisions. It can
become less effective and efficient, purely due to the numbers of
people around the table.</hs_para>

of workers and, indeed, patients who have got a case, but there are
other ways of involving them. I very much accept what the noble Lord,
Lord Turnberg, said about having due regard to universities and deans
of medical schools. I am happy about the idea that one should have
regard to advice that has been given, but I am not sure about having
specific representatives that HEE decides are good for a local area on
the board. Some areas want to do it differently. To me, that is fine.
The size of the LETBs varies enormously; they can be the size of the
whole of the north-west and the whole of the south-west, yet Wessex and
Thames Valley are separate. These are to be local education and
training boards; they need the freedom and flexibility to reflect the
local area. Although I understand that people are anxious to ensure
that the LETBs are efficient and represent local areas, views and
constituent parts, it should be left to their flexibility and

education, but for the whole of health education. If Health Education
England is to be a body that influences education and training from the

next to Amendments 38, 41 and 50, as we have previously discussed, it
is important that Health Education England and the LETBs have access to

The postgraduate deans have great knowledge and expertise and, through
the local education and training boards, they are now an integral part
of the new system, working alongside other colleagues to strengthen the
multidisciplinary approach to planning and developing the workforce. It
is important to remember here that Health Education England and the

Turnberg:</Member></B> The problem is that I suspect there to be a
conflict. There is a desire to devolve responsibility for education to
local education and training boards, which are dominated, of course
quite reasonably, by local providers. Their desire is to see a trained
workforce in the right numbers, and they will be very interested in
workforce planning. There is also a drive at the centre to maintain
standards across the country, and so there is tension between the two.
The noble Earl set out a number of provisions which will help. The
amendments we put down were meant to strengthen that capacity in order
for the LETBs to inspire confidence

it will be mutually reinforcing. You will have accountabilities running

from the local to the national. In the past this has been a notoriously

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, that was a very useful

When looking back at the history of the NHS I remain concerned, as does
my noble friend, about failure to implement national strategies in
relation to the workforce. This is because decisions are being taken
locally which do not fit into the national strategy, particularly over
training commissions. This afternoon the noble Earl said that HEE has
enough powers to intervene if that were to happen. I think the question
is whether HEE has enough national leadership and confidence to
actually ensure that a national strategy is implemented. Of course, we
will have to

membership, I note the noble Earl’s statement about the number
of different professional groups that will have to be covered by LETBs,
which is why postgraduate deans are not listed on the face of the Bill.
I think that my noble friend really was persuasive on this point.
Doctors may not be the only profession, but they are a very important
profession. I would have thought it quite extraordinary not to have a
postgraduate dean among those around the table of the LETB. Equally, I
do not think that the patient advisory forum is sufficient at national
level. Considering the NHS record over the last few years, one of the
areas causing most concern has been whether trained staff are fit for
purpose when it comes to clinical areas. To have a representative of a
patient or carer around the table at a LETB would have been very
important. However, this has been a good debate, and I beg leave to
withdraw my

want to make one or two points by way of introduction. First, I would
be remiss not to say that the Royal College of Nursing has long called
for the mandatory registration and regulation of healthcare support
workers. The RCN believes that it is an important part of the
registration and regulation process because it has done a tremendous
amount of work in talking to both registered nurses and healthcare
support workers. It feels that this should be the way forward in the
interests of patient safety. However, disappointed as they have been
that we could not have regulation, they have moved on and are
sympathetic to the amendments that we have laid
down<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:39:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061040000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061040000014">Mention
was made of the disappearance from this setting of enrolled nurses. I
went back to look at the case that was made for that disappearance and
the end of enrolled nurse training. It happened because the enrolled
nurses were being abused and misused by being left in charge of wards
and being required to undertake tasks for which they had not been
trained or were not being supervised. I have to say that the various
skills currently being used by healthcare support workers far exceeds
the definition of basic skills. They are doing things that might
suggest that they are being abused and misused. I am sure that the
House will agree that we need to do something about the situation. The
Francis report requested that we look at the registration of support
workers.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061040000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061040000015">The
question of standards leads into the amendments that we have put down.
When a healthcare support worker is under the direction of a registered
nurse, that nurse is working to care standards that have been
determined by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. It seems sensible that
the skills for care should be linked to care standards so that the
registered nurse who delegates to the support worker can understand to
which standards that support worker has been trained as well as the
level of understanding that that support worker should have. I think
that I used this example before in a debate on the health Bill, but
instead of them just being taught how to carry out a skill such as
taking a blood pressure, they should also understand the side effects
of a raised or lowered blood pressure and what that means in terms of
reporting it to the person who has delegated the task.</hs_para>

Patel:</Member></B> My Lords, I have added my name to both these
amendments in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, and the
noble Lord, Lord Willis of Knaresborough, and I strongly support the
principles behind both. The key issue here is that a training
curriculum should be developed by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, as
the amendment says. In a way—to pre-empt the Minister regarding
what the Cavendish review might recommend—whatever the review
recommends will have to be taken on board by whoever develops the
curriculum. Although the Cavendish review is not defunct, the
principles of this amendment are not based on what it might say.
Presumably the review will focus on the necessity for training and the
kind of training that support and healthcare workers should have. These
amendments put a duty on Health Education England to make sure that a
curriculum is developed.</hs_para>

point is that the training should be mandatory—not the training
curriculum but the training—and the employers must ensure that
they employ only those who, having been trained, hold a certificate
showing that they have completed it. It is just the same as I would
have to do when seeking employment at a hospital. I would have to
produce a degree certificate from a university proving that I have been
trained as a doctor before they will employ me. It would be an offence
to do otherwise. The amendment does not provide for a penalty but that
issue will have 
<?notus-xml column=1463?>to be addressed. Although “register” might be the wrong
word, the implication is that the employer should be obliged to keep a
list of all the healthcare support workers in its employment who have
completed the mandatory training and hold a

training and the holding of a certificate are the key issues. As nobody
can be employed unless they have done that, the care for patients will
be safer. The process will define the competencies of these people. It
will define what further development they have to go through
professionally to be able to do other tasks. It will also make the life
of the supervisor easier as they will know what competencies these
people have and they will not delegate to them tasks which are beyond
their competencies. In that respect, these amendments fulfil all the
requirements that the Francis report and several other reports have
alluded to—the need to make sure that we have a fully trained
and competent workforce which delivers front-line healthcare. I hope

is well over 90. Somebody comes to see her in her home every
day—for the most part they are very nice young women—but
I have no idea where they come from or what training they have.
Amendment 23A would give me confidence that they have been trained and
are certificated. Furthermore, these people tend to be quite a mobile
population. If their certificates were to follow them from one
establishment to the next, it would give the next establishment
confidence that their training had been delivered to the right standard
and that, all other things being equal, it is appropriate to employ
them. That adds weight to Amendment
23A.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_10_PT_1/269B53A3E0950CDD8E8FAEE2981F969E798D5E54" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 June 2013">Monday,

Campbell-Savours:</Member></B> In speaking to a previous amendment, my
noble friend Lord Hunt produced the explanation, which I am sure is
true, that the reason that the Government are being tardy in the area
of registration, which is obviously linked to training, is money. I
argue that it is actually more costly not to act in this area than to
ignore the problems that inevitably arise where there is an untrained
workforce in an area where life and death are of critical importance. I
do not exaggerate.</hs_para>

think I have said before in health debates that I probably spend more
time in bed on hospital wards than a large number of noble Lords put
together. I have seen all kinds of things in hospitals over the years.
You never say a word because you are grateful that you are there. You
cannot complain. You watch. When you are an MP or a Member of this
place you 
<?notus-xml column=1464?>watch with a view to one day perhaps being able to raise what you have
seen in a forum where people might actually listen and deal with it.
There are many people who leave hospitals today and do not say a word.
If they are cured and feel better, they feel grateful, even though they
have seen things that they know are wrong.</hs_para>

argue that many of the problems that arise on hospital wards arise as a
result of insufficient training of healthcare assistants. They are in
the low-paid sector of the social care and the acute hospital worlds.
Many are on the national minimum wage. I will have to do a little more
work on vetting and barring. I must admit that I do not know a lot
about that. However, it seems to me that somehow people are allowed to
enter into this sector who should not be there. I have seen them at
work over the
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:51:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

hospital, but I remember being on a ward where they needed to put
strapping across my chest to do an ECG. It was around 1 am or 2 am. A
healthcare assistant brought five machines to my bed. The first four
machines all appeared not to work. The healthcare assistant then found
a junior doctor on the ward. It turned out that the healthcare
assistant just did not know how to use the ECG machines. They had not
been trained properly. Think of the loss of time involved; of my
frustration at 2 am, or whatever time it was—it is several years
back now—at having to wait while all this was going on. There
was also disruption for the patients in the beds to each side. They
could not sleep because of the commotion. They knew that something was
happening. The lights were off. There was only a light at the end of
the ward where the nurses sit. The curtains were pulled around the bed.
People kept going back and forth trying to find out why this piece of
equipment was not working. In the end the problem was
solved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:53:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

many areas not only in social care but also in the private social care
sector where little things that are of immense importance to
patients could be dealt with if only the healthcare
assistants available actually knew what they were doing
and understood the importance of what they were doing to an
individual patient. I shall refer to just a few of these
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. We have
heard of food out of reach. I have seen that repeatedly in hospitals. I
have seen it in other settings as well. An elderly person
may be trying to get hold of something but they cannot
communicate. They can only wait for someone to turn up. That person
will not be a nurse, because the nurses are invariably sitting behind a
desk trying to sort out the huge amount of paperwork that they
have to deal with, or a doctor, because the doctors
are running back and forth. Their problem may be
the jug of water, the uncomfortable bed, the extra pillow,
the extra blanket to keep warm, the dirt on the floor, the
fact that they have not been cleaned or, if they manage to
get to the toilet, the toilet not being properly cleaned.
Many people might say that that is down to ward management, but the
fact is that everyone on the ward is under pressure and very often it
is not the nurse or the ward leader who is held responsible, but the
poor young woman or man who is paid very little money who is taking the
brunt of the anger of the patient. I do not think that that is good 
<?notus-xml column=1465?>enough. I very strongly support these amendments as their purpose is to
tackle the problem of the quality of care that is given by people who
are hands-on in the

have talked about standards. I think that communication is extremely
important. I have been on wards where the patient could not talk to the
healthcare assistant because the healthcare assistant could not speak
English. Can you imagine the frustration of the ill patient who cannot
communicate with the healthcare worker because they do not understand
what the patient is saying? I think that it is essential that language,
and the ability to communicate through language, is a part of the
training programme, to ensure that we are not bringing in, particularly
from the banks and agencies, people who should not be on the ward. Some
of them are, in my view, a danger to
patients<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:56:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

should certainly be training for healthcare assistants in nutritional
requirements and why nutrition is important. As the noble Baroness,
Lady Emerton, said, it is necessary not just to say to someone that
this is what they must do; they must also understand why they are doing
it and the significance of that to the patient.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:58:22"></hs_TimeCode> should
also be training in ward hygiene and training in the use of equipment.
There should be training in how to take blood pressure. On one occasion
I had my blood pressure taken by a person who did not know where the
tube had to come out of the arm strap. I had to tell that person that
it was on the wrong way. I have been in Parliament; of course I could
tell them. What about the patients who do not know how to take blood
pressure and may well get a wrong reading? That must

should be training in the need to ensure that bedding is fresh and

on a hospital ward, as the Minister must know. However, it is very

There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:58:22"></hs_TimeCode> must also
be training in ward hygiene and in the standards required of a hospital

I do know about the speeches that she is giving in the House of
Commons, involving personal testimony coming in from all over the
country. She has read to the Commons from some of the letters she has
received—not hundreds but, as the Minister will be aware,
thousands—underlining all the complaints about the NHS. She has
almost become the national clearing house for complaints. Many of those
complaints are not about sophisticated areas of healthcare in
hospitals. They are about very elementary things with which, with a
little bit of thought, a healthcare assistant or a nurse could deal if
only they had been properly trained in that area.</hs_para>

unions, particularly Unison, have made their voice very clear on this

the position of the RCN. Most of the health service organisations want
it and many healthcare assistants recognise the value of it. The
Minister may not concede today but I plead with him to go back to his
department and tell some of the civil servants who work with him on
these matters that something has to change. I do not believe that this
sort of laissez-faire attitude to this sector of healthcare is the
answer. It is for Ministers in this Government to take action now and

perhaps poor protection for themselves. They also have varying access

it makes very good sense. I have one more example: in the interests of
more integrated health and social care, care assistants are often
required to support disabled or elderly people to access healthcare,
but they are not 
<?notus-xml column=1467?>very good at doing that. The confidential inquiry into the premature

I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, for setting out a
number of persuasive arguments for why there ought to be mandatory
training for health and care support workers. There 
<?notus-xml column=1468?>seems to be a general consensus around the House and no doubt the
Minister will agree with it. My reason for supporting the amendment is
that mandatory training is clearly very important, but it is inevitable
that if you have mandatory training you have regulation; the two run
together. Those who are proposing these amendments ought to recognise
that there is an inevitability that if you have training then you must
have a list of people who are trained; action has to be taken against
those people who have been trained but are then found to be unsafe in
dealing with vulnerable people; and there has to be a way of removing
them from the list of those who have been trained that has been
published. If you go down this route, one way or another you are
clearly signing up to mandatory regulation, and a jolly good thing

23A puts forward an eminently sensible suggestion for healthcare
support workers to be certified to show that they have been trained in
basic standards, with employers to register individuals who hold such

widely reported to be disappointed with the Government’s
response to his report, and it is not hard to see why. His report
commented on the absence of minimum standards in training and
competence. This is compounded by huge variations in the approach of
employers to job specifications, supervision and training requirements.

the mandate issued by the Secretary of State to Health Education
England that it is obliged to establish minimum training standards for
healthcare assistants by spring 2014. At this point, I ask the noble
Earl: how far does that go? Will it be mandatory for all entrants to
the role of healthcare assistant to undertake such training? If that is

whether prospective staff have undertaken the minimum training
requirement under the mandate? I come back to the point I made at the
beginning: if a list is established, would that, in essence, not amount
to a register? If there is such a list or register and it becomes clear
that a support worker is unsuitable to care for vulnerable people, is
there a way in which an organisation or employer could then apply to

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I first thank the noble Baroness, Lady
Emerton, for an interesting set of proposals and I am grateful for her
thoughtful introductory remarks. I agree that ensuring the capability
of the health and care support workforce is vital to delivering
high-quality care to patients and service users across both health and
social care settings. The issue is how we achieve this. Key
requirements for delivering high-quality care can best be achieved by
providers having the right processes in place to ensure they have the
right staff with the right skills and the right training to deliver the
right care in the right way to patients and service
users.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061040000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061040000051">The
idea of statutory requirements can seem an attractive means of ensuring
patient safety, yet Robert Francis’s report demonstrates amply
that this in itself does not prevent poor care. I confess that I was a
little surprised by the vehement support of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt,
for the idea of statutory regulation because it was an idea that his
Government resisted for some time. I suggest that they resisted it for
a number of reasons and they came to the conclusion that it is not as
self-evident as some like to make out. That is certainly this
Government’s position. This is not, as the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours, suggested, a laissez-faire attitude on the part of
the Government. As we made clear in <I>Patients First and Foremost</I>,
the initial response to the Francis inquiry, the Chief Inspector of
Hospitals will ensure that all hospitals act to make sure that all
healthcare assistants are properly trained and inducted before they
care for people. I suggest that this is an important step

capability of care assistants and public confidence in them are our key
concerns. Health Education England will work with employers to improve
the capability of care assistants, including those in the care sector.

That document set out how local areas can use existing structures such

the NHS, social care providers, education, housing services, public
health and others to make further steps towards integration. The
ambition here is to make joined-up and co-ordinated health and care the
norm. It works towards the first ever agreed definition of what people
say good integrated care and support looks and feels like. That will be

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the
European Scrutiny Committee for its thoughtful consideration of the
draft Council decision increasing the number of advocates-general at
the Court of Justice of the European Union from eight to 11. As
the House will be aware, this proposal is subject to the EU
Act 2011 and, before Ministers can take a position in
Council, parliamentary approval must be secured for the UK’s
position. That is the purpose of our debate
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061040000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061040000077">The
Lords European Union Committee has reported on this subject twice, in
2011 and again in April this year. An increase in the number of
advocates-general at the Court of Justice of the European Union will be
of benefit to British businesses, which will gain from the increased
capacity of the Court. The proposal is to increase the number of
advocates-general to nine from 1 July 2013 and to 11 from 7 October
2015. The first additional advocate-general will be a permanent Polish
advocate-general. Under Declaration 38 on Article 252 of the Treaty on
the Functioning of the European Union, member states agreed in 2007
that, if there was an increase in the number of advocates-general,
Poland would have a permanent advocate-general and no longer take part
in the rotation of advocates-general. This will bring Poland in to line
with the other “Big Six” member states, including the UK,
which all have permanent advocates-general. The other two additional
advocates-general will increase the existing rotation 
<?notus-xml column=1476?>system from three to five. Under the current arrangements, we expect
that the first two additional advocates-general appointed in October
2015 will be Czech and
Danish.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061040000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061040000078">The
Government believe that this reform will help to maximise the
efficiency of the Court and promote the effective passage of justice,
as it will allow the Court to increase the speed at which it handles
cases and improve the quality of its decision-making. However, more
efficient operation of the Court will require more than the appointment
of these three additional advocates-general to the Court of Justice.
Peers will already be familiar with the reforms that the Court has
introduced in the last two years, which include: increasing
the number of judges in the Grand Chamber from 13 to 15;
abolishing unnecessary procedural elements, such as the
requirement to read the report for the
hearing in full, and thus the need to produce the report; providing for
the appointment of temporary judges to the Civil Service Tribunal; and
establishing a new office of vice-president in the Court of Justice and
the General Court. Today’s debate focuses on the latest of these
wider reforms, but it will not be the
last.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061040000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061040000079">The
Government share the eagerness of the European Union Committee for the
question of additional judges at the General Court to be resolved.
Negotiations on that reform have been ongoing since March 2011 and
currently are at an impasse. In common with many other member states,
the UK had concerns about the proposals that have been made so far.
However, the Government are keen to work with other member states to
agree a way forward. With that in mind, we look forward to receiving
new proposals to consider. In addition to negotiations on extra judges
at the General Court, the Government will continue to work closely with
the Court, the Commission and other member states to identify and take
forward both long-term and short-term solutions to the General
Court’s backlog. We will continue to explore the full range of
options for structural reform to identify a solution that meets the
needs of all
concerned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061040000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061040000080">To
return to the specific issue today, the Government broadly support this
proposal. In particular, it meets three key goals of our policy towards
Court reform. Those goals are to promote the effective passage of
justice, for there to be a clear need for any reform, in this case the
additional advocates-general, and for costs to be contained. The role
of advocates-general is to produce non-legally binding opinions for the
Court of Justice to assist it in reaching its judgment. They do this in
more than 50% of cases, particularly in cases that raise a new point of
law. As there is no appeals process in the Court of Justice, their
additional reasoned submissions help the Court to provide effective
justice. As the number of cases before the Court of Justice continues
to rise, by 4.5% in 2012, the Government are satisfied that there is a
need for additional advocates-general to manage the workload of the
Court of Justice.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13061040000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061040000081">I turn now to the
particular issues that the EU Committee has raised with the Minister
for Europe: the timetable for appointments and Council decisions, and
funding. To take the timetable for appointments and Council decisions
first, the Court would like to have the first additional
advocate-general, the Polish 
<?notus-xml column=1477?>one, in post from 1 July 2013 and the other two from 7
October 2015, when there will be a partial replacement of the members
of the Court. Given that this request was made by the Court only on 16
January 2013, the 1 July date was always an ambitious
timetable for the first advocate-general. In addition to our
requirement for an affirmative debate in both Houses before Ministers
can take a position in Council, Poland also estimates that the
appointment process will take four months. However, the Government are
still hopeful that, if parliamentary approval is secured today in the
House of Lords and tomorrow in the House of Commons, the Council will
be able to approve the decision under the Irish presidency, which ends
at the end of June. If the 1 July deadline is missed, member states can
appoint the first advocate-general at any point from then onwards and
do not need to wait until October 2015. We know that the Court and
other member states are keen to have the Polish advocate-general in
post as soon as possible, so we anticipate that happening
quickly.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13061040000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061040000136">7.45

issue of funding, while broadly supporting this proposal, the
Government are clear that any additional advocates-general
should not result in an increase to the Court’s budget. We are
satisfied that the relatively small additional cost that the Court will
incur of around €4 million a year can be met from within its
existing budget—it was more than €354 million for
2013—which the Court has underspent in previous years. In the
current economic climate, there is an imperative on all the European
Union’s institutions to find ways to reduce their administrative
costs. The UK is not alone in expecting the Court to absorb the costs
of the additional advocates-general. During discussions on the annual
budgetary framework next year, when the decision on funding will be
taken, alongside like-minded member states we will press very firmly
for this to be met from within the Court’s existing
budget.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061040000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061040000083">I hope
that Peers will appreciate how keen the Government are to promote the
effective passage of justice at the Court and that they will agree with
the Government’s view that these additional advocates-general
will contribute to this aim and should be delivered without further
budget increase. I hope that today’s debate will provide Peers
with the opportunity to consider this proposal fully and that, having
done so, they will agree with the Government that the addition of three
advocates-general to the Court of Justice of the European Union is in
the UK’s interests. Before Ministers can vote in Council on this
issue, the Government need to secure parliamentary approval. As such,
this is a key element of improving trust in the decision-making process
between citizens, Parliament and Government, and so increasing the
democratic accountability of the European
Union.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_10_PT_1/22CE303AD24955A4B98FE3E5AEC232836AE67BA8" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 June 2013">Monday,

play an important part in complex cases, delivering a non-binding

that a report from an advocate-general was produced in about half the
cases brought to trial. It was a recommendation in the report that the

make pure efficiency hard to achieve. Tonight’s procedure under
the European Union Act 2011 does not exactly streamline the
decision-making process in EU matters. It was an Act strongly advocated
by some who are equally strong advocates for efficiency in the
decision-making process, so to obtain the best of both cannot always be
done in ways that are the most efficient. This is the price we pay for
justice and democracy, and a failure to appreciate this leads, I fear,

debate follows on from that on 23 July last year, under Section 10 of
the European Union Act 2011. It
requires a positive vote in both Houses before the Government can
support any decisions in council. In July last year, the House debated
a motion to approve amendments to the
statute of the Court of Justice of the European
Union and the appointment of temporary judges to
the Civil Service Tribunal. The Court of Justice, the
General Court and the Civil Service Tribunal, which together comprise
the Court of Justice of the European Union, play a fundamental role in
the effective functioning of the single market and the European Union.
The Court of Justice and the General Court rule in matters of freedom
of movement, of persons, goods and services, equal treatment and social
rights, fundamental rights, European citizenship and trademark and
competition cases. It therefore follows that their decisions have a
direct impact on the functioning and operation of the single market and
on the lives of the citizens of the European Union. So an efficient and

<?notus-xml column=1480?>in the French legal system. Although their opinions are not legally
binding, they tend to offer more comprehensive discussions of the EU
law governing each case than the judgments themselves. As the noble
Lord, Lord Bowness, said, in 2010 the EU Committee conducted an inquiry
under his chairmanship into the workload of the Court, prompted by
concerns about the Court’s ability to fulfil its functions
effectively and in a timely manner. It noted that the ratio of judges
to advocates-general was 15:8 in 2003, but 27:8 by 2011, following
enlargement of the European Union. The committee therefore recommended
that the number of advocates-general should be increased as soon as
possible in order for the Court to increase the speed with which cases
could be dealt with while improving the quality of
decision-making.</hs_para>

the committee was pleased to learn that the Court had requested an
increase in the number of advocates-general. It is proposed that the
first additional advocate-general would be appointed as soon as
possible this year, with the other two taking up their posts in October
2015. It was very gratifying to hear the Minister informing the House
that the Government were entirely happy with those proposals. The
appointment is a welcome step and it can be achieved without the
significant difficulties posed by treaty reform. It is to be hoped that
people in another place take the same view.</hs_para>

this opportunity to talk about the equally important issue of tackling
the backlog of cases in the General Court by increasing the number of
judges. In 2011, the committee commented on the backlog of cases and
delays in the General Court, and recommended that the number of judges
appointed to that court be increased by one-third. Indeed, some
organisations, such as the Confederation of British Industry, had
expressed concerns about delay and the effect on business within the
European Union. Shortly after the report was published, the Court asked
the Council to increase the number of judges by 12 which, in the view
of the president of the Court of Justice, was the only solution to
afford the necessary flexibility to tackle the increase in the number
of cases pending before the General Court and the time needed to deal
with them. During the debate on 23 July last year, the then Minister,

than three years, and if anyone wanted to find a way to be a model
chairman, they should follow
him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:02:02"></hs_TimeCode>. We have

acceptance by the Minister of our recommendation to increase
the number of advocates-general. Whatever one’s views about the
court’s broader role—it has been controversial and
previously I have made observations about its role and said that it
might have been on a mission to drive ever closer union and so
on—we know simply that we need a fully functioning Court of
Justice if we are to remain in the single market and if it is to be
effective. It is not just in the interests of some European ideal, it

the new area of the administration of justice, which has to take
priority because judgments have to made quickly, and, more broadly, the
court’s other cases and judgments that could be displaced.
Interesting figures are quoted in the report. Table 1 reveals that the
number of preliminary rulings that have come before the Court of
Justice concerning freedom, security and justice, was 17 in 2009, 38 in
2010, and 44 in 2011. That represents a considerable increase, both in
terms of numbers and proportion. If that were to continue, the

Minister admitted in his evidence that we really do not know the
potential. The figures are beginning to show, and I believe that they
will show, that as the Court of Justice increasingly becomes involved

Liddle:</Member></B> My Lords, this is the third debate in which I have
spoken on the European Court of Justice from the Opposition Front
Bench. We support the strengthening of the system; it is essential to
the effectiveness and quality of justice in the European Union. We seem
to be getting there at least step by step. The proposal for additional
advocates-general has our support. The idea that Poland should have a
permanent position seems to be in accord with the acceptance that that
country is one of the major member states of the Union. It grants
Poland the equality of status that it has long

the Government have moved to support this proposal. It shows that at
least they accept the pragmatism of the view of the noble Lord, Lord
Rowlands, whereby if you are going to have an effective single market
you have to have an effective

present tonight but who occupy the government Benches and talk about
renegotiating a relationship between Britain and the European Union,
which, in essence, boils down to free trade and political co-operation.
If that is the vision of the modern Conservative Party about
Britain’s relationship with the EU, it is not one in which you
would have this system of law which upholds the single market. We need
clarification from the Government as to what they envisage the role of
the system of law in the European Union to be. I very much hope that
what they are doing now, on a case-by-case basis, demonstrates that
they accept pooled sovereignty in areas where we have chosen to accept
it, and that part of this involves a form of supranational
decision-making and supranational law.</hs_para>

I support those noble Lords who have raised the question of why
progress is limited, so far, to the issue of additional judges for the
general court. That is clearly an important part of the
reform package. I listened very carefully to what the Minister said
about the Government broadly supporting this proposal. Do they support
it or do they not? Do they regard the requirement to keep within the
existing budget of the court as a binding constraint in all
circumstances, or do they not? Is it a binding constraint or is it not?
If they say it is a binding constraint, what efficiency proposals are
the Government putting forward to the court in order that the cost of
the additional judges could be met from within the budget?</hs_para>

what the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, said about not differentiating

efficiency of justice in terms of the single market, but also in terms
of the basic rights of European citizens. We welcome the limited steps
that have been taken. Of course, one should search for efficiency and
cost saving all the time, but can the Government give us an assurance

Patel:</Member></B> My Lords, one often feels during any legislation
that by the time it finishes the Minister—in this case, the
noble Earl—must wish that he had included in the Bill something
that he had forgotten. This amendment is it and I hope that he will see
it in 
<?notus-xml column=1486?>that light, particularly as continuing professional development was a
part of the original draft Care and Support Bill. However, it was taken
out of this Bill and I wonder why. I am sure that the Minister knows
why and will tell us. I feel that somehow the page got turned and it
was left out, rather than being deliberately not included. None the
less, I will make a case that it should be included because it is one
part of education that should be part of HEE and
LETBs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061047000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061047000023">The
amendment requires the local education and training boards to set out
in their education and training plans how they will support continuing
professional development. The NHS constitution commits all employers
supplying NHS-funded services to provide staff with personal
development and access to appropriate training for their jobs.
Continuing professional development is important for healthcare
professionals to maintain and improve their professional skills. While
you might go to medical school for five years and undertake
postgraduate study to be a specialist or a GP for six or seven years or
even longer, continuing professional development is for the rest of
your professional life. For many specialties, without continuing
professional development you cannot provide up-to-date
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061047000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061047000024">Continuing
professional development is particularly important for those working in
medicine but it is also important for all other clinicians. Doctors and
nurses need constantly to update their skills and keep abreast of the
latest developments. Good CPD is therefore vital for improving patient
care and spreading innovation throughout the NHS.</hs_para>

participation in CPD activities is a compulsory requirement for the
revalidation of doctors in order to demonstrate continuous fitness to
practice. In April 2013, the General Medical Council published the
results of a study that aimed to assess the impact of CPD on
doctors’ performance and patient and service outcomes. The study
underlined the importance of CPD in maintaining competence and
identified a lack of funding and a lack of allocated time as key
barriers to undertaking
CPD.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061047000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061047000026">CPD used
to be funded through the national multi-professional education and
training budget—I remember because I used to be given an annual
budget. If you did not spend it, initially you could not carry it over
but latterly you could. Lots of other doctors did not take advantage of
it, so those like me who did benefited even more. However, it is no
longer funded in that way. Currently, the funding is tight and there is
a risk that CPD funding for medicine and other clinicians will be cut
at the expense of other areas. The Council of Deans of Health, for
example, says that reductions in education and training budgets are
most likely to impact on CPD compared with other areas of education and
training.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061047000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061047000027">I
saw that as part of its strategic intent document, Health Education
England recently announced that it would ensure greater investment in
CPD for staff currently in post, but I feel that further clarification
is needed about what this will mean in practice. It is presently
unclear what level of funding is provided for CPD across the NHS. In
their response to the Future Forum report on developing the NHS

present CPD is a responsibility for healthcare providers, but there is
no requirement in the Bill on HEE or LETBs to support this or to
monitor how providers are supporting CPD. Again, the GMC-commissioned
report, <I>The </I><I>E</I><I>ffectiveness of C</I><I>ontinuing
Professional Development</I>, found that trusts varied from being
“generous” to “not interested” in providing
CPD opportunities for staff. While both Health Education England and
the local education and training boards have a clear role to support
training more broadly, it is unclear to me how they will currently
support CPD for all clinicians as distinct from other types of training
that apply to other healthcare workers. My amendment would therefore
place a clear requirement on local education and training boards to set
out how they would support CPD for clinical professions. I hope that
the Minister will find in favour of it, particularly as I feel it is
something that got left out, having been included in the original draft
Care and Support Bill. I beg to move.</hs_para>

Ribeiro:</Member></B> My Lords, following the disruption of medical
education that followed on from the MTAS debacle in 2007, one of the
outcomes, which was a positive one, was the development of schools of
surgery—a concept that we took on from the anaesthetists. This
required personnel from the Royal College of Surgeons and the deaneries
to take responsibility for the delivery and planning of training and
education. However, this was very much confined to trainees. There was
no requirement to extend it to consultants in terms of CPD.</hs_para>

that health education does not end with certification; it is a
continuum that occurs throughout one’s career as a professional
doctor. It is a requirement to keep up to date. It is a requirement by
the GMC to ensure that one knows what is happening within the wider
medical field. One of the problems for doctors is having the time to go
away and attend courses to improve one’s CPD. The amendment of
the noble Lord, Lord Patel, places an obligation on HEE and the LETBs
to support CPD and, in doing so, to allow the release of NHS staff, as
he quite rightly said, to attend courses and educational programmes. It
is also important to provide consultants and medical personnel of all
disciplines with the opportunity to work in the wider NHS. It has been
one of the basic tenets of the NHS that contributions in the wider NHS
benefit not only the NHS but the participants, who learn a lot more
about its workings. That, too, can improve and enhance one’s
continuing development.</hs_para>

welcome the suggestion made today several times by
speakers—certainly by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath,
in that he made reference to the Francis report. One thing that came
out of the Francis report was a clear statement that he would recommend
that the GMC and the royal colleges 
<?notus-xml column=1488?>work together in providing visits to educational centres. That was
stopped some time ago. I think that there is a real opportunity to
reintroduce that and I hope that the Minister, in responding, will
address that issue. Here again is an opportunity, because in the past
lessons were learnt by consultants visiting hospitals and looking at
the education provision.</hs_para>

peer groups in a hospital often helps to raise standards. Therefore,
not only would CPD provide another training opportunity for those who
participate but it would improve local education provision. The quality
assurance of the training it would provide would ensure that, in the
long term, patients benefited from such visits. For that, if nothing
else, I support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Patel. We need to
include something on continuing professional development because the
whole emphasis of HEE is very much on training and trainees and it has
very little to do with those who continue right through to
retirement.</hs_para>

Turnberg:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, strongly support the amendment
of the noble Lord, Lord Patel. Like him, I am concerned and rather
surprised that there is no mention in the Bill about the need for
trusts and other providers to support their staff in continuing
professional development. We really cannot afford to have any staff
working in front-line clinical services not keeping up to date when we
know that clinical practice changes rapidly from month to
month.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061047000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061047000034">New
tests, new diagnostic methods and new treatments are coming along fast
and furious. Unless members of staff are given the time and facilities
to keep abreast of all of those, we will get poorer and more
out-of-date care. As the noble Lord, Lord Patel, said, it is
unfortunately the case that when health budgets are stretched, as they
almost always are, CPD budgets are the first to go. Time off to attend
courses or to engage in appraisals disappears quickly, as everyone in
the service is rushed off their
feet.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061047000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061047000035">It is in
just those circumstances that a stand should be made. The amendment of
the noble Lord, Lord Patel, makes it clear that the LETBs must include
the need for employers to allow the time for CPD development of their
staff. How else will doctors, for example, be able to comply with the
mandatory requirement of the GMC to revalidate at regular intervals? We
have struggled both long and hard to get revalidation mandated and we
cannot afford to see it eroded now at the same time as the
responsibility for funding CPD is falling to employers. LETBs must be
given the teeth to insist that time and support for CPD are included in
their educational contracts with
trusts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061047000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061047000036"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Emerton" PimsId="3109" UID="13061047000163" xid="1211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0002.htm#13061047000163">Baroness
Emerton:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendment but I also
support what the noble Lord, Lord Patel, said, about CPD being extended
to other healthcare professionals. One thing that has emerged as a
barometer from the questionnaires is that, often, the culture of an
organisation is affected by the fact that there has been no appraisal
system and no continuing professional education built into the
programme for other healthcare professionals—nurses,
physiotherapists and radiographers. There is an important issue here:
all staff delivering care need to have regular appraisals and regular
updating of their continuing professional
education.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_10_PT_1/D50A0D948431F0E06ADB499482DE563C05B5F14F" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 June 2013">Monday,

amendment would ensure that the annual reports of LETBs specify how
they propose to support continuous professional development in that
area. We strongly support that. The amendment specifies the medical
professions, but it is applicable across the healthcare workforce. CPD
is about ensuring that structured learning continues throughout
one’s career, with clear objectives set and progress logged and
regularly reviewed. CPD complements formal training and enables
practitioners and other staff to acquire new knowledge and skills, as
well as to maintain and improve their standards across all areas of
their
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061047000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0003.htm#13061047000039">The

of course emphasis elsewhere in the document on the
workforce needing to be flexible and receptive to research and
innovation, but CPD is wider than just keeping up
to date and applies to values, behaviours and the ability to understand

It is worth going into the findings in a little more detail today. The
survey found that in the past 12 months almost a third of respondents
had received no CPD that was provided or paid for by their employer. By
sector, just a third of respondents in the NHS received no training in
the past 12 months, compared to just under a quarter of those working
in the independent

93 requires local education and training boards to publish an education
and training plan for each financial year. The education and training
plan must set out the local education and training board’s
proposed investment in its current and future workforce for the
following year. Note the word “current” in this context.
In developing an education and training plan, the Bill makes clear that
a local education and training board must consult with and have regard

to be taken locally. As I indicated, local providers and commissioners
are best placed to decide what ongoing professional development their

local education and training plan is developed. I have already spoken

have a clear responsibility to provide their staff with the support and
personal development they need, as well as access to appropriate
training to enable them to fulfil their duties. However, Health
Education England will play a crucial role in providing leadership in
supporting employers in this area. The mandate sets out that Health

ring-fenced budget for CPD, for the reasons we debated earlier: we are
clear that we must leave it to LETBs to exercise autonomy in the way
that they work out their local education and training plans. They will
have to prioritise, inevitably, in certain cases and from year to year.
It may be that they will have to make hard choices. The great thing
about Health Education England is that, as a non-departmental public
body separate from NHS England, it will have a dedicated budget which
cannot be eroded by those who might wish to siphon money off to patient
care, for example. I hope that, in that sense, the noble Lord, Lord

establishes a tariff-based system for funding clinical education and
training, whereby providers receive the same payment for the same
activity. This is intended to enable a national approach to the funding
of clinical payments and to provide for equality of treatment between
different providers. What the clause does not do is to provide for
equality of treatment between the public and private sectors. The noble

ways. It can be delivered onsite and on the job within the healthcare
or care setting. It can be delivered outside as part of a higher
education course. Who funds that will depend on the status of the
worker. If he or she is a healthcare worker, it is possible, as I said,
that they are funded by the NHS. It is also possible that he or she is
privately employed by the organisation concerned, and that organisation
will therefore fund the course of education. So it depends. I suggest
that in a care home it is more likely that the person would be
designated as a care worker rather than a healthcare worker if they do
not have a recognised qualification to their name. I do not think that
there is any generic answer to the noble Lord’s question. I hope

sought views on introducing a levy. Many respondents felt

consultation, to avoid any unintended consequences and that is the
approach we are taking. The NHS Future Forum expressed particular
concern about the impact of such a system on third sector and local

Campbell-Savours:</Member></B> I have one final question. How can a
person placing a relative in a care home know that the standard of care
provided in that home by presumably trained healthcare assistants will
be of a similar standard to that available under the arrangements
proposed in the Bill for those who work directly in the healthcare
sector of the National Health

Howe:</Member></B> The answer is twofold. First, the Care Quality
Commission inspects every care home to a uniform standard. One of its
duties is to ensure that the staff in a care home are sufficiently
capable and trained to deliver care in the right way to the patients
and service users who live there, taking into account the acuity of
need of those people. Secondly, as the noble Lord may be aware, the
Government have proposed that a system of star ratings should be
reintroduced for both healthcare settings and adult social care
settings. In that way the general public may have a much closer and
more detailed sense of the quality of care provided in the care home,
as assessed by the Care Quality Commission. Again, this is work in
progress. The Care Quality Commission is working out its methodologies
for delivering those star ratings, but if we get this right, I believe
it will take us several steps forward in transparency of quality and
the ability of members of the public to choose, in a much more
meaningful way, the setting that they wish to see either themselves or
their families benefiting

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, that has been extremely
useful. The intervention of my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours has
been particularly useful. Reading Clause 86 (5) together with Clause 93
and the interpretation in Clause 110, it becomes clear that many
nursing homes will receive some funding from the NHS in providing
continuing healthcare for some residents. That seems to me to be very
helpful indeed because, given that there is a great deal of concern
about the quality of staff in nursing homes and the training of those
staff, it gives local education and training boards a clear remit to
concern themselves with the staff in a lot of nursing homes in their
area. I hope that it will be possible for a message to be sent to
Health Education England from this debate that, if it is looking at the
most vulnerable areas in terms of vulnerable people, that ought to be
where the priority should be. My noble friend has teased out a very
important indicator of the way in which LETBs should work in future. I
hope we will see in their plans that a major effort will be devoted to
the staff in those

this. In practice, as he knows, most education and training take place
in the public sector, but we expect Health Education England and the
LETBs to seek advice from a range of stakeholders. Indeed, HEE has
reinforced the importance of this in the appointment criteria that it
has set for LETBs which state that they should demonstrate meaningful
collaborative working relationships with stakeholders, including third

but, in doing so, has to ensure that the publication of research
findings takes place fairly and frankly. I tabled the amendment because

discussions of witnesses in front of us, including the Minister, about
prescribing this requirement in primary legislation. Tucked away in the

pharmaceutical companies to take clinical trials away from the UK. That
was the implication, I think, of some of the remarks passed to the

happening with an anti-depressant called Seroxat, which was being given
to about half a million people a year. Some of the people taking higher
doses of the drug experienced suicidal feelings, and there were a
number of cases of younger patients committing suicide. There was
widespread concern among patient groups, and the MHRA had to launch a
review, which included a small subset of younger patients under 18, for
whom Seroxat was not licensed but for whom it was being prescribed by
doctors. At that time, about 8,000 young people a year were being
prescribed this drug, and the Committee on Safety of Medicines advised
me that children taking this drug were more likely to self-harm or have
suicidal thoughts. That finding was not then available to the
regulators, but the public fuss caused by the media caused the
company—and I want to mention it; it was GSK—to end up
passing the information in its files to the regulators in the UK,
Europe and the US. I took the view, in 2004, that there was a
respectable case for prosecuting GSK, because it had failed to inform
the MHRA in a timely fashion of the information on adverse reactions in
juveniles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:34:26"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:34:26"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:32:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061047000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0003.htm#13061047000090">The
whole affair limped on after my time as a Minister and became the
largest investigation of its kind. Over 1 million pages of evidence
were scrutinised, with GSK challenging matters all the way. Matters
were only concluded in March 2008 when the decision was taken not to
prosecute GSK, which received a slap on the wrist. The then MHRA chief
executive said in a press
release:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13061047000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0003.htm#13061047000143">“I

Turnberg:</Member></B> My Lords, the point of Amendment 63,
which is in my name, is the need for the HRA to emphasise transparency
in the reporting of clinical trials because patients and the public
must have confidence that research in which they have been involved
will be used in the best way to spread the message for the good of
other sufferers. They have to know that results, whether negative or
positive, are published. As my noble friend Lord Warner has said, it is
particularly important if they are negative, for at least two reasons.
First, it is to stop the unnecessary, wasteful repetition of the
research by others who are unaware that it has already been done.
Equally important is to prevent a bias in reports towards research that
shows only that a new drug works when other, unpublished, research
shows that it does not. This is particularly important when we consider
what is called meta-analysis, whereby an analysis is made of all
relevant published reports, brought together to provide a large
database on whether a drug works or does not. If only the positive
results are reported, we have a biased result at the end, which could
result in all sorts of problems.</hs_para>

data provides researchers with a much better picture of their field
than if research results are held too closely to the chest, perhaps by
researchers jealous of their findings or by drug companies fearful of
rivals gaining an advantage. It is heartening to know that GSK seems to
have learnt the lesson: it is the first pharmaceutical company to lead
the way in transparency. Members of the Association of Medical Research
Charities make it a condition of their grants that results are
published. We are pushing on an open door and we just need the HRA to
have some capacity to ensure transparency in NHS

63. It is right for my noble friends Lord Warner and Lord Turnberg and

recognise the vital importance of research and innovation to the NHS,
the very real progress that is being made in these areas and the scale

only promote and protect the interests of patients and the public in
health and social care research but ensure that it is 
<?notus-xml column=1501?>ethical and safe research, which inspires the public confidence that my
noble friend Lord Turnberg spoke about.</hs_para>

other bodies, the HRA has a key role in promoting transparency, and we
acknowledge that its recent guidance on how it will undertake this role
sets out important measures that will go some way towards underlining
that it takes its duty seriously. These include: gaining approval from
research ethics committees before clinical trials can go ahead; a new
timescale for registrations; the commitment to work with research
funders and sponsors to set the standards for the publication and
dissemination of research outcomes; taking steps to facilitate further
analysis of detailed data; and plans to look at how patient consent
forms can be amended to provide early consent and understanding on how

the HRA is committed to working with others to overcome barriers to
transparency and create a culture of openness. The amendment and
Amendment 63, which provide for the publication of research findings
“fairly and frankly” and transparency in the reporting of
clinical trials, would enshrine the HRA’s commitment in statute,
and ensure that clinical research benefits patients and that the
findings are available for others to learn and benefit from. As we have
heard from my noble friend Lord Turnberg, the advice of the Association
of Medical Research Charities to its members to ensure that there is a
requirement to publish in the terms and conditions of all their
research awards has played an important role in providing greater
transparency and would be reinforced by greater HRA authority in this

tolerate a short intervention. I was for 30 years a trustee of the

is, to some extent, a disparity of arms between the huge pharmaceutical
companies and the regulatory authorities. Frankly, I see no harm and
some potential good in the amendments to try to rectify the balance of
power and to avoid a repetition of the example given by the noble Lord,
Lord Warner, which is extremely sobering but by no means unique. A
number of instances that we confronted in the 1970s and 1980s mirrored

Campbell-Savours:</Member></B> My Lords, I want briefly to intervene
with a thought to which the Minister may have a response. When you have
medicines prescribed under the National Health Service—indeed,
when you buy medicines—there is a leaflet inside the package
setting out the need for the product and the circumstances in which it
can be taken. However, there is also a section that deals with risk. I
have often wondered whether that section on risk assessments, which
lays down varying levels of risk, dependent on the incidence of
conditions that might arise under use of the medicine, is based on the
original clinical trials carried out by the manufacturer. If it is, it
may well be that there is an argument for more frank information to be
made available. If the element of risk is linked to the original
research, it would obviously be very interesting to the wider public. I
wonder whether the Minister might be able to help us there. Is there a

speak not to this amendment but, as the Minister may recognise, on the
issue of human fertilisation. However, I am feeling drawn into the
argument. I find it difficult to agree with my noble friends on this
side of the House. The wording of the amendment would not really fulfil
the laudable purpose set out by my noble friends. There are many
examples where this information would be very important. The case of
Seroxat is a fine example of where there was a real need to have better
regulation of the negative results of a drug trial.</hs_para>

of relevance in the same sort of way. In the area of reproductive
medicine, for example, clomiphene citrate was first given as a
contraceptive. The surprise was that people got pregnant on it, so the
drug was shelved as a contraceptive. A great deal later, however, a
drug company suddenly recognised that it had something that might
stimulate pregnancy in women who had been infertile.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:45:18"></hs_TimeCode> problem is
that a drug company sponsors, pays for and organises research, so to
some extent it has a commercial value in that research. We have to
strike a very careful balance between when there is an important
commercial angle which requires proper legislation and, equally, when
there is a chance for drug companies to do a good job—as they
did eventually with clomiphene citrate when it was launched as one of
the most successful drugs in my area of medicine.</hs_para>

say to my noble friend that most of these clinical trials look at a
product which is being tried for a particular purpose. If that product
happens to fulfil some other purpose, a different set of issues arises.
Seroxat was actually trialled as an anti-depressant, but it failed that
test in so far as it was applied in a dangerous way to juveniles. The
information about it failing that test was concealed from the public
and the regulator. My wording might not be perfect but I am not arguing
for my wording. I am trying to get the Government to engage with the
issue so that they can find a wording that meets my
concerns—and, I suspect, those of my noble friend Lord

the HRA in ensuring proper transparency when there are downsides to
research. That is in no way stopping a pharmaceutical company from

I come to the answer to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord
Hunt, in debate on the previous group of amendments. Promoting
transparency in research is inextricably part of facilitating the
conduct of safe and ethical research, which is the Health Research
Authority’s main objective in Clause 97(2)(b). As Dr Wisely, the
Health Research Authority chief executive, said in evidence to the
Joint Committee which scrutinised the draft Bill, promoting
transparency is absolutely fundamental to protecting patients and the
public in health research. As a special health authority, the Health
Research Authority is already doing a number of things with regard to
transparency in research. First, research ethics committees already
consider an applicant’s proposals for the registration and
publication of research, for dissemination of its findings, including
to those who took part, and for making available any data or tissue
collected as part of the
research.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061047000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-0003.htm#13061047000112">Secondly,
since April 2013, the Health Research Authority has been undertaking
checks of research ethics committee applicants’ end-of-study
reports to see whether they registered and published research as they
declared they would to the ethics committee. Thirdly, as noble Lords
may be aware, the Health Research Authority recently published a
position statement setting out its plans for promoting transparency in
research. This statement has received widespread support from
stakeholders, including the AllTrials campaign, the James Lind

turn specifically to Amendment 63, which would specify that one way in
which the Health Research Authority, the bodies listed in Clause
98(1)—for example, the Human Tissue Authority—and the
devolved Administrations would be able to fulfil their respective
duties to co-operate would be through encouraging transparency in the
reporting of clinical trials results. The intention behind these duties
of co-operation is to encourage co-ordination and standardisation of
practice so as to streamline regulation and remove duplication. The aim
is that through these duties the people and bodies listed will work
collaboratively with the Health Research Authority to create a unified
approval process for research applications and to put in place
consistent and proportionate standards for compliance and inspection.

Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, asked about the patient information
leaflet that is now mandatory within packs of medicines. The risks that
are set out typically on the patient information leaflets can be
derived in several ways: first, from the original clinical trials
data—the noble Lord is quite right about that—but also
from any data that may have subsequently arisen from the reporting
system that exists. Pharmacovigilance legislation, which came into
force last year, now enables the Medicines and Health products
Regulatory Authority to require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report
safety and efficacy data where either concerns arise or where the
evidence for a medicine was perhaps less than it might have been in the
first instance. So transparency can be promoted in that sense as well.

pharmacovigilance responsibilities extremely

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 16
requires an independent review of average civil compensation for
mesothelioma cases, an annual reporting to Parliament and a review of
the payments made under the scheme. We know very little of how the
payment arrangements and levy amounts will work in practice and trust
that a draft at least of the regulations for payments under Clause 4
and the levy under Clause 13 will be available in good time before
Report. Can the Minister give us an assurance on this? We are grateful
for the additional documents covering these matters that were
circulated on Thursday, which do provide some additional analysis. It
is a pity, frankly, that we did not have sight of them in time for the
Committee session last
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:31:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306104000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#1306104000004">Although
the Minister told us that his negotiation had been about the levy rate,
it seems, inevitably, that payment amounts will be determined by the
tariff.  The levy rate will be set at a level that is
presumably estimated to be sufficient to meet the projected numbers of
those diagnosed and their age profile, together with admin and legal
costs. If this is the case, the computation of average civil
compensation is fundamental to payment levels and it is important that
compilation of the tariff is current, hence the call for an
independent, periodic review. The period between reviews might depend
on an interim uprating—perhaps based on CPI—and maybe the
Minister can tell us what is intended in that respect. Amounts payable
under the statutory schemes are in practice uprated on an annual basis.
We need to know more about the intent when the levy produces more, or
less, than is required to cover scheme payments and administration.
When it produces more, has the Minister’s negotiation focused on
this being used to 
<?notus-xml column=270?>enhance the percentage payout—to the extent that it is not
already 100%—or on it being carried forward to reduce the levy
in subsequent periods? What is the insurance industry’s
expectation of the position from the negotiations? Indeed, what is the
Treasury’s
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:33:12"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306104000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#1306104000005">Clearly,
to the extent that it has not already been achieved, we would expect to
see any surplus used to enhance payments. If levy shortfalls could be
borne, in whole or in part, by those diagnosed with mesothelioma, we
will resist this. What consideration has been given to the possible
avoidance of the levy by insurers, by bundling products and/or loading
premiums on other business lines such as public liability? The
additional information provided last week indicates a significant
change to the estimated amount of legal fees which the scheme will
fund. It reduces from £7,000 to £2,000, a benefit of
£5,000 per case for the insurers. What is the reason for that
reduction? It is also noted that the percentage of average civil
compensation taken is calculated before any benefit recovery, which
depresses the net amount received by claimants. Can the Minister let us
have a note of the overall savings to government from these
proposals—not only the estimated benefit recoveries but from not
having to make payments under the 1979 scheme in the first
instance?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306104000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#1306104000006">There
is much we need to know about these matters before we sign off the
Bill. As well as ensuring proper updating, will the Minister tell us
why the proposed percentage of civil compensation amounts payable under
the scheme has been reduced from the original impact assessment of, I
think, 76% to 70%? Which of the various averages or means from the
national institute’s calculations has been used to drive the
tariff in the new document, and
why<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:36:18"></hs_TimeCode>? The levy
rate for the first four years is calculated in that document at 2.61%
at the 70% payout rate. Is this consistent with an overall average of
2.24%, which is in the updated impact assessment? Further, the updated
impact assessment puts overall cost as a percentage of GWP at 2.74% for
the first four years. The current impact assessment, in a footnote,
suggests that this was due to basing the average only on settled and
withdrawn cases. Why is this, other than the fact that it is to the
advantage of the insurers? Our concern is that even in the past few
months the insurance sector has been chipping away at the scheme in
order to reduce its obligations. That is why we need to strengthen the
primary legislation. I beg to

were raised when we last met on Wednesday, to put noble Lords’
minds at rest and to aid today’s discussions. In the case of
people who contracted mesothelioma from exposure to asbestos fibres
that were on another person’s clothes, or were brought into the
household by other means, the question was raised whether these people,
too, were covered by employer’s liability. This is a complicated
area and I will do my best to be

cases of secondary exposure, the claim will be of negligence against
the person who exposed the primary victim. Theoretically, that person
could have public 
<?notus-xml column=271?>liability insurance, employer’s liability insurance, or both, or
none. We have contacted the ABI on this matter and I understand that it
is not aware of any cases where anyone other than the employee has been
compensated under the employer’s liability policy. Therefore, we
return to the point that the scheme will raise funds from the employer
liability market to cover those who would ordinarily have been covered
by those insurers. In this case, it seems that, historically, instances
of secondary exposure have not been covered by employer’s
liability insurance, so the scheme cannot provide for
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:38:06"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:38:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306104000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#1306104000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Howarth of Newport" PimsId="4870" UID="1306104000079" xid="1872" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#1306104000079">Lord
Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> I am extremely grateful to the
Minister for responding to the Committee on this point, which was the
subject of an amendment that I tabled. As I heard him just now, he said
that because historically no cases had turned up, in future
employer’s liability insurance should not cover secondary
exposure, even in a case where the secondary exposure occurred—I
hope he agrees with this; I think the Committee agrees—to
someone who did the family laundry and washed the overalls of the
employee who was exposed to asbestos fibres and who therefore found
herself exposed to asbestos and contracted the disease. Surely we
cannot simply extrapolate from  the past on the basis that
there do not happen to have been any such claims. It is entirely
imaginable that there could be such claims, and it is not enough, if I
may say so, for the Minister to say simply that because it has not
happened, the Government will make no provision for it to happen in
future. We still have a class of people whose predicament is just as
grave as the predicament of someone who was a direct employee. I hope

this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306104000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#1306104000010"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:40:00"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Moonie" PimsId="4889" UID="1306104000080" xid="1885" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#1306104000080">Lord

of the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock. When discussing the proposed
start date of eligibility for this scheme, we talked about insurers
being able to reserve against that liability from that date. The noble
Baroness drew attention to the fact that the levy will be an annual
running cost, not a liability to reserve against. She is of course
correct: the payment is not the same as a liability. However, the
impact is much the same. The levy is an additional cost to insurers
that needs to be factored into their business plans. To do this, they
need to have confidence in the timing and amount of the cost to be
incurred. Therefore, on 25 July 2012, when the intention to set up a
payments scheme was announced, this provided a sufficient level of
confidence for insurers to start to factor the levy into their business
plans for 2014. I ask the noble Baroness’s forgiveness for my
incorrect use of terms, and for her recognition that this does not
change the shape of things in this

and for any similar offences. However, can he reflect for a moment on
the consequences of the change? Although I confess to a tendency to
pedantry, on that occasion I do not think I was simply being pedantic.
I was trying 
<?notus-xml column=273?>to draw a distinction between whether the matter was a liability for
which the insurance company would wish to reserve or a running cost for
which it would have to plan, because I understood that the Minister had
used the fact that an insurance company would not be permitted to
reserve before a certain date as  an argument for why the
scheme could not start before 25 July. Had that been the case, I would
imagine that no such restraint would exist in the case of planning for
a payment. An insurance company can plan for a future level of running
costs based on its own judgment, not on any auditing limitations. Will
the Minister respond to

understand noble Lords’ wish to ensure that if we are to express
payment amounts in relation to civil damages, the data we hold on
average civil damages in mesothelioma cases should be current. However,
I must reject the proposal to require a yearly review on the grounds
that it would not be fruitful due to the volume of mesothelioma cases.
Reviewing civil cases on a yearly basis would be too frequent to show
any trends or changes in the awards. Indeed, the data that we hold on
the initial trawl for the period 2007 to 2012 show this. In this case,
it takes a bit longer for meaningful trends to
appear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:47:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306104000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#1306104000022">It
should also be said that gathering the data is pretty costly, and in
the interests of value for money we need to make sure that they are
gathered at intervals that allow us to identify change. One year is too
short a period for this, so a review of the data every five years is
more appropriate. If we were to accept the amendment, costs would be
incurred from gathering data on an annual basis, and further costs
would be involved through the requirement for these reviews to be
carried out by an independent body. As part of the monitoring planned,
civil compensation amounts in mesothelioma cases will be reviewed, but
there is no need for a separate body or for annual reports.
Furthermore, I can give my assurance that this area will not go
ignored.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306104000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#1306104000023">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:48:20"></hs_TimeCode>

to this and then ignore it. Far from it. Along with the monitoring of
data from civil cases that I have just mentioned, I can confirm for the
noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, that we intend to uprate the tariff on an
annual basis in line with the consumer prices index. The noble Lord
went on to put a vast  
<?notus-xml column=274?>number of specific questions to me, and we shall touch on quite a few of
them later. However, perhaps I may pick up the point about legal fees,
although we will deal with them in due course. A figure of
£7,000 was mentioned, and more recently £2,000 was
mentioned. In practice, it will probably come in at something in
between, but we will deal with fees in the fullness of

the purpose of the amendment was not as clear as it might have been and
the Government did not anticipate or expect that there would be an
annual updating of the civil compensation analysis. That would have to
be done periodically, and how often that would be done might be driven
in part by what is going to happen on annual uprating. The noble Lord
has reassured us that there will be an annual uprating of the starting
tariff by CPI. I think that is consistent with the statutory schemes at
the moment. I took it that he was also supportive of a periodic
updating of the data that underpin the tariff. I think that meets the

note that any over levy will accrue to the Consolidated Fund and make
the Treasury happy, I am sure. The noble Lord said that the move from
76% to 70% was driven by the assessment of whether amounts were going

providers. I take it from the impact assessment that it was to do with
quite what cases were included in the analysis and those that were
not<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. Perhaps I
need to look at the record and go back on that analysis. It seemed that
for no justifiable reason there has been a 6% reduction in the support
that is going to be available for those availing themselves of this
scheme, quite apart from the further loss, because of the change in the
support for legal costs. We will come on to these things later this

the Bill on Second Reading, he rather gave us to understand that the
Department for Work and Pensions and the Ministry of Justice were on
separate planets, and I think used the phrase that one was not beholden
to the other. Indeed, it appears that, within government, the left hand
is not at all clear what the right hand is doing and vice versa. It
should not be like that, of course. There is a principle of collective
responsibility in government. More importantly, it matters very much
that there should be coherent policy-making in the interests of
mesothelioma victims and their dependants. The way in which policy is
developed should not be for the convenience of Whitehall but should
have an unwavering focus on producing a scheme as soon as possible that
will in every dimension benefit mesothelioma

legal, and possibly other, costs associated with getting to the point
of making an application and then pursuing it are significant. The
impact assessment issued on 7 May—only last

overall would

told that the legal costs incurred by an applicant to the scheme, in
the event that he was successful, would be of the order of
£7,000. However, in the previous debate, my noble friend Lord
McKenzie drew to the Committee’s attention the new document
issued by the department on 4 June—less than a month after the
original impact assessment—which says that the published impact

have just talked about that, and I heard the Minister say that neither
the £7,000 figure nor the new £2,000 figure had much
solidity, and that it might end up somewhere in between. I would be
grateful if he could explain to us what is going on, because it seems
extraordinary that the assessment for an applicant making a successful
application to the scheme should be £7,000 in legal costs one

of magnitude and leaves one a little anxious about impact assessments.
I appreciate that they involve a whole mass of judgments and are very
difficult to achieve with any precision, but there is extraordinary
latitude here. Does the figure of £9,000 legal costs for an
unsuccessful application still stand? As I say, does the overall figure
that was given on 7 May still
stand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T15:58:38"></hs_TimeCode>? As we go

costs will a claimant incur and what legal costs will he or she be able
to recoup? I would be interested to know what happens about the
preliminary legal costs that a claimant will incur before he reaches
the door of the scheme. Following diagnosis, the claimant presumably
has to make an appointment to see a solicitor. I do not know how this
would work, but perhaps he would then be referred to a specialist
personal injury solicitor. A lot of work must be done to determine
whether a claim can be made against an employer or employer’s
insurer, and to test whether that claim is strong enough to proceed in
court. All these hoops must be gone through before the claimant is able
to embark upon a claim against the scheme. Could the Minister in his
response kindly escort the Committee along the path a claimant must
take in legal consultation and legal process on his way to the scheme
and to the completion of an application to it? We would then know much
more about what the reality will be for

17 is intended to provide the Committee with an opportunity to probe
this whole area. I have some specific questions, too. What will be
covered by the fixed legal fees envisaged by the Minister at the
Ministry of Justice, Mrs Helen Grant, in her Written Ministerial
Statement on 18 December last year? It would be helpful to know exactly
what that scheme of fixed fees will cover and what the foreseeable
amounts might be. I would like to know—maybe the Minister has
told us this, but it would be helpful if he put it clearly on
record—whether the scheme will pay the lawyers directly, in the
same sort of way in which the scheme will pay any social
security recoveries to 
<?notus-xml column=277?>the compensation recovery unit; or will the scheme pay the claimant, who
then has to pay out legal costs from the sum he receives and himself
make payment to the lawyers whose bills have to be met? However the
legal costs are paid, whether they are paid by the scheme directly or
by the claimant to the lawyers, will they be over and above the scheme
award, or will the scheme award, already massively discounted at 70%,
be further discounted by legal costs on top of the DWP recoveries? If
the legal costs also have to be met out of the sum paid at typically
70% of what a court award might have been, this scheme begins to look
pretty
threadbare.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061019000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061019000006">Amendment
28 refers to the situation in which someone appeals to the First-tier
Tribunal against an award made by the scheme. The cost of advice
associated with taking that step would not necessarily be only legal
costs, but there could be legal costs. I know that the
Government’s position is that they do not provide legal aid to
support appellants to the First-tier Tribunal, but it is fanciful to
suppose that tribunal procedures are simple, user friendly, easily
accessible or easy to handle for people who want to refer their case to
one, as if it were some simple matter of dispensing justice under the
spreading oak tree. If the Minister doubts this, I recommend he looks
at the Sir Henry Hodge memorial lecture given in 2011 by the noble and
learned Baroness, Lady Hale, Justice of the Supreme Court, in which she
explained very clearly and compellingly, in the context of the
proposals put forward by the Ministry of Justice in the LASPO Act, that
if you remove legal aid from people seeking to bring their case to a
tribunal you expose them to procedures that are complex, difficult and
daunting.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061019000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061019000007">I do

payments under that scheme may be of the order of 70% of what claimants
might have got in the courts, different considerations apply. I hope it

years; it is now three years since the noble Lord rightly, following
the impetus already established when my noble friend Lord McKenzie was

concerns civil cases and the information that has been provided to us
in the tariff about the awards. Is it net or gross, and does it include
the legal costs? Have they been excluded from the awards or do they
come on top? If they are on top, we need to know what kind of money has
been paid to lawyers when a claimant has been awarded in order to be
able to judge whether the figures in the documentation before us are
accurate. I had always assumed that the impact assessment would provide
accurate information, so I was rather stunned to realise that the
figures of £7,000 for a successful applicant, £9,000 for
an unsuccessful applicant downgraded to £2,000, is something of
a leap. If you are a sufferer or the relative of a sufferer, engaging a
lawyer to do the preliminary work that is necessary to undertake this
sort of action presents some sort of risk if the application fails. I
want to explore that area as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T16:12:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

gives an estimate of unsuccessful legal fees as £3 million out
of a total of £24 million. A rough division shows that one case
in every eight is unsuccessful, so if you are the one person out of the
eight, presumably in a civil case action you are going to have to find
those fees, unless of course you can find a no-win no-fee lawyer. I
raised this issue at Second Reading. It seems that if you were about to
embark upon this legal route, unless there is some form of support
guaranteed at the end of it it would be the no-win no-fee lawyer to
whom you would have to turn. I would be grateful if my noble friend

that requires a lawyer is quite substantial. Having now had the benefit
of seeing the draft rules for the scheme, Part 1 paragraph 2 lists the
evidence that an applicant may be required to provide. It is quite
substantial and includes the history of employment and the companies to
which the applicant is referring. In civil cases the courts have made
it clear that you have to prove negligence, and three tests are given
in the Appeal Court judgment. Three measures have to be satisfied in
order to prove negligence.

group, about which I can be brief. Before speaking to it, I will say
that I support the thrust of the amendments moved by my noble friend
Lord Howarth and the questions posed by the noble Lord, Lord German.
Specifically, the amendment seeks to ensure that the definition of the
costs of the diffuse mesothelioma payment scheme includes legal costs
incurred by a person bringing proceedings, including appeal costs, and
in particular that it covers the costs of proceedings brought as a
consequence of Clause 10. Where Clause 10 proceedings are facilitated,
can the Minister confirm that the financial help referred to will cover
the legal costs of proceedings, including appeal costs? How is the
funding for this to be organised? Presumably it will come from the levy
but, like other amounts in respect of legal costs, not in a way that
reduces the tariff amount. I will not probe further the issue of the
reduction in estimated legal costs as the Minister has enough queries
about that already. However, I look forward to the

fees to be paid by the scheme without limit. Amendment 17, tabled by

costs incurred either through applying to the scheme or through
bringing proceedings against an employer or insurer. The noble Lord,
Lord Howarth, has also tabled Amendment 28 to cover the cost of legal

question about the level of information that is required, the
eligibility criteria are specified in Clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill. The
scheme is not a no-fault scheme, so the applicant will be required to
establish the eligibility criteria. However, they are in practice much
simpler and more straightforward than in a civil claim. Rather than go

reasons for wanting to set a fixed amount of legal costs that can be
recovered by lawyers are threefold. First, it is important that
applicants are not charged unreasonable or disproportionate legal costs
by their lawyers, as we have seen happen in other instances. Any legal
work would be in respect of an application to a statutory scheme, which
is non-contentious and much quicker and simpler than civil litigation.
Secondly, we hope that fixed costs will deter scheme applicants being
pressured into entering no-win no-fee agreements, potentially reducing
the amount of scheme payment paid in respect of their disease. Thirdly,
it is important that the scheme is not overburdened with high legal
costs, which would raise the levy and jeopardise the scheme in its
entirety.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061019000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061019000021">In
respect of any legal costs associated with appealing to the First-tier

incentive for anyone who was unsuccessful in receiving a scheme payment

requiring the levy to be set higher. Any significant increase in costs

will be no legal aid for appeals to the First-tier Tribunal following
the review scheme decision unless exceptionally it is necessary to make
legal aid available to avoid a breach of an individual’s rights

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I should explain that this
amendment was tabled before we had a chance to peruse a draft of the
scheme rules, but there are some issues still worth pursuing. It is a
probing amendment and is, I hope, precisely focused for the benefit of
my noble friend. Clause 4(3)(a) states that the scheme may make
payments “subject to conditions”, and paragraph (b)
gives,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13061037000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061037000079">“the

conditions to
impose”.</hs_quotefo><hs_para UID="13061037000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061037000002">To
the extent that these conditions are to be covered in the scheme rules
and that those scheme rules are to be subject to some parliamentary
process, we are perhaps more relaxed about the position. However,
paragraph (b) appears to give a wide discretion to the administrator,
which is likely to be an arm of the insurance industry. The draft
scheme rules throw some light on this by identifying that the
conditions that might be imposed include requiring that a trust be
established and that a deputy or guardian be appointed. The draft rules
also authorise the meeting of costs to this end by the administrator.
The thrust of this seems  
<?notus-xml column=284?>to be a concern in situations relating to the capacity or legal
competency of the claimant or a dependant. However, there is nothing
that requires the imposition of conditions to be for the benefit of the
applicant or dependants rather than that of the levy
payers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061037000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061037000003">A key
point in the draft rules is that conditions can be imposed to ensure
that that payment is used for the benefit of the applicant. That
requirement does not appear in primary legislation. There would be
merit in it doing so to tie down this potentially wide discretion. I
await the Minister’s response on that. We might return to this
quite narrow point on Report to embed the concept that is in the draft
rules, which we have now seen, into primary legislation. I beg to

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to reinforce the
points made by my noble friend Lord McKenzie. It is easier to
understand what lies behind Clause 4(3) now that we have the draft
scheme rules. To understand the Government’s thinking one has to
read that subsection along with Rules 15 and 16(3)(e)—I
think—and presumably also the review provisions and the appeal
provisions that will apply all the way back to any conditions that may
be imposed, set out in Rule 19 and those following it. It is by no
stretch of the imagination straightforward to determine what exactly
the combination of this provision and the rules will mean in practice.
I have just a couple of specific questions, which I hope are relatively
simple.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061037000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061037000005">The
primary legislation, if enacted, will allow conditions to be imposed on
any payment. There appears to be no limit to the conditions that can be
imposed. The rules, to some degree, limit them. Rule 15, in particular,
says that this rule—that is, the decision to impose conditions
on making a payment—applies when the scheme administrator first
decides to make a payment under the scheme but considers that there is
good reason to impose one or more conditions in making a payment in
order to ensure that the payment is used for the benefit of the
applicant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T16:35:11"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T16:35:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061037000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061037000006">The
next paragraph, paragraph 2, says that the scheme administrator may
impose such conditions as it considers appropriate. We appear to go
back into a very broad power immediately after a limiting power. It is
not clear to me that the limitation in the first part of that rule
applies to the second part of that rule. If it is intended to do so,
clarification from the Minister might be of some
assistance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T16:35:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061037000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061037000007">I
reinforce the point made by my noble friend Lord McKenzie that if that
restriction on making conditions is to apply to all conditions, it
would be better for that restriction to be reflected in the primary
legislation rather than in the rules. There is at least one possible
interpretation of this at the moment—I have not had time to work
out all the possible interpretations—that is, that the power to
make the rules requires the scheme administrator to come to the view
that rules are necessary to ensure that the payment is used for the
benefit of the applicant. Once they pass that hurdle, the administrator
can make any rule that it considers appropriate. It is not clear that
all rules have to pass the test of being rules made to ensure that the
payment is used for the benefit of the applicant. That is intended, but
it would be helpful if that was
clear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T16:36:52"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T16:36:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, I fully recognise that Amendment 19 is a
probing amendment that would remove the possibility of the scheme
making payments subject to conditions. It would therefore have the
consequence that the recipient of a scheme payment would have full

me make the purpose of this part of the clause absolutely clear. In
general, we fully expect that most scheme payments will be made to the
applicant. This is for vulnerable people who might be mentally
incapable of handling their own finances or who are unable to look
after their own welfare by attending to basic financial transactions
that adults normally carry out for themselves. It is important,
therefore, that in those sorts of cases the scheme administrator is
able to subject some payments to certain safeguards, such as how a
scheme payment is to be used, and to decide when such conditions should
be imposed.</hs_para>

thing on which we are all agreed in this Committee is that we want to
avoid the recipient of a scheme payment having unsupervised control
over the use of a large sum of money if they are incapable of managing
such a sum. However, a number of valuable points are being made about
the interplay between primary legislation and regulations, which we
will take away and consider. Clearly, the rules are in draft and we

reasonably be applied to payments from the

1 deals with these matters, but it is a prime candidate for the plain
English prize for legislative opacity. It was beyond my wit to amend it
for the purposes I had in mind. Therefore, I tabled the amendments to
Clause 4 to establish some principles to constrain and guide the
Secretary of State—and, in the case of Amendment 26, to provide
him with an opportunity not to take away too much with one hand while
he, or rather the insurance industry, gives with the other. I
emphasise, as is the nature of amendments to the Bill, that we are
talking only of the application of these proposed measures to the
diffuse mesothelioma payments scheme or other schemes that might be set

<?notus-xml column=287?>up under this legislation. I am not, needless to say, seeking to rewrite
social security law; the Minister need not fear that that the ground
will give way under his feet if he is willing to take an accommodating
view of some of these amendments. It is an opportunity for the Minister
to explain—relatively fully, I hope—what the spirit and
practice will be of his department’s approach to recovery of
benefits and lump-sum payments in these
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T16:45:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

at any rate, that we all—I believe I can include the
Minister—want to apply: the rules and the practice where the
social security benefit arrangements and the scheme interact ought to
be as generous as possible. That is more particularly the case in the
situation in which the full, insured entitlements which a claimant
ought to have have proved impossible to obtain because the documents
are not there: a situation in which claimants have had to fight and
wait for financial relief; and in which, when that relief then comes,
it is discounted by 30% from the payments they might have secured from
a civil court action. Of course, that discount of 30% might become less
if Parliament in due course agrees with every noble Lord who spoke in
our debate last week on Amendments 15 and 18 on whether the 70% measure
should be raised.</hs_para>

that there is a deficit. He will not quite put it like this: that the
further the Chancellor’s financial strategy goes astray, the
more imperative it is that no opportunity is lost to reduce the deficit
between what the Government raise and what they spend. In response, I
say that, of all members of society, mesothelioma sufferers and their
families should least be required to shoulder the burden of deficit
reduction. On any reasonable scale of values, they surely should have
priority for relatively generous treatment—before, for example,
affluent individuals who can still get top-rate tax relief at 40% on
their pension

payments from the scheme made on account of pain and suffering. This
goes with the grain of DWP practice; indeed, it might even be in the
law that the compensation recovery unit does not recover the element of
an award made by a court that is in respect of pain and suffering, in

and therefore that the capital will, or should, apply to the whole of
the payment, and that the compensation recovery unit, which henceforth

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, I am strongly in favour of
the principle that informs the amendments in this group, which has been
set out in such detail by my noble friend Lord Howarth of Newport. At
Second Reading, the Minister in explaining—and, I dare say, in
justifying—the part of the Bill that allows for the recovery of
benefits, relied on the principle, with which we all agree, that nobody
should be compensated twice. However, until then he had explained in
some detail, in order to explain the 70% of average as a payment to
mesothelioma sufferers and to defend it against the argument that it
was insufficient, that we were dealing not with a compensation scheme
at all but with a payments scheme. As I pointed out strongly in my
contribution at Second Reading, it is inconsistent to have the same two
arguments in relation to the same legislation. Either this is a
compensation scheme or it is a payment
scheme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T16:59:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Howarth of Newport, in trying to devise a justification or a reason for
this, was being generous to the Government. He has observed from a
sedentary position that he did not mean to be; I know that, but he was.
This is a payment scheme until we come to compensation recovery,
because if it were a compensation scheme, all the justifications for
averaging and for taking percentages of averages would fall away. They
would be intellectually incapable of being defended. However, one comes
to the point at which it is clear that the Treasury wants to try to
recover some of this money as if it was compensation, so it has to
become compensation or quasi-compensation to justify that. One can then
deploy the high-minded principle that no one should be compensated
twice for the same loss. I have some sympathy for the Minister in
having to ride these two horses, and I hope that he is not torn apart
by them. However, as I said at Second Reading and as someone once said
to me when I was a Minister, if you cannot ride two horses at once, you
should not be in the

is what lies at the heart of this issue. The justification for
recovering benefits paid to people through the compensation recovery
process is not because people cannot be compensated twice, it is just
because the money is there and it can be recovered. It is because it
can be done. To some degree, given that the Treasury has inadvertently
been subsidising the insurance industry through a genuine compensation
scheme in the past, perhaps there is some justification for trying to
get some of the money back, and of course we are living in difficult
financial times. I understand 
<?notus-xml column=291?>that, but I would like the Minister to explain in simple terms why this
is being done rather than by seeking some justification in the

Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997, as now amended, and in a
variety of subsequent Acts of Parliament. It applies throughout the
United Kingdom. I was not present for the earlier debate about the
calculation of the average that would inform the payment, but there are
substantial differences between awards for mesothelioma in Scotland as
opposed to the rest of the United Kingdom. The Scottish courts are much
more generous to mesothelioma sufferers than are the English courts and
award substantially more in damages. However, compensation recovery law
is consistent throughout the United

were to be accepted, my noble friend Lord Howarth would have created a
device to defeat the Government’s ability to recover
compensation at all by designating all payments as being for pain and
suffering, and through the second of the two amendments would discount
all payments for pain and suffering from recovery. He is wise to do
this because that is the way the Act operates at the moment. However,
thanks to some of my colleagues in the legal profession in Scotland, I
have a pretty exhaustive list of all the heads of damages litigation
that are not offsetable in relation to benefits. The list is the best
part of half a page long. I will spare noble Lords the whole list, but
it moves from pain and suffering to loss of future earnings, and it
goes into some detail. All of them are component elements that one
would look at if one were calculating the level of compensation payment

thing about this list is that it lies behind all the settlements that
form the history of the settlements that in turn have informed the
average, from which the Government will take the 70%. They are not
irrelevant to the calculation of the payment that will be made; they
are at the heart of it. If the payments were made through a court
process of compensation, a very small number would allow for benefit
recovery: substantially, they would not allow it. There is a lot to be
said for treating these payments, which are informed in that way, in
the same way as one would treat compensation. Not the least that can be
said in favour of that proposition is the fact that the Government
cannot justify recovering any benefits unless they can use the word
“compensation” against the

will make a final point to the Minister that is not reflected in an

If, having gone through a process of looking at historical settlements
and averaging them one is then justified in making a payment that is
70% of that average, why is one justified in taking 100% of the
benefits of that 70% settlement? Why do we not at least restrict the

principle, we should seek from the Bill a scheme that will place
claimants in the same position as they would have been had they
received compensation in the normal manner, notwithstanding the fact,
as my noble friend outlined, that it is a payments scheme. This
position is fettered in two key respects. First, average compensation
in age bands is used as a proxy for actual compensation. We accept this
as a practical matter. Secondly, only a percentage—70% is the
figure that is currently suggested—of relevant average
compensation will be used. We strenuously reject this and will continue

benefit recovery, we do not challenge the current broad approach in the
benefits system, although there is always scope for a review to see how
it is working in practice. However, I suggest that any change should
not be fundamentally a matter for the Bill. However, neither should we
see it as a mechanism to redress any shortfall in the payments scheme.
That should be addressed by paying at 100%. To do otherwise would
relieve insurers of their obligations and impose a cost on the state.
However, it is absolutely right, if our benchmark is normal
compensation arrangements, to ensure that a scheme payment should
attract no greater benefit recovery than a payment received as
compensation. If our benchmark is 100% payment, we would not want to
see any compensation recovery that was greater than it would be with a

key difference is that a scheme payment, absent my noble

recoverable in respect of the 1979 and 2008 Acts, it is understood that
there is no difference between the payment scheme and normal
compensation, although if paid at less than 100% there might in
extremis be a shortfall for a scheme payment. The recovery of other
benefits is more convoluted, and a whole range of benefits are
potentially recoverable. The rules were helpfully summarised in the

the insurers in how they allocate payments. I am bound to say that I

is a further issue. Again, I am grateful for a note from the officials
on this. I just want to press a point of principle to clarify the
situation. If the scheme payment was 100% for pain and suffering, would
the compensation recovery work as follows? If the scheme payment was
£100,000, the claimant received IIDB of £10,000, and a
2008 scheme payment £10,000, the benefits of IIDB could not be
recovered from payments for pain and suffering but the 2008 scheme
lumps could be, so the outcome would be that the claimant received
£90,000—that is, the £100,000 scheme payment minus
the £10,000 deduction for the lump sum—but the cost to
the scheme administrator would be £110,000: the £20,000
to DWP and the £90,000 to the claimant. In those circumstances,
the claimant actually meets more than the gross cost of the scheme
payment. I do not know the extent to which that is factored into the
noble Lord’s calculations. It seems that we need clarity about
how this will all work. We would be reluctant to go down the path of
tweaking the benefit recovery as a means of letting insurers off the
hook. It is their obligation to pay 100% compensation. If we do
otherwise, we in effect ask the state to meet that shortfall, when
insurers should be doing

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for these
amendments. Clearly, the general intention behind them is to place
restrictions on the ability of the Secretary of State to recover both
social security benefits and existing lump-sum payments made in
accordance with the 1979 and 2008 Acts. This would then prevent the
scheme administrator from reducing scheme payments to offset the cost
of repaying recoverable benefits and lump sums to the Secretary of
State. Actually, it may be the case that two of the amendments would
restrict the scheme administrator from seeking repayment where sums
were paid incorrectly due to error, mistake, misrepresentation or
fraud. Clearly, where a scheme payment is falsely claimed it is only
right that it should be repaid. Broadly, we think—as the noble
Lord pointed out in his cogent remarks—that the amendments are
aimed at restricting the recovery of benefits from scheme
payments.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13061037000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061037000089">5.15

deal with the issue of compensation, which reminds me of my classes in
Wittgenstein and the meaning of words? The payments scheme is not a 
<?notus-xml column=294?>compensation scheme in the sense that the Government are not accepting
any liability for the damage caused and it is not replacing civil
litigation. However, one uses the expression that one gets something
for or in compensation, in a non-legal sense, for having had this
dreadful disease. So I do not think it is helpful to play with the
words under the recovery of benefits legislation. Where a person makes
any payment to or in respect of another in consequence of any accident,
injury or disease, he is required to pay the Secretary of State any
recoverable social benefit and lump-sum payments. That recovery would
apply if the person made a goodwill payment to another after an
accident.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061037000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061037000050">The
other clarification that it might be worth making upfront concerns the
point touched on by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie. Treating a payment
as being made on account of pain and suffering will not have the effect
that I believe the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, looked to achieve.
Payments determined as such are still subject to recovery of the 1979
and 2008 schemes. That payment would be exempt from the recovery of
other benefits such as CSA but, bluntly, these payments are generally
much smaller. The relatively larger proportion of the payments to be
recovered—in other words, the scheme payments—would still
be recoverable. So I do not think this is a particularly fruitful route
for the noble Lord to
pursue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061037000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061037000051">I will
have to write to him on the relative sizes of the schemes. Clearly, it
is by much the larger amount and, given the regrettably short life
expectancy of victims, it becomes even more the case that the amount
received by the actual victim is likely to be predominantly in that
category, but I will write with better
figures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061037000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061037000052">I am
not making here a point about the position of the country and the
deficit and all that. That is not relevant here. The point about this
is that a person should not receive money twice in respect of the same
injury or disease, for example once by the benefits system and secondly
through civil compensation. That is a long-standing point. It dates
back at least as far as the pre-1948 workers’ compensation
system, where injured workers had to elect either to sue their employer
in tort or claim workers’ compensation: they could not receive
both. That principle was carried forward and evolved into legislation
after 1948, creating a benefit recovery mechanism which is the basis
for what we have today in the 1997 Act.</hs_para>

should apply to scheme payments because, if the scheme administrator
was not required to repay recoverable social security benefits and lump
sums when they made a scheme payment, this would mean that others, who
paid compensation or made similar but perhaps lower payments in respect
of personal injuries, were treated less favourably. Clearly that would
be unjust.</hs_para>

recovery legislation, a person who makes a payment, whether that is
compensation or any other form of payment made in cash—for
instance, goodwill—to or in respect of another, in consequence
of any accident, injury or disease suffered by the other, is required
to pay the Secretary of State any recoverable social benefits and
lump-sum payments. He is required to pay the Secretary of State,
whether or not he can deduct the full amount of the benefits 
<?notus-xml column=295?>and lump-sum payments from the payment made to the injured party. It
cannot matter how the scheme payment is defined, it is still a payment
made by one person to another in respect of a disease suffered by the
other so compensation recovery legislation applies. Similarly, if the
payment was paid out of a trust then a payment would still have to be
made and so compensation recovery legislation would
apply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061037000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061037000055">Accordingly,
in relation to scheme payments, if the scheme administrator does not
have the opportunity to reduce the scheme payment to offset any amounts
they are required to repay the Secretary of State, in the same way as
others who make personal injury payments may do so, this would mean the
costs to the scheme’s funds would be increased correspondingly.
This is because the scheme administrator would have to not only pay the
full value of a scheme payment but also repay the Secretary of State an
amount equivalent to any monies the applicant had received for their
mesothelioma by way of recoverable state benefits and lump
sums.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061037000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061037000056">Unlike
compensation, scheme payments will not be made up of an amount for pain
and suffering and an amount for pecuniary losses. The payments will be
set according to a fixed tariff and paid at a flat rate based on the
age of the person with mesothelioma. If scheme payments were to be made
by calculating specific heads of damages in each individual case, it
would add to the complexity of administering the scheme both for
individual applicants, who would have to go to the trouble and expense
of proving the extent of their actual loss, and for the scheme
administrator. This would clearly delay payments to people when they
are most needed. As the scheme payment is tariff based, the whole
amount is available for compensation
recovery.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061037000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061037000057">Even
if a proportion of the scheme payment was to be ring-fenced for pain

assessment, with the assumption of an average benefit recovery of

reality is that, of course, in practical terms, the payments in the
scheme we are introducing dwarf any other payments that have already
been made and any of the lump-sum and other benefit payments. They
absolutely dwarf them, given that typical payments under the 2008 Act

wind up his remarks. Can he confirm that if one is dealing with
benefits, not lump sums, a scheme payment can only be reduced to offset
amounts to be repaid to the Secretary of State where the scheme payment
and the benefit are both paid to meet the same need? As the scheme
payment is not allocated to meet any particular needs to do with
mobility, the cost of care, loss of earnings or pain and suffering, it

payments, but they would have to be specifically for mesothelioma. I do

get it precisely right for the noble Lord.</hs_para>

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
friends Lord Browne of Ladyton and Lord McKenzie of Luton, and the
noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for participating in the debate and for the
excellent points that they have made. I will study with great care what
the Minister has said and see whether I can elicit from his words a
clear and acceptable set of principles that the department will apply
here. He seemed to say that nothing must shake or disturb the existing
ways of doing things, and I am not in the least bit surprised that he
has said, in his characteristically courteous way, that my amendments
are variously defective, subversive or would create chaos. I am an 
<?notus-xml column=297?>amateur in these matters and I have simply sought to raise the pertinent
issues. Merely because my amendments may not stand up to the rigorous
scrutiny of this Committee does not mean to say that the issues are not
very important and worthy of continuing consideration as we reach the
later stages of this legislation.</hs_para>

Minister that the term “compensation” is a pretty
slippery and rather sloppy one. It becomes a fairly sickly euphemism,
not least in the context in which it is often used, where it refers to
bankers’ compensation. Those are remuneration packages worth
many millions of pounds, and one wonders what the bankers are being
compensated for, other than the opprobrium in which they are held in
society. I am with him in being cautious about the use of the term
“compensation”. However, as my noble friend Lord McKenzie
indicated, there may be difficulties in the Government seeking to have
it both ways. We should consider further whether the normal rules that
apply to compensation recovery, which are entirely legitimate and we do
not challenge, can actually be laid over this particular scheme with
its very distinctive circumstances.</hs_para>

lines of what the Minister has said and from his tone that he wants to
be as flexible, constructive and generous as he can be. In that case,
we should certainly look further at the use of the mechanism of trusts.
I completely accept that we should not take a sledgehammer to crack a
nut and that it would not be sensible or appropriate to drive a coach
and horses through the existing provisions of trust law in relation to
social security benefits. However, it may be possible to harness those
provisions to provide slightly more extensive alleviation. Whether, for
example, the scheme might be able to provide a hand-out package, which
is a trust ready for use that it would be easy for people to pick up
and use, I do not know.</hs_para>

talking of people who will be very ill and of family members in
extremely difficult circumstances. We are talking of people who have no
background in their personal lives of using sophisticated financial and
legal instruments. It would be not unreasonable, considering that the
sums at issue are very small indeed in terms of the department’s
budget but very significant for these households. I hope that the
Minister would be willing to look a little more at that.</hs_para>

that people should not receive the same money twice in respect of the
same injury or disease, which is the principle that the Minister put
forward. However, we have to consider whether that is actually what
would happen if we mitigated to some extent the recovery regime, given
that it is very hard to determine what they are receiving the money
for—these generalised, lump-sum payments—and that we know
that they are receiving significantly less than they would receive from
court awards. As my noble friend Lord Browne of Ladyton asked, why is
it right to take 100% of 70%? It is not self-evidently right; indeed, I
am strongly disposed to think that it is wrong. I tend to agree with my
noble friend Lord McKenzie on two of his points. We should seek to
place recipients in the 
<?notus-xml column=298?>same situation as if they had received court awards. I also agree with
him that we should not favour the insurers against the state.</hs_para>

Minister told us that the assumption on which he is working is that the
average recovery of benefits would be some £20,000 out of an
average payment of £87,000. That is getting on for a quarter of
the payment. It is a very significant factor for the sufferers and
their families. We have more work to do on this but it has been a
useful preliminary scouting of the issues. On that basis, I beg leave

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving Amendment 29, I
will also speak to Amendment 30. Clause 7 provides for the Secretary of
State to administer the payment scheme or to make arrangements for a
body to administer the scheme. The arrangements can allow the body to
arrange for somebody else to administer the scheme or any part of it.
Amendment 29 would ensure that any further delegation which is
permitted has the approval of the Secretary of State. This is a
straightforward issue. Administering the scheme is an important
undertaking, and the Secretary of State should be satisfied that those
involved are fit for purpose.</hs_para>

Minister will say that the Secretary of State should not have to be
bothered if somebody is appointed to administer, say, a routine part of
the scheme such as the processing of payments. However, as it stands,
an appointed body would appear to be able to cause the whole of the
operation practice to be transferred to somebody without any recourse
to the Secretary of State. Our concerns in this matter might be negated
if we knew what arrangements the Minister envisages for membership of
any company or other body which it is expected will run the scheme. We
know the insurance industry view but, by now, the Government must have
arrangements in mind. Perhaps the Minister will share these.</hs_para>

Amendment 30, which requires the administering body to be constituted
from members who are demonstrably independent of any active insurers.
As levy payers, clearly they have an interest in the numbers and the
profile of successful claims. The 
<?notus-xml column=299?>Minister may again say that they may also have an interest in helping
people bring proceedings against individual insurers. That may be so,
but it does not negate the fact that active insurers have a direct
financial interest in the outcome of the
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061044000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000014">Of
course, it is accepted that claimants have a right of appeal, but we
have already touched on the costs and time of this, and it is not a
sufficient answer. In the draft scheme rules it does not appear that
there is a requirement for any specific insurance expertise to be
brought to bear—or, if there is, it does not seem to be the

Irrespective of the background of the scheme administrator, the body

that the administrator is sufficiently tied to a set of rules as
determined by the Secretary of State and not by the insurance industry.

Minister’s response. He said that it might be quicker to get

administrator is of some concern and clearly it is one of the things
that have prompted the amendment. I can reassure the noble Lord that
whoever the Secretary of State makes arrangements with to administer
the scheme will be bound by agreements to comply with the scheme rules
and departmental standards of implementation and administration.
However, I am attracted to the idea of having some oversight of the
scheme set out more formally. We could, for example, put something
about reviewing and monitoring the scheme in the scheme rules and set
this out in more detail in the arrangements for the scheme
administration. I am minded to do more work on this to consider further
whether we should bring forward an amendment on oversight of the
scheme. I am not able to agree to the amendment today because I need to
do the work first, but I would be grateful if I could consult the noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie, and get his wisdom on this. I shall then come back
to noble Lords at a later stage. On that basis, I urge him to withdraw

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak also to
Amendments 34, 35 and 44 in this group. Clause 10 gives the power to
the scheme administrator to help a person bring proceedings. However,
this is only the case where a payment is first made under the scheme.
Under Clause 2(1)(c), eligibility for the scheme depends on a person
not bringing or being unable to bring an action against a negligent
employer or insurer. Perhaps the Minister would expand on the
circumstances envisaged where a payment has been made but proceedings
may now be possible. Is it to do with the subsequent discovery of the
possibility of proceedings in light of new information? Why is there
the requirement that a payment be made before these provisions
apply?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061044000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000041">On
Amendment 35, the Bill suggests an enabling power for the administrator
to help a person bring proceedings. Our amendment requires the
administrator to give this help, provided they have the agreement of
the claimant. In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T17:50:17"></hs_TimeCode>
pressing the point, we are mindful of the prospect of the insurance
sector itself running the scheme, and thus of potential conflicts of
interest. Where proceedings are possible that might garner a higher
reward for the claimant, then, unless the claimant stipulates
otherwise, that help must be provided. I accept that it may be
necessary to stop any spurious or vexatious requirements by claimants,
but that could be built into any

proceedings in question can be brought against an employer for
negligence or breach of statutory duty, or against an insurance
company. Amendment 34 includes those against whom proceedings might be
taken, such as the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. I am bound
to say that this is rather a tentative amendment, but it is understood
that the FSCS compensates those covered by insolvent insurers. However,
perhaps that is what the Minister has in mind in Clause
10(5<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T17:50:46"></hs_TimeCode>).</hs_para>

group addresses a different point. It requires the arrangements for
establishing a technical committee to be in accordance with
regulations; that is, that the committee should be subject to a

Freud:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord and the noble Baroness, Lady
Sherlock, for these amendments. Amendments 33 and 35 cover the scheme
administrator’s ability to help a person bring relevant
proceedings through the courts. The amendments allow the scheme
administrator to help a person bring relevant proceedings against
particular employers or insurers whether or not a scheme payment has
been made. They also provide that the Secretary of State’s
scheme rules may 
<?notus-xml column=304?>include the circumstances where the scheme administrator is required to

bringing relevant proceedings will benefit both the applicant and the
scheme by allowing a scheme payment to be recovered from an award of
civil damages, it is right that the scheme should be allowed to help a
person bring relevant proceedings. We want to allow flexibility in the
scheme so that the scheme administrator can decide, based on an
individual’s circumstances, whether it is in the interests both
of that person and of the scheme to help that person bring proceedings.
We want to avoid inflexibility where a scheme administrator is obliged
to help a person bring proceedings with that person’s consent.
It is also not appropriate for the scheme administrator to use scheme
funds to bring proceedings where the scheme may not benefit from such
action.</hs_para>

scheme administrator to help someone bring a claim against the
Financial Services Compensation Scheme where they have already received
a scheme payment. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme makes
compensation payments when insurers are insolvent. In cases prior to
1972, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme will pay compensation
only where both the employer and the employer’s liability
insurer are insolvent. Where both an employer and insurer are
insolvent, a person may also be eligible for a payment under the Bill.
So it is possible for a scheme payment to be made where a person may
also be eligible for compensation from the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme. If a scheme payment has already been made and it
is subsequently established that a Financial Services Compensation
Scheme payment can be made, it could be in the interests of the scheme
to help a person make an application for an FSCS payment so that the
scheme payment can be recovered from the FSCS
payment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061044000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000047">This

regulations will be needed for the Secretary of State’s
arrangements with a body to establish a technical committee. The
committee will make decisions on questions arising between a potential
claimant and an insurer as to whether an employer maintained
employer’s liability insurance with that insurer at a particular
time. The technical committee is separate from the scheme and will
decide an issue prior to any application being made for a scheme
payment. The scheme may in fact never be involved with some cases, if
insurance cover can be determined by the committee. The committee is
therefore still essentially determining a private dispute between two
parties, albeit facilitated by legislation, and is not directly making
any decision about the allocation of public money to individuals. For
that reason, it is appropriate that it will be outside government and
that it should be set up under non-statutory arrangements.</hs_para>

this. In moving Amendment 36, I will speak to the other amendments in
this group; namely, Amendments 37, 38 and 39. I have raised the issue
with the Bill team, so this is an opportunity to put something on the

2 precludes an individual from claiming benefits under the 1979 and
2008 state compensation schemes if an application is made under the
mesothelioma scheme provided for in the Bill. Equivalent exclusions are
added to the parallel Northern Ireland legislation. This probing
amendment simply adds the word “successful” to the
reference to “application”. As it stands, if somebody
should apply to the mesothelioma payment scheme unsuccessfully,
Schedule 2 would seemingly prevent access to the 1979 or 2008 statutory

Freud:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord and the noble Baroness for
these amendments, which I understand are probing amendments. I am
hopeful that I can give complete satisfaction on the matter. The
intention of these amendments is to enable a person to apply for a
payment under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers’ Compensation)
Act 1979, or under the corresponding legislation in Northern Ireland,
after they have made an application for a scheme payment but before a
scheme payment is made or where the application is
unsuccessful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061044000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000055">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T17:59:42"></hs_TimeCode>

person has not brought any action or compromised any claim for damages
in respect of a disablement, for example by issuing proceedings against
a negligent employer or insurer, or by settling a potential claim out
of court. The provisions of Schedule 2, which these proposals would
amend, ensure that people who apply to the scheme and those who bring
an action or claim for damages are treated equally under the 1979 Act.
If a person is prevented from claiming under the 1979 legislation
because they have made an application to the diffuse mesothelioma
payments scheme, instead they may still be able to claim under the 2008
diffuse mesothelioma schemes established under Part 4 of the Child
Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 and the corresponding Northern
Ireland legislation.</hs_para>

they could use the 2008 Act which would provide them with exactly the
same financial outcome. They would not be prevented by the 1979 Act

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I am again grateful to the
Minister. I accept from what he has said that there is a route to at
least the equivalent, even if the 1979 Act would be barred under these
circumstances. I am a bit less clear as to why the 1979 provisions

accept entirely that compensation under that scheme is currently paid
at the same rate as the 1979 scheme, but that was not always the
case—certainly not in the early years of the scheme. I do not
think there is anything that technically links the two to require each
to be paid at the same rate. Although people will currently be able to
put themselves in the same position as if they could have claimed under
the 1979 Act, I am not convinced that that would inevitably be the case
if the route is to have to look at the 2008 Act. However, perhaps we
can reflect on the Minister’s 
<?notus-xml column=307?>response and return to this at a later stage; or maybe we could have
some more detailed, technical discussions on this before the Report
stage so as to make sure that we understand precisely why the 1979
scheme cannot be amended as suggested. In the mean time, however, I beg
leave to withdraw the amendment.</hs_para>

perhaps I should say that they would clarify what has already been
hinted at and may already be in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:03:37"></hs_TimeCode>. Amendment
40 would empower the Secretary of State to levy employers’
liability insurers in order to fund additional schemes comparable to
the diffuse mesothelioma payment scheme. Amendment 45 would empower the
Secretary of State to establish by regulation other schemes in relation
to long-latency, asbestos-related
diseases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:04:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the department has just produced a document entitled, <I>Estimates of
the Impact of Extending the Scope of the Payment Scheme in the
Mesothelioma Bill to Include Other Asbestos-Related Diseases and Other
Non-Asbestos Work Related</I> <I>Diseases</I>. It expects that there
will be some 2,000 asbestos-related lung 
<?notus-xml column=308?>cancer deaths yearly, 725 newly assessed cases of asbestosis and 821
cases of non-malignant pleural disease—around 3,500 cases a year
of one sort or another. The department acknowledges that it may be more
difficult to establish a causal occupational link where these other
diseases are concerned and estimates that the levy on insurers to fund
a scheme for asbestos-related diseases other than mesothelioma, if the
new scheme were to be constituted on the same principle as the DMPS,
would amount to £478 million compared with the £322
million cost of the levy for the mesothelioma scheme. That is a
significantly larger cost than that of the mesothelioma scheme, but I
think it is not impossible to contemplate at some point in the future.
I certainly do not think that new schemes should be funded via the DMPS
itself, nor do I think that anybody is in a position to create a new
scheme immediately. However, it should be done in the fullness of
time—indeed, as soon as possible. Therefore, while we are
legislating to provide the basis for the diffuse mesothelioma payment
scheme, it seems sensible that we should also be clear that we are
legislating to make provision for further analogous schemes to be
established on future occasions. I beg to

James of Blackheath:</Member></B> I think it will be harder to make
progress without the Minister. It seems to me that three very
significant problems are emerging in any dialogue with the MoD at
present, and they will not go away very easily. Each of them has been
shadowed in the discussions this afternoon. For a start, of course,
this is a compensation payment for a dying sailor. There is no argument
about it. There is no way you can call it anything else. We are here
talking of it not being a compensation payment and this gives rise to a
total misunderstanding in the minds of the MoD people to whom I have
been talking because they seem to think that what we have here is a
great big government-funded handout that they can dip their hands in
and have a share for their
sailors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061044000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000066">Of
course, the downside is that in saying no to them, we run the risk that
this clever and inspired programme to force the compensation programme
through for non-compensation payments will invite the dreadful
comparison that the Government, who are concerned to prepare catch-up
payments to all the sufferers of this disease for whom they can, should
include responsibility for the Navy, which has deliberately discarded
any responsibility for payments for people who are suffering
similarly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:10:11"></hs_TimeCode>. I

understand that if it wants a solution to this problem, that must come
out of its own resources. It cannot come from this scheme. When I first
realised this, simply on the grounds that I did not know the answer I
tabled my strange Amendment

problems with the MoD. First, it will have a hugely high percentage of
what I call the household contamination problem. The sailors and
workers will have gone home at night to their wives with their dirty
washing from working in the boiler rooms of the intensely
asbestos-lagged warships. We are going to have a huge problem of a

cannot run an insurance industry-based solution because it cannot
insure its ships or people; that has to come from a different pot and a
different source. It is absolutely unacceptable that we do not have a
solution for the sailors in parallel with this, but it is not going to
be compatible with this Bill. Forgive me for having put the clause in,
which is completely wrong and irrelevant, but it really is a desperate

to get the MoD really interested in this is to threaten to write to the

speeches which have just been made, not least because I agree with the
noble Lord, Lord James, that there are other groups of people outside
the scope of this Bill who are clearly looking to the Minister, who has
done such a good job for this group of people: the 300 or so of the
2,200 who have unmet claims. He has done such a good job in dealing
with this that there is the raised hope and expectation that other
groups, whether they are in our Armed Forces or other groups
entirely—such as those who have suffered from asbestos-related
diseases of the kind to which the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, referred in
his remarks—who will also be hoping that the noble Lord will in
due course be able to come forward with other measures that might to
meet some of those hopes and expectations.</hs_para>

with the Minister in this situation. I think it was William Wilberforce
who was criticised by William Hazlitt for not dealing with problems of
children who were being sent down into the mines; it would take Lord
Shaftesbury to do that in due course. One of those who was defending
Wilberforce, I think it was Henry Thornton, said it was rather like
criticising Christopher Columbus for discovering the United States but
also for not going on to discover Australia and New Zealand as well.
The Minister is in that slightly invidious position at the 
<?notus-xml column=310?>moment. People will unfairly criticise him for not solving all the
problems of the whole of mankind. What he is doing in the context of
this Bill is incredibly noteworthy and all of us pay tribute to him for
that. However, he should not neglect the points made by the two noble
Lords, because they were well made and these amendments raise the point

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, our Amendment 46
is in this group. I will say at the start that I thoroughly support the
amendments of my noble friend Lord Howarth. I agree with the noble
Lord, Lord Alton, that the Minister has almost made a rod for his own
back in raising hopes and expectations. Those are challenges that he
will have to face, and I am sure he is well up to the task. The noble
Lord, Lord James, should not apologise for having brought forward his
amendment. He is right to say that what he seeks is not an
insurance-based solution, but there are issues around inviting
comparisons with the progress that has been
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061044000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000076">As we
have discussed, the payments scheme relates to those diagnosed with
diffuse mesothelioma. It therefore excludes other asbestos-related
diseases such as asbestos-related lung cancer and asbestosis. It also
excludes other work-related, non-asbestos diseases such as
pneuomoconiosis. The DWP’s June 2013 analysis quotes the HSE
data on industrial diseases, which has an annual estimate of sufferers
of asbestos-related diseases of some 3,500—that excludes those
suffering from mesothelioma—and of non-asbestos-related
industrial diseases of some 4,200. Many of these will face the same
problem in identifying a negligent employer, or an employer liability
insurer. The DWP’s June note acknowledges that many of the
diseases covered do not share the same characteristics as mesothelioma,
and that their severity and progression may vary, depending on the
heaviness of exposure to
asbestos.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061044000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000077">It
also highlights the fact that, for example, only a small proportion of
asbestos-related lung cancers are compensated through government
schemes, because of the range of different causes of lung cancer that
mask an asbestos cause. Notwithstanding this, and perhaps somewhat
strangely, in computing the effect of extending the scheme, it has been
assumed in the data that the same proportion of those with diffuse
mesothelioma who can access the scheme proposed by the Bill will be
able to access an extended scheme, that the same level of scheme
payment will be received, and that the same amount of benefit will be
recovered. Those are fairly broad-brush assumptions, to say the least.
In resisting the amendment, the Minister will doubtless point to the
costs of bringing forward an extension of the scheme. On the basis of
their estimates over a 10-year period, they suggest that there will be
5,100 successful applicants for other asbestos-related 
<?notus-xml column=311?>diseases, and 6,100 non-asbestos work-related diseases. There will be an
additional levy on insurers of £478 million and
£564 million
respectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061044000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000078">At
face value, the figures are shocking. It is not so much the amounts as
the suggestion that over 10 years, some 11,200 people will
miss out. By how much will depend on benefit recovery arrangements, but
they could miss out to the tune of £1 billion. If the
concentration were just on the other asbestos-related diseases, not
expanding the scheme will deny 5,100 people, who will miss out just
because an employer has gone out of business or cannot be located and a
relevant insurer cannot be
established.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061044000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000079">The
amendment requires the Secretary of State to bring forward proposals
within a year to establish other schemes to cover these other diseases.
On reflection, limiting this to diseases covered by the 1979 Act may
not be the most appropriate approach, and we might seek a different
definition on Report. We have been clear that we do not want the
pursuit of broader coverage to hold up the scheme of diffuse
mesothelioma, and there is no reason why acceptance of the amendment,
or my noble friend’s variations, should cause this to happen. It
is accepted that it will be difficult to graft on to the mesothelioma
scheme the tariff approach, given the varying degrees of suffering that
some of the other diseases entail, and that there may be convoluted
issues around causation. Therefore, while continuing to acknowledge the
merits of the mesothelioma scheme, we should no longer look aside from
those people—many thousands on the Government’s own
figures—who face terrible suffering because of the negligence or
breach of statutory duty of an employer. This is all the more important
where access to the state lump sum and social security support is more
difficult, as it is for
some.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061044000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000080">The

is strictly related to mesothelioma. However, like many noble Lords, I
hope that the momentum generated by this legislation will not dissipate

<?notus-xml column=312?>and that further work will be done in the future. Perhaps I may explain
why we cannot be flexible on this. I should start by reminding noble
Lords about the distinctive characteristics of mesothelioma. The Bill
allows for a relatively straightforward and quick scheme to be
established. The key points are mesothelioma’s undeniable link
to asbestos exposure and lack of co-causality with other factors such
as smoking. The unique elements of diffuse mesothelioma allow us to
establish a tariff payment scheme of this nature. A streamlined scheme
like this would not work for other long-tail diseases. The law of
causation is favourable to mesothelioma victims in the sense that it is
an indivisible injury. It does not matter who exposed the victim or how
many people exposed him, they will all be jointly and severally liable
for the same damage. This allows for simplicity when assessing whether
someone is eligible for a payment. Assessing liability for other
diseases where the causation rules are not the same would involve a
degree of complexity that this scheme has not been designed to allow
for.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061044000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000084">I join
noble Lords in their hope that, in the future, other people will be
provided for. Until such time, there remain state payments that
sufferers of other long-tail diseases can apply for, such as payments
made under the 1979 and 2008 Acts. I hope that I have explained and
made it clear why this scheme will succeed only if it deals exclusively
with mesothelioma, and I urge the noble Lord to withdraw his
amendment.</hs_para>

that, mainly because the MoD was not and is not covered by employer
liability insurance.

there is no liability accepted by the Ministry of Defence and no

the Armed Forces, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord James of

to be not only for sailors, for people doing highly skilled labouring
jobs in naval dockyards and for other members of the armed services,
but for people who could well have been directly employed by government
in a whole host of other fields in publicly owned facilities of one
kind or another, including of course civil servants. The Government
self-insure, and there must be an employer’s liability in that
situation. I cannot see how it could possibly be otherwise. Perfectly
understandably, the Government do not go to the insurance market to
take out employer’s liability insurance but absorb the risk
themselves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061044000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000101">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:34:30"></hs_TimeCode>

thought its point was that, in the context of this Bill, the reference
to other kinds of disease or bodily injury when it referred
specifically to a definition of a potential insurance claimant was too
broad and could be made more specific. Indeed, if the noble Lord felt
able to adopt one or more of the amendments before him, that would tie
nicely in with that. I did not think the committee’s point was
that a broader reference was inherently inconsistent with the Bill,
simply that the specifics of this clause were not specific enough to
identify the other kinds of disease that might be involved. If the
problem is not being specific about the other types of disease that
ought to be covered by the scheme, that could be rectified quite

explanation. I yield to no one in my respect for the Delegated Powers
and Regulatory Reform Committee, which does extremely valuable work in
ensuring that the Government do not take outsized powers of a rather
generalised nature when they present legislation to Parliament.
However, I am not sure that an argument put forward by the Delegated
Powers Committee on the proposed technical committee would have a
bearing on whether it would be appropriate to take the opportunity of
this scheme to make provision in primary legislation to be able in due
course by regulation to establish further schemes that would be on the
same model as Parliament will have approved in the primary legislation
for the diffuse mesothelioma payment scheme, and which would of course
have to be legislated in their specifics by way of regulation—as
is quite explicitly stipulated in my Amendment

know what the Minister had in mind when he addressed the House at

the opportunity to bring forward a Bill of one sort, then another and
then another after that to establish further schemes, he must have
known that that was not realistic. To secure legislative time is always
a considerable problem, and I am afraid it would be pretty improbable
that we would have the opportunity to embark on fresh primary
legislation to repeat the process that we are going through now to
create the mesothelioma scheme. Therefore, I can see no difficulty of
principle that ought to deter us from amending the Bill to provide a
clear legal base for establishing other schemes, so that it could

in Committee. It will introduce into the Bill a new clause to require
that the Secretary of State commissions a report on the history of

precisely because the insurance records are missing in a significant
proportion of mesothelioma cases. It would be helpful if the Minister

negligence will have to have recourse to the scheme because the

James of Blackheath:</Member></B> I might be able to ease the noble
Lord’s concern on this. I believe that when the major
reinsurances were written, they were limited as to the dates when an
infection was identified and the reinsurance applied only to the names
of those who had a registered claim at that time. That was all that was
relevant for a claim; there is no question about that. Lloyd’s
of London did not buy its first computer until 1986. It has nothing
that goes back to this
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061044000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000114"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Howarth of Newport" PimsId="4870" UID="13061044000224" xid="1872" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000224">Lord
Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> I am always disposed to defer to the
noble Lord as he has a depth of knowledge on this matter that I do not
think is matched by the rest of the Committee. However, if
Lloyd’s of London did not get a computer until a rather late
date in the history of that august market, it none the less had brown
cardboard files. It seems to me that strong procedural safeguards and
impeccable record-keeping are always central to the upholding of
property rights and the protection of people who enter into
contracts.  
<?notus-xml column=318?>I cannot see how employer’s liability insurers at any phase of
their history could ever have been justified in allowing the documents
to disappear. There might have been a fire in the warehouse but we have
not been told that there has been such a fire at any of these insurers.
Other than in an extraordinary circumstance of that kind, it must be
normal and basic practice to keep the documentation and to pass it on

else could have been

are looking here at a spectrum of wrongdoing that runs from
inefficiency and muddle through negligence to, very possibly,
deliberate criminality in some places. Indeed, the scale on which the
documentation has gone missing suggests that there could have been
widespread criminal intention on the part of some people in an earlier
generation of insurers. I say “an earlier generation”;
they may no longer be active in the market but many of them may still
be extant as
individuals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061044000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000116">Another
recent major scandal has occurred in terms of record-keeping. I refer
to the sub-prime lenders in their Gadarene rush towards 2008. The
banks, in issuing huge numbers of mortgages and eagerly selling them
on, took to neglecting procedural safeguards. The combination of
disregard for procedural safeguards with fraudulence led to the
catastrophe of 2008 and in the years following, from which we continue
to suffer. It reached a point where, with millions of mortgages in
default, the banks abandoned the attempt to examine individual
documentation to certify that a particular person owed a certain amount
of money on a mortgage, which was the asset being sold on, and took to
what was known in the trade as “robo-signing”. Instead of
examining the individual records, they hired a person simply to sign
masses of these documents without even examining the
records.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061044000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-gc0001.htm#13061044000117">The
temptation for businesses not to keep full, accurate and proper records
when it is convenient to do so clearly can be very great. We do not
suppose—I do not think we do; I certainly do not—that the
banks which were guilty of that systematic failure of proper
record-keeping should be able to walk away from the scene of what they
did and just get away with funding a token scheme. Equally, it seems to
me that in the interests of justice and for exemplary purposes, there
should be a proper investigation of what went wrong with the
employer’s liability insurers. Of course, ELTO has been created
and that improves the methodology of tracing claims and liability.
However, a disastrous failure has occurred in this regard for a great
many people. As I say, it seems to me that this is a major scandal.
That is the reason why I have tabled Amendment 43—to
require the Secretary of State to establish a commission to investigate
and report on what happened in this history of inadequate
record-keeping, which I do not think anything can possibly have
justified. I beg to
move.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_10_PT_1/241277723B55EC15A9D85AF36B7EEF1B6E0DBB3C" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 June 2013">Monday,

sympathise with the aim behind this amendment, which is to bring those

aware, and inevitably would not have been aware of when he put down
this amendment, is that on 4 June the FCA published details of its
requirements for employer liability insurers to undertake effective
searches for historic policies. Moreover, the employer liability
tracing office, ELTO, is currently undertaking an audit of the record
keeping of its 150 or so members, including Equitas. The number
affected by the issue of records that were destroyed is broadly 300 out
of the 2,400 people with relevant mesothelioma per year, which implies
that one in eight cases is untraced—that is the proportion of

that he thinks an investigation of the kind that the amendment would
require is not practical. I think it depends on how important people
think it is to do the detective work. Of course, it is not within the
resources of his own department and I think it would be difficult for
the employer’s liability insurers themselves to meet the full

if we consider that an inexcusable series of abuses has occurred, I
cannot see that it is right to allow those who perpetrated these abuses

people are untraceable, then something is going wrong on a very big
scale indeed. It cannot be satisfactory to leave it at that. The noble
Lord gives me a modicum of encouragement in telling me that from now on
the FCA is going to intensify the requirements for effective search and
that ELTO is going to audit its members. However, if we accept the
position as stated by the Minister just now, we will be saying in
effect that those generations of people in the insurance market who did
not take the basic duty of care that they should have done in relation

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to be brief and I am
slightly hesitant about whether I should move the amendment. It was
pressed on us by ACOR. It concerns the definition of dependants, and
the suggestion is that rather than live with the definition we have,
which I think is based on what is set out in the 1979 Act, we should
pick up the definition used in the Damages (Scotland) Act 2011, which
ACOR suggests is fairer, more flexible and less prescriptive. It
includes, for example, siblings, grandparents and grandchildren. It
seems to me that this can cut both ways. The wider the group of
dependants, the less each will get, although the wider the group, the
more likely it is that a dependant will be spotted and available to
benefit. On balance, living with the existing definition is probably
the better route, but perhaps the Minister will give us the benefit of
his wisdom. I beg to move.</hs_para>

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, I think I will treat this as an extremely
probing amendment, and in that spirit I am happy to go through our
thinking; indeed, there is some value in doing so. The amendment seeks
to replace the definition from the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers’
Compensation) Act 1979 that we have used in the Bill with the
definition of “relative” set out in Section 14 of the
Damages (Scotland) Act 2011.</hs_para>

1979 Act provides an order of priority and is not just a
straightforward list. In other words, the first dependant on the list
is a spouse or civil partner and it is that person, if they exist, who
must make the application for a scheme payment. If there is no spouse,
the next on the list is a child or children and they must make the
application, and so on. The scheme payment would then be made to that
applicant or applicants, and it would be up to those applicants if they
wanted to share the scheme payment with any other relatives further
down the list.</hs_para>

2011 Act is a straightforward list. The effect of the amendment would
be that anyone on the list may make an application for a scheme
payment. The 2011 list includes some relatives who are not defined as
dependants in the 1979 Act. They are uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces,
cousins, and former 
<?notus-xml column=321?>spouses or civil partners. If all these people make an application for a
scheme payment, the payment made in accordance with regulations under
Clause 4 under the scheme must be divided equally between them. It is
right that there is a hierarchy of those who can make an application
for a scheme payment as it provides certainty to those who may want to
make such an application, and certainty to those administering the
scheme who would not be in a position to identify all the other
relatives who might want to make an application.</hs_para>

scheme payment are likely to be made by a surviving spouse or civil
partner. In these cases, the amendment would dilute the amount
available to that spouse or civil partner by compelling the scheme
payment to be divided up between other relatives who are less close,
either legally or by blood, to the deceased person with mesothelioma.
That could mean that a former spouse or cousin, for example, would
receive the same amount as the current spouse. Without the amendment,
the current spouse would receive the whole payment. I do not think that
it is right that a scheme payment should be divided up in this way so
that those closer to the 
<?notus-xml column=322?>deceased person with mesothelioma would receive less in order that a
proportion could be paid to more distant relatives.</hs_para>

security. For decades the oil and gas sector has been one of the
UK’s major industrial success stories, a key contributor to
growth, jobs and tax revenue. The industry supports 440,000 jobs
directly or indirectly and paid £11.2 billion in direct taxes in
2011-12, almost a quarter of all corporation taxes received by the
Exchequer. Investment in the UK continental shelf has risen
substantially in recent years, and investment in 2013, up to £14
billion, will reach an all-time
high.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306102000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130610-wms0001.htm#1306102000005">Some 41
billion barrels of oil and gas have already been produced from the UK
continental shelf, and 20 billion or more could still be
produced. Although peak production is now behind us, we must maintain
our momentum and make the most of the huge opportunity that the UK
continental shelf still represents. In addition to the economic
importance, maximising recovery of the UK’s indigenous supplies
of oil and gas will also help maintain security of supply as we
continue on our journey to a low-carbon future.</hs_para>

McNally:</Member> At present, civil legal aid is available to fund
certain cases where the prospects of success are only
“borderline”. The Government believe that, as a matter of
principle, in order to warrant public funding through civil legal aid,
a case should have at least a 50% prospect of success (ie moderate or
better). We therefore propose that cases with borderline prospects of
success should no longer qualify for civil legal aid funding. We have
recently consulted on this proposal and are now considering
responses.</hs_para>

the LAA and set out its estimate of the prospects of success. In
