new coal-fired power stations in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.
Some 10 new coal and lignite coal projects are under construction in
Germany, because the final investment decisions on them were taken in
2005 and 2008, when there was a very different policy environment, but
four have been postponed and 22 have now been abandoned, so the

Parliament, when Labour was in office, fuel poverty grew in every
single year and that, according to the latest figures, it has now gone
down. In many ways this is a rather odd debate. The Government
commissioned Professor Hills to review how we measure fuel poverty and
he has come up with proposals that have gained wide-scale acceptance.
We have consulted on them and will respond shortly to that
consultation. We believe that the old measurements of fuel poverty,
which are still in use, need radical reform so that we can better
target fuel poverty

we are helping people club together to exercise power in the market to
get better rates. The simplification of tariffs proposed by Ofgem will
mean greater competition and choice for people. We have a whole range

targets some of the poorest households in our country, taking
£130 directly of their bills, I would be surprised by such
findings. I reassure her and the House that the Government are not
complacent on the challenge of fuel poverty. We know we need to do as
much as possible, which is why we commissioned Professor Hills, why we
consulted on many of his proposals, and why we will respond. We will
shortly produce a framework on fuel poverty and produce a strategy by

improved outcomes they can have for local communities. We will amend
secondary legislation to make pre-application consultation with local
communities compulsory for the more significant onshore wind
applications. This will ensure that community engagement takes place at
an earlier stage and may assist in improving the quality of proposed
onshore wind development. It will also complement the community

However, I know that local communities have genuine concerns that

damaging impact on the landscape. Fourthly, great care should be taken

careful not to mention any specific named applications, but when
something has been determined at local level, we clearly cannot reopen
it. The changes will not be retrospective. When something is in the

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T10:41:17"></hs_TimeCode>She rightly
raised the question of what a “more significant”
development is. This will depend on a number of issues. As hon. Members
may understand, it may be about the scale and number of turbines, but
it could also be about the height, size and massing of them. Clearly,
we do not want to ensnare someone who is thinking of having a small
turbine in the back garden. That is not the purpose of the approach;
this will be set out clearly in the secondary
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T10:41:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0001.htm#13060646000216">The
hon. Lady then raised a broader point about retrospectivity. She did so
quite imaginatively, I thought, in a number of different ways. Perhaps
I can reiterate the point. Where a determination has been made, there
will not be a retrospective change, but where an application is in the
system, we expect the local planning officers and, if the case is in
appeal, the inspectors themselves to give clear and careful
consideration to the issue, in the knowledge that it has the potential
to be a “material consideration”, which she will
obviously understand has a legal implication as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0001.htm#13060646000217"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T10:42:18"></hs_TimeCode>The
purpose behind this approach is very clear, but I am not sure that the

Eagle:</Member></B> This week marks the 100th anniversary of the death
of suffragette Emily Wilding Davison, who threw herself at the
King’s horse demanding votes for women. As the battle for
women’s suffrage raged, she was at its forefront, being
imprisoned on multiple occasions and force fed 49 times. She has a
connection with this place because she hid in St Mary’s
Undercroft so that she could register as a resident here for the 1911
census. She is also known for throwing things at Chancellor Lloyd
George<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T11:06:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000298" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0001.htm#13060646000298">Since
women won the vote, just 35 have entered the Cabinet and today we make
up only 23% of the House of Commons. Does the Leader of the House agree
with me that, on this centenary, we should have a debate in Government
time on women’s progress in the UK? Under this Government,
women’s rights are going backwards: as carers, service users and
public sector workers, women are bearing the brunt of Government cuts
and women’s unemployment is the highest it has 
<?notus-xml column=1676?>been for a generation. No wonder the Government forgot to do a gender
impact assessment of their first Budget. I suggest that if Emily
Wilding Davison were alive today, she would still find reasons to throw
rocks at the
Chancellor<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T11:07:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000299" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0001.htm#13060646000299">I
wonder whether the Leader of the House recalls last October’s
Back-Bench business debate on the badger cull. The vote at the end of
that debate instructed the Government not to proceed with the
cull, but the Government just ignored it and started anyway. The
Government have lost Back-Bench votes on circus animals, badgers and
the Royal Fusiliers, and since starting to lose votes on Back-Bench
motions so frequently, they have simply stopped opposing them. Today,
we have a motion on the effects of pesticides on the bee population.
Will the Leader of the House let us know whether the Government intend
simply to let the motion pass without a vote, and if they do, will the
will of the House be ignored
again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T11:08:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T11:08:30"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000300" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0001.htm#13060646000300">The
Commons is abuzz with speculation about the end of the greatest No. 10
love affair of all time. Their eyes met at a press conference in the
garden and they accepted each other with open arms, but the Prime
Minister was unfaithful with his Back-Bench EU deal and now the Deputy
Prime Minister has gone to the papers over his child care demands. They
have been kidding themselves for a while, but the Queen’s Speech
showed us that they did not even have the energy to try any more. Their
mouse of a legislative programme has already unravelled, with No. 10 at
panic stations over another lobbying scandal, the EU Back-Bench Bill,
and the third U-turn of the Session in the abandonment of the appalling
plan to increase ratios for child care providers. It is hard to believe
that the House has sat for only 11 days since the Queen’s Speech
was
unveiled.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_06_PT_1/6AD10F53692386258589E1FDFC7496F9D0CDC514" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="6 June 2013">Thursday

is the job of the Leader of the House to co-ordinate the
Government’s legislative programme. I know he likes expensive
top-down reorganisations, but this is ridiculous. To be fair to him,
though, it is not as if his Cabinet colleagues are faring any better.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> Education
Secretary has been so busy positioning himself to be the next Tory
leader that he has forgotten to do the day job. According to a damning
report from the Procedure Committee, his Department is very late in
answering half of all written questions tabled by Members, and answers
only one in five written named day questions in time. During the recess
the chairman of the Tory party was told off by the UK Statistics
Authority for making things up. He joins a long list of his Cabinet
colleagues languishing on the statistical naughty step, including the
Prime Minister, the Health Secretary and the Work and Pensions
Secretary. So may we have a debate about sanctions that could be
applied to Ministers who do not answer questions in a timely fashion or
get censured for misusing statistics?</hs_Para>

we should also have a debate about performance-managing the Cabinet.
Such a debate could start with a look at the NHS. Since 2010 the number
of people waiting in A and E for more than four hours has doubled. The
ambulance queues have doubled, but instead of taking responsibility,
the Government have tried to blame immigrants, women doctors and a
10-year-old GP contract for a problem that has only just emerged. Of
course, they are only following the Chancellor’s lead after he
blamed the flatlining economy on the snow, the rain and various bank
holidays, including the royal

jubilee<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. This

success, that the Prime Minister has led in securing international
co-operation, not least through the G8 summit that will have taken

to a satisfactory outcome of this statutory process, the Highways
Agency expects that construction could start in the spring of 2014.

the emergency period, widespread violence was committed by both sides,

the British regiments and

regulations were introduced; political organisations were banned;
prohibited areas were created; and provisions for detention without
trial were enacted. The colonial authorities made unprecedented use of
capital punishment and sanctioned harsh prison, so-called
“rehabilitation”, regimes. Many of those detained were
never tried, and the links of many with the Mau Mau were never proven.
There was recognition at the time of the brutality of these repressive
measures and the shocking level of violence, including an important

recognise that British personnel were called upon to serve in difficult
and dangerous circumstances. Many members of the colonial service
contributed to establishing the institutions that underpin Kenya today,
and we acknowledge their contribution. However, I would like to make it
clear now and for the first time on behalf of Her Majesty’s
Government that we understand the pain and grievance felt by those who
were involved in the events of the emergency in Kenya. The British
Government recognise that Kenyans were subject to torture and other
forms of ill treatment at the hands of the colonial administration. The
British Government sincerely regret that these abuses took place and
that they marred Kenya’s progress towards independence. Torture
and ill treatment are abhorrent violations of human dignity, which we
unreservedly
condemn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T12:01:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000398" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000398">In
October 2009, claims were first brought to the High Court by five
individuals, who were detained during the emergency period, regarding
their treatment in detention. In 2011, the High Court rejected the
claimants’ arguments that the liabilities of the colonial
administration transferred to the British Government on independence,
but allowed the claims to proceed on the basis of other
arguments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000399" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000399">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T12:01:47"></hs_TimeCode>
2012, a further hearing took place to determine whether the cases
should be allowed to proceed. The High Court ruled that three of the
five cases could do so. The Court of Appeal was due to hear our appeal
against that decision last month. However, I can announce today that
the Government have now reached an agreement with Leigh Day, the
solicitors acting on behalf of the claimants, in full and final

agreement includes payment of a settlement sum in respect of 5,228
claimants, as well as a gross costs sum to the total value of
£19.9 million. The Government will also support the construction
of a memorial in Nairobi to the victims of torture and ill-treatment
during 
<?notus-xml column=1693?>the colonial era. The memorial will stand alongside
others that are already being established in Kenya as the country
continues to heal the wounds of the past. The British high commissioner

settlement provides recognition of the suffering and injustice that
took place in Kenya. The Government of Kenya, the Kenya Human Rights
Commission and the Mau Mau War Veterans Association have long been in
favour of a settlement, and it is my hope that the agreement now
reached will receive wide support, will help draw a line under these
events and will support
reconciliation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000402" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000402">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T12:03:15"></hs_TimeCode>

liability against the Government in this case. We do not believe that
claims relating to events that occurred overseas outside direct British
jurisdiction more than 50 years ago can be resolved satisfactorily
through the courts without the testimony of key witnesses, which is no

reconciliation. In December this year, Kenya will mark its 50th
anniversary of independence and the country’s future belongs to
a post-independence generation. We do not want our current and future
relations with Kenya to be overshadowed by the past. Today, we are
bound together by commercial, security and personal links that benefit
both our countries. We are working together closely to build a more
stable region. Bilateral trade between the UK and Kenya amounts to
£1 billion each year, and around 200,000 Britons visit Kenya

relationship that will promote the security and prosperity of both our

both hallmarks of our

Douglas Alexander</B> (Paisley and Renfrewshire South) (Lab):</Member>
May I thank the Foreign Secretary for his statement and for advance
sight of it? However, may I begin my remarks by asking him about a
procedural point: why, given a Minister’s obligation to the
House and the importance of this announcement, were the details,
including the wording of the statement of regret, the scale of the
quantum agreed and details of the legal 
<?notus-xml column=1694?>background to the settlement, all provided to the newspapers yesterday
before the House of Commons today? A full report appeared on <I>The
Guardian</I> website at 6.42 yesterday evening and on <I>The Times</I>
website at 7.30 yesterday evening. I hope that in his response the
Foreign Secretary will offer the House a candid explanation as to why
that occurred.</hs_Para>

me turn to the substance of the matter in the Foreign
Secretary’s statement. First, may I place on record the
cross-party consensus that exists on this issue and offer my support
for the Foreign Secretary’s efforts in seeing a legal settlement
being agreed? Much has already been said of the suffering on all sides
that lies at the heart of today’s announcements. On 20 October
1952, Governor Baring signed an order declaring a state of emergency in
Kenya. The violence that followed, carried out by both sides in the
conflict, has been well documented, not least thanks to the brave and
tragic testimony of many survivors who lived through it. As the Foreign
Secretary said, there were hundreds of casualties among the British
soldiers, police and officials, but during the period of emergency in
Kenya most of the victims and casualties were Kenyan, with many
thousands of Mau Mau members killed, and thousands more imprisoned and
displaced. It is therefore right that the Foreign Secretary recognised
the challenges and dangers that British personnel in Kenya faced at
that time, but the mass detention camps, the forced resettlement and
the levels of brutality that characterised that period in Kenyan
history must also be recognised. The numbers of dead and those not
accounted for is, of course, still debated, but I think there is broad
consensus in all parts of this House that the scale of the suffering
was profound and deeply regrettable.</hs_Para>

is why I welcome today’s statement by the Foreign Secretary and
want to echo his words acknowledging that Kenyans were tortured and
mistreated by the colonial administration. I also want to support
further today’s expression of deep regret and unreserved
condemnation of those actions. The British Government are right to
reflect on our country’s colonial past, not simply because the
legacy of our past is still being felt today, but because we must look
to history, learn its lessons and use them to help chart a course going
forward. All parts of this House share an interest in seeing this issue
resolved, which is why today I wish to put on record my support for the
right hon. Gentleman’s work over recent months to press for a
fair resolution as Foreign Secretary.</hs_Para>

we support the announcements made today in the Foreign
Secretary’s statement, but I seek his clarification on a number
of issues that arise as a result. First, could he confirm to the House
which departmental budget is funding the £19.9 million of which
he spoke, which makes up the full and final settlement announced today?
Will he also set out what meetings his Department has had with
representatives of the Mau Mau claimants, and could he update the House
as to their collective view of and response to today’s
announcement? Indeed, will he further explain what he anticipates will
be the response of the Kenyan Government, in particular, to
today’s
announcement?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000410" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000410">The
British Government must continue, of course, to be categorical in their
condemnation of torture and ill treatment, which are abhorrent

Secretary, I hope that today’s announcement will encourage even
stronger ties between our two nations going forward, despite, but not

past.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000411" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000411"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Hague" PimsId="3707" UID="13060646001370" xid="245" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646001370">Mr
Hague:</Member></B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. I agree
that the cross-party approach is important. These claims were first
made in 2009, under the last Government, and the last Government
decided to contest them in the courts. That was the right decision,
because all of us together contest the liability of British taxpayers
in the 21st century for what happened under colonial administrations.
However, we are also right to support this settlement together, because
it is the best outcome all round for both the British taxpayer and the
claimants. Many of the claimants are of course very old, and further
protracted legal proceedings would not necessarily be in their
interests.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000412" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000412">The
right hon. Gentleman asked, quite rightly, about reports in the press.
As I think he and the House recognise, I am an enthusiast for
announcing things to Parliament. While I am not in a position to point
a finger of accusation at anyone, I note that, in view of the nature of
the settlement, information about it had been circulated beyond the
Government before today. I also note that some of the figures given in
newspaper reports are different from the figures that I have given
today, and have clearly not come from the Foreign Office. However, the
right hon. Gentleman was absolutely right to make the point that such
announcements are best made to Parliament in the first instance. He was
also right to join in the sincere regret that the Government have
expressed: it will mean a great deal in Kenya that regret has been
expressed by the Opposition as well as by the Government.</hs_Para>

to the specific questions that the right hon. Gentleman asked. The
claim will not be met by any departmental budget; it is a claim on the
Treasury reserve. That is what the reserve is for—to provide
lump sums that cannot be anticipated or budgeted for.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman asked what meetings the Government had had. This matter
has been a subject of legal proceedings for four years, and the
meetings that have been held with the aim of reaching a settlement have
taken place with the lawyers of the claimants. From that it can be
deduced that the claimants are happy with the settlement. Certainly the
lawyers have expressed satisfaction on their behalf.</hs_Para>

Government called for a settlement, and it is now for them to react to
this settlement in whatever way they wish, but I hope that they will
welcome it. The British high commissioner in Nairobi has met the Kenyan
human rights commission and representatives of the Mau Mau in recent
weeks, and, as I said in my statement, he will be speaking to Mau Mau
veterans today, in particular about our plans for a memorial. However,

stronger ties between our countries are very important. Kenya is an
important partner of this country in trade and tourism, and
also—this is particularly important—in countering
terrorism and seeking stability in east Africa. We work with Kenya
closely in trying to bring stability to Somalia, for instance. I hope
that the settlement will make it easier for us to do all those things

Corbyn</B> (Islington North) (Lab):</Member> I thank the Foreign
Secretary for his statement, but I was a bit surprised when, towards
the end of it, he said that the British Government “continue to
deny liability” for what happened. It is very strange that the
Government should arrive at a settlement with Leigh Day and offer
compensation, and at the same time deny liability.</hs_Para>

well known in the 1950s. Fenner Brockway, Barbara Castle, Leslie Hale,
Tony Benn and many other MPs raised the issue in Parliament during the
1950s. It is only the steadfastness of people in Kenya who stood for
justice and against the use of concentration camps, torture,
castration, and all the vile things that were done to Kenyan prisoners
by the British forces that has finally brought about this settlement. I
met many of those victims last year when they came here to go to court,
and I pay tribute to them, and to Dan Thea and others who have
organised the campaign that has finally brought this day
about.</hs_Para>

serious lessons to be learnt. When we deny rights and justice, when we
deny democracy, when we use concentration camps, our actions reduce our

other colonial wars in which equal brutality was employed by British
forces.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000426" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000426"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Hague" PimsId="3707" UID="13060646001376" xid="245" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646001376">Mr

Gentleman asked, in particular, about the consistency between
recognition of those things and the Government’s

later, 50 or 60 years on in the 21st century, the British
taxpayer can be held liable for what happened under colonial
administrations in the middle of the 20th century. However, while we

in my statement how the legal cases were proceeding. There had been a
series of hearings in 2011 and 2012. The Government had contested all
of the cases, but the High Court had decided that three out of five of
them could proceed, on grounds that were quite specific to this
particular case and to the Mau Mau insurgency. It does not therefore
set a precedent for other cases. Given that it had decided that, the
Government came to the view that it was in the interests of the British

11,000 Mau Mau rebels were killed and only 32 white settlers, but David
Anderson, professor of African politics at Oxford, says that probably
25,000 people died at the hands of the colonial organisation. I wonder
whether there should be a debate about the past, and whether we ought
to make sure that adults, some of whom will remember these events, know
about what happened, and also that young people learn from this period
of history. Might the Foreign Secretary speak to the Education

important to our country, and I mentioned a few moments ago the many
different dimensions of it. It is a relationship that we want to
expand, in terms of trade in particular, to the benefit of both
nations. It is also very important for stability in east Africa. Given
the UK’s leading role there, for instance in the work we do on
Somalia, our relations with Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia are of great
importance, and we give great attention to them. I hope relations
between the UK and Kenya will develop over the coming years and decades
in a true sense of partnership, with the new generations moving on
fully from everything that happened in the colonial era. A sense of

that charities must be established for charitable purposes only and
that a charitable purpose must be “for the public

presumption of public benefit from the list of headings that has
historically existed, although case law prompts the question whether
there ever was in fact such a presumption. However, the Act also placed

me take the hon. Gentleman back to the point about the situation with

the unfairness whereby Eton and Harrow get a handout from taxpayers
whereas ordinary schools in poor areas do not. The Act tried to change
that, but a perverse decision taken by the law stated that the status
of a charity depends on what it was established for, not on what it
does. Two charities—one in Wales that exists to give petticoats

We did not major on that during this inquiry, but it might be something
to which we return. We recommend in our report that the Charity
Commission and HMRC should work much more closely together. In fact,
HMRC has the resource to investigate, penetrate and demand information
about charities and their tax affairs and donors. In my personal
opinion, it is as much a failure of HMRC as of the Charity
Commission, but we recommend they work together more closely. What we
have to be

charitable status for religious institutions? Many such institutions
feel that there has been creep by the Charity Commission in defining
public benefit or, worse still, going to the tribunal to define it.

Jenkin:</Member></B> That is exactly right. The legal advice we
received on this question is quite clear: in the 1949 case of Gilmour
<I>v.</I> Coats, the House of Lords made it clear that a cloistered
religious order is not charitable, as any benefit is restricted to its
members, who are a private class and not a sufficient section of the
public. It has never been the case that every religious organisation is
automatically charitable. However, the judgments in two other
cases—Neville Estates <I>v.</I> Madden in 1962 and Re Banfield
in 1968—were that a private religious group that is not wholly
shut off from the world at large may be
charitable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000493" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000493">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T12:41:58"></hs_TimeCode>

because we were presented by my noble Friend Lord Hodgson with a
recommendation that it should be made much easier for trustees to be
paid officials. I have to say that there was a strong reaction against
that proposal, which has a bearing on the point my hon. Friend raises
because the whole point about charities is that trustees are not paid.
There may be quite highly paid executives in charities, but the job of
a trustee is not to benefit financially from being a trustee. There are
exceptions, but the Charity Commission has to approve them. I believe
my hon. Friend is suggesting that the commission should be prepared to
withdraw that consent in the event of a person offering to do the job
for nothing. I invite the commission to consider that matter, which we

and I was personally approached—face to face—more than 50
times, including at my party conference. Around every corner in this

widespread fear among many colleagues that the case presages a
crackdown on religious groups by the Charity Commission. I believe the
consistent message in our 
<?notus-xml column=1706?>report is that we believe that too much has been laid at the door of the
commission to determine. If Parliament wishes to legislate to provide
additional restrictions against religious organisations, it is for
Parliament to do that, but there is established case law, which I
quoted earlier, that should determine whether or not a religious
organisation becomes a charity. It is unfortunate that that particular
case became so adversarial. It has to be said that the charity tribunal
has not reduced the costs of litigation as was hoped, and there is
scope to improve the practices of the commission in handling such
disputes, so that vast amounts of the time and resources of the
commission and charities, or potential charities, is not absorbed in
paying lawyers to argue about how many angels there are on the head of

its members very badly. We had people giving evidence in this House
that they were threatened with losing their job, their home or their

Exclusive Brethren have, which, rather like what happens in North
Korea, can only pick up the group’s website. This is an
exceptional group of people, and the Charity Commission took no action

Skills and higher education is now a global market. Those with the best

they will get the best opportunity to develop their expertise and where
they feel they will get the warmest welcome. It is in that
international context that we must look at our policies on student

what must be recognised as a hugely sensitive issue and a focus of
public concern, the Government must have a student regime that does not
deter bona fide international students and does not undermine our
further education colleges, our universities or the wider economy. I
recognise the efforts that the Prime Minister has made to visit India
and China in particular to make it clear unequivocally that there is no
cap on bona fide student applications. However, the Prime Minister has
a credibility problem if, at the same time as he proclaims those
things, students who wish to come to this country from abroad find that

the regulatory regime, the current problems are focused on the
inflexibility of the tier 4 visa for undergraduate education. Over and
above that and linked to it are the problems associated with the
post-study work visa. There is no doubt that many international
students who want an undergraduate education want to carry that on at
postgraduate level in order to demonstrate the skills that they have
acquired in local universities, the local public sector or sometimes
local businesses. The majority deterrent to that within the existing
visa structure is the high salary threshold, which precludes much
postgraduate working in areas where salaries for graduates are lower or
in professions where salaries for graduates are
lower.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000526" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000526">Credibility
interviews are the process that the Home Office is using to interview
would-be international students in their home countries to establish
the credibility of their claims to want higher education in this
country. The feedback that I am getting time and again from
universities is that that approach appears to be incoherent and
inconsistent. Taken together with the change in regulations, it
reinforces the perception abroad that Britain is no longer open to
business. The fact that the Prime Minister needs to go to these
countries and make these statements is a tacit admission that there is
a real problem and a gap between the regulatory regime as stated by the

Wolverhampton, currently recruits 800 international students each year,
but it estimates that with a fair and consistent visa process it could
take another 500 a year from India and Sri Lanka alone. If they
contribute £10,000 a year, which is a fairly minimal estimate,
that would amount to £5 million more a year going into the local

that or not, they do not use the figures as the basis for their
immigration policy. The Government’s target of reducing net
migration to fewer than 100,000 can only be achieved by reducing
numbers. The current drop to 157,000 has been achieved mainly by
reducing numbers in the further education sector and by increased
numbers going abroad. The Migration Advisory Committee calculates that
to reach the target, non-EU student numbers need to be reduced by
87,000. That would be catastrophic to the finances of the FE and higher

current visa regime, whatever the legitimacy of the broad objectives of

to be robust and I will deal with that later. She is absolutely right

targets are an essential part of the democratic process. They tell the

target is about building an immigration system that
works for Britain—one that delivers economic benefits
while addressing long-standing public concerns about immigration.

easy it has been to exploit the student visa system in recent years. If

innocents get caught out in those situations. The best way to deal with
the problem is to close down the colleges that are abusing the system
and the students. Indeed, I spoke about London Metropolitan university

deportation of legitimate students from this

we must be more intelligent about where the risks and the opportunities
lie for us. I hope that Ministers will listen to this point carefully.
In targeting tier 4 visas, the UK Border Agency already distinguishes
between high and low-risk students. There are face-to-face interviews
for students who are considered to be high
risk.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000575" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000575">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:29:29"></hs_TimeCode>
my opinion, that should work the other way around and we should give
the red-carpet treatment to the kind of students we want to attract to
our country. For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:24:20"></hs_TimeCode>
example, female students from the Gulf states are likely to have lower
English language proficiency and are more likely to want to bring their
spouses and children with them. If we want to see reform in the Gulf
states, those are exactly the kind of students we need to attract.
However, under the current rules, their dependants are obliged to
return home every six months to renew their visa, and after 11 months
the student must do the same. In Australia, Canada and America,
dependants can apply for a visa that covers the whole study
period<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:24:53"></hs_TimeCode>. We do
not need to rewrite the rule book; we just need to have more common

we need a cross-party consensus to neutralise the political fallout. No
Government want to be accused of fiddling the figures, particularly on
a policy area as combustible as immigration. We need to present a

the outset of the debate, it is worth emphasising that international

contribution, but because they add to the intellectual vitality of our
campuses; they are vital to the viability of many courses, particularly
in the STEM subjects of science, technology, engineering and maths;
they contribute to the cutting-edge research that gives the UK a unique
edge in international markets; and they give UK students the chance to
learn alongside people from every other major country, which is
extraordinarily good preparation for the transnational environment in
which our graduates will work. As has been pointed out, international
students form relationships and a fondness for this country that will
win us contracts and influence as they become leaders back

are huge advantages for Britain, but let us put them to one side and
look at the hard-nosed economic case. International students bring
£8 billion into the UK economy each year. Higher education is a
major industry and a major export earner. Some people ask, “What
about the costs?” Indeed, the Minister made that point on the
all-party parliamentary university group at one point. I discussed it
with the university of Sheffield, 
<?notus-xml column=1717?>which said, “Fair point. We ought to look at that”, and it
commissioned Oxford Economics to undertake the first ever independent
cost-benefit analysis of the contribution of international students. As
an independent study I expected it to be quite rigorous, although I did
not realise how rigorous. Oxford Economics did not just look at health,
education and use of public services; it went to the nth degree and
looked at traffic congestion and every conceivable indirect cost. It
concluded that the annual net benefit to our city’s economy is
£120 million. That is worth about 6,000 much-needed
jobs in the city, not just in universities but in restaurants, shops,
transport, construction and more besides.</hs_Para>

Government have damaged our ability to recruit by including
international students in net migration targets. That is not a
statistical argument but a fundamental point because in doing so, they
have put international students at the heart of the immigration debate.
It is no good saying, as the Minister might later and the Home Office
did this week in its response to the report by the Business, Innovation
and Skills Committee, that there is no cap on student
numbers—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I><I> </I>The Minister
says from a sedentary position that there is not, but if the Government
have a target for reducing immigration and they include international
students in that, such a policy leads them to celebrate cutting the
number of international students coming to the UK. Indeed, the Minister
did <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:31:22"></hs_TimeCode>just that a
couple of weeks ago when the fall in net migration was announced by
celebrating the drop in numbers of 56,000 international

will point out that within those figures the number of university visas
rose slightly while the real fall was in private college and further
education student numbers, but that in itself should be a cause for
worry not celebration. Not only are those students valuable in
themselves, those courses are pathways into higher education and a fall
in numbers is an indication of the problems we are storing up for the
future. Conservative estimates suggest that some 40% of students going
to universities in the UK go through those routes, and we should worry
about that future impact.</hs_Para>

Brazil—one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Under
their Science Without Borders programme, the Brazilian Government are
spending $2 billion over four years on sending 100,000 of their
brightest young people to study abroad at undergraduate and
postgraduate level. They want them to go to the best universities in
the world, and those are in the UK.</hs_Para>

2,143 Brazilian students who wanted to come to the UK have been
prevented by inflexible visa rules. They are high-achieving students
who wanted to study undergraduate STEM courses, but they
needed  
<?notus-xml column=1718?>to improve their English before starting. Current rules prevent them
from staying in the UK after completing an English language course, and
they would have had to return to Brazil and reapply for a new visa
before starting their courses. As a result of those rules and the Home
Office’s refusal to change them, 1,100 of those students are now
going to the US and 600 to Australia, where they are welcome to study
English and stay on for their degree course. Of the original 2,143
students, only 43 are applying to come to the UK this September. The
value to the country of that cohort was £66 million. That has
been lost because of Home Office inflexibility, and with it,

allow other hon. Members to contribute, I will draw my remarks to a
close by making a couple of points. Including students in net migration
targets distorts the policy debate on immigration and focuses on the
migration that concerns nobody. More importantly, as has been said, it
damages the opportunity for growth in one of our most important and
successful industries. Five Select Committees of both Houses are agreed
on the issue, and as we debate the matter, those in the other place are
also considering it when discussing a report by one of its Select
Committees. This is too important for the Home Office to dig its heels
in, and I suspect that in his heart the Minister knows that. I urge him
to go away from today’s debate, look again at the inclusion of
students in our net migration targets, and send a clear message to the
world that it is not just about what we say but about what we do, and
that we are open for
business.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_06_PT_1/40EF41CFDDBC05ED1E6EDA2CB15DB0DF1C948731" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="6 June 2013">Thursday

for West Bromwich West acknowledged is our clear task of addressing the
public’s concern about levels of migration into this country in
recent years—not an easy thing to do. When my constituents
communicate with me they sometimes seem to think that the challenges we

these issues are difficult and sometimes point us in conflicting
directions.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:38:08"></hs_TimeCode>There is also a
fundamental conflict between the need in electoral politics for
simplicity of message when trying to communicate what our party would

me say a little about what my constituents think about immigration,
which I think is relevant to the debate. I represent a part of south
London that is changing rapidly demographically, and it will not be
long before no ethnic community is in a majority in the London borough
of Croydon, nor will it ever be again. Migration is an issue of real
concern to my constituents, particularly because the UK Border Agency
has a significant presence in Croydon in Lunar house. Many of my
constituents have recently been through the asylum or immigration
processes, and I have several thousand constituents who worked for the
two units into which the agency has been broken. A lot of my
constituents are concerned about the pace of change, and I spend a lot
of time talking to them on the doorstep about those concerns. However,
I have never heard a constituent express to me a concern about bright
people from around the world coming to study at our universities, or
about international companies that want to invest in the UK and create
businesses, bringing some of their managers and employees to the UK as
part of that investment into our economy.</hs_Para>

hear a lot of concern about low-skill migration into the EU, which many
of my constituents believe—rightly or wrongly—has made it
more difficult for them or their children to get work and has depressed
wages in sectors of our economy. There is a great deal of concern about
unlimited migration from within the EU, and the effect of allowing into
the EU countries from eastern Europe, which I strongly
support—the concern is about the principle of free movement when
the EU incorporates a series of states that are at different levels
economically.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000601" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000601">There
is also huge concern about our failure to control our borders
effectively. When I report to my constituents on the
Government’s progress in reducing net migration, they are almost
universally inclined not to believe the figures, because their
perception is that the figures do not include people who are here
illegally. On migration policy, therefore, I am most keen for the
Government to take more action than they are taking to deal with people
who are in this country who should not be
here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:40:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

substantive point at the end of my speech, but on his point on skills,
when there are skill needs in our economy, our starting point should be
to ask, “Can we train people in this country who have not got

fourth benefit of such migration, which has not been mentioned much, is
the contribution to UK science and technology. I studied natural
science at Cambridge and was on the Select Committee on Science and
Technology for a period, so I feel passionately about this. Some 49% of
people on taught postgraduate course in maths, engineering or computer
science are international students—that figure has been
mentioned. Cutting down on those numbers would have a massive effect on
UK leadership in science. Sir Andre Geim, the Russian-born Nobel prize

are the four clear benefits, but there are problems. The Higher
Education Statistics Agency provides figures for enrolments, not for
visa applications—enrolments are the best measure. In 2011,
there was a slight decline in applications for first-year places at
university from non-EU applicants. Admittedly, the position is complex,
with significant country variations—there was a big increase in
applications from China, but a big decrease in applications from India.
I should be grateful if the Minister would offer an explanation for
those significant variations if he has time. Students from different
parts of the world tend to apply for different courses. Indian students
are more likely to apply for STEM courses, so those variations have an
impact on universities. In 2012, for the first time in 10 years, the
total number of non-EU postgraduate students fell.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) correctly identified the three
issues we need to address, the first of which is bureaucracy and the
process people must go through when they want to come here. I pay
tribute to the Minister and the Home Secretary, because the decision to
split the UKBA up into two organisations—one focuses on customer
satisfaction and processing applications for people who want to come
here, and the other focuses on the entirely different job of
enforcement and removing people who should not be here—was the
right decision, and a welcome one. However, there is more to do to
improve the process and the experience people have when they
apply.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000627" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000627">The
second issue is the tone and the message we send out in debates on
migration—that is not totally within the Government’s
control, because we must also consider the tone of the migration debate
in our media. The Government have recognised the importance of sending
the message that the UK is open for business, as we saw during the
Prime Minister’s recent visit to
India.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000628" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000628">The
third issue is policy. We have a target for reducing net migration and
should ask who is included in it. One hon. Member has mentioned the
Migration Advisory Committee, which has said that an equivalent
reduction in all different forms of migration could reduce student
migration by 87,000. I put it to the Minister that, in 2009-10, the
National Audit Office identified that about 50,000 students looked as
if their principal reason for coming here was work rather than study.
All hon. Members would accept that there was significant abuse of the
process. That happened through institutions— bogus
colleges—but we all see what we might regard as serial students,
meaning people who have come here and done a number of courses but
still not reached undergraduate level. Clearly, their primary
motivation for coming to this country is to work in the UK, whatever
their visa application says. All hon. Members accept that there was
potential to reduce the numbers without having an impact on the
positive aspects we have
discussed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000629" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000629">On
the long-term situation, the House has made its view clear on the
policy, but I am interested in what the Conservative party will say in
its next manifesto. As hon. Members have said, the sector has the
potential to nearly double by 2020. At the moment, about 4.1 million
around the world study in tertiary education abroad. The projection is
that that will go up to 7 million by 2020. We should at least set
ourselves the objective of maintaining our market share, which is
currently about 13%. We have done the job of squeezing down on student
migration abuse, but if our objective is to maintain or grow our market
share and continue to recruit the people we want in this country, it
will creep up over time.</hs_Para>

support what my party had to say at the previous election. It was
absolutely right to focus on this, and I think many Opposition Members
recognise that. In the longer term, we need to think more clearly about
how we differentiate to the public the kinds of immigration that we are
looking to control—the bits that we do not think are good for
the country and want to squeeze down on, both illegal immigration and
immigration through the existing system. We should not get ourselves
into a position where we are trying to control things that we all
recognise are positive and good for the country. I wish the Minister,
for whom I have a very high regard, the best of luck as he grapples
with the

two universities and numerous independent colleges in Oxford East, my

student visas and immigration that the Government have brought in. They
have inflicted serious damage on the reputation and attractiveness of
the UK, and on the economic and cultural contribution that overseas
students, and those who teach them, make to our country. The
Government’s policies amount to a perverse and stupid act of
economic self-sabotage. They hit a part of our economy where Britain in
general, and Oxford in particular, have a strong global strategic
competitive advantage. There is a
logical<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:51:34"></hs_TimeCode>
contradiction in the Government protesting that there is no cap on
student numbers, while persisting in including student numbers in their
overall target of reducing net immigration to tens rather than hundreds
of thousands. They find it so difficult to control other areas of
immigration, including illegal immigration, that there is continual
downward pressure on student
numbers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000633" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0002.htm#13060646000633">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:52:07"></hs_TimeCode>

another area; for example, to our Mini plant—to manufacturing,
as opposed to educational exports. Imagine a Government who have an
overall limit on manufacturing exports because they do not want too
many foreigners getting their hands on our goods. As the number of BMW
Minis being exported falls because overseas dealers worry that they
will not be able to fulfil orders, the Prime Minister flies out to the
far east and attempts to reassure people that while he is determined to
bring down net manufacturing exports, there is no cap on the export of
Minis! Such a policy would be barmy, way beyond swivel-eyed, and yet

strongly support the motion. I hope that the Government will listen to
the Select Committees that have come to the same view and take
international students out of the migrations statistics used to steer
UK immigration policy. I hope that Ministers will remove the unfair
penalties imposed on independent colleges, work in partnership with
them to develop longer-term, highly trusted accreditation and promote
the contribution these colleges make. I also urge them more generally
to think further and positively about how to encourage, not discourage,
overseas students at all levels who want to come here, as those
students invigorate universities and other education institutions and
generate lots of overseas earnings, jobs and economic demand, which
people here desperately need. Doing so would rebuild Britain’s
reputation in the world as somewhere that welcomes international
students and researchers and recognises their enormous potential
contribution to our culture and economy—which, let us remember,
is to the benefit of us

students at our universities are generally seen though one of two
lenses: the positive one is that they are a cash-cow, premium product
that historically has cross-subsidised domestic students in our
universities; the negative one is that, because of this, they might end
up getting too many places at our universities, thus keeping out some
of our home-grown talent. Both are completely the wrong way of thinking
about international students. This is a huge growth market in the world

rankings consider that if a university is not good enough to attract
foreign students, it is probably not very good. Thirdly, having a

<?notus-xml column=1727?>and we are not the only ones who have spotted that this is an attractive
sector and who are doing things differently, as we will continue do in
order to protect and growth our own share. The most obvious competitive
set are the Anglophone countries, led by the United States, but also
including Canada and Australia. Increasingly, however, non-English
speaking countries are offering English-speaking courses. The third
competitor is potentially the biggest, and that is the choice of
staying at home. In China, India, Nigeria and elsewhere in the world,
there is a big business opportunity in attracting students from those
countries to stay in institutions there. So, yes, we have to redouble
our efforts all the time in order not only to forge ahead, but just to

Education in the other place—have all arrived at the same
conclusion and the same recommendation. They are united in their
belief—it is a considered belief, based on the vast amount of
evidence they have taken—that including students in net
migration numbers is the wrong thing to do, for a number of reasons,
and that the Government should reverse that decision. The reason for
that belief is obvious. The students we are talking about are not
migrant workers. They have paid to come to the UK to study. They have
chosen to invest in the UK and are sponsored to remain only for the
period of their studies.</hs_Para>

speak as an MP for a constituency that benefits from the positive
contribution that overseas students can make to university life and the
wider community. According to the University of Sunderland’s
annual review, more than 2,600 overseas students were enrolled in
taught undergraduate or postgraduate courses last year. What does that
mean for the university and the wider city? Those students are paying
their fees, which are crucial to the university as a means of investing
in the facilities and opportunities they can provide to all students,
particularly as grants are repeatedly cut, but there are wider benefits
too. Those students need places to live and therefore pay rent to local
private landlords, usually through local letting agents. Those students
need to eat and therefore spend money in local shops and restaurants.
They probably need coats and gloves—they have probably also
needed wellies over the last couple of years—to deal with the
harsh north-east weather, and they will obviously buy those in local
shops. Those students will also want to have a good time, as do 
<?notus-xml column=1730?>students the world over, spending money in local cinemas, bars and
clubs, and going to gigs, football matches and so on. They might even
need books and stationery, which they will buy from local bookshops and
stationers.</hs_Para>

to evidence that the university submitted to the Home Affairs Committee
when it considered this issue in 2011, overseas students bring an
income to the university of £15 million in tuition fees and
£1.5 million in accommodation fees. The university estimated the
additional income to the city to be around £10 million a year.
That figure is probably a conservative estimate, given that it amounts
to only £385 a month or so for each student, and we know that
many international students who come to the UK are from pretty wealthy
families—after all, how else would they afford the large
up-front fees that they have to pay? That is probably reflected in the
revised estimate that I recently received from the university, of
£37 million of total benefit.</hs_Para>

the middle east and north Africa group, to name but a few—but it
is a two-way street. The university encourages international students
to experience the culture that the north-east has to offer, such as
Washington old hall in my constituency, which has an obvious attraction

<?notus-xml column=1731?>many of these students come from well-connected families, and that among

and trade and exports are fundamental parts of the economy. The
independent “North-east Economic Review” recently
commissioned by the local enterprise partnership and authored by my
noble colleague Lord Adonis reported that the north-east is one
of the leading exporting areas of the UK, with over
1,500 companies exporting goods. In 2011 and 2012, it was

country that often comes up when we talk about the need to get more
people over to the UK is China. The University of Sunderland works hard
to attract Chinese students, as do other higher education institutions.
I was lucky enough to visit China in September 2011. I visited the
offices of the University of Sunderland in Beijing, where I was able to
talk to the local staff there about the work they do. Their biggest
concerns by far were the new visa requirements, coupled with the way in
which some Chinese students they had recruited were treated at customs
when they arrived here in the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:22:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

those factors are a source of humiliation to students. What will happen
when word gets out that the UK does not want them and that it will put
them through that kind of experience? Students who would have come to
the UK, and who might well have come to Sunderland, will go elsewhere
in the world. They want to learn and develop their English, and they
will go to the USA, Australia, New Zealand or Canada, all of which
exclude students from their migrant figures and are currently welcoming
them with open arms. Those countries are benefiting from our

University of Sunderland posed two questions to me, which I believe cut
to the heart of this debate. I would be grateful if the Minister could
address them in his response—if indeed he is listening to what I
am saying. First, can the Government meet their net migration targets
without reducing the number of international students coming to study
at British universities? My suspicion is that they probably cannot, and
are therefore 
<?notus-xml column=1732?>knowingly and willingly accepting the devastating economic impact that
this policy will have on localities and regions, particularly those

what is more important to this Government: economic growth and
sustainability or a falsely painted picture of immigration and
immigrants that includes those who choose to come and invest in the UK
and bring substantial short and long-term economic and social advantage
to our country? I am sure the Minister will say that it is the former,
but actions speak louder than words, and the actions of this Government
firmly suggest that their priority is political headlines, rather than
what is right for our higher education sector and for the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:25:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000689" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000689">Of
course we must tackle bogus colleges and bogus students. Everyone
agrees on that. I am afraid, however, that such action is being used as
a smokescreen to justify this damaging and short-sighted policy. Well,
the Government are fooling nobody. We all know that this is about using
overseas students to reduce the net migration figures in order to
fulfil a promise made by the Prime Minister that he would otherwise be
unable to fulfil. That is a disgrace, and it must stop. I hope that
this debate will spur a change in policy and a more grown-up and
thought-through approach. This Government are well-practised in the art
of the U-turn, and I hope that we will see one being performed on this
issue sooner rather than later, before too much more damage is done to
our universities and our international reputation.</hs_Para>

survey done by the United Kingdom Border Agency claimed that there was
a lack of attendance and monitoring, insufficient English language
testing and overstaying of student visas. The students concerned were
told that they had 60 days to find another institution or they would
have to return to their own country. That resulted in a great deal of
debate, including an urgent question in this Chamber and statements
from the Government. The university sought High Court action against

will the Minister provide assurances that the 20 London Met students
who submitted passports nine months ago and who now wish to leave the
country will receive an answer in the next 28 days? In all fairness,
those students spent a great deal of money coming to this country, many
of them are from poor families who scrimped and saved to send them
here, and they had to go through a dreadful experience. We want to move
on. We want international students back at the university and the
university to be thriving and providing good-quality education. That is
the message I want to give. Our local community benefits from that
university, and it frequently benefits from the community when
community events and many other things are held there. We want it to be
a good place of learning. Every colleague who represents 
<?notus-xml column=1735?>a constituency with a university or a higher education institution in it
wants that for those institutions. It is up to the Minister to ensure
that we continue to recruit overseas students and that they benefit

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:36:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for West Bromwich West (Mr Bailey) and all other Members who
signed up to ensure that we had this afternoon’s debate. It is
perhaps a sort of irony that the quality of the debate has been high,
with an enormous degree of unanimity on the issues. I suspect that if
the Chamber had been fuller, the debate might have been more partisan
and there might have been less unanimity, but the debate we have had is
a tribute to the way in which the argument has been advanced in several
Select Committees and through the Select Committee process itself.
Sometimes if we just look rationally at the facts, it is easier to
reach a cross-party position.</hs_Para>

referred to Erasmus, talking about what has happened since Erasmus came
here in the 16th century. It is interesting because when Erasmus first
came here to study at Cambridge university in 1506, he did not complete
a whole year so I do not think he would have been included in the net
migration target. When he came again, in 1511, staying until 1515, he
taught as the Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at Cambridge
university. In that case, he would have come here under the tier 2
visa, which would have been completely different and not the subject of
this afternoon’s

for Croydon Central (Gavin Barwell), who speaks sanely and sensibly on
many of these issues. As he said, some studied at Sandhurst, as many

would also point to those who have had a more courageous political
career, such as Aung San Suu Kyi, and, for that matter, to the large
number of people who have come to the United Kingdom, studied here,
stayed on and ended up teaching here, gaining Nobel prizes in classic
instances such as Sydney Brenner, César Milstein and Aaron Klug.
Perhaps most interesting of all, T S Eliot, now
thought of as the quintessentially British poet of the 20th century,
was originally born in the United States of America, came to study here
at the beginning of the first world war and ended up staying 
<?notus-xml column=1736?>here for the rest of his life. Perhaps it was because he had the
experience of being a migrant student that he ended up writing so much
about travelling and the difficulty of living in other
cultures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000710" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000710"><Member ContinuationText="Jason McCartney" PimsId="5697" UID="13060646001521" xid="1044" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646001521"><B>Jason

the number of people from Latin American militaries—air force,
navy or army—who have historically had the Prussian tradition of
military and then come to the UK to train in a British environment and
completely changed their attitude towards democracy and the way in
which the military operate in a democratic society, we see another
positive aspect of people coming from other parts of the world to study

hon. Members have rightly referred to the economic benefit of
international students coming to study in this country. The Government
estimate in 2009, produced by the Department for Business, Innovation
and Skills, was that this country’s higher education exports
came to a value of some £8 billion and could rise to
£16.9 billion by 2025. That is one of the most significant areas
of growth potential in the economy. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield) said, the University
of Sheffield has produced an important report on the economic benefits
that can arise from international students coming here.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:41:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson) referred to
the importance to the north-east of not only people studying and paying
for their courses—many British people do not understand that
international students pay fully for their course and, indeed, pay over
the odds compared with British people, doing so in advance—but
all the other benefits that come to the local economy. According to the
University of Sheffield’s study, the relevant figure for
Sheffield is £120 million a year.</hs_Para>

addition, we need to consider the wide range of subjects studied. Some
people want to say, “It is just about the brightest and the best
coming to the United Kingdom.” I wholly agree with those who
have said that it was absolutely right for the Government to deal with
issue of bogus colleges, but it is not just university degrees at
Oxford and Cambridge that we should be concerned with; this is also
about postgraduate studies at many different universities and the
English language. I would prefer people who are learning English around
the world to learn about taps, not faucets, and about pavements, not
sidewalks, because I would prefer them to have a British understanding
of the English language and get it from the horse’s
mouth.</hs_Para>

schools and universities have valued enormously exchange students
coming to the United Kingdom, and they are important in relation to the
shorter-term student visitor visa. There is not only an economic
advantage to consider, but a social advantage, in terms of, the quality
of the education students are able to get. If they are studying
international politics or history and people 
<?notus-xml column=1737?>come with completely different experiences from
elsewhere in the world, that enlivens, informs and improves the quality
of the education of British students in universities and colleges.
Also, this is about ensuring that we provide the strongest possible
opportunity for overseas students to develop their understanding of
what it is like to be in Britain and to do business in Britain. We hope
that they will then do greater business with us further in
the future.</hs_Para>

would also point out that, as many hon. Members have said, this is an
area of migration—if we want to term it as such—that is
warmly welcomed and accepted by the British public. Leaving aside the
matter of bogus colleges, where foreigners were exploited and not given
a proper education, and British taxpayers were exploited because proper
controls were not in place, it is warmly accepted in this country that
international students are important for our economy. If we are to
prosper in the future as a country that is in “a global
race”, to use the Prime Minister’s term, we have
to be able to compete for international students—for that market

Reckless</B> (Rochester and Strood) (Con):</Member> Does the hon.

stay on has been much of the reason why international students have
stayed, and that the Government have been right to crack down on
that?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000717" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000717"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Bryant" PimsId="2350" UID="13060646001524" xid="76" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646001524">Chris
Bryant:</Member></B> I want to see more evidence of precisely what the
hon. Gentleman mentions. I believe he has been in his Committee all
afternoon, so I understand why he has not been able to take part in the
whole of this debate, which is a shame. I merely wish to cite the
Government’s own Home Office paper from this year, “The
Migrant Journey”, which showed that just 1% of students who came
here in 2006 were permanently residing here five years later. So those
myths that have sometimes grown up of<I>—[Interruption.]</I>
There are others who are still studying and who have gone on to study
other courses, but according to the Home Office’s own report
only 1% are permanently residing. Some of the myths that have been
mentioned in previous debates about 20% or 30% of students staying on
afterwards are misguided.</hs_Para>

wish briefly to discuss the Government’s record.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:45:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Oxford West and Abingdon (Nicola Blackwood) referred to the Higher
Education Statistics Agency. Its figures showed, contrary to the
figures often provided by the Government, that the number of
first-year, non-EU, new-entrant students at universities was down by
0.4% in 2011-12. In particular, the number of postgraduate new entrants
has gone down from 105,195 to 103,150, which is potentially a worrying
trend that we need to examine for the future because it is the first
time there has been a fall in those figures for a decade—in
effect, for all the time that similar statistics have been
available.</hs_Para>

several hon. Members said, the number of students coming from India has
fallen by some 8,000. That number may have been made up for by the
number coming from China, but, as

Friend the 
<?notus-xml column=1738?>Member for Oxford East (Mr Smith) said, it was a sign of the
Government’s “forked-tonguedness” or two-facedness
that the Prime Minister actually had to go to India to say that there
is no cap on international students coming to the United Kingdom. There
may not be a legal cap, but it certainly feels as if there is a cap,
and the Government have to address that. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:47:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stratford-on-Avon said, if this is a growing market, we need to be
holding our market share, and that means advancing and not stepping
backwards. I would like us to increase our market share, because we
have a unique and very valuable offer, and this would be good for the
British economy. I worry that the way the Government’s
immigration target is crafted has made that more difficult for us to
achieve.</hs_Para>

Government have been clear about the need to bring control to the
immigration system, but we have also been clear about our wish to
welcome those whom we want in the country. A common view, which many
Members will share, was expressed particularly well by my hon. Friend
the Member for Croydon Central (Gavin Barwell), who said that his
constituents had voiced no concern either about those who come here to
study at our excellent universities, or about those who come here to do
highly skilled jobs in business. I agree with my hon. Friend. That is
why we have deliberately designed our system to attract people like
that, and to deter those who are not coming to work in skilled
occupations, or who are coming for other reasons.</hs_Para>

show that we have achieved that selective balance. The number of
university students and the number of people working in skilled jobs
have risen. However, as my hon. Friend said, it should also be borne in
mind that our constituents are anxious for us to have some control over
the system. We must design a system that attracts the best and the
brightest—to use the buzz words—from around the world to
study, and appeals to global companies based in Britain that want to
import some of their engineers and senior managers for a certain period
to run their businesses, while also deterring those who will bring no
benefit to the United Kingdom.</hs_Para>

about the cap. Is it not disingenuous, and the sort of misuse of

hand that there is no cap on the number of students coming, and on the

Harper:</Member></B> I do not agree, for the following reason. The
point was best made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:55:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds). There are two aspects to
this. First, over a period, international students who come here to
study and then go back to their home country make no contribution to
net migration at all, because they come to Britain and then leave. In a
steady state, therefore, they make no contribution to net migration at
all. My hon. Friend is right, however, that in a growing market, as a
consequence of the difference between those coming in a year and those
leaving in that year, there will be a gap, but it is only the gap that
contributes to net migration, not the total
number<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:55:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000744" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000744">One
of the complexities here is that the data on those leaving are not
brilliant. The Office for National Statistics, which is independent and
which measures the numbers of people coming to and leaving Britain,
measures those coming to study, but does not currently measure those
who were studying and left. One of the improvements it has made to its
system is that it is now starting to do that, and we will get the first
of those statistics in August, I think. Coming back to a point that the
hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) made,
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:56:15"></hs_TimeCode> will give
us a much clearer picture of how many students do leave each year, and
we will then get a much clearer idea of the impact of student numbers
on net migration. It is worth remembering that a lot of genuine
students are still in the UK quite a considerable time after their
arrival. According to one study quoted by Opposition Members, about 20%
of former international students are still in the UK although they
might not have decided to settle here
permanently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:56:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

important point shows why we need a robust system. The NAO study has
been quoted several times. In the past there were significant numbers
of purported students who were not here to study, but who 
<?notus-xml column=1741?>were working in low-skilled jobs, and significant numbers of students
were renewing their visas over a period of time without any academic
progression at all. It does no credit to our immigration system or our
genuine academic institutions that such abuse is
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:57:27"></hs_TimeCode>. We
must deal with that, as well as welcome those we want to welcome to

Joan Ruddock:</Member></B> I want to relay to the Minister my
experiences and those of my constituents in respect of those moving
from one course to a higher course who need to renew a visa. It is
taking at least three months, and during that time the student has no
access to their passport and cannot travel for academic or personal
reasons. Is the Minister really satisfied that that is good enough?

Harper:</Member></B> The point the right hon. Lady makes about
in-country performance is absolutely right; it is true that the
performance in the last financial year of what was the UK Border Agency
was not good enough, as I know very well from conversations and
correspondence with Members. Out-of-country performance has remained
very good, however. Part of the reason why the Home Secretary made the
changes she has made to the border agency was to fix the problems in
the UK visas and immigration part of the business. The good news is
that we have put a lot of resource and effort into turning that around,
and the performance of the Home Office for in-country
operations—which used to be a UKBA responsibility—has got
immeasurably better. The latest figures are much better. It has taken
some time to do that, but I ask the right hon. Lady to let me know of
any specific
outstanding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:57:25"></hs_TimeCode>

Bryant:</Member></B> The Minister slipped in the words “academic
progression”. I fully understand why, in the vast majority of
cases, someone would want to go from an undergraduate degree to a
postgraduate degree and so on, but there are cases, in particular for
vocations and some STEM degrees, where a student who had first done an
undergraduate degree in their home country might want to come to the UK
to study for another undergraduate degree, which would not count as
academic progression. I worry that people might therefore be being
excluded who would be perfectly decent and sensible to have studying
here.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000749" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000749"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:59:16"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Harper" PimsId="4788" UID="13060646001535" xid="841" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646001535">Mr

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:04:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Rhondda expressed two slightly different views. First, he said he
was pleased that international students are coming here on shorter
courses, but then he voiced some concerns. I hope he noticed that
yesterday we published some detailed research that I think makes it
clear that the visitor route is being used exactly as intended. It is
attracting high-value, low-risk migrants who contribute positively to
economic growth; in large part, they attend institutions that are
accredited by bodies approved by the Home Office, and most are doing
English language programmes or university exchanges. There is literally
no evidence of displacement from tier 4 into the student visitor route.
The number of students from countries where we have seen abuse under
tier 4 and where we have cracked down on that abuse is rising in single
figures—fewer than 10—so there is no evidence of further
abuse, which I think is very positive. It is perfectly proper that the
hon. Gentleman raised the question, but the evidence shows no risk at

have responded to the Select Committee reports and to each of the
Select Committees. The clearest response is this: we do not have a cap
on student numbers, and I do not think our net migration target means
that we will have to take action that damages universities.
Universities were originally concerned that having a net migration
target and counting student numbers, as all our international
competitors do, would drive the Government to take decisions on future
policy that would damage universities. The fact that we have stated
clearly that not only do we not have a cap but we are not going to have
a cap—that was stated not only by me but by the Prime
Minister—should reassure
universities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000764" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000764">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:07:07"></hs_TimeCode>

Bailey:</Member></B> Conscious of the time, I will be brief. I thank
everyone who contributed to the debate. When I applied for it,
my objective was a debate that was constructive in tone and would
enable us to discuss issues and to present facts and figures that are
not normally publicised to the extent that they should be. In its own
way, the House today may have helped to change the perception abroad by
making it clear that this House recognises and understands the
contribution that international students make to our economy and
welcomes
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:08:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000766" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000766">My
second point, however, is that the Minister has not really resolved the
contradiction at the heart of current policy. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:08:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield) said, it is
contradictory to say that bona fide students are welcome and there is
no cap on numbers and, at the same time, to say that there is a target
to reduce overall immigration to fewer than 100,000 and student visas
should be included in the numbers. The Minister exercised some
fairly sophisticated arguments in justification, but I put it to him
that, were he to undergo a credibility interview on that point, he
would find it hard to persuade Members and would-be international
students in foreign countries that what he said is the case.</hs_Para>

remind the Minister that the consensus that has emerged during the
debate is reflected more widely. Although I did not anticipate the
Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills coming to the
House to vote for the motion, his public utterances have
made it clear where he stands on the issue. The Mayor of
London—it shows how passionately I feel about it that I quote
the Mayor of London—has also made public statements in favour of
the arguments set out today, and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) has made similar
statements. When we get three such representatives across the political

Committee decided to conduct our inquiry because the available evidence
indicated that insect pollinators have experienced serious population
declines in the UK in recent years. For example, we heard—this
is quite shocking—that two thirds to three quarters of insect
pollinator species are declining in the UK. Indeed, the 2013 report
“State of Nature” assessed 178 bee species in the UK and
found that half were in decline. For the benefit of the House, I should
explain that insect pollinators include not only honey bees and wild
bees but other insects such as hoverflies, moths and butterflies. At
the moment, the honey bee is the sentinel species for all insect
pollinators, which means that most scientific studies involve bees, but
given the biological differences between the various insect
pollinators, it is vital that the Government monitor a wider range of
species. I hope that this is an uncontroversial point on which the

I have said, the Committee considered a range of factors that affect
insect pollinators, but we were driven to scrutinise the effects of one
family of insecticides—neonicotinoids—by the weight of
peer-reviewed scientific evidence. For Members who are not familiar
with neonicotinoids, I should say that they are a class of insecticide
derived from nicotine. Following their introduction in the
mid-’90s, they have been widely used in the UK on oilseed rape,
cereals, maize, sugar beet and crops grown in glass houses. The body of
evidence indicating that neonicotinoids cause acute harm to bees grew
appreciably in the course of our inquiry, as new studies were published
in heavyweight journals such as <I>Science </I>and <I>Nature</I>.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:21:52"></hs_TimeCode> this case,
harm to bees includes increased susceptibility to disease and reduced

experiments was too high. In response it is worth pointing out that

agri-chemical industry also likes to cite its own tests as proof that
neonicotinoids cannot harm bees. However, the industry studies by which
neonicotinoids were licensed for use in the European Union were not
peer reviewed and are not open to scrutiny due to the supposed

In the course of our inquiry, we heard that major do-it-yourself chains

from sale for domestic use, and supermarket chains such as the

research did not impress DEFRA, it led the EC to take action. The EC is
responsible for licensing chemicals for use in European agriculture. It
instructed EFSA to draw up new risk assessments for neonicotinoids in

April, there was intensive lobbying and negotiation in Europe. Indeed,
I went out personally to present our report to the European
Commissioner. Finally, the EC amended its initial proposal. It
recognised the need to delay the introduction of a moratorium to allow
the seed supply chain time to adjust, which was a recommendation of our

the debate, not least because I am a member of the Environmental Audit
Committee. I thank our Chair for the excellent leadership she has
provided with this report and others. She is right on the importance of
establishing a broad agreement, which the Committee did in its
report—we have always achieved such agreement in previous
reports, too. That is a good illustration of the Committee’s
effectiveness, which I hope will continue, because we will do important
work on investment in the green economy, which will result in a
thought-provoking and important
report.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000820" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000820">I
am a former farmer, so I am familiar with the pesticides argument. I
was principally a livestock farmer, but I could not escape other types
of farming. I fully support the report’s recommendations. It is
important that we recognise that bees are essential to our environment
and to successful farming. That is well illustrated by my
constituency—Stroud is recognised as world bee place. We have
done a huge amount of work to promote the protection of bees, including
wild bees, which are also at risk. I am extraordinarily proud of my
constituency’s bee protection
reputation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000821" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000821">It
is important to recognise that there are more threats to bees than
pesticides. We have heard about bee starvation and bee diseases such as
varroa—I hope I pronounced that correctly; as a Northumbrian, I
sometimes get my vowels slightly mixed up. We also know of a variety of
other threats to bees. We should recognise that the Government see the
problem and are taking action with the bee protection plan. I hope the
Minister outlines how extensive that plan is, because we need to
demonstrate that the coalition Government are determined to protect
bees.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000822" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000822">It
was disappointing that the UK did not vote in favour of the moratorium
on neonicotinoids, but the moratorium is in place. As our Committee
Chair correctly 
<?notus-xml column=1752?>noted, that reflects the concerns and interest the Committee has spelt
out. We had a lengthy debate on the seeds supply chain, and recognised
that, for any moratorium to be effective, it would have to start later
than we envisaged, which is right. It is good that Europe noticed that
as well. The changes our Chair outlined are extremely welcome. It is
good that the Government, through the field studies we have heard
about, are determined to recognise the importance of the impact of
neonicotinoids.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:40:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston) noted, there are too many
occasions when one wonders how much we really know about what is being
discovered or being hidden, so this matter would benefit from true
transparency. I urge the Minister and the Department to consider the
transparency of field studies, so that we know exactly what is going on
and what the tests reveal. As the Chair noted, maize in Italy did not
really suffer as a result of neonicotinoids being banned, but that is
just one example. Everybody would benefit from more study and a more
comprehensive understanding, including pesticide manufacturers. One
problem that has to be borne in mind is that banning one type of
pesticide might mean that other pesticides are used in an uncontrolled
way. We have to monitor the use of all pesticides, especially
when withdrawing neonicotinoids, as using different pesticides might
make matters considerably worse. I am sure the Government are minded to
do that.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:44:28"></hs_TimeCode> raises
an interesting point about what amounts to the devolution of the CAP.
From its inception, its impact has been characterised by either
dominant nation states promoting certain types of produce, or, as in
this case, by policy filtration, with different levels of government
influencing outcomes by changing the nature of the policy. That was
particularly prevalent in the early days in certain Mediterranean
countries with regard to olives and so on. We should recognise
devolution, but it is a double-edged sword. We in this country are able
to do the right thing, but can we always guarantee that that will be
the case in other countries that might have other priorities? I welcome
those changes in the CAP, but urge the Government to do as the 

<?notus-xml column=1753?>hon. Lady suggests. Indeed, I would go further
and argue that we need to amplify the CAP’s impact
environmental protection. It needs to be understood more clearly by the
wider public. If people understood its more positive implications and
outcomes, we could generate greater support for the
CAP<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:45:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000828" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000828">To
sum up, I think it is right to have the moratorium on neonicotinoids
and that it was postponed to allow the supply chain to adjust. It is
necessary, however, to maintain a weather eye on neonicotinoids, so I
welcome the Government’s commitment to field studies. It is
important that they be conducted transparently and that their outcomes
be made transparent. It is also important to recognise the value of
good management and the impact that the reformed CAP can have. I would
like more farmers encouraged down that path. In broad terms, we should
celebrate the fact that many organisations—including those in my
constituency I mentioned—are doing a lot of good work for the
protection of bees. We should be supporting and welcoming
those local solutions.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:46:31"></hs_TimeCode>Gardeners, too,
have a responsibility, because in the past they have used
neonicotinoids. It is important to recognise that all of us—I
indulge in a spot of gardening myself, though I do not use
neonicotinoids —should promote good practice wherever it is
necessary, and it is necessary in our gardens, as well as on
our farms.</hs_Para>

strongly support all the conclusions and recommendations in our report,
but my interest in what is happening to our pollinating insects goes
back quite a bit further than last November, when we started taking
evidence. In fact, it probably dates back more than 40 years to
when I was at agricultural school and undertook a course in apiculture.
The certificate I secured at the end remains a treasured possession.
More recently, about three years ago, that interest was further spurred
by a 2009 report produced by the organisation Buglife, which our Chair
has already mentioned, and the Soil Association. It was a review of the
scientific literature on a group of systemic pesticides called
neonicotinoids on non-target insect species.</hs_Para>

the combined evidence in the report was not conclusive, even at that

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:48:17"></hs_TimeCode>I secured a
Westminster Hall debate on the subject, which a surprising number of
Members from across the House attended to express their shared concern
about the potential threat posed by these pesticides to a vital group
of invertebrates—pollinating insects. Since that debate, thanks
to intelligence supplied by Buglife and other environmental
organisations, I have tried to keep track of further research and, when
significant, have drawn it to the House’s attention through
early-day motions and other parliamentary
means<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:48:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000832" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000832">As
our Chair said, last autumn, the Committee decided to conduct what has
turned out to be a major inquiry taking evidence from the organisations
she mentioned. 
<?notus-xml column=1754?>The first thing the Committee had to recognise was that many of our
pollinating species appeared to have been in decline for some time. Of
course, when we look at pollinators—especially any threats to
them—the first focus is usually honey bees. That has been
particularly the case in Europe and the USA in recent years, with
alarming reports of what is sometimes called colony collapse on an
international basis.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060646000833" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000833">As a result
<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>of their
economic significance, honey bees attract far more scientific attention
than any other pollinator. Their decline has been ascribed to a range
of causes—pests and diseases, such as the varroa mite, which has
been mentioned, along with weather conditions, poor nutrition, poor
husbandry, urbanisation, agricultural intensification, habitat
degradation and the use and misuse of pesticides. However, honey bees
are not the main pollinators in the UK—far from it. Ninety per
cent of insect pollination is done by the thousands of other, wild
pollinators—other bees, hoverflies, butterflies, carrion flies,
beetles, midges, moths, and so on. These other pollinators are not
monitored or studied like honey bees, so we do not know exactly what is
happening to them. However, we received disquieting evidence from some
witnesses of how, as the Chair has said, two thirds of wild pollinator
species are declining, including moths, butterflies, hoverflies and
bumble bees. We were told that of the 25 UK bumble bee species, two or
three—no one is sure because the research has not been
done—have already become extinct, while probably 10
others have suffered large range decline.</hs_Para>

were advised that DEFRA has a bee unit that does a good job of
monitoring honey bees. There are 70 Government scientists
dedicated to researching honey bees, but just part of one scientist
looking at the health of wild bees. That has to change. We cannot
afford to remain ignorant about our wild pollinators. That is why we
call in the report for DEFRA to introduce a national monitoring
programme to generate and monitor population data on a broad range of
wild insect pollinator species. If we do not really know what is going
on, we cannot make the right policy decisions to halt
decline.</hs_Para>

people looking at pollinator decline would come to the conclusion that,
at least in most cases, multiple factors are at play—those that
I have listed for honey bees and perhaps others. Most of our witnesses
who addressed the wider picture accepted that there were probably a
range of causes. However, the representatives of mainstream farming and
especially the agrichemical industry were absolutely adamant that the
decline had nothing to do with pesticide use and
especially not the use of neonics. Our Chair has described how
neonicotinoids work, which I will not repeat, but I will add that they
are systemic, which means that they get into every part of the plants
that are treated with them. Pollinating insects absorb them and carry
them back to their nests or hives, even though they are not the target
species<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:52:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000836" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000836"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dame Joan Ruddock" PimsId="491" UID="13060646001562" xid="516" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646001562">Dame

looked at the pesticide approvals regime at EU and UK levels, and found
a system flawed at both. Put simply, it works like this. The chemical
company puts together the scientific data to support its application
and submits a dossier to the regulatory authority in any EU member
state. That authority’s experts make their own assessment, which
is set out in a draft assessment report. That is then reported to the
European Food Safety Authority, which conducts a peer review by experts
from other EU countries. Its conclusions are sent to the Commission,
which makes a proposal—for approval or not—to the Council
of Ministers. After approval, companies can apply to the regulatory
authority in any member state for permission to market their product.
The regulatory authority in the UK is the chemicals regulation
directorate of the Health and Safety Executive. The CRD prepares a
scientific evaluation, which is considered by the Advisory Committee on
Pesticides, which is a statutory, independent body that advises
Ministers on whether approval should be given.</hs_Para>

the face of it, the whole thing sounds quite rigorous, but we found
significant flaws. First, as our Chair said, the pesticide
manufacturers that commission the research to submit to the regulators
keep control of that research. In practice, that means that the data on
safety under which a chemical is licensed are not put into the public
domain, denying effective academic access and, therefore, independent
criticism. In contrast, some of the academics who gave evidence to us
reported that their research was openly published, which meant that
where it showed a link between pesticide use and pollinator decline,
defenders of the agrichemical industry would go through their work with
a fine-toothed comb looking for a way to rubbish it, sometimes
deliberately misinterpreting it to do so. We believe that it should not
be beyond the wit of humankind to ensure maximum transparency without
threatening genuine commercial
sensitivity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:54:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000840" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000840">Another
problem with the process is that, up to now, the EU approval system has
explicitly addressed only the risk to honey bees. That probably would
not be too bad if the honey bee were one of the more fragile and
sensitive pollinators. If that were the case, and it survived exposure
to a product, it would be likely that other, tougher pollinator species
would be fine. In fact, we heard evidence that the honey bee is
probably the most robust of the pollinators when it comes to pesticide
exposure. Bumble bee research, for instance, shows the clear
detrimental impact of neonicotinoid use.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:55:21"></hs_TimeCode>Some
pollinators, such as hoverflies, have very different life cycles from
any bees, and therefore have different exposure routes. Such
pollinators remain unconsidered at present. We urge DEFRA to introduce
a representative range of sentinel pollinator species in UK pesticide
risk assessments, and to work for the same arrangements across the
EU.</hs_Para>

also came across an example that showed that, however good the approval
system might be in theory, it can fall down badly in practice. The

Germany’s regulatory authority produced the draft assessment
report. One of the properties to be assessed was the propensity of the
pesticide to accumulate in soil and water, and the

the UK. The results of the tests were misreported in the draft

Alan Whitehead</B> (Southampton, Test) (Lab):</Member> It is true to
say that very little of what is discussed in this Chamber is beyond
dispute. Indeed, only on Tuesday, a scientific hypothesis that has been
shown to be supported by 97% of scientists writing about it in a review
of 12,000 papers—namely, anthropogenic global warming—was
nevertheless merrily being debated by hon. Members as though that near
certainty did not exist. Questions 
<?notus-xml column=1757?>concerning what is happening to bees and pollinators, what the causes
are and what role pesticides may or may not play in the problems that
we have heard this afternoon are occurring with bee populations are far
less certain than that. It is thus potentially a matter for a great
deal of dispute.</hs_Para>

want to reflect on the related problem that we as legislators have in
addressing those issues and deciding how best to take action on them.
The Select Committee’s work on this issue was an exemplar of how
to go about that when the members themselves are not experts.
Interestingly, however, as we have heard, the Environmental Audit
Committee has rather more experts on it than one might think in respect
of those who hold a certificate in apiculture. Also, several members
are active or former farmers who have a great deal of knowledge and
information about how these things work in general. The Committee did
not go about its business in any kind of sensationalist manner. It
operated carefully, quietly and at some length, seeking a large range
of thoughts, opinions and experts in order to shed some light on what
is a very knotty problem.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060646000853" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000853">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:02:10"></hs_TimeCode>
problem was well summed up in a book published recently by the Canadian
author, Douglas Coupland. He posited as a starting point of his novel
that bees had been declared extinct. Then, across America, five people
were found who had been stung by bees, and they were all arrested and
immediately investigated by scientists on the basis of that apparently
counter-scientific fact relating to the continuous existence of bees.
Douglas Coupland was, I think, a little unscientific in setting out a
world in which there were no bees, without taking account of the large
number of other pollinators that exist alongside bees.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060646000854" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000854">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:03:09"></hs_TimeCode>
know from the evidence produced before the Select Committee that the
problem is not just about honey bees; in fact it is not just about bees
as it is about all the pollinators that operate in our environment in
such a fundamentally important and basic way to ensure that our
ecosystem continues in a recognisable way. If the sort of declines that
the Committee heard about are to continue at the same rate over the
same sort of period, not just several bumble bee species but large
numbers of bumble bees will be extinct.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060646000855" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000855"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>The
Committee was told that 600 solitary bees can pollinate as well as two
hives containing 30,000 honey bees, so it is not just about honey bees.
As our Committee Chairman mentioned, they are a sentinel species, but
it is nevertheless the case that hoverflies, butterflies and all sorts
of other pollinators are in steep decline. We were told that 66% of
larger moth species in the countryside are declining, as are most of
the bumble bees—we were told that six species had declined by at
least 80% in recent years. As we have heard, hoverflies are declining,
and 71% of butterfly species are declining at an alarming rate. We do
not have data on the vast majority of the other pollinators, and we
have to take some of those sentinel species as indicators for those
other species, but we certainly do know that something is beginning to
go seriously wrong with the species that pollinate our crops, flowers
and food.</hs_Para>

I do not think the Committee had a choice in the conclusions it might
reasonably draw from the material presented to it, given that, as
legislators, we have to 
<?notus-xml column=1758?>make choices when we are not necessarily complete experts in a subject.
We are responsible for what happens and we have to take the best shot
we can in terms of getting the best evidence available to inform our
judgments. The evidence that came before the Committee demonstrated
clearly a strong relationship, not only where neonicotinoids were used,
but, for example, where crops were routinely dusted. Farmers cannot
purchase oilseed rape seeds in this country that have not been dusted.
Whether or not they think there is a problem with their crops, they
simply have to plant those crops, which have, systemic within them, the
effect of the neonicotinoid with which they have been dusted.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060646000857" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0003.htm#13060646000857">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:04:24"></hs_TimeCode>
Committee heard about the various studies done by Henry, Whitehorn and
Gill, which demonstrated a strong causal link between neonicotinoids
and an effect on bees in a laboratory. We also heard about the
continued difficulty in conducting adequate field trials. One person
who contributed to our evidence suggested that getting scientific
certainty from field trials would cost about £20 million and
take 10 years, if that is what one wanted to do. So we cannot deal in
absolute scientific certainty on these things and, in terms of decision
making, nor should we.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:07:54"></hs_TimeCode>The conclusions
that the Committee reached on what should be done about neonicotinoids
are absolutely right, given what we, as legislators, are charged with
doing. I continue to be a little dismayed about the extent to which it
appears that this is not quite the route the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is taking in its representations on
pesticides, pollinators and bees.</hs_Para>

welcome the notion that further, and, we hope, much less flawed, field
trials will be carried out urgently, which can get further indicators
to the fore. I also welcome the idea that we should try to ensure that
integrated approaches are brought to the fore in the future management
of pesticides. It has been implied—the Committee unanimously
felt that this was not the case—that there are no alternatives
to neonicotinoids if they are taken off the roster of usable pesticides
for those plants. I hope that we can use different methods of pesticide
management and ensure that the crops are well maintained, with advice
and assistance from DEFRA, in a way that a number of people say is not
possible to do.</hs_Para>

a world in which there is an enormous amount that we do not know. I
hope that DEFRA will monitor developments involving non-bee pollinators
much more closely, will keep them well to the fore in terms of the
views that it expresses and the action that it decides to take, and
will continue to look at the evidence that is being produced about
elements that are thought to be having an impact on colony decline. I
hope that its consideration will bring together such issues as varroa
mite habitats, food availability, husbandry, and, indeed, climate
change, in order to create a more complete picture of what is going
on.</hs_Para>

emphasise again that we do not know the details of what is going on. We
do not know what is the prime cause of decline. What we do know is that
there is a decline, that it is very serious, and that we can do things

report. It does not seek to provide all the answers; it does not look
for a silver bullet; but it does suggest that there is a strong case
for taking action. I hope that DEFRA will take precisely the sort of
action

McCarthy</B> (Bristol East) (Lab):</Member> The debate about
pollinators and pesticides tends to be seen as a debate about bees and
the decline of our bee population, but, in fact, more than 250
pollinating insects are threatened with extinction, including more than
50% of all wild bee species. A third of European butterfly species are
in decline, with about 10% at risk of extinction. Over the last 70

about 400,000 species of flowering plants. While some rely on wind to
move pollen and a much smaller number rely on water, the vast
majority—about 90%—depend on animals and insects to
transfer pollen between flowers. The considerable decline in
pollinators to which some of my hon. Friends have referred today poses
several risks, but in particular it poses a risk to our food supply.
Bees are thought to be responsible for the pollination of about a third
of the food eaten by the world’s population. Twenty per cent. of
the UK’s cropped area is made up of pollinator-dependent crops,
which include most fruit and vegetables.</hs_Para>

confess that, as became clear when I met representatives of Friends of
the Earth to discuss their campaign, I tended to think of bees as
flower pollinators, and had not really thought about the food chain.
However, almost all blueberries, grapefruits, avocados, cherries,
apples, pears, plums, squashes, cucumbers, strawberries, raspberries,
blackberries and macadamia nuts, along with many other
products—I think that cabbages were mentioned—depend on
the foraging activities of bees. Moreover, pollination is responsible
not just for the quantity of food but for its quality, in terms of both
taste and nutrients. Watermelons that are visited more frequently by
pollinators tend to have darker fruit with a richer flavour. It is
estimated that without bees, the availability of vitamin C could drop
by 20%.</hs_Para>

decline in pollinators also poses an economic risk. Their value to the
UK Government is conservatively estimated to be £430 million per
annum. Unless we halt the decline in British bees and other
pollinators, our farmers might have to rely on hand pollination, which
could cost farmers £1.8 billion a year in labour and pollen
alone. That is increasingly happening in China, causing food prices to
rise.</hs_Para>

I want to turn to the issue of pesticides. It was remiss of me not to

non-professional plant protection products that contain neonicotinoids,

final point is about the EU vote. As we have heard, the UK Government
were one of eight Governments who voted against a ban, but thankfully
the vote was carried by a narrow majority and the UK will not be able
to opt out. The press has carried reports of intense secret lobbying by
British Ministers on behalf of chemical companies in the run-up to the
vote. In a letter released to <I>The Observer</I> under freedom of

those of us who have been waiting for the Government to step up to the

vote against the EU ban on neonicotinoid insecticides came as a blow.
Thankfully for the bee population, the weight of support for the ban
among other EU member states enabled the European Commission to proceed
with a two-year moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids, but the
UK’s action confirmed the Government’s fundamental

Ministers are hiding behind the need for what they call “clearer

attempted to discredit the findings of the European Food Safety Agency,
which concluded that the insecticides represented a “high acute

they were based on the results of lab tests rather than “field

say, the study was brushed hastily under the carpet and Ministers were
forced to stop touting it as sufficient proof that a ban was
unnecessary, but the disregard for suggestive evidence that
neonicotinoids cause harm and the massaging of scientific evidence to
suit current policy causes real concern. Most troubling is that the
Government have completely missed the point: in this situation, given
the potential truly devastating 
<?notus-xml column=1763?>effects of bee decline, it is the Government’s duty to act with
appropriate caution—a duty they have utterly failed to
recognise. In other words, DEFRA Ministers must apply the precautionary
principle, as set out in the 1992 United Nations Rio declaration and
the Lisbon treaty. It is not for the Government to entertain a
value-based preference for false negatives—a desperate
willingness to conclude that neonicotinoid pesticides are safe when
they might not be. As the Environmental Audit Committee report

countries have always had a reputation for thorough scientific
research, real concern for the environment and respect for the

the Government must seize the chance to make a fresh start. The

crops attractive to honey bees will provide an opportunity for DEFRA

positive action that demonstrates the UK’s appreciation of the
seriousness of bee decline and its commitment to working to reverse it.
It will also demonstrate the UK’s support for the work of the

the decline in bee numbers and a recognition of the complex factors

the point was to show what would be available to eat in the event of a
world that no longer had bees. That was a very clever, though
frightening, way of getting the point across. I can assure Members that
people did finally come forward with the toast, butter, honey and jam.
They made the crucial point that neonicotinoids and pesticides were

agricultural practice in the UK and across Europe; the growth in
monocultural crops; the removal of hedges and other wildlife corridors;
the increased use of fertilisers, pesticides, insecticides and
herbicides; bee pests, including the Varroa mite and deadly pathogens
such as Nosema; and the effect of climate change on patterns of
flowering, hibernation and food availability. Those are all
contributing to falling populations of bees and other pollinator
insects. I have frequently voiced the opinion that if we allow
ourselves to see the moratorium on neonicotinoids as a silver bullet
for bee decline, we become complacent, think “Job done,”
and fail to address the many other important issues that we face.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:37:49"></hs_TimeCode> is clear that

comprehensive set of UK-wide measures in place to tackle the many
drivers of pollinator decline. Though Ministers have cited a number of
Government-led initiatives to improve bee health, these ultimately fail
to meet the scale and urgency of the task in hand. Current failure to
tackle habitat loss, which needs to be approached from both a
conservation and a planning perspective, is a prime example of where
the Government are failing to make headway.
On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:38:36"></hs_TimeCode> the

“Biodiversity 2020”, they have not set out specific
measures to help threatened bee species or to protect or restore
habitats most important to bees, such as lowland meadows and upland hay

exposure is too low. That is where we must do a lot more work, and that

done by FERA was by no means a satisfactory field trial. We never
pretended that it was; it had to be done quickly to meet a
timetable—set not by us, but by others—to give at least
some indication of whether that correlation was there. Incidentally, I
will not accept criticism of FERA scientists on that basis. They are
extremely good and do their work in a totally dispassionate and
independent way on the best scientific principles. They were asked to
do a quick piece

NHS England is starting, because it intends to use historical budgets,

will not be sufficient for training. The

effectively is if the hub can train up more people in the spokes to
deliver the more complex tools. Complexity is at the heart of the

disability equipment is to be commissioned
nationally—incidentally, another is artificial eyes, the
national centre for which is based in my constituency. It would be

stroke patient will receive a relatively straightforward medical
diagnosis—it might be a devastating incident in their personal
life, but its medical nature is relatively simple. None the less, what
will restore the power of communication to someone who has lost it will
be a complex piece of kit, yet under the current rules, as I understand
them, it would be commissioned in the spoke. If the skills are not
there to utilise that piece of equipment, that stroke patient will not
benefit, so complexity of need has to be balanced by the complexity of
the product being supplied. That is crucial.</hs_Para>

other issue on which I want to draw out the Minister is the concerns of
worried providers in the voluntary sector about their ability to bid
for commissions from NHS England. There has been a long-running battle
over whether AAC should be based in the education or the health sector.
It is now clear that it will be based in the health sector, but one of
the key elements of what NHS England seeks to commission is an
educational component in a multi-disciplinary team. That component is
most often found in organisations such as the ACE Centre, the Dame
Hannah Rogers Trust, near the constituency of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:10:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston), or the Percy Hedley school, up
in the constituency of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:10:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Blaydon (Mr Anderson). They all have immense expertise,
yet they greatly fear that the mood music emanating from NHS England
suggests that they will be unable to bid for such provision, because of
an understanding that it must be supplied by an NHS provider. That
seems strange, given all that the Government have said down the years
about trying to ensure a broader spectrum of provision—that more
civil society organisations can provide such services. I hope the
Minister can provide some reassurance on that.</hs_Para>

would also like a commitment from the Minister—this is another
fundamental aspect—that this really is a health issue and no
longer just an education issue. I hear far too many heartbreaking
stories of children who are equipped with complex equipment when in
school but, because it is funded by the Department for Education, lose
it when they leave. It is not just a piece of kit they are losing; it
is their ability to express themselves as fully formed adults. That is
why it is so important that this becomes a health issue, not just an
education issue.</hs_Para>

final query is rather technical—I beg the Minister’s
forgiveness, but this goes back to acting like a statin in NHS England.
A clinical reference group has been set up, but it has yet to
meet—it is in a form of limbo, as it were. There is yet greater
uncertainty, not merely because it has not met, but because the
gentleman who chairs it, one Dr Thursfield, is shortly to retire from
his academic post at the University of Birmingham. There is grave
concern that his uncertain status in the clinical reference 
<?notus-xml column=1776?>group is imperilling its ability to meet, take
decisions and do its job. Alexis Egerton—the gentleman I
mentioned earlier—was disappointed not to be appointed as a
patient representative on the clinical reference group. I have known
Alexis since my youngest days. He did his PhD on the funding of AAC
provision, and it would be immensely valuable to the Government and the
nation as a whole if we could find a way to allow him to play a role in
that.</hs_Para>

want to ensure that the Minister has time to respond fully—will
he bear in mind that the right to have a voice is a fundamental human
right? We have an opportunity in this place to represent our
constituents. If, in doing so, we give a voice to some who hitherto did
not have one, we will have spent a useful half-hour in this debate. I

the Member for Blackpool North and Cleveleys (Paul Maynard) for raising
this issue, and for his work, together with that of colleagues, as a
member of the all-party parliamentary group on speech and language
difficulties. An occasion such as this is particularly valuable, as was
the meeting that we had yesterday, in ensuring that Ministers focus on
issues that might otherwise not get attention. I learned a lot from the
meeting yesterday, and from my hon. Friend’s impassioned speech
today. He clearly speaks with real authority on this subject. I was
struck by his point about the lad who ended up with a PhD as a result
of the support that these facilities can provide. He made the point

specialised areas of health and education provision. The number of
children who will require support in this way is relatively small,
perhaps less than 0.5% of the population, so it is important that we do
not lose sight of them. My hon. Friend rightly made the point that the

that it should be recognised as such.</hs_Para>

revolutionised the support that can be given to those who have lost, or
never had, the tools of speech and language that allow us all to
interact and that are critical to development, to education, to work
and to living one’s life. Augmentative and assistive

in the past has not always been of sufficient consistency and quality,
and the Bercow review in 2007 and the subsequent work of the
Communication Champion, Jean Gross, have helped to identify systemic
improvements, culminating in a new approach to the commissioning of AAC

system is in its very early days. I was pleased that my hon. Friend
acknowledged that it had the potential to work effectively. It is
perhaps understandable that we have not got it quite as we would want
it to be, given the early stage that we are at, but I agree that it has
enormous potential. There is significant clinical consensus behind the
new approach, and I am proud to say that it has been developed from the
new structures of commissioning that this Government have introduced

April this year, NHS England took on responsibility for the direct
commissioning of specialised assessment and the provision of
augmentative and assistive communication aids for adults, children and
young people. NHS England’s role as an independent national
commissioner is particularly suited to the effective commissioning of
extremely complex, yet relatively low volume, services of this kind.
Let us bear in mind that the patients who require AAC aids have
extremely complex needs and in many cases require bespoke equipment
that has been designed for them.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:19:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston) mentioned the training involved in
the use of such equipment. It could not feasibly be provided by
small-scale local services. Assessment and provision is needed by
specialised tertiary providers with their concentration of
expertise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:19:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000968" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0004.htm#13060646000968">Previously,
we had no national commissioning of AAC services and improvement across
the board was essential. There was no standard or nationally
consistent definition of those services, which were the commissioning
and funding responsibility of the NHS. The effect of that was variation
in the organisations commissioning and funding specialised AAC services
and, crucially, inequitable access to them. There was a mix of non-NHS
commissioning agencies, including social care and the education sector,
to which my hon. Friend referred, and charity and third sector funding
agencies that were commissioning the assessment and provision of
specialised AAC aids. It was haphazard, depending very much on where
people lived. That was unfair to those in need, and far from ideal for
commissioners or providers.</hs_Para>

changed. NHS England—committed to ensuring national consistent
commissioning of high quality, equitable and effective specialised
services—has 
<?notus-xml column=1778?>worked with the expert partners on its clinical reference group for
complex disability to develop for the first time a nationally
consistent specification for specialised AAC aids, which was subject to
public consultation. The specification has allowed a clear demarcation
of the responsibilities of clinical commissioning groups in relation to
less specialised AACs—around 90% of the total provision. The
highly specialised services will be commissioned by NHS
England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:21:32"></hs_TimeCode>. It will
be an important role for NHS England to work to support CCGs in their
commissioning of the less specialised end of the spectrum and to ensure
that we build capacity rather than lose it, as my hon. Friend feared
could happen. If we get this right, the potential of having this
specialist team working nationally with local commissioners could be
significant.</hs_Para>

implementing the specification,
NHS<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:22:04"></hs_TimeCode> England will
draw on the recommendations of the Bercow review and the Government
communication champion to consider, in particular, how best to ensure
more consistent and responsive commissioning of AAC aids across England
and the implications of meeting unmet need. We know from recent
research from Communication Matters that there is variation in service
provision across England—the postcode lottery to which I
referred—and inconsistency in identifying, assessing and
providing AAC services.</hs_Para>

key priority is therefore to ensure that commissioning arrangements for
this specialised service are placed on a much more robust and equitable

reference groups and area teams to identify areas where there may be
inequalities and where additional resources may be required to
bring about better access. The clinical expertise both embedded in the
organisation and accessed through its close association and close
partnership working with organisations such as ACE—Aiding

this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:23:18"></hs_TimeCode>. I met

would also like to acknowledge the potential benefits of clinically-led
commissioning of services for children with special educational needs
as part of new joint arrangements, which will also provide far more
tailored support, focused on the health and lifestyle outcomes for the
child, for the developmental needs of children who require AAC aids.
The Children and Families Bill sets out a framework for a new
integrated approach to meeting the needs of children and young people
with special educational needs. This will include many children,
potentially the majority, of children in need of AAC
aids.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060646000973" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/debtext/130606-0004.htm#13060646000973">In
brief, the Bill’s provisions will get clinical commissioning
groups and local authorities—and, in some cases, the NHS
Commissioning Board, where it is acting as a commissioner of services
for a child or young person—to enter into joint arrangements to
assess, plan and commission the services needed by children and young
people with special educational needs. Each child’s improvement
outcomes, and the services they need to deliver them, will be captured
in the education, health and care plan, to which the relevant
commissioners will contribute. That is a much more joined-up approach

specifically required in the mandate for the NHS—the
Government’s priorities—the need for improvement, through
partnership working, to support children and young people with special
educational needs and disabilities, and for ensuring that children have
access to the services identified in the agreed care plan. AAC support

recognised that it is important to get it right and to assess the level
of need so that we can identify how much needs to be spend on it. This
is not a done deal and he should not assume that this is the end of the
story. He also made a point about organisations with great expertise
which could be excluded from being able to play a part in this. I can
reassure him that they will be able to bid to do work. He also made the
point about loss of equipment on leaving school, and it is really
important that that is avoided; that sort of thing is utterly crazy and
we must ensure continuity. As he rightly said, this is a health issue
and it must be recognised as such. He talked about the hub-and-spoke
issue. The relationship between the expert team nationally and the CCGs

under your chairmanship, Mr Bayley, in this important debate. I am
pleased to see the Minister here, as well as the colleagues from the
Select Committee on Home Affairs who said that they would come. I pay
tribute to those Committee members who participated in drafting and
agreeing the report:
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:30:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Members
for Northampton North (Michael

Walsall North (Mr

commend the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:31:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) and our colleague

hon. Member for Oxford West and Abingdon, who first pressed for the
inquiry. The hon. Member for Cambridge is in his place. Like me, he is
torn between two debates in the House on Home Affairs. We are occupying
the time of Home Office Ministers in both Westminster Hall and the main
Chamber: gladly, not the same Minister. I am also grateful to Committee
staff, particularly the specialist Ellie Scarnell, for all their hard
work.</hs_Para>

Committee’s report, published on 3 December 2012, is entitled
“Breaking the Cycle”. It is our first report on drugs for
more than a decade; the last time we considered the issue, in 2002, a
young Member of the House, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr
Cameron), was on the Committee, which should give other Committee
members heart that they have a great political future ahead of them. We
spent a year looking in depth at drug education, prevention and
treatment for drug addiction, at reducing the supply of drugs in both
the United Kingdom and abroad and at the evidence on which drugs policy
was based. We visited two countries: Colombia, where we travelled into
the jungle to see where cocaine is produced, and Portugal, to examine
the drug laws there. We had nearly 200 evidence submissions and 48
conclusions and recommendations. We heard views from people as diverse
as Sir Richard Branson, Russell Brand and Peter Oborne. The
ex-president of Switzerland, Ruth Dreifuss, also gave evidence to the
Committee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000009">This
debate, for which we canvassed so many people’s support, is
current. Just today, there was a letter in <I>The Times </I>calling for
an independent review of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, signed by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:33:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) as the former leader of the
Green party, Professor David Nutt, Sting and 
<?notus-xml column=266?>many others, including
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:33:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cambridge and myself. Public response to the report has been
overwhelming. Society cares deeply about the issue, because it affects
us all and the costs are borne by each and every one of us. In the
United Kingdom alone, drug addicts commit between one third and one
half of all acquisitive crime, and drugs cost our health and justice
system £15.3 billion a year.</hs_Para>

has become a feature of reports by the Home Affairs Committee and other
Committees that we do not just make recommendations; we also monitor
them to see whether they have been implemented. I call it our traffic
light report. Each recommendation is awarded a colour: red when the
Government have done nothing about it, yellow when they are moving in
the right direction and green if the recommendation has been accepted.
After all—you will know this, Mr Bayley, from your distinguished
service on Select Committees —there is no point in
having a Select Committee  inquiry, going into a subject in
depth and providing recommendations if nobody wants to implement
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000013">I
am pleased to say that the Government have accepted or partially
accepted just under 50% of the conclusions and recommendations in our
drugs report. That is not as much as in other reports, but they are
moving in the right direction. It was, however, disappointing that they
rejected our main recommendation calling for a royal commission,
although I warmly welcome the Deputy Prime Minister’s support
for it.</hs_Para>

State, Home Department, the hon. Member for Taunton Deane  (Mr
Browne), who is here today, is following our recommendations and
considering drugs policies abroad, visiting countries such as Denmark
and Sweden. In particular, I am glad that he is considering visiting
Portugal, or may have done so already; we will hear his travel plans
and where he has been in his speech. We visited Portugal, as I have
said, and saw at first hand what the Portuguese are doing. I hope that
when he went to Portugal he met, or that if he goes to Portugal he will
meet, Dr Fernando Leal da Costa, the Portuguese Health Minister, who
was kind enough to attend our drugs conference in September and give
the 200-plus attendees a fascinating insight into the impact of their
policies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000015">We
decided to call our report “Breaking the Cycle” because
we identified a number of critical intervention points where, if the
right action is taken, the devastating cycle of drug addiction can be
broken. The first critical intervention point is during childhood.
Prevention is better than cure, and the education system has a vital
role to play in ensuring that children and young people resist peer
pressure and understand the risks involved in taking drugs. We found
that drugs education provision was patchy. The Department for Education
noted that most primary and secondary schools provide it once a year at
most. A number of our witnesses were highly critical of the quality of
awareness provided in the 
<?notus-xml column=267?>education system. In some cases, they believed that it was likely to
inspire children to take drugs rather than the opposite.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060639000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000016">The
Government have now told us that education will be their focus in the
third year of the drugs strategy. In our view, we cannot wait three
years for a resolution to the issue. This is the earliest possible
chance to break the cycle of drug addiction, and we cannot squander it.
Local authorities are being left to decide and fund the most
appropriate way of educating children about the dangers of drugs. As
focus rightly moves from enforcement for possession to tackling supply
and demand, it is vital that our children are aware that there are more
risks to drug taking than just being
arrested.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000017">Another
critical intervention point is recovery from addiction. In 2011-12,
some 96,070 people were given a prescription for a substitute drug as a
method of treatment. Another 30,000 people were given a prescription
and some sort of counselling. Only 1,100 people were in residential
rehabilitation.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060639000018" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000018">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:40:14"></hs_TimeCode>
the Government are serious about their policy of recovery, they must
improve the quality and range  of treatments available. There
is an over-reliance on prescription treatment, and no recognition of
the importance of also treating the psychological symptoms of
addiction. Each individual needs a treatment plan tailored to their
needs. Intensive treatment is more expensive in the short term, but if
it breaks the cycle of drug addiction, the long-term benefits to
society are enormous and the cost to society is greatly
reduced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000019">Treatments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:40:14"></hs_TimeCode>
that we know work, such as residential rehabilitation and buprenorphine
as an alternative to methadone, are under-utilised. In 2011, more than
400 deaths were related to methadone. Treatment must also be
supplemented by housing, training and employment support, if required,
because the end goal of recovery is integration into society. A league
table of treatment centre performance should be established so that
patients do not waste time and money on care that is not up to scratch.
The Department of Health and the Home Office should lead jointly on
drugs to ensure that the focus on recovery is maintained. If we reduce
demand, we automatically reduce
supply.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000020">Many
groups are working hard to bring such matters to the
Government’s attention, and we met some of them during our
inquiry. I want to commend the work being done by Mitch Winehouse, and
the living memorial that he has set up to his daughter Amy. He has been
one of the most vocal and articulate voices about the provision of
rehabilitation support to so many
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:41:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000021">Prison
is another critical intervention point. Tackling drug addiction, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:41:53"></hs_TimeCode> Secretary of
State for Justice has said, is vital to the prevention of costly
reoffending. Some 29% of prisoners reported having a drug problem when
they arrived in prison, 6% developed a drug problem after having
arrived and 24% reported that it was easy or very easy to get drugs
there. Last year, Her Majesty’s chief inspector of prisons, Nick
Hardwick, reported an increase in the number of people in prison with
prescription drug
addiction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000022">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:42:44"></hs_TimeCode>
Committee visited Her Majesty’s Prisons Brixton and Holloway,
and we were impressed by their voluntary testing schemes, which were
having a real impact on 
<?notus-xml column=268?>addiction. I want to thank the governors of Brixton, Edmond Tullett, and
of Holloway, Julia Killick, for helping to make that happen. We were,
however, concerned that funding for such schemes was under
threat.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000023">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:43:51"></hs_TimeCode>
welcome the Justice Secretary’s commitment to a rehabilitation
revolution, with inmates being met at the prison gates to be given
support. To identify those who need rehabilitation, we need compulsory
testing on entry to and exit from prison, including for the use of
prescription drugs. We must also ensure that the voluntary sector, with
its valuable experience, has a chance to win rehabilitation contracts
against large procurement companies such as G4S that are cheaper but,
frankly, just do not have the
expertise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000024">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:43:47"></hs_TimeCode>
Committee’s visit to Miami alerted us to the epidemic scale of
prescription drug addiction in the United States. More than half of
American drug addicts are prescription drug addicts. It is difficult to
measure the exact scale of the problem in the UK, because treatment is
by general practitioners and is not treated as drug addiction. However,
valuable reports by newspapers such as <I>The Times</I> highlight that
it is a ticking time bomb in British society that we are doing very
little to address. It is a problem not just in our prisons, but right
across the

prescription drugs are a powder keg awaiting a spark, legal highs have
already exploded. In 2012, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and
Drug Addiction identified 73 new drugs in Europe, which is 10 times the
number of new substances identified in 2006. A survey on the drug use
of 15 to 24-year-olds found that 8% of them had taken a legal

drugs market is changing, and as well as warning our children of the
dangers of heroin, cocaine and ecstasy, we need to worry about the
creation of a culture in which people can order so many legal highs for
next-day delivery through the internet. The Government have introduced
temporary banning orders, but just last month Maryon Stewart, who gave
evidence to our inquiry, found legal highs on sale on Amazon. There are
200 different substances that are not covered by our drug laws, and we
do not know the dangers of those psychoactive substances because,
clearly, we have not tried them. Temporary banning orders work, and
once a substance has been banned it can no longer be used, but what are
the Government doing about the five substances that are created for
every one that is
banned?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000028">New<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:48:32"></hs_TimeCode>

plans, because I know how much he likes staying in his constituency,

he did so assiduously, but we should look

future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:48:06"></hs_TimeCode>. I urge
the Government to follow our recommendation to make retailers liable
for the harms caused by untested psychoactive substances that they have

faulty car, legal high sellers should be accountable for the effects of
their
products.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000029">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:48:32"></hs_TimeCode>
cost of ineffective drugs policy reaches far wider than the United
Kingdom. During the Committee’s visit to Colombia, we witnessed
how the devastating impact of drugs extends far beyond the addict. In
2010, coca was cultivated on 149,100 hectares in Andean
countries—an area roughly one and a half times the size of Hong
Kong—that cannot afford to fight the drugs war on their own. The
value of the global cocaine market is £543 billion, while
Bolivia’s national budget, for example, is just £1.69
billion. Despite damage to their land, farmers receive only 1% of the
revenue from global cocaine sales. When the Committee met the President

judges and his citizens should die in the war on drugs when members of
the British public were the ones who wanted to use those drugs. The

the best way forward was to bring all the people with great expertise,

aspects of drugs policy, so that there is a proper debate. We do not
want a situation in which politicians run away as soon as the word

that we thought about that, which is why we suggested that it should

want to begin with the basic principles of how we start to work. First
and fairly obviously, drugs are harmful. They are harmful whether they
are legal or illegal; whether they are cocaine, marijuana, paracetamol
or one of the new legal highs. They all have harms, and many of them
also have benefits. As we say in one of the key parts of the report,
the question is how we deal with those harms. Paragraph 14 of the
report
states:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13060639000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000106">“Drug
use can lead to harm in a variety of ways: to the individual who is
consuming the drug; to other people who are close to the user; through
acquisitive and organised crime, and wider harm to society at large.
The drugs trade is the most lucrative form of crime, affecting most
countries, if not every country in the
world.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13060639000042" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000042"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:50:00"></hs_TimeCode>The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:50:00"></hs_TimeCode>
principal aim of the Government drugs policy should be first and
foremost to minimise those harms, but how do we go about doing that?
How do we reduce the harms from alcohol and heroin and the harms from
prescription drugs, which can be abused? For more than 40 years now,
the answer has principally been to separate drugs into a category of
legal or illegal—I use the term loosely of course because the
drug itself cannot be legal or illegal, but possession can be. For the
illegal ones, we have focused principally on the criminal justice
approach—policing, courts, prisons and all the sanctions of the
Home
Office.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000043">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:59:33"></hs_TimeCode>
the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 was passed—interestingly, it has
never been reviewed since 1971—the debate was all about how it
would lead to the end of the use of illegal drugs. That was the
Act’s aim. It certainly has not worked in that respect. If we
were in a world now where no one had any of the drugs for which
possession was illegal, we would be having a very different
debate.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060639000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000044">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:59:58"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:00:04"></hs_TimeCode>
Act simply has not worked, and that has been very expensive. The
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has estimated
that 0.48% of the UK’s GDP is spent on our overall drugs
strategy. I think that that is the highest rate of expenditure in
Europe, and yet for many drugs, we have among the highest rates of use
in Europe. We are spending lots of money, but there is lots of drug
use—the Act is just not working.</hs_Para>

the process, we have hit many people’s lives. We have left
people to languish in jail for a long time. Also, we have made people
who possess small amounts of drugs go to jail, and many of them suffer
problems trying to live and work afterwards. Even a caution for the
most minor offences can still affect people’s ability to live
and work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:00:44"></hs_TimeCode>. So we
need to change things.</hs_Para>

have heard it said—there is some basis for saying it—that
drug use is currently down. However, that is only true when looking at
the drugs that we have made illegal. What we know—as the Chair
of the Select Committee highlighted—is that there are now many
other new psychoactive substances that people are moving to because of
the pressure that we are putting on for legal reasons. We have no idea
whether encouraging 
<?notus-xml column=272?>people to stop taking marijuana and to start taking one of the new
things that they can find legally online somewhere is better or worse
for them. We have no idea whether the harms caused by the other drugs
will be better or worse. So we may well be pushing people to things
that are far worse than the things that we are trying to clamp down
on.</hs_Para>

also have to look at this issue in the round. We have to look at the
pressures of alcohol. I asked one of the police officers who gave
evidence if his officers would rather face, at the end of an evening, a
group of four men who were drunk or a group of four men who were
stoned. Most police officers would far rather deal with the people who
had used marijuana. We have to look at the impacts of some of these
other issues.</hs_Para>

the Chairman of the Select Committee quite rightly said, one of the key
things that we say is that we need to look again at this issue. These
days, we do not allow legislation to sit by for 40 years without
looking at it; we try to have post-legislative scrutiny to see whether
a law is working and doing what it is supposed to do. That is why the
Select Committee has called for a royal commission to look at the
Misuse of Drugs Act
1971.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:02:22"></hs_TimeCode> That is
what our report says, and we are not the only people saying it by any
stretch of the imagination.</hs_Para>

Transform and Release.

agree completely with that. To start off by putting treatment as the
principal aim rather than the criminal justice focus is exactly what

hon. Friend the Minister has been to Portugal already, and I am sure
that he will talk a bit later about what he saw there. When our
Committee went to Portugal, we saw a few things that were really
striking. The Portuguese model is often misdescribed. In Portugal, it
is still an offence to possess large amounts of any drug and it is
still a criminal offence to supply drugs. The key difference is that
possession of a relatively small amount of any drug—up to 10
days’ personal supply, and there are estimated figures for what
that amount is—is treated outside the criminal justice system.
There are dissuasion commissions that deal with those cases in a
non-judicial way; there is no criminal sanction and the focus is on
treatment. The aim is to have individualised care, to make sure that
people can get out of using drugs.</hs_Para>

very frustrating that sometimes they would have to wait for two days,
which would be amazingly fast for many of the people in my constituency
who I have spoken to. So Portugal has this process whereby people who
are addicts are pushed towards treatment. There are other ways that
they can be dealt with, but none of them involves dealing with the
criminal justice process and none of them affects people’s
ability to work, except in a very few special circumstances.</hs_Para>

Portuguese approach was controversial when it was established but it
seems to have worked, and there are a number of ways to look at it.
According to the official Portuguese figures, the number of long-term
addicts has declined from more than 100,000 people before the new
policy was enacted, which was about 10 years ago, to half
that number today. The Portuguese have also found less drug use in

a point of asking everybody whether they agreed in principle with the

did so. We spoke to the police, who had originally opposed it, and they
said, “Actually, this has been better for us for policing. We
don’t have to spend so much time on people who are addicts, who
are small users. Instead, they can help us to deal with the people who
are dealing, who are causing the higher-level problems with gangs and

met a gentleman who leads a non-governmental organisation that is
staunchly anti liberalising the drugs policy—it was the closest

principle of focusing on not criminalising people in possession has
already been accepted by the Government in a different context:
temporary class drug orders, 
<?notus-xml column=275?>brought in a couple of years ago to allow the temporary ban on drugs
while we are trying to find all the evidence. The Government have made
it an offence to supply large amounts of such drugs, but not an offence
to possess small amounts. All I am suggesting is that we apply the same
principle to other drugs, because it has been found to work in
Portugal, to be publicly accepted and to have good
outcomes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:11:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000067">I
am keen on an evidence base. There is a fantastic piece of evidence
from the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic used to have no criminal
sanction on possession of small amounts, but in 2001 it changed the law
and criminalised possession, and there was a big debate. The sort of
arguments were made that might be expected, with people saying that if
possession were criminalised fewer people would use drugs, people would
be healthier and better, and there would be less drug use—all of
that sort of thing. The Government there did something that Governments
rarely do and set out their hypotheses, worked out how to measure and
test them, and published a proper impact analysis, internationally
verified, of their
predictions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:12:32"></hs_TimeCode>.

me finish by mentioning supply, because drugs are not just a UK problem
but a huge international problem. Although we have had 50 years of
criminalisation, illicit drugs are now the third most valuable industry
in the world, after food and oil. That is incredibly damaging. We
tracked the routes for cocaine, as our Committee Chair said. We went to
Colombia to see where it was grown; to Florida, where we saw how the US
military tried to combat it; and we saw the customs’ efforts to
try to stop it flooding into the US. I spoke to parliamentarians from
west Africa, looking at that stage of the process. In Portugal, cocaine
is coming into
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:16:46"></hs_TimeCode>. The
message at every stage was clear: supply cannot be stopped. It can be
squeezed in various ways. For example, massive military efforts can be
made in Colombia to reduce the amount of coca plantation, but it moves
to a neighbouring country. Interdiction can used and the navy can block
one side of central America, but it goes to the other side or takes an
air
route<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:17:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060639000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060639000076">It
was astonishing to see the mini-submarines now being created by the
Colombian drugs lords, which cost about $1 million and have a range

Africa—they have tried to combat that—drugs are now being
flown back from Portugal into west Africa. On asking, we were told,
“We think it is because the drugs are returned  to the
sender if they are not of good enough quality.” If people think
it is safe enough to transfer drugs internationally that they can have

new police and crime commissioners, who will have some responsibility
for funding, and the new health and wellbeing boards. In the case of
the facility that I visited, the PCC will have to liaise with nine

ideology and not on looking at the individual needs of each person. For
some people a life of abstinence would be appropriate; for others, a

expressed by the Committee, and this afternoon by its Chair, about how
that method of funding might hamper small providers. It is also
important that support is given to a range of commissioning bodies to
enable them to sort through the data on what is effective. Given the

course, we all want to see fewer people taking drugs in the first
place, and I will concentrate for a few moments on the need to have
more effort directed at prevention. I agree with the Committee that
drugs prevention and education are the strands of the drugs strategy to
have had least work and least interest. In the review of the drugs
strategy, the Government could identify just two areas of progress:
they had relaunched the FRANK website, and they were reviewing the
curriculum for
schools<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:33:43"></hs_TimeCode>. Since
then, the curriculum review has finished, but my understanding is that
there will now be even less drugs education in the science curriculum.
That cannot be seen as progress. At the same time, the Government have
abandoned Labour’s plans to make personal, social, health and
economic education a statutory requirement for schools and have closed
the drugs education

Previously, when there was a problem with prioritising drug treatment
within the NHS, Ministers came together to form the National Treatment

work in schools and education and in public health, so perhaps the

I want to discuss the problem of the new psychoactive substances. The
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is now
monitoring 280 new substances throughout Europe; 73 new
substances came on to the British market last year, and they are now
freely available from 690 online shops. In addition, the Angelus
Foundation, which has already been mentioned, reports that there might
be up to 300 “head shops” selling those substances on the
UK high street. The figures are truly shocking and will terrify every
parent in the country, but even those figures do not quite show how
readily available the drugs are through peer-to-peer selling in
schools. As the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee mentioned, even
Amazon was recently selling the drugs, and some online sellers are
sending out free samples to children once a new compound arrives from
China<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:38:27"></hs_TimeCode>. Our
understanding of the dangers of legal highs has been greatly enhanced
by the work of the Angelus Foundation, and I pay particular tribute to

daughter, Hester Stewart, a medical student, from the legal high GBL in
2009.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060643000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060643000009">As
we heard, the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:38:44"></hs_TimeCode>
Government have introduced temporary banning orders to make such drugs
easier to prohibit. The Home Secretary promised that they would allow 
<?notus-xml column=282?>for swift and effective action. In two years, however, one temporary
banning order has been used, during a period when more than 100 new
legal highs have emerged on the market. I understand from the press

first thing we need to do to get better understanding of the harms of
such drugs is, as the Select Committee said in its report, to improve
data collection on drugs. Nowhere is that more pressing than with the
new psychoactive substances. First, we need better information about
their prevalence. I am very concerned that those drugs are not being
properly recorded in the Mixmag drug survey or the British crime

need to understand the harm they cause. I have heard from front-line
practitioners in addiction services and A and E that they are
encountering more and more people who have taken legal highs, but that
is anecdotal and we need proper data collection. If someone presents to
A and E having taken a legal high, that should be properly
recorded.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060643000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060643000012">Thirdly,
we need the major databases to work together. For the last year, I have
tried to ascertain how the EMCDDA database liaises with the Home
Office’s much-touted early warning system. Last year, I asked
why it was monitoring 13 substances when the EMCDDA had 47
on its list, but I have still not received a satisfactory explanation.
I would also like to know how the Home Office’s system is
informed by the TICTAC database of toxins, which is run by the NHS, and
the National Poisons Information Service’s TOXBASE. In the past,
work on collecting data was done by the Forensic Science Service, but
it has been disbanded. I hope that the Minister will explain who is
doing that work
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060643000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060643000013">This
week, the Government announced that they will finally ban Benzo Fury.
It is clear from the letter that the Home Secretary received from the
Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs that there are real concerns
that the system that has been set up is failing. The drug has been
putting people in hospital since 2009, when it was first reported to
TOXBASE, and since then there have been 65 more referrals. Will the
Minister explain the point of a temporary banning order if it takes
four years from the first hospital admissions to a ban on the sale of
the drug on the high street? No deaths from this drug have been
reported in the UK, but deaths have been reported in other countries.

extreme libertarians may not accept the harm premise, or they may

<?notus-xml column=284?>extremely harmful, and that it is in the interests of the Government and
Parliament to try to reduce the harm caused by drugs that may sometimes
lead to death, or to severe injury and disability that may last for the

a few people reach for the view that there is a right answer and a

a royal commission or some other august body of dispassionate people

has done the work before us and it could tell us the right answer,
which we could adopt and solve all our problems. My experience of this
difficult area of policy making is, sadly, that it is far more
difficult and complicated. Many well-meaning, expert and informed
people can come to different conclusions about how best to address the
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060643000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060643000025">There
are reasons for cautious optimism about Government policy and its
impact on society, and about how society is evolving in comparable
countries, particularly in our part of the world. There are signs of
progress. Some may be a direct result of Government intervention and
some may arise from the evolution of society, which is less easy to
attribute directly to Government action. However, there are reasons to
be cautiously optimistic, and I will come to them
shortly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060643000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060643000026">If
there was a straightforward answer—for example, to decriminalise
drugs—it would be a persuasive path for many people, but we have
just heard from the Chairman of the Select Committee that when it went
to Miami it saw the chronic problem of people addicted to
decriminalised legal drugs. One issue in this debate is the growing
problem of legal highs. In this country, consumption of illegal drugs
has reduced, but consumption of legal drugs has increased. That
presents all sorts of thorny and interesting public policy issues, but
does not automatically lead to the conclusion that the more drugs we
legalise, or at least decriminalise, the better the effect on public
health. The effect may be better—I am not ruling that out
altogether—but I caution everybody in this debate not to leap to
immediate conclusions about public policy outcomes, because in my
experience, the more carefully one looks at the issue, the less obvious
the conclusions become.</hs_Para>

complicated it is. He talked about it not being straightforward, so

Browne:</Member></B> I think that that is a good argument for elected
politicians, including those who have participated in the debate this
afternoon, to devote more time to thinking seriously about the subject.
The point I was making about a royal commission was that we can put
together an expert body of men and women who are full of integrity,
knowledge and decency, and they could spend a long time thinking about
the issue, but they would not produce “the right answer”,
because I fear that the right answer does not exist in that form. They
would produce a series of interesting observations and recommendations,
which may match, to a high degree, the series of interesting
observations and recommendations that the Committee made in its report.
We would then have a debate along the lines of the one we are having
this afternoon. As I said, although a royal commission would be a good
opportunity for stimulating debate, I do not think that it would in
itself necessarily reach the outcomes that we seek, because I am not
sure that the outcomes are ever fully
attainable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:52:15"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:53:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060643000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060643000032">A
number of other issues have come up. The Government’s strategy
has three prongs: reducing demand, restricting supply and building
recovery. In addition, we have always said that we are open to learning
from best practice in other countries. I have had the opportunity to
travel, as recommended by the Committee, to Portugal, and last week I
spent 24 hours in Denmark and 24 hours in Sweden. During the remainder
of the year, my plan is to visit South Korea, Japan, the United States,
Canada, the Czech Republic and Switzerland.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:54:30"></hs_TimeCode>We should be
open-minded to the ideas that such other countries have come up with,
because they are broadly equivalent to us in their economic and social
development, and they are confronted by the same problems as us in
terms of drugs policy. There is no reason to believe that every good
idea in the world originates in this country, and they may well have
ideas that we can learn from.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge dwelt particularly on that
country. I will write a report when I conclude the process, so I will
not do a running commentary on a weekly basis. I thought Portugal was
interesting, but I was perhaps slightly less bowled over by it than I
might have expected to be, because in some ways, the Portuguese 
<?notus-xml column=286?>codify what, in practice, happens to a large degree in this country
anyway. People<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:59:26"></hs_TimeCode>
might think that that is quite interesting in itself. The fact that
Portugal has made that formal codification is a significant step, but,
in practice, there are very few people in Britain who are in prison
merely for the possession of drugs for personal consumption. People are
in prison because they have stolen money to buy drugs, or because they
have supplied drugs to others, but most people in Britain who present
with a severe heroin addiction, for example, are treated. We try and
find ways of enabling them to address their addiction and, in time,
recover from it, rather than treating them straightforwardly as
criminals. Therefore, the gap between what happens in Portugal and what
happens in practice in the United Kingdom is perhaps not as great as
some might say.</hs_Para>

was interesting, for example, to talk to the Portuguese about the
impact of changes in their laws on infection and blood-borne illnesses
caused by the injection of drugs. They had a very big rise in instances
of HIV infection in intravenous drug users, and when they changed the
laws, there was a dramatic fall. It is a striking graph—like a
mountain, it goes up and then comes down, and there is a clear
correlation. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:56:25"></hs_TimeCode>
only thing I would say is that their starting point was higher than the
United Kingdom’s. They then went to a point that was
dramatically higher than the United Kingdom’s, and they have now
come down to a point that is just higher than ours—but they are
still higher than us.</hs_Para>

a number of reasons, we have never had that level of infection in the
intravenous drug-taking community. Because the scale of our problem is
dramatically different from the scale of the problem that they were
confronted with when they changed the law, we should not automatically
assume that changing the law would have a similar impact on infection
rates in this country.

interesting lessons to learn from talking to people in other countries,

days-worth of personal drugs consumption was thought by the Minister to
be a high figure. There was a lobby or case for reducing that to five,
or even possibly three days. I suppose that if someone who was minded
to transport drugs for sale to others had 50 days-worth of supply that
they wanted to take to another house five minutes’ walk away,
they would be better making that journey five times, with 10 days-worth
on them each time, because they would then not be breaking the law.

particularly school pupils experimenting with drugs has fallen

that there is not much time left to teach children some of the core
academic subjects that parents rightly expect them to be taught. There
is a genuine debate about whether schools are there primarily to create
good citizens or to educate children in core areas of academic
knowledge. There is scope for a bit of a trade-off. Most people would
want their children to be adept at maths, English literature and other
typical academic subjects and to be rounded citizens at the same time,

We have had that debate in Government. I accept, as I think most people
do, that it represents progress when we take someone whose life is
chaotic, who is a drug taker and who is unable to work or to take
responsibility for themselves in quite elementary ways and we stabilise
their life—perhaps through some programme of replacement drug
treatment—so that that they can perhaps address some of their
underlying social problems and, in time, find a job. I would not want
the Government to fail to recognise that, because a lot of people,
including in the voluntary sector, work to try to bring about that
progress, which leads to improved outcomes for the people affected and,
in many cases, for their spouses, their children and others around
them.</hs_Para>

only caveat that I would enter is that the Government are cautious
about regarding that as a desirable end point. Although some people may
struggle to get beyond that point, most people—if they were
talking about their own children, for example—would regard it as
a desirable interim point. Ideally, however, they would like the end

later, they are living an ordered and managed life on drugs, one could

Gentleman’s question is yes, it is wrong. It is a source of
great regret and sadness that someone might go to prison, not as a drug
taker or drug addict, and become one while they are there. I recognise
there are practical difficulties with trying to restrict drugs in
prisons, and people find ingenious ways to smuggle drugs into prisons,
just as they find ingenious ways to smuggle them into other places, but
the Government are doing work, as we should be, to try to reduce that
threat.</hs_Para>

I am saying is that we could just as well do random testing throughout
the period people are in prison. I have been told that if we tell
somebody they will be tested on a set day, they may take steps to make
it less likely that drugs will be detected in their body on that day.
We are not, therefore, against the idea of testing prisoners, and we
are strongly in favour of trying to ensure that people do not take
drugs in prison, while those who might be minded to take drugs are
dissuaded or prevented from doing so, but the proposed testing regime
would not necessarily automatically have the most successful
outcome.</hs_Para>

States of America and I am visiting both Colorado and Washington state,
which are the two states that have voted to legalise cannabis. I was in
Denmark last week and the mayor of Copenhagen is keen to legalise
cannabis, but the pretty liberal Danish Government are keen to remind
the mayor that it is not within his power to legalise cannabis and that
it is not a policy that they want to
pursue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060643000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060643000070">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:21:23"></hs_TimeCode>
point is that the public policy debate around cannabis is evolving. The
potential health harms caused by cannabis are greater than when it was
a much less powerful drug. People sometimes talk about cannabis as
being the softer end of the drugs market and say that cannabis could be
legalised while everything else is kept illegal as if it were a benign
drug and all others harmful. If that were once the case, it is less the
case now. Cannabis does have cause to concern
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:21:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060643000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060643000071">I
move finally on to psychoactive substances, which is a whole new area
that is evolving a lot. It is good that we see significant reductions
in people consuming heroin and crack cocaine, which are very harmful
drugs, but new psychoactive substances are a fast-evolving threat to
many people. In the most tragic cases, some people have died after
taking such drugs. People sometimes assume—this is interesting
for public policy—that because something is legal it is safe.
People have quite paternalistic assumptions about the state even when
they are not necessarily minded to believe the Government in other
areas of public policy. Just because something is legal, that does not
mean that it is safe to
consume.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060643000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060643000072">Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:27:56"></hs_TimeCode>
such drugs get under the barrier by claiming not to be for human
consumption and serious harm has been caused to people by consuming
so-called novel psychoactive substances. We have tried to adapt how we
respond to such substances to take account of their fast-moving nature.
As has been mentioned, we have introduced temporary class drug orders
and just this week the Government laid such an order in my name that
will take effect from 10 June for two groups of NPSs known as NBOMe and
Benzo Fury<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:23:34"></hs_TimeCode>. We
are discussing families of drugs, because, as has been said, these
chemical compounds can be manipulated and form whole categories of
drugs. We therefore do not 
<?notus-xml column=293?>just ban street names or individual drugs; we ban groupings of drugs to
try to stop people breaking the spirit of the law but staying within
the letter of the law. The problem, however, is constantly mutating and
we want to maintain the academic rigour that enables the ACMD to
consider such matters at length while also having the speed to deal
with evolving threats more quickly than it otherwise could. That is why
we have the temporary orders lasting 12 months and a more considered
process following on from
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:24:18"></hs_TimeCode>. I do not
pretend that this is an area in which any country does not have public
policy challenges to consider. How such drugs are couriered and
supplied is also a potential new cause for concern, because people
order them on the internet and the drug smuggling does not take the
familiar, conventional
form<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:24:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060643000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/halltext/130606h0001.htm#13060643000073">This
is a big area of public policy and there are some causes for cautious
optimism. Some drug consumption trends in this country are positive. If
they were going in the opposite direction, I suggest that there would
be far more Members at this debate and a bigger clamour to ask the
Government what they were doing about increases in heroin or crack
cocaine consumption. We should momentarily reflect on the good news and

began with an orientation debate on Commission proposals to regulate
statutory audits. In a full round table, most member states were
prepared to accept the principle of mandatory rotation, with some
arguing for a longer period before mandatory rotation, or for a
narrower scope. I intervened on a similar vein to this. Some member
states remained opposed. On non-audit services, all member states
supported the principle of a blacklist only of prohibited services, but
with many stressing the need for the list to be more limited, with some
pushing for alignment with international standards. I agreed with the
principle of a blacklist only, though expressed reservations on any cap
in non-audit services. On a final point on the role of the European
Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) in pan-European audit regulation, a
majority of member states supported the European Board of
Auditors’ Oversight Bodies (EBAOB) solution already proposed by
nine member states, citing cost and independence as key concerns. I

next substantive item concerned Single Market Act I and II, with the
presidency and Commission outlining progress made over the last six

previous evening on the same subject, which I attended. The main UK
messages highlighted the importance of creating the right environment
for industries to be competitive, while questioning the need to set a
20% target for industry’s share of the economy. The presidency
summed up the discussions in the first agenda item after lunch,
reporting on the consensus of the importance of re-industrialisation as
a means for employment, and that technical change had opened up various
new opportunities which the EU is well placed to benefit from. There
were also comments on the importance of energy costs, and the
revolution caused by shale gas in the
US.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="13060640000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/wmstext/130606m0001.htm#13060640000113">The

modernisation of EU copyright law, with the Council updated on progress

Commission updating the Council on their ongoing “Licenses

Vitorino on his recent report on private copying and reprography
levels. There was a general consensus among member states that the
copyright framework needed to be updated to better suit the digital
age, and that this work should be based on sound evidence, guided by
the principles of technological neutrality, promoting legal offers and
providing the necessary protections for creators. Response to the
Vitorino report was varied, with the UK’s view that any work in
this area should commence after the pending European Court of Justice
rulings in this area. This was echoed by many member
states.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="13060640000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/wmstext/130606m0001.htm#13060640000114">The
final substantive agenda item was a general approach on state aid, with
the presidency presenting the current text of the two proposed
regulations as a finely balanced compromise. Most member states
endorsed the current text, though with some opposing the procedural
regulation. Other member states intervened to seek further detailed
changes, though were not met with much support. In a broader debate on
modernisation, a wide-ranging discussion took place. A significant
number of member states asked for further flexibility regarding the
Commission’s proposed ban on regional aid to large enterprises
in “C” regions. The UK intervened strongly on this point,
and also to welcome the regulations as a useful contribution to
improving state aid procedures and that state aid was to be used only
to address genuine market failure. The presidency concluded that
agreement had been reached on the regulations as proposed, and noted

the space items, the Council adopted conclusions in response to a
Commission communication on “EU Space Industrial Policy:
Releasing the potential for economic growth in the Space
sector”. 
<?notus-xml column=111?>The Council took note of a proposal for a space surveillance and
tracking support programme. Under AOB, the Commission briefly presented
its proposals for the funding and operation of the
European Earth monitoring programme (Copernicus) 2014-20 (previously
known as “GMES”). Their latest proposal reflected the
agreement made at February’s European Council that Copernicus
should be funded from within the multi-annual financial framework
(MFF). It would provide a solid legal base from which to launch the
next set of satellites in the “Sentinel” series and
support the delivery of downstream applications that would foster
economic growth. The Commission emphasised the importance of a swift
negotiation on the regulation in order to ensure the programme could
launch at the beginning of 2014. The space discussion closed with a
short update from the Commission on work to re-evaluate the
relationship between the EU and the European Space Agency (ESA). The
Commission argued that reciprocal access to the respective
decision-making bodies was essential for the relationship to function

presidency updated Council on progress in negotiations with the
European Parliament on the Horizon 2020 Regulation and associated Rules
for Participation Regulation. The presidency noted that seven trialogue
meetings had been held with the European Parliament, and that
negotiations were now entering a critical phase if a deal was going to
be delivered by the end of June. They believed that a compromise
package could secure an agreement which did not alter the
Council’s agreed position on the reimbursement model. The
Commission reiterated the importance of simplification; this was
essential to make life more straightforward for participants, and widen
participation by reducing barriers to entry. The Council then broke for
lunch. After receiving a short presentation from the CERN Council on
the European strategy for particle physics, the presidency hosted an
informal discussion between heads of delegation on their strategy for
the Horizon 2020 negotiations. The UK intervened to support the
presidency’s aim of securing political agreement by the end of
June, while recognising the need to demonstrate a willingness to
compromise on several issues of importance to the European Parliament.
Following this discussion the Council reconvened. The presidency
concluded without further discussion that a large majority of member
states had subscribed to their proposal that simplification and the
“flat rate” funding model should be defended and that in
exchange the Council could show flexibility on other issues, such as
widening participation, a fast track to innovation instrument, some
earmarking in favour of renewable energy research, and stronger support
for SMEs. As a result of the discussion the presidency noted that they
would intensify negotiations with the European Parliament with a view
to securing an informal agreement by the middle of
June.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="13060640000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/wmstext/130606m0001.htm#13060640000126">A

targets to be met by 2020. The targets are based on the proportion of
children living in households with relative low income, combined low
income and material deprivation, absolute low income and persistent
poverty (all before housing costs have been taken into account).
Estimates of these are published in the National Statistics Households

(or ‘equivalised’) for household size and composition, to
provide a proxy for standard of living. The most recent figures showed
that 300,000 children

matters but considering this in isolation fails to properly reflect the
reality of child poverty in the UK today (as shown in the reduction of
children in poverty as median income drops). We want to develop better
measures of child poverty which include income but provide a more
accurate picture of the reality of child poverty. Our consultation on
how best to measure child poverty closed on 15 February. A large volume
of responses was received and all of these are being read and analysed
to ensure that all important points are captured and used to help
Ministers decide on the next steps.</hs_Para>

Webb:</Member></B> Support with mortgage interest (SMI) is not a stand
alone benefit but is a component of income support, income-based
jobseeker's allowance, and income-related employment and support
allowance and state pension credit. The level of these benefits depends
upon the circumstances of the individual case. For example, whether the
claimant is single or has a partner, whether they have children,
whether someone has a disability. It also depends upon the amount of
the SMI to which they are entitled.</hs_Para>

Health Improvement’, published in March this year, contained an
ambition to reduce unwanted pregnancy in women of all ages. The
document highlights that there is evidence that provision of
contraception, particularly long acting methods of contraception,
supplied or fitted by the abortion provider can reduce repeat
abortions. It also highlights the evidence base for reducing teenage
conceptions and why it is vital to continue to make progress in this
area. The Department will review progress on all the ambitions in the
Framework and a wider set of indicators, including repeat abortions and
teenage conceptions, on an annual
basis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060672000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/text/130606w0002.htm#13060672000154">In

Grant:</Member></B> There is no evidence to suggest that introducing
fees into the employment tribunals will disadvantage or deter women
from bringing claims, including discrimination or pregnancy-related
claims. The aim of introducing fees is to transfer some of the cost of
administering the tribunals from the taxpayer to the users of the
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060672000272" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/text/130606w0002.htm#13060672000272">For
those who cannot afford fees, a fee remission scheme will operate to
ensure access to the tribunal is not affected. Women are more likely to
fall into the lower income brackets so they are more likely to qualify
for partial or full fee remissions. As a consequence they are unlikely
to be detrimentally impacted by the introduction of
fees.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060672000273" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130606/text/130606w0002.htm#13060672000273">Further
