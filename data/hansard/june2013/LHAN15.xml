Popat:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government take the issue of late
payment very seriously. We recently transposed a European directive to
combat late payment into UK law. The amended legislation came
into effect on 16 March this year and builds on existing UK
law. It further strengthens the legal obligation on payment terms,
including a statutory obligation on public authorities to pay
commercial creditors within 30
days<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T14:38:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Harrison" PimsId="860" UID="13061174000302" xid="1256" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000302">Lord
Harrison:</Member></B> My Lords, the prompt payment code has been a
palpable and egregious failure. Only one in five of Britain’s
limited companies and only two out of 42 police authorities have signed
up to it, leaving most small businesses £45,000 short in their
ability to invest. While it is welcome news that the Government are
implementing the March 2013 late payment legislation, failure has
occurred so far. Therefore, could the Government put teeth into the
legislation prepared by the Labour Government? Secondly, will they
consider encouraging credit capital markets to be available to small
businesses in the same way as they are in America, to allow small
businesses the ability to
invest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T14:39:14"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Popat" PimsId="5792" UID="13061174000303" xid="2062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000303">Lord

signing up to it. With regard to the public organisations, including
police authorities, we are taking every action possible. My colleague,
the Minister Michael Fallon, has written to them, giving them 90 days
to ensure that they sign up to the prompt payment code. With regard to

payment schemes, which offer suppliers the option of early payment in
return for a discount or a fee, as long as that is offered in
conjunction with fair payment

They all have one thing in common: not one of them is working. The
money simply is not getting through. If large organisations could be

immediately. Here is an idea: why not make it compulsory for all

80% of their invoices within five days. We are promoting a culture of

O'Cathain:</Member></B> My Lords, I ask my noble friend whether it is a
great thing that 75% of the FTSE 100 who actually pay have
subscribed to this code? First, a code is a code, not a law.
Circumstances are such now, with austerity in such a state, that we 
<?notus-xml column=1509?>ought to look at this seriously. If 75% of the FTSE 100 pay on time,
that still leaves one in four of our major companies that do not. I
also support the point that my noble friend raised: is the Minister

time, not the ones that do

Popat:</Member></B> My Lords, at least 80% of invoices are paid within
five days by government departments. In March 2013, the biggest paid
97.1% of its invoices within five days. Although 75% of FTSE 100
companies have signed this code, we are doing everything possible to
encourage and support the other 25% who have not signed. However, there
is a good chance that these companies do not supply that many goods and
services in the UK, even though they are FTSE 100 companies listed in

the buyer. Quite often there is an agreement to make prompt payment,
and if there is early payment a discount is offered by the supplier to
the buyer. Factoring is very common; most banks like to factor
invoices, rather than provide additional funding in the form of an
overdraft. That is because factoring brings their capital back more
quickly than an overdraft facility
would.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_11_PT_1/AFDFF43DBC654042D352E2226DEFE40A3E8E81E6" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 June 2013">Tuesday,

point about the danger of internet pornography, which is a much bigger
issue than just in schools. We are working with the industry, through
the UK Council for Child Internet Safety, to make it easier than ever
for harmful and inappropriate internet content to be filtered from home
broadband and all devices. The top five ISPs have committed to having
parental controls in place by the end of 2013. On 18 June, the
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport will meet internet
businesses to see what more they can do to tackle illegal online

changes in the Government’s regulations concerning night
shelters, why are homeless people who were in shelters now on the
streets? In the light of the Anglesey judgment is there not an urgent
need for the Minister to issue new guidance to close a revolving door
which has sent vulnerable people, many of whose lives were, in any
event, in freefall, back on to the streets, sleeping rough on park
benches or in shop doorways or seeking hospital beds, and which in
Salford precipitated the closure of Narrowgate, the only night shelter
serving Manchester and Salford, which has, in the past, helped more
than 2,000 people? To protect the homeless, do we not need to rapidly
hammer out a humane and just solution, with new guidelines issued to
local authorities and to charities working with the

particular finding which might apply to a few other places. However,

stated in the register. I know that the Minister understands that many
homeless organisations are trying to move as many people as possible
from hostel accommodation in to independent living. However, does he
realise that that is now being put at threat because of the changes to
the benefits system and, of course, the bedroom tax? In Newcastle, the
local housing company has had to warn the Cyrenians, which is the
biggest supplier, if you like, of work with the homeless, that it is
coming to the stage where it will not be able to allocate any

I find it hard to answer the specific point. On the point about hostels
for the homeless, our best estimate is that there are about 9,000

be affected by this particular provision. Authorities need to look at

is a dwelling for which housing benefit is payable. Clearly, there are
other ways to provide support for night shelters where they are not
dwellings. As I said, that is in the Supporting People programme and in
the homelessness prevention budget, which are the two large budgets.
There may be a small number of the 9,000 or so bedroom spaces
where one has to look carefully at what is the appropriate funding,
but a large amount of effort is going into supporting rough
sleepers and to make that provision. If the effect of this is to
upgrade the provision of beds for those who are sleeping rough, that
might be a rather good
outcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:07:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000060"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McKenzie of Luton" PimsId="1827" UID="13061174000360" xid="1824" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000360">Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister said that
homelessness was a priority for the Government. It is interesting to
note that, after years of declining trends, 2010 marked the turning
point when all forms of homelessness began to rise. Does the Minister
accept that for many, a period of stay in a shelter is the first step
to being able to obtain and keep a home? It is an environment where
they can begin the transition from a chaotic lifestyle to something
more stable. In those circumstances, why does not the Minister take up
the suggestions that noble Lords have made to look specifically
at statutory guidance or a tweak in the regulations so that the types
of provision caught by this ruling are put back in the position where
people assumed that they were before the judgment was
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:08:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000061"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Freud" PimsId="5439" UID="13061174000361" xid="2007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000361">Lord
Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, I emphasise that there is absolutely no
change here in what is the kind of home for which housing benefit is
appropriate. Where that is, in the case of Anglesey, a hall where the
showers for those people are half a mile away, it may be that other
forms of support, such as the Supporting People programme or
homelessness prevention are more appropriate. The No Second Night Out
programme, which is now being introduced throughout the country is
beginning to make some impressive moves to make sure that people in the
state of rough sleeping are caught early and got back on to the path,
as the noble Lord said, out of a chaotic lifestyle into something where
they can get themselves
organised.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="StatutoryInstrument"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13061174000437" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000437">Planning

with our changes to the national curriculum, the new specifications are
more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous. That means more
extended writing in subjects such as English and history, more testing
of advanced problem-solving skills in mathematics and science, and more
testing of mathematics within science GCSEs to improve progression to
A-levels. It also means more challenging mechanics problems in physics,
a stronger focus on evolution and genetics in biology and a greater

apprenticeship. We can raise the bar confidently knowing that we have
the best generation of teachers ever in our schools to help students
achieve more than ever before. Our education reforms, the growth in the
number of academies and free schools, the improvements in teacher
recruitment and training as well as sharper accountability from
improved league tables and a strengthened Ofsted are raising standards

we are publishing today also give awarding organisations a clearer
indication of our expectations in each subject. Under the previous
system specifications were too vague. This caused suspicion and
speculation that some exam boards were ‘harder’ than
others, undermining the credibility of the exam system as a whole.
Including more detail in our requirements for subject content should
ensure greater consistency and fairness across subjects and between
exam boards. We hope that by reducing variability in the system we can

making GCSE content more rigorous we must also correct the structural
problems with GCSEs that the coalition Government inherited. As
today’s report from the Select Committee confirms,
the problems with English GCSEs generated last summer proved
beyond any doubt that the current system requires reform. Both the
Select Committee report and Ofqual recognise that controlled
assessment, which counted for 60% of the English GCSE qualification,
undermined the reliability of the assessment as a whole. That is why I
asked Ofqual to review the regulatory framework for GCSEs, to judge how
we might limit coursework and controlled assessment and to
reflect on how we could lift the cap on aspiration by reducing the
two-tier structure of some

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
repeating the Statement today. He will know that the department and the
Secretary of State have a rather chequered history on education
reform—less about linear reform and more about stops, starts and
U-turns. It has been difficult for politicians to keep up with his
thinking, let alone the head teachers who have to plan for the changes,
the teachers who have to deliver those changes and the parents who
would like to understand what is to be expected of their child. As a
result, a great deal of cynicism and anger has developed about the
mixed messages coming out of the department, the pace of change now
being demanded and the lack of engagement with the profession prior to
the curriculum changes being published.</hs_para>

Minister talked about the involvement of distinguished subject experts
in drawing up the subject content, but he will know that there is a
great deal of discontent among those very advisers that their advice
was ignored and that they did not recognise the final subject drafts
being published. There was even some suggestion that the Secretary of
State had removed some of the advisers at a late stage and taken on the
task himself. What reassurance can the Minister provide that the draft
subject content is genuinely based on the best external advice
available and receives their broad
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:18:02"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000074">Secondly,
there is a real concern that the views of parents were not properly
sought before these changes were announced. Most parents are passionate
about their children’s education and well positioned to know
what excites and inspires their child at school. They want to know that
standards will apply across the sector—not one rule for
academies and another for maintained schools; they worry that
unqualified teachers are being allowed back into classrooms by this
Government; and they want to be reassured that any new curriculum will
provide their child with the qualifications and skills to get decent
employment in the future. What steps have been taken to give parents a
real and powerful voice in the final shaping of these proposals before
they are

the Minister will know that in the past business leaders and the CBI
have expressed concerns that the emphasis on learning and repeating
facts that is now being proposed, rather than understanding the
importance of collaborative working and creative thinking, are taking
the curriculum proposals in the wrong direction and not producing young
people with the soft skills necessary in today’s business world.
To what extent have the future employers of these young people been
involved in drafting the curriculum proposals, and do these now meet
with their
approval?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000076">Fourthly,
the Government are already committed to raising the participation and
school-leaving age to 18. This is a policy that we also endorse.
However, these proposals cover only the teaching provision to 16. Does
the Minister agree that it would have been better to review the
curriculum and assessment provisions 
<?notus-xml column=1520?>in a streamlined way through to school-leaving age,
rather than approaching it in this piecemeal way? What thought is being
given to providing a meaningful education to young people who do not
want to study the traditional academic A-level route and who would
prefer a quality vocational offer, particularly those in the 16-to-18
range? How does this fit in with these
proposals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:20:16"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

determination to have high standards and rigour in our teaching and
assessment of young people. We are proud of our record of driving up
standards in the past—the Secretary of State has previously
acknowledged our record in this regard—and we support the reform
of controlled assessment of coursework in examinations. Clearly,
everyone has to have confidence that assessments are carried out
objectively and rigorously, but we very much oppose the move back to
assessment purely at the end-of-course exams. The Minister spoke of a
“cram and forget” culture in exams, but that is the
inevitable feature of measurement by exams.</hs_para>

three-hour exam can never give a child a chance to show all they have
learnt over a two-year course, nor can it show the depth of
understanding that they can demonstrate in a well-structured piece of
coursework. A minority of children will have an innate talent for
learning and regurgitating facts. Good for them; we wish them well; but
that is not how most children learn or show their abilities, and these
are not necessarily the skills that employers want either. The answer
has to be a mix of assessment methods to ensure a fair outcome. Can the
Minister therefore explain the evidence by which this major change in
assessment has come about and what consultation will continue to take
place on whether it is fair and
viable?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000079">Once
again the department has been guilty of rushing out proposals which
have major consequences for the next generation of young people. There
should be a national debate on the implications and a genuine
commitment from the Government to listen and change. Sadly, this

I hope on this occasion the Minister can reassure this House that there
will be a full opportunity to influence the eventual outcome of these

Nash:</Member></B> I am grateful for the noble Baroness’s
comments. I was rather surprised to be asked to make this Statement
because it seemed to be one more opportunity to highlight the
grade-inflation confidence trick that the previous Government pulled on
the public of this country. It is true that grade inflation has been
going on for a long time. According to a detailed study by
King’s College London and Durham University, over the past 30
years-plus in maths the attainment levels have hardly moved, yet the
number achieving grade C in maths GCSE has gone up from 22% to 55%.
Between 2006 and 2009 achievement at grade C in English and maths
increased by eight percentage points, defying all international
evidence about the actual levels of achievement. We all know that the
current system suffers from dumbing down and grade inflation and that
the modular system has 
<?notus-xml column=1521?>much more potential for manipulation. The blowing up of
English last summer was the last straw in providing evidence in
relation to this. It is not a question of whether we should do it; we
must do it, and we must do it now if we are to render our education
system competitive in the international
world<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:23:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

will continue to listen. This is a genuine consultation. We have
consulted numerous experts, from Dr Anthony Ashmore, Dr Helen Drury,
Lynne McClure, Professor Black, Eleanor Rawling to Charlie Stripp and
many others. We have consulted parents and businesses. Businesses have
been consistent in their claim that the curriculum is not fit for
purpose—42% of employers have to provide remedial training for
school leavers; eight out of 10 small businesses do not believe that
school leavers are ready for

science, the Royal Society of Chemistry has called the decline in
science a “catastrophic slippage”. Again, there is no
doubt that we have taken this on board. Businesses want pupils to have
better literacy and numeracy skills, which these more rigorous exams

right at the top of the Government’s priorities. The first thing
we did when we came to power was to commission Professor Alison Wolf to
do an analysis of the over 4,000 vocational subjects, many of which
were so-called “equivalents”; this equivalence was
another attempt to make the education system look better than it was.
We have rigorously gone through those qualifications and reduced them
to fewer than 200: those which are seriously valued by employers. We
are introducing the TechBac, and have consistently compared our exam
system with international systems and found it

in the system for better education. By doing that, in two years alone
we have increased the take-up of the English baccalaureate from 22% to

think anything other than that. It is high time that we reformed these

Wall of New Barnet:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the
Minister’s Statement. I am involved in skills and in working

first point follows on from the comments about how we engage parents. A
key thing that came out from the meeting yesterday was how we persuade
parents that the vocational route is as good, as well qualified and as
valuable as the academic route, which my Government and previous
Governments have 
<?notus-xml column=1523?>endeavoured to take more people through. That is
hugely important. When young people look at apprenticeships, very often
their parents will suggest that they are the least best option, let
alone the message that comes from schools, where career advice is now
non-existent, and Connexions has gone—not that I was a great
admirer of it; it had lots of faults. However, if we are to get UK plc
working in the way it should do, and being as productive and profitable
as it needs to be, employers need to know that they have support from

is essential that we now make sure that our vocational
qualifications are seen by all— employers, parents and
students—as being as rigorous as academic qualifications and
equally valuable. The Alison Wolf review, which suggests that we focus
down on a core—although still substantial—number of
vocational qualifications, is helpful here. However, we started from a
very low base. You could get a diploma in a subject—I will not
mention the name—which required no examinations at all because
it was assessed entirely by continuous assessment. That counted as four
GCSE equivalents. We clearly had got to a point where the system of
equivalents was out of control. However, we need to see more rigorous
vocational qualifications—and the UTC programme is very focused
on this. We are seeing pupils, aged 14 and 16, going to UTCs
which offer extremely rigorous vocational qualifications, and we need

Government’s intention to introduce more rigour in foreign
languages at GCSE. However, there seems little point in improving the
system if very large numbers of pupils are effectively disfranchised
from access to it. What can the Minister tell the House about the
Government’s intention in relation to the pupils in the 20% of
state schools that have condensed key stage 3 into only two years,
meaning that there are tens of thousands of pupils who do no languages
at all after the age of 13, and who therefore have no chance of taking

GCSEs over three years. It is a technique that troubles me a bit
personally because we all know that if key stage 3 was better and not
the kind of desert it can be, more pupils would do it. The noble

consulting on the regulations. The consultation on subject content ends
on 20 August and Ofqual’s consultation ends two weeks later. We
plan to publish final versions of both in September or October. The
awarding organisations then have about six months to develop their
detailed subject specifications and it will take approximately six
months for those to be accredited by Ofqual. The full subject
specifications should, therefore, be available in September 2014 for
first teaching in September 2015 in all the subjects we have mentioned
except languages, where first teaching will not be until September
2016. We believe that is ample time for teachers to prepare.</hs_para>

the Government’s approach to professional training for teachers.
Like other noble Lords, I am sure, I came across people who were
trained after the Second World War, straight out of the forces. Some of

offenders’ ties with their communities, with their jobs if they
have them, and with their families. They introduce offenders,

only as to the seriousness of the offence or offences themselves but
that there were special reasons to justify a custodial sentence, and
those reasons would have to be stated in open court. The principle

Williamson of Horton:</Member></B> My Lords, I have a favourable
approach to this amendment, which would be a substantial change in

of short custodial sentences and community sentences simply in terms of
hard or soft sentencing, although that is what actually happens in the
media comment on some 
<?notus-xml column=1528?>of these issues. For me, the real question is what
arrangement is more likely to protect the public against continuing
crime. That is the issue that we face in this amendment. At present, we
have short custodial sentences, which do of course protect the public
for a short period, but because the reoffending rate is high we also
have periods when the public are not protected because we get a
continuation of crime. The question is: can we do

amendment does not take away the power of a court to impose a short
custodial sentence where there are special reasons for doing so. Like
the noble Lord who presented the amendment, I think that part of it is
well drafted and correct and that we should concentrate on the special

such cases. Over a period, such explanations will provide a good basis
for assessing the effectiveness of the proposals. It is certainly
possible—in my view, probable—that the proposal in the

pointed out. This is very much a probing amendment to see how the
Minister will react. I will be brief. My noble friend Lord McNally, the
Minister, is aware that every time we have discussed legislation on
sentencing, particularly lower-level sentencing, I have advocated a
cautious approach in favour of community sentence orders in place of

sentences of less than 12 months are the argument that we are putting
forward. We all know that under the present provisions, custodial
sentences of less than 12 months achieve very little corrective
behaviour. On the contrary, we have seen that the impact on an
individual without supervision can be very damaging indeed. We want to
avoid this risk. Our amendment would help guard against the risk that
the welcome provisions of the Bill for post-release supervision for
short-term prisoners could lead to the courts imprisoning more people.
At present, courts may decide in borderline cases not to imprison an
offender because supervision in the form of a community sentence is
more likely to divert him or her away from offending. However, with the
new supervision arrangements, the court might feel that by imprisoning
the offender for a short period it can get the best of both
worlds—both the punitive impact of imprisonment and supervision
of the offender when he or she is

have discussed similar provisions in previous legislation. The custody
plus provision that we introduced at one stage is history now, but we

short period of custody can lead to an offender losing accommodation
and a job and fracturing family links, all of which make it more likely
that he or she will reoffend, which is contrary to the provisions that
we will discuss in our debate on rehabilitating offenders. Sentences of
less than 12 months are too short for a sustained attempt at
rehabilitation in custody but are 
<?notus-xml column=1529?>long enough to damage the community ties which those supervising
offenders can build on in trying to prevent them
reoffending.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000126">There
has been a dramatic increase in the number of options available to the

criminal justice system, with other penalties often referred to as
alternatives to custody. I believe that my noble friend Lord McNally is
on the right track in the way in which this Bill deals with
rehabilitation. He is right in putting the emphasis on society to try
and deal with more offenders in the community rather than in prisons.
That is not in doubt. We are now seeing the impact, which is less use

are not suggesting that grave offences should in general attract other

important principles of sentencing. This is not original, radical or
revolutionary. In essence, it fits in with many Court of Appeal

those whose offending behaviour makes any other course unacceptable.
Secondly, those who are sent to prison should stay there no longer than
is strictly necessary. The amendment is designed to meet the
Government’s objective on matters of rehabilitation. We should
do this by avoiding the unintended increase in prison sentences. This
would be an important discipline that would help against that
unintended consequence. This probing amendment would make it possible

special reasons have to be given in open court. My question to
the noble Lord, Lord Marks, if it is appropriate to ask him, is: what
might those reasons be? Would a breach of previous community orders be

that same point in an earlier debate. My experience is that magistrates

doubtful whether sentencers will change their behaviour; there will not
be more custodial sentences because of the additional supervision

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> My Lords, before my noble
friend replies, having been asked direct questions, perhaps I may reply
briefly. I envisage that there would be a wide range of special
reasons. As the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, suggested, they would
include a history of breach of previous supervision requirements.
However they might also encompass areas of special risk to do with the
particular offender. The shortcoming of the Criminal Justice Act 2003
at which this amendment is aimed is that under Section 152 only the
seriousness of the offences is taken into account. There may well be
reasons to do with the offender that could justify a custodial
sentence, but the point of the amendment is to make it quite clear that
in the absence of such special reasons, whether they are to do with
history, special risk or other reasons, the presumption in favour of a
community sentence should

rehabilitation. I certainly share my noble friend Lord
Dholakia’s view that short sentences are too short to
rehabilitate, but just long enough to disrupt, the life of the person
sent to prison and introduce them, perhaps for the first time, to all
the bad influences that can be found in a prison. On the other hand, as
the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, rightly recognised, we face
media and—to a certain extent—public opinion that sees
community sentences as somehow softer than prison sentences. Part of

natural to ask what are these special reasons or circumstances that are

history of previous convictions? If so, the current custodial threshold
test already applies because, under Section 143 of the 2003 Act, a

sentence of any length to give reasons for the sentence passed. That is
contained in Section 174 of the 2003 Act. Invariably, a sentencer will
begin their explanation of a custodial sentence by setting out why the
offence is so serious that it merits a custodial term. The further
provision is, I suggest, unnecessary. I understand the good intentions
behind the amendment. No one in this House wants to see short custodial
sentences passed for offences that do not justify them, but that is why

Amendment 7A, which I moved last week in relation to Clause 2. As I
said then, the effect would be to require the necessary supervision to
be carried out either by a directly employed public service provider or
by a person commissioned by such a public sector provider. I do not

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I am like St Augustine; I want to give
up sin, but not yet. I will deal briefly with Amendment 24C. It would
mean that the responsible officer for the supervision of offenders
subject to community orders and suspended sentence orders would have to
be a public sector probation provider. As the noble Lord, Lord Beecham,
said, this is essentially the same amendment applied to
community orders as the noble Lord tabled on the first day of Committee
for supervision of custodial sentences. As I said then, the Government
are committed to providing new supervision for those released from
short custodial sentences. To achieve this aim, we, as a responsible
Government, have to be able to afford this additional supervision. To
do that, we need to reduce the current costs of dealing with
offenders.</hs_para>

those serving custodial terms. Paying providers in full only where they
are successful at reducing reoffending will not only make savings; it
will drive down our reoffending rates. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord

27, 27A, 28 and 29. The group is separated by Amendment 26, which is to
be moved by 
<?notus-xml column=1534?>the noble Lord, Lord Marks, and others after we have dealt with these
amendments. As I have said before, I welcome this Bill’s
emphasis on the rehabilitation of offenders. Those who have been
involved in the criminal justice system as long as I have are in no
doubt that reoffending is one of the most serious problems that it
faces. We have been, until now, extremely unsuccessful in tackling it.
Here and there, we have made some progress, often because of
initiatives not of the big battalions but of the small ones, which
concentrate on conduct directed towards the offender which changes his
habits. We know, from experience, that employment, the home and the
family are all important elements in determining whether reoffending
will take
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:14:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13061174000285" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000285">4.15

of the improvements that have occurred in that field in recent times is
restorative justice. To hear me talk about restorative justice in this
Chamber is nothing new. We have made progress thanks to, among others,
the opposition Front Bench, and I am delighted that I speak with the
support of the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, who joins me in making the
proposals in certain of the amendments in this group. We are also
grateful for the Government’s change in emphasis in relation to
restorative justice. They now accept that it is something which has
qualified to appear in legislation and, indeed, to be part of the
panoply of action which can be taken to deal with
offending<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:16:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000151">The
most important aspect about restorative justice is that it is strongly
supported by victims who have experienced what it can achieve. My most
important point in support of these amendments is that victims find
that restorative justice does more for them than probably anything else
that happens within the criminal justice system. Because the increased
status of restorative justice is only recent, legislation was passed in
2003—the Criminal Justice Act—which made no mention of
it. If one looks at both Sections 177 and 190 of that Act, one finds a
menu of actions which can be taken by a court to help ensure that what
happens in court achieves a cessation of reoffending. The amendments I
am speaking to now are simply designed to remedy, or bring up to date,
those provisions by ensuring that one of the programmes that can be
availed is restorative justice and designed to do so in a way which
will achieve the maximum benefit.</hs_para>

culture. You will attain a change of culture only if those in the

not believe that this programme is to their benefit, they will not

the more senior courts. I should also mention, wearing my hat as life
president of the Butler Trust, those who work in our prisons. They do

Park in Middlesbrough and the other at Saltwell Park in Gateshead, both
Victorian parks which had become very run down. Offenders were brought
in to work on these and benefited from being taught skills, which it is

am sure we will get a change of culture from a public that sees
results. I think we will get support from victims. I went to Thames
Valley to have a look at the restorative justice operation that is
supported by the noble Lord, Lord Blair. Meeting victims there left me
in no doubt that they found it an extremely 
<?notus-xml column=1537?>restorative exercise in coming through the trauma of
crime. I fully associate myself with the work of the Butler Trust.
Anyone who goes around a prison knows what a difficult job we ask our
prison officers to do. That change of culture is certainly part of what
we want to do.</hs_para>

occasions in this House, noble Lords have made the powerful case for
the importance of restorative justice. It is clear that there is little
that divides us on this. As I say, anyone who has met victims and
offenders who have taken part in restorative justice will know the
positive impact it can have. For victims, it offers an opportunity to
have their voices heard. For offenders, it provides an opportunity to
face the consequences of their actions and the impact that they have
had on others. The Government are firmly committed to ensuring that
more victims and offenders can take part in restorative justice. I am
particularly proud that in the Crime and Courts Act the Government were
able to put pre-sentence restorative justice on to a statutory
footing.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061174000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000167">Let
me deal with Amendments 27, 27A and 28 first. Taken together,
Amendments 27 and 28 would make explicit that a rehabilitation activity
requirement can include restorative justice activities. They would do
this by removing the reference in Clause 13 to rehabilitation
activities including those whose purpose is reparative. Amendment 27A
does much the same, except it would retain the current provision that
activities can include those whose purpose is reparative—what I
would call the “Beecham sticking
plaster”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000168">In
response, I start by reassuring noble Lords that it is absolutely the
Government’s intention that restorative justice should be
delivered under the new rehabilitation activity requirements. Given the
good evidence of the impact that restorative justice can have on
reoffending, I am sure that many providers will want to make use of
restorative processes in appropriate cases. We would not want to stand
in the way of that, and Clause 13 is certainly not intended to prevent
that—quite the
reverse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000169">It
may be helpful here if I explain what the current Clause 13 provides
for. It creates a new Section 200A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.
Subsection (7) of new Section 200A makes clear that activities an
offender is required to participate in can include those whose purpose
is reparative as well as rehabilitative. The clause is drafted in this
way to refer back to the statutory purposes of sentencing. As noble
Lords will know, the making of reparation to persons affected by their
offences is one of these purposes. Restorative justice—as a
process that can deliver various positive outcomes—is not a
purpose of sentencing in itself, but by linking the new requirement to
both reparation and rehabilitation, our firm intention is to give scope
for providers to deliver restorative activities that can benefit
offenders and victims. It is also worth noting that the same link to
reparation applies to the activity requirements available under the
top-up supervision created by Clause 2 of the
Bill.</hs_para>

already gives scope for delivery of restorative justice activities.
None the less, noble Lords have made a good case for bringing greater
clarity to the types of activities that supervisors might require
offenders to do, both as part of a rehabilitation activity requirement
under a community order or suspended sentence, and as part of an
activity requirement during post-release supervision. I am therefore
happy to take this point away further to consider it and bring it back

Amendments 25 and 29 would create a new stand-alone restorative justice
requirement that could be imposed as part of a community order or a
suspended sentence order. Noble Lords will know that courts can and do
already order restorative justice activities to take place as part of a
community order or suspended sentence order. This is currently done
through the activity requirement, which provides for activities to
include those with a reparative purpose. Although Clause 13 replaces
the existing activity requirement, as I have already explained, it maps
across this provision to allow for restorative justice activities to
continue to take place under the new rehabilitation activity
requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:36:10"></hs_TimeCode>.
When the Government consulted on restorative justice as part of
community orders in 2012, respondents did not identify that there was a
major gap in the use of restorative justice as a requirement of
non-custodial sentences. That was why, in the Crime and Courts Act, we
focused on making provision for restorative justice
pre-sentence.</hs_para>

offenders to do reparative duties. On that occasion he had very
favourable mentions in the media, which were fully deserved, although I
understand that he did not find the reparative tasks particularly
demanding. The noble and learned Lord has strange tastes when it comes
to spending what leisure time he has; he continually indulges in

a good thing to have clarity and certainty. Therefore, I ask the
Minister to reconsider the amendments carefully and, if he sees fit at
a later stage, to come back and tell the House that he welcomes them.

seriousness of this Government in tackling reoffending. In the

consistent with the Government’s desire to ensure that
rehabilitation measures in this legislation are targeted particularly
at helping women offenders, who often face particular difficulties
within the criminal justice system. They would make the Bill more

amendments are primarily aimed at avoiding conflict for women offenders
who are the subject of community orders or suspended sentence orders,
and are designed to enable them to fulfil the requirements of such
orders without making it unduly difficult for them to meet the demands
of caring for families. However, the amendments are gender-neutral, as
you would expect, because many male offenders have similar commitments.
It is important that appointments and activities can be arranged
in a way that does not interfere unduly with family
commitments, be those commitments to take children to school, to be at
home when children are at home without alternative childcare or to look
after elderly or disabled relatives. The same goes for all

difficulty, as I see it, is something that I hope that we can consider
between now and Report. As the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, pointed out,
we are entering an entirely new era in the provision of probation

sentencing guidelines require the courts and responsible
officers—who are now in the public sector probation
service—to have regard to caring responsibilities. However,
there is a risk that in the new regime, which is a new world for
probation provision, there will be a departure from best practice or,
at any rate, a temptation to depart from it. I hope that, by amending
the Bill in a similar way to our amendments, we could send out the
message that family commitments have to be taken into account just as
faith and education commitments are. In those circumstances, I invite
the Government to consider these amendments carefully and

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, my intention is purely to probe for
information. Clause 14 seeks to amend Section 202 of the Criminal
Justice Act 2003 which, as the Explanatory Notes make clear, is about
programme requirements for community orders and suspended sentence
orders. As drafted, the clause removes from the Act the provision that
an offender can only participate in accredited programmes in places
approved by the local probation board or local provider of probation
services. My purpose here is to obtain from the Minister an elucidation
of what the implications of the amendment to Section 202 of the 2003
Act would actually be. What sort of programmes will be encompassed
within 
<?notus-xml column=1544?>the new arrangements? Will they be accredited and
who will the providers be? It is as simple as that. If the noble Lord
is not able to deal with those questions today I would quite
understand, because the clause is not particularly revealing of its
purpose. I would be happy to receive a letter which could be placed in
the Library, if that would be of

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham, for that clarification. His reasoning may not have been clear
when he notified his intention to oppose the Question that the clause
stand part, but it was in his explanation. It may be helpful to
reiterate what Clause 14 intends to do. Currently an accredited
programme can take place only in premises that have been approved by a
probation trust or other provider of probation services. There is
therefore a slightly redundant step built into the process for
delivering accredited programmes, whereby trusts currently have to set
up premises for programmes and then approve those premises themselves
before courts can require offenders to attend. Clause 14 removes this
requirement. Although probation providers will still want to satisfy
themselves that a programme’s premises are suitable for those
attending, as a result of the amendment there will no longer be a
formal requirement in law for them to ratify or sign that off
internally before courts can require offenders to
attend.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000201">Parliament
has already approved a change in the law that means that the
responsible officer, who is the person responsible for delivering the
requirement, now chooses the accredited programme that the offender
must follow. This was previously in the gift of the court. This change
was made by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act
2012 and commenced in December last year. As a consequence, the court
no longer specifies where the offender must go to participate in the
programme but simply imposes a programme requirement and sets the
number of days on which the offender must take
part.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000202">The
detail of the requirement is now in the hands of the provider, who is
best placed to know which programme is the most likely to promote
rehabilitation. This also means that where it emerges that a different
programme would work better—for example, the offender starts on
a cognitive programme but it becomes clear that a domestic violence
programme would be better—the responsible officer can switch the
programme without taking the order back to court. The amendment in
Clause 14 merely furthers the principle of operational discretion for
providers by removing the largely redundant requirement for formal
approval of a place as suitable for offenders subject to a programme
requirement.</hs_para>

noble Lords that the Government see a continued place for accredited
programmes under our new framework for delivering services for
offenders. Accredited programmes are evidence-based and developed from
the academic literature on what works. Where interventions have a
substantial degree of evidence for their effectiveness, it is important
that we build on that success. Those advising the courts through
pre-sentence reports will continue to be able to recommend a programme
requirement where a particular intervention is available locally, and
where probation professionals 
<?notus-xml column=1545?>believe that it is the right way of dealing with
the causes of an individual’s offending. Based on

reason is that a restriction on moving one’s home or

rehabilitation; it would be a judgment that would have to be made by

responding to the substance of the two amendments, it may be helpful if
I briefly set out the purpose of Clause 16. In essence, it would place
a new duty on offenders serving community orders or suspended sentence
orders to seek permission from their responsible officer or from a
court before changing their residence. It replaces the existing
requirement for offenders simply to notify their responsible officers
after they have moved. It is intended to deal with cases
where an offender moving from one probation trust puts at
risk the effectiveness of their rehabilitation. For example, a move to
a different area may bring to an end an established
relationship with the offender’s supervisor. Instead, they may
have to start again with a new supervisor from a different probation
trust or, in the future, a different rehabilitation
provider.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000212">Noble<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:09:38"></hs_TimeCode>
Lords will know that the personal relationship between offenders and
their supervisors is important to reducing reoffending. Evidence
suggests that offenders with a positive relationship with their
offender manager are less likely to offend. This will be particularly
important with a move to a through-the-gate model of support, where an
offender may have had contact with the same mentor or supervisor before
and after release. Another example is a case where a specialist
programme that the offender is attending is not available in the area
that the offender is proposing to move to. In such cases, a court or
responsible officer may consider that ending participation in that
programme may set back the offender’s
rehabilitation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000213">Clearly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:10:17"></hs_TimeCode>,
there are many reasons to support, rather than prevent, an offender
changing residence. For example, an offender may be moving to live with
family or to take up a new job. We recognise that there will be many
cases where a move would not have any 
<?notus-xml column=1547?>negative impact on rehabilitation or on compliance with the order. For
example, it may be a move of only a short distance which does not
prevent the offender attending required appointments. Even with a
long-distance move, programmes may be available in the new area that
are equally as appropriate as those in the old area. We
recognise this and have built it into the way that the clause is
structured. The clause limits the circumstances in which a court or
responsible officer can refuse permission to change residence to only
two scenarios: where the move is likely to prevent the offender
complying with a requirement of the order; or where the move would
hinder the offender’s
rehabilitation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000214">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:11:09"></hs_TimeCode>
31 would make explicit that these are the only grounds on which a court
or responsible officer can refuse permission to change
residence. However, the effect of the way that the clause is drafted is
to provide already for these two circumstances, and only these two
circumstances, to be grounds for refusal. I am very happy to make that
clear to my noble friend Lady Hamwee. I hope that, on that basis, she
will see fit to withdraw the

32 would provide that a court or responsible officer cannot refuse an
application to change residence unless the offender’s
rehabilitation or compliance with a requirement of the order would be
significantly less likely to be achieved. I hope that I can
reassure my noble friend on a number of points. First, even if a move
is likely to prevent compliance or would hinder rehabilitation, courts
and responsible officers will still have to balance this with other
factors. For the purposes of this clause, both courts and responsible
officers, whether probation staff or from the voluntary or private
sectors, are public authorities within the terms of the Human Rights
Act 1998. This means that they are required to balance the impact of
the proposed move on rehabilitation or compliance with the order
against the offender’s interests in making such a move. They
will have to consider the availability of rehabilitative support in the
area that the offender wishes to move to, and the extent to which an
offender could comply with a requirement in the new area. They will
also have to consider the offender’s Article 8 rights. For
example, an unemployed offender may wish to move to take up
a new job or for family reasons—for example, if their partner is
taking up a new job or if a parent is unwell and they need to
provide them with care or support. In many cases, factors like
these would outweigh concerns about compliance with a requirement or
continued rehabilitation. It would be open to a responsible officer to
take the order back to court to ask for it to be varied or revoked to
suit the offender’s new circumstances.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1548?><hs_para UID="13061174000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000217">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:14:07"></hs_TimeCode>
would also point out that the clause provides the safeguard of allowing
offenders to apply to the court for a decision in cases where the
responsible officer has refused permission to change residence, so in
cases where offenders feel there are compelling reasons to move which
outweigh any potential impact on compliance with a requirement or
rehabilitation, they would be able to apply directly to the court to
reconsider their case. I hope that these points reassure my noble
friend, and, indeed, all noble Lords, that this clause provides a means
of supporting the continuity of rehabilitation in cases where a change
of residence could put it at risk without impinging on
offenders’ wider family or work commitments. With those
reassurances, I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw
the
amendment.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_11_PT_1/FA0B28DC744CFC922387506E7BF6170AED0D2F7A" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 June 2013">Tuesday,

the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham. It deals with provision for female offenders, which is another
area in which the criminal justice system has slowly—painfully
so in this case—moved forward to recognising that female
offenders have particular needs. The recognition of those needs, which
are very great and cannot be disputed, is of the greatest importance if
we are to achieve the purposes of the Bill with regard to
avoiding
reoffending.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061174000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061174000223">There
will always be a greater risk of females committing offences if their
particular needs have not been taken into account. Of late, great
strides have been made—I pay credit to the Government for
this—in trying to give positive attention to this problem. There

the criminal justice system who know her have great confidence in her,

that report and give effect to its provisions, as suggested in these
clauses. They require that the Offender Management Act 2007 should be

that we are all puzzled about why women and their special needs are not
part of the original Bill. They have been rather brushed
to one side. The document, <I>Transforming Rehabilitation:

proportion of the consultees themselves specifically wanted the special
needs of women to be delivered on. The more one thinks about it, the
more surprising it is that women have been put to one side, at least

several points before I sit down. Although I accept entirely the point
made by the noble Lord, Lord Marks, that carers come from both sexes,
the vast majority of those caring for the children in a family and the
heads of single-parent households are women. We know that many women
prisoners themselves come from chaotic backgrounds and are likely to be
have been abused in their own childhoods. As regards drug trafficking,
quite a number of them—certainly the ones I have met in
women’s prisons—have been used as mules for the purpose
of transporting drugs at the request of their partners. All this shows
that the one thing that must not happen, if it is humanly
possible—of course there are exceptions where prison must play
its part—is to send women to prison. It should be the last
resort because it is the children who suffer. Often in such
circumstances, the children have to be taken into care because the
family home is broken up or the landlord can no longer accept the

given an explanation of why specific attention has not been paid to
women’s needs in this Bill. I know that we have been told that
we will be given something later, but not taking these issues into
account as the various plans unfold is something that I and others find
puzzling and rather worrying. I shall give an example. A women’s
prison is to be closed down because it is to be used to provide for the
special needs of young offenders. That is fair enough, because those
young offenders may well have special needs, but yet again one more
place will no longer be available for women. No doubt it means that if
they have to be sent to prison, they will be located even further away

reading of the current government policy on transforming rehabilitation

what kind of strategic priorities we need for women offenders. Those
are missing. We have a two-page statement, not a strategy, from the
Government about what is going to happen for women. If this was
a serious undertaking, this kind of amendment would have

other thing that I found very troubling during the course of my review

is what was so amazing about the seed-corn money, although it was
£15 million, that the previous Government put into keeping women
out of prison by providing women’s centres as alternatives to
custody. I know that the Minister has visited at least one,
and I am sure that noble Lords who are interested in this area
will have done the same. You hear stories of women who have gone
through a period of the most amazing redemption because they have had
these gender-specific services from people who understand the
reality of women’s lives and the centrality of family
and children. They understand that when women go to prison, unlike men,
there is no one to keep the home fires burning, and they usually lose
their children and do not get them

these issues can be dealt with easily if you make provision statutorily
for gender-specific services, because people have to think about it. It
is not a question of 
<?notus-xml column=1552?>women being an add-on. I accept that, given the overall
prison population—there are about 86,000 men in prison and 4,000
women—you could say that women are an add-on. However, given
that some 17,000 children a year are affected by their mothers’
imprisonment, and a significant proportion of those children end up in
prison themselves, such provision seems to me to be the most important
preventive strategy. I cannot for the life of me understand why the
Government are so reluctant to have this in the Bill, because it would
be a matter of pride to do so. I know that the Minister will tell me
how much has happened, and I will listen with patience but with some
irritation, because, given my experience in the 21 years since I first
set foot in a women’s prison, I know that it will not be enough.

was, but I cannot keep silent either. I spoke on the issue on the

amendment that addresses a different matter from those that we have
looked at before. On short sentences and a period of supervision, I
want to make one specific point before I come to the more general.
Unless the supervision requirements are appropriate, for all the
reasons that we have talked about, the likelihood of a breach of the

that shows the importance with which this House regards this
issue—like the noble Baroness, one finds it difficult to find
the words, but they are not specialist services, because they are
not an add-on; they are a different group and they need
different services. Furthermore, the marker should acknowledge the
importance with which this issue is regarded outside this House by, I
think, everyone in the offender management penal reform field to whom I

I am, is what amendment, if this is not accepted, would put down that
marker, get past the Treasury, if that is where the problem is, and not
restrict the progress of work done in the MoJ but enable us to make the
point? Many noble Lords have put down a string of amendments. If none

silent. I am so glad that we are privileged to have the noble Baroness,
Lady Corston, 
<?notus-xml column=1553?>to add her voice to this debate. The crucial thing is that we have not
managed to listen hard enough before. There is no question that women
are different from men. They are not just differently shaped; they have
particular needs and they are absolutely specific. We have known this
for years. It is possibly boring but quite graphic to look at just a
few of the facts and figures. Women serve very short sentences on
the whole, with 58% serving six months or less and many only
four months, or a matter of weeks. The sentences are for non-violent
offences; we do not need to be protected from these women. Some 81% are
for shoplifting, and we know that most shoplifting is for food for
their children or for drugs. About 60% of the women, in
fact, are drug
users.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061185000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0001.htm#13061185000011">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:40:19"></hs_TimeCode>
final thing, which the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, also
mentioned, is that the collateral damage of the imprisonment of
women is absolutely unquantifiable. If more than 17,000 children a year
experience and suffer separation from their mothers, that damage does
not really take a lot of imagination to assess. Some terribly graphic
reports have been published. For many children, to be separated in this
way from their parents is like a bereavement: in their eyes, their
mothers have died. This is a terrible thing to have to experience, but
this is what we are doing to this primarily non-violent, very
vulnerable, group of people from whom we do not need to be
protected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061185000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061185000012">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:42:14"></hs_TimeCode>
centres, which we have models for, do exist and it would not be
difficult for the Government to develop them along those lines. Several
years ago now, when I chaired the Rethinking Crime and Punishment
initiative, we funded the Fawcett Society, which issued an important
report, before even the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, saying that we
should make this specialist provision. We now have one or two important
Together Women groups, and a total in this country of about 55 groups
altogether, which is not very many. We have the 218 service
in Glasgow and the Willow partnership, which we are very proud
of, but they are a drop in the ocean compared with the needs of these
women. I have been to a women’s centre recently and not only
were the women telling me how much their lives were being changed but
there were people at the centre who had been users and were now coming

that the statistics show that, for crimes of a comparable nature and
for people with a comparable record, the rate of refusal of bail is
much higher for BME alleged offenders, while custodial sentences are
more frequent and longer than for non-BME offenders with similar
records and for similar offences. The question occurred to me somewhat
belatedly but is provoked by the perhaps comparable needs of the other
neglected body that we are discussing with this amendment, namely
women, and I raise it now because it will the last opportunity to do so

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been an extremely useful
debate, fully living up to the reputation of this House for taking an
ongoing interest in this matter. I thank the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Woolf, in particular, for bringing it forward. We have had a very
useful debate, with a number of interesting points being raised. We
already realise that if the problems of women within our criminal
justice system could be solved by reports, or even clauses in a Bill,
they would have been solved a long time ago.</hs_para>

part of the problem, going back to what the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Woolf, mentioned earlier, is that we also need a change in culture
and general approach. We have made painfully slow progress in this
area. Too many women are in our prisons. It is palpably obvious that
women have different problems and needs and, as the noble Baroness,
Lady Linklater, has reminded us, the collateral damage from
the imprisonment of women is substantial. Nothing divides us on

was pleased that the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, made her
contribution. I regret that her assessment is that we are going back 10
years. I do not think that we are. That is not the direction of travel.
However, we face difficulties. She knows that her report was not
implemented in full by her Government because of some of the
financial constraints that face this Government. I have never moved
away from the fact that her report is a template for action and we will

course, one of the key factors of these reforms is that we are picking
up the challenge of dealing with sentences of under 12 months. As has
been pointed out on a number of occasions, it is that cohort,
if that is the new in-word to use, that has the greatest
preponderance of women offenders. So, in that respect, this legislation

number of points were raised during the debate. The noble Baroness,
Lady Howe, mentioned the review that is under way of the women’s

particular needs and that the custodial female estate should be
organised as effectively as possible to meet gender-specific
requirements while delivering best value to the public. That review is
expected to report by the end of the summer. I do not know what that
means. I was told today that summer has not yet started but it

course, although the implementation of the Corston review has not been

broader life-management issues associated with women offending, such as

specifications for the commissioning process will include
gender-specific outputs, where appropriate, which providers must meet.
In order to win contracts, service providers will be required to

needs of female offenders where these differ from those of men. This
will include, for example, taking account of women’s family and
caring responsibilities. Many female offenders have children, and any
activity requirement clearly must take account of their needs too.

payment-by-results approach will in itself be an incentive to providers

I also reassure noble Lords that those safeguards for female offenders
will not end with the commissioning process. Once contracts have been
awarded, contract managers within the Ministry of Justice will monitor
service delivery to ensure that key outputs for female offenders are
being delivered. Service providers will be supported by guidance on

am delighted that this is being prepared in collaboration with members
of the new advisory board on female offenders. In fact, a workshop is
taking place tomorrow to take that important work forward. The guidance
will be completed in time to inform the competition process later this
year. The advisory board, which was announced in March, has a key role
in safeguarding the needs of female offenders as we take forward our
reforms. The board brings together key stakeholders, criminal justice
partners and senior officials from across Government. One of its tasks
is to ensure that the needs of women are recognised and addressed in
the new arrangements for commissioning probation services.</hs_para>

that it is just wrong to keep 4,000 women in prison. The move to get
those numbers down has been painfully slow. I believe that the Bill

Although it is pleasing to hear that some things are happening, I fear
that the reassurance that we get from Ministers will not continue to

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment
reflects the suggestion I made at Second Reading that the UK should
follow the precedent set by the United States and establish
veterans’ courts to supplement the trial courts when ex-service
men and women plead guilty to or are convicted of crimes for which
non-custodial sentences could be imposed, to assist the rehabilitation
of those ex-service personnel. Consistent with earlier amendments moved
in relation to payment by results and probation, it calls for such a
scheme to be piloted before being eventually embodied in the system on
the basis of a resolution to be approved by both Houses of
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061191000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000002">There
were two sources of inspiration for this amendment. The first was a
report published in 2011 by the North East Regional Joint Health
Scrutiny Committee, led by officers of Newcastle City Council, looking
at the mental health needs of the ex-service community. The second and
in many ways more relevant source was a recent seminar on
veterans’ treatment courts organised by Justice for Vets and the
Community Covenant—two voluntary sector organisations—and
the city council. That took place in Newcastle about three weeks
ago.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061191000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000003">Estimates
of the numbers of UK former service men and women vary. The Department
of Health says that there are around 5 million in England
while research by King’s College for the Department
of Health and MoD in 2010 estimated only 3.8 million, with about 20,000
men and women leaving the forces each year—a figure likely to
grow now that the size of the Armed Forces is being reduced. Around
2,000 service men and women a year are discharged on health grounds,
with the main issues being adjustment disorders, depression and alcohol
abuse. They have a significantly higher rate of post-traumatic stress
syndromes than the general
population.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061191000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000004">Evidence
collected by a community veteran mental health project in the
north-east suggests that most mental health problems occur
after discharge. There are varying estimates, too, of the numbers in
the criminal justice and penal systems. NOMS figures are at the lower
end of the range, but even if they are right, between 3% and 5% of the
national prison population at any one time may be veterans, and many
more veterans will have been before the courts and received
non-custodial community sentences, probation or suspended sentences,
giving a total of around 20,000. The incidence of mental health
disorders among the 16-to-44 age group of veterans, their families and
carers—the so-called ex-service community—is threefold
that for the UK population, and combat stress referrals have risen by
two-thirds in the past few years. Early service leavers who are young
are particularly vulnerable to emotional and mental health problems and
are up to three times more likely to commit suicide than the general
population.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061191000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000005">The
seminar to which I referred was addressed by a former state prosecutor
from Little Rock, Arkansas, who has also served in senior positions in
the state’s correctional service. He describes himself as
“not a bleeding-heart liberal”. With that experience, one
might well accept that. Nevertheless, he enthusiastically espouses and
promotes the concept of veterans’ courts. The presentation
included a video by a senior trial judge who also presides over the
veterans’ court in Little Rock.</hs_para>

million veterans, around five times the number in the UK, and in the
last five years every state has established a veterans’ court.
The offender can be referred from the trial court and is
required to attend monthly so that progress can be assessed. A
veteran mentor is appointed and systematic efforts made to
help the offender deal with the range of problems with which he or she
may have failed to cope. Substance abuse, mental health issues, lack of
housing, skills or a job, family breakdown and other problems are
addressed by development agencies. Failure to co-operate on the part of
the offender leads to recall by the trial court and the possible
imposition of a custodial sentence.</hs_para>

remarkably successful. The court in Buffalo, New York, which I think
was the first to be established, has a 100% success rate in avoiding
reoffending. In Minnesota, reoffending rates fell very sharply for 83%
of those participating. The potential savings were found to be
considerable. In the analogous system of US drug courts around $5,700
was saved per participant. Even Texas, a state not known as a
stronghold of bleeding-heart liberals, is looking across the board in
its justice system for more cost-effective approaches than
imprisonment. When considering the position of men and women
who have served in the Armed Forces, it is surely time for us to extend
the reach of the military covenant by piloting veterans’ courts
here.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061191000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000008">I

north-east<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T18:10:52"></hs_TimeCode>. The
region is the largest contributor of recruits to the armed services,
and veterans comprise around 5% of its prison population of
10,500 against an ONS estimate—which may be on the low
side—of 3% nationally. The 2011 scrutiny report produced a
series of recommendations covering services for veterans, especially in
the mental health arena, which play such a significant part in
offending and reoffending. This is influencing the necessary
development of a more co-ordinated approach between the relevant
agencies. The potential clearly exists to build on this experience so
that the MoD, NHS bodies—including health and
well-being boards, clinical commissioning groups, the national
Commissioning Board and trusts—councils with their
responsibilities for housing and social care and the Department for
Work and Pensions can, we hope, help to prevent ex-service men and
women from offending in the first place. Together with the probation
service and the voluntary sector, these bodies will help to prevent
reoffending should they fall foul of the
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061191000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000009">Having

would be very important in establishing these courts—which I

service charities in whatever action they take with these unfortunate
people. I am also very glad that the noble Lord, Lord Beecham,

very poignant story that he told of Mr A’s experiences and how
we can build upon that. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham,

McNally said at Second Reading, we share the concerns that have been
expressed by all noble Lords in this debate and by the House as a

we should not make our genuine concern, which we have heard
today, about our ex-service personnel appear unduly alarmist about
service in our Armed Forces. To keep this in perspective, there is some
evidence that points to the fact that having served in the Armed Forces
is a preventative factor in offending—that is, those who serve
in the Armed Forces are less likely to offend than the general
population. However, many of those ex-service personnel who
offend—I<I> </I>fully acknowledge this, and I am sure that this
sentiment<I> </I>resonates with everyone in your Lordships’

do not want to go into the specific wording of the amendment because I
acknowledge, and I am sure that this was the intention of both noble

we could discuss it further. The amendment raises some
fundamental and important questions about the different approaches that
could be taken. For example, should we be looking at a body designed to
divert ex-service personnel before they get to the criminal courts?
Should we be considering whether there is a case for ensuring that
courts have greater knowledge and awareness in dealing with this group
of offenders? Or should we be considering an oversight role, looking at
the most effective ways to rehabilitate ex-service personnel? These are
questions that we will look at in conjunction with the judiciary, my

is not to suggest that there is nothing going on in regard to veterans.

doing more to identify the particular needs of those offenders who end
up in prison, including issues arising from their previous service. All

During meetings that we have had around the Bill with the Lord
Chancellor, the Secretary of State and indeed with all Peers, I know
that this issue was raised by other Peers. The noble Lord, Lord Reid,
raised specific examples of what he had seen in Scotland. We have seen
examples of this through the PbR pilots. For example, as part of the
pilot at HMP Doncaster, ex-service personnel are being matched up with

this issue particular thought and much more careful consideration, and
the department is already looking at it. I invite all noble Lords

disappointment with the Minister’s reply. I am grateful to the
noble Lords who have supported the amendment. I rather expected the
Government to say that they would at least go forward with a pilot,
whether or not legislation was required for that. I would have hoped
that they would acknowledge that there would be space in the Bill to
allow for the establishment of these courts if legislation were
required for that, although 
<?notus-xml column=1565?>maybe it is not—it will be interesting to find out on Report if
it would require legislation to establish this system—and for
the Government to allow for such an eventuality after a pilot. If the
Government are not prepared to give an assurance that a pilot will be
mounted, it will be necessary to bring this amendment or something like
it back before the House and, perhaps, to test its opinion. Sympathy is

across the House, that we should get on with this and not allow another

Ramsbotham:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a probing amendment drafted
by the Prison Reform Trust, reflecting a great number of concerns put
to it by practitioners. Although there is general approval of and
welcome for the intent of the Bill, as has been voiced throughout this
Chamber today and on the previous Committee day, there is concern that
we do not know a great deal 
<?notus-xml column=1566?>of the detail. Based on experience, those of us who
have been involved in the criminal justice system in one way or another
are concerned that it is the very lack of detail that it is likely to
inhibit the advance of whatever is proposed. The amendment therefore
does not aim to put a spanner in the works—far from it. Like
many other noble Lords, I want to see the Bill come to fruition. I want
something to be done about this terrible reoffending rate, if that
indeed is the right term. What is more, I want whatever is introduced
to be sustained and not a sort of one-day
wonder<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T18:32:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of what of being proposed is the introduction of payment by results. I
declare an interest as chairman of the All-Party Penal Affairs Group.
We have been involved with the drug and alcohol recovery pilots, eight
of which are currently running. They went live in April last year and
are being run by the NHS. There was a long two-year period before they
were introduced and they are being academically evaluated over three
years by Manchester University and Birkbeck University. I think that
they are very relevant to what is being proposed for the criminal
justice system because they involve practitioners in the field. Those
monitoring these pilots in the National Health Service have looked at
the payback mechanism straw-man proposal for this Bill which, like all
the papers we have before us, was published only last month. Although
saying that in some respects what is proposed looks promising, they
point out that it raises questions, many of which relate to the absence
of numbers or qualitative weighting—or, indeed
pilots—which does not give one a great deal of confidence in
what is
alleged<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T18:34:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

concerned that there is no mention of the overlap and tension for both
users and providers involved with other payment-by-result schemes such
as the Work Programme, the NHS alcohol treatment programme, the NHS
dual-diagnosis programme, the troubled families programme and indeed,
in the case of the Ministry of Justice, the drug and alcohol recovery
programme, all of which are connected with the offender rehabilitation
programme and some of which could impact on the plans made and payment
claimed for an individual who is subject to more than one
payment-by-results programme. There does not appear to have been any
resolution of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T18:35:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061191000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000035">Various
concerns suggested by other payment-by-result initiatives do not seem
to have been fully addressed. For example, there is considerable
concern about what is referred to as gaming—the public’s
private sector providers playing games with the payment, the assessment
or the people they actually put forward for it. To get over that, the
National Health Service has put in place a mechanism called the
National Drug Treatment Monitoring System, which has treatment outcome
profiles and local area assessment and referral services, because it
found that unless it does that, there is a great danger of it being
taken for a ride, which it cannot

proposed called the learning-curve discount scheme that nobody seems to
know much about because we do not know whether providers are going to
be able consistently to reduce costs and/or improve performance and
therefore come up with something earning a discount. Also, there is no
mention 
<?notus-xml column=1567?>of the significant transition costs of payment by results, which other
people have found both in establishing the data management systems for
managing the outcomes and the substantial bureaucracy required to
manage them. If they are being managed by the current system, which is
working flat-out to manage current offenders, I wonder how it will cope
with the problems of the payment-by-results
schemes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T18:36:44"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is also the problem of verification of outcomes which when they are
delayed can cause problems with cash flow and therefore the whole
payment-based system. I mention those not to be a Jonah but to say that
I hope that all these have been taken into account by the Ministry of
Justice, which, not having pilots of its own does not have the
advantage of practical experience. I hope that it is cashing in on the
experience of others to make certain that it does not fall into the

is true that the Serco bid undercut the probation service bid by
£24 million for a four-year contract. However, that started only
last year and that £25 million does not include the
costs of running the competition which went on for more than two years
and must have been substantial. We also have to consider, when looking
at value for money, that the contract has only been running so far for
less than a year with three years to go. The probation service is very
sceptical that someone such as Serco will put in quite such a low bid
next time when recompetition comes up based on actual experience of
running the thing. It would regard its bid as being more realistic
based on its experience. So the jury is out and I am concerned that too
much emphasis is being placed on savings that have been made when a
contract has cost less when we have not yet seen the outcomes.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T18:38:53"></hs_TimeCode> Prison
Service has a bad track record on this. I remember complaining once
when it excluded central administrative costs from a competition bid

second doubt concerns time. I refer to the chart on page 34 of the
White Paper, which sets out the Government’s timetable. This

questions and critiques of the Government’s proposals. It will
be interesting to see what defence the Minister can put up to
them. The noble Lord has made many telling points, not least the
question of the timetable, which looks ridiculously short. The
Secretary of State in his previous capacity introduced the markedly
unsuccessful Work Programme, which was also rushed through with pretty

occurred to me to think as the noble Lord was talking about this
transition that one can envisage staff members being involved in that
transition. Does that mean that they take, for example, their caseload
with them? Will the cases of those who are being supervised and who
will transfer into the payment-by-results system remain with probation
or, if the probation officer in question is to be moved
over—presumably some of that will happen—will the case go
across to the payment-by-results providers? Or will they be excluded?
It all seems highly

resist, largely because I have been asked to do so by my noble friend
Lord Ponsonby, recounting something that he reported to me which
illustrates some of the problems that one might well encounter with the
involvement of these private contractors. A colleague of my noble
friend apparently visited a building scheme to which Serco had brought
offenders to be involved in a community payback scheme. Several of them
were standing around doing nothing. My noble friend’s colleague
asked what was happening. “Oh,” said the representative
of Serco, “the beneficiary” —that is, the owner of
the building—“hasn’t provided the paint”.
In other words, people were standing around doing nothing because the
system had not operated in such a way that the materials required were
on site. That was either the fault of Serco for not doing it, or of a
contract which did not specify that they should do it, or of the
beneficiary for not providing it if he was expected to do so. It is an
illustration of the problems that we can easily get into, and a telling
case 
<?notus-xml column=1569?>to support the noble Lord’s amendments to require rigorous
scrutiny of and regular reporting on what will ensue if this

raised tonight about the timetable requires urgent attention in itself.

Lord Ramsbotham, is trying to throw a spanner in the works. I know that
he wants this to work as much as I do. One of the values of the

this or that will be done. As the process unfolds, I will do my best to

moment, not in advance of legislation but within the department, on how
contracts and competition will work. We are not entirely flying blind
on this because, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has said, payment

taking advice and learning from both the successes and the failures of
other departments. That is being built into our process. The noble Lord
referred to gaming in the NHS experience. That will certainly be looked
at. He mentioned transition costs being built 
<?notus-xml column=1570?>in, and verification. We are working and consulting with other
departments on these matters. It is very interesting. I can remember
the first prospects for privatisation of prisons and a lot of the
debates that went on. Even the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, would
acknowledge that with the privatisations of prisons lessons and
efficiencies have been shown and standards set which have been to the

it is not the Government’s intention that this Bill will result
in changes in sentencing practice, and nothing in the Bill alters the

we will be monitoring this and other issues extremely closely.
Again, the noble Lord, Lord
Rams<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T18:52:03"></hs_TimeCode>botham, is
quite right that there are a lot of other initiatives. This
Government are exciting and radical, and are doing things across the
piece. Of course, progress we are making in other areas will impact on
the criminal justice system, just as our successes will impact on other
parts. That is what happens when you have a radical
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061191000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000054">We
will also make sure that we are open and transparent about sharing data
and information wherever we can. There are already well established
mechanisms for making available many of the types of information that
the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has highlighted in his amendment. On
changes in sentencing trends, for example, we publish every quarter a
<I>Criminal Justice Statistics</I> bulletin that includes detailed
information on sentencing outcomes and trends. This is a national
statistics publication, so it is subject to the appropriate checks and
safeguards. Any changes in sentencing practice will be clear from this
report. In addition, the Sentencing Council has a duty under Section
130 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 to publish a report every year
on the impact of changes in sentencing practice on prison and probation
costs. Any changes to sentencing practice as a result of this Bill will
fall under that duty. The independent council, with all its expertise
on sentencing, is best placed to carry out that analysis.</hs_para>

already publish licence recall statistics every quarter in the

is a national statistics publication. We want to make sure that, in the

less than 12 months, and includes committals to custody for those
proven to have breached a supervision requirement. Likewise, we publish
proven

hope this makes it clear that we are not starting from scratch. I also
take pride in the fact that this has been one of the most proactive
Governments in putting out their statistics and information, allowing
various parts of the Government to be checked on performance. The
Government have worked hard over the past three years to improve the
transparency of the criminal justice system, and we would look to make
available much of the information that Amendment 34 details through the
existing mechanisms we have.</hs_para>

is already subject to a duty to publish information of this sort. As I
suspect the noble Lord is aware, given that his amendment follows some
of its language very closely, Section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act
1991 requires the Secretary of State every year to publish such
information as he considers expedient on a range of topics, including
information that allows those working in the justice system to become
aware of the financial implications of their decisions and information
that allows those working in the justice system to understand the
effectiveness of different sentences in preventing
reoffending.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061191000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000058">We
already consider it expedient to publish not just annually, but
quarterly, much of the information that Amendment 34 mentions. That
will continue to happen if the provisions of the Bill receive the
agreement of both Houses. Therefore, while I understand, welcome, and
agree with the intentions of the noble Lord in tabling this amendment,
I hope that what I have said reassures him that the Government are
committed to understanding and sharing the impacts of this Bill and to
being as transparent as possible in delivering it forward.</hs_para>

noble Lords that costs for extending supervision will ultimately be
dependent on the outcome of competing offender services in the
community. If we were to give figures at this stage, it would put at
risk our ability to agree value-for-money contracts with providers.
However, I hope that my commitment last week to take away the impact
assessment for the Bill and to consider how we could expand it will
provide some additional assurance. Work is under way to revise the
impact assessment as I speak, and I hope to be able to bring
back a revised version soon. I know what has been said about the value
of that on Report. In the light of these assurances I hope the noble

<?notus-xml column=1573?>is a “Government of wonders”. I am
reminded of the late Lord George Brown, who, when he was Economics
Minister, stood up at the Dispatch Box, banged it and said “This
Government are running the economy in a way that it has never been run
before”, and was then surprised when the Opposition cheered him
to the
echo.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061191000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000067">In this
last group of amendments, we turn to the provisions on consequential
and transitional arrangements. The provisions in Clauses 18 and 19 are
mainly technical, and are also fairly standard constructions, which can
be seen, for example, in the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The noble Lord,
Lord Beecham, seems to be saying that these amendments are designed to

18 allows the Secretary of State to make provision that is
consequential, supplementary or incidental to the provisions of the Act
by an order that is subject to the negative procedure. This clause
mainly amends other statutory schemes, some of which are complicated

Clause 18(6) makes clear that where an order under Clause 18 is made

Amendment 35 would remove Clause 18(2), which makes it clear what the
power can be used for. The power itself is conferred by subsection (1),
so the amendment makes it unclear what the power may be used for: it
would not remove the power. There will be an opportunity to scrutinise
the technical changes made by any order made under Clause 18. I do not
believe that these have to be affirmative orders, and where the order

36 is more specific in that it would make any order made under Clause

for transitional provisions and introduces Schedule 7, which sets out

it sets out how the new supervision changes apply to different
sentences in different circumstances. The power to make transitional,
transitory or saving provisions can be used only if those provisions
are related to a commencement order. Under this Act, commencement
orders are, as is usual, not subject to a parliamentary procedure. It

generously. There is a well established tradition of volunteering, with
many young people, in particular, willing and anxious to spend some of
their lives in the service of others. Sadly, on a number of occasions
this has put those young people in personal jeopardy, and some have
lost their lives. My own region of Northern Ireland always punches

debate. Noble Lords on all sides of the House, irrespective of their
point of view, will look forward to hearing the answers to the
questions he posed, which should be in the public

he reminded us that there is a choice about how we spend our budget,
and whether we devote it to overseas development assistance or whether
we spend it on military interventions. On that subject, I will
underline some important facts that are sometimes overlooked in the
current debate—understandably, because these are incredibly
tough fiscal times for the country and times of great hardship at home.
Therefore, people are asking questions about how we are spending our
money overseas. For every £1 we pay in taxes, just over 1p is
spent on aid. For every £1 we spend on aid, we 
<?notus-xml column=1577?>spend £6 on
defence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:19:16"></hs_TimeCode>. Clearly
we need to look at that situation and keep it constantly under review.
I was impressed by some figures that came out of the weekend summit to
which the noble Lord referred—and it is wonderful to see
Northern Ireland in the spotlight this week, in the lead-up to the G8
summit in Lough Erne, Enniskillen. Therefore it is timely that we
should focus on that in
particular.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061191000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000086">Save
the Children sent me some figures which pointed out that, in 1990, 12
million children under the age of five died from preventable diseases.
They then showed that, in 2011, that figure had fallen dramatically to
6.9 million. Aid has played a crucial part in that; so has trade. The
noble Lord, Lord Empey, was a distinguished Minister of Enterprise,
Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and knows the importance of
trade in lifting people out of poverty. None the less, 5.1 million
fewer deaths of under-fives per year is an incredible return that the
British people and others are getting on their investment in the
poorest in the
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061191000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000087">It is
always very difficult when these things happen because, when we see
need around the world, a hue and cry goes up that “something
must be done”. We are finding this at the moment in Syria. There
is no doubt that, if you are in a ministerial office—at the
Foreign Office, in the Ministry of Defence or in No. 10—the
pressure to show immediate responses is immense, and military action is
an immediate response. It has impact, it is visual and it shows a
degree of leadership. To invest in aid, training people in how to
develop crops, drilling wells, improving sanitation and educating the
child takes longer. In a sense, they are less immediate, but the
long-term return is vastly
more<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:21:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:23:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:23:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:23:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061191000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000088">We
need to look at this very carefully and I read the Prime
Minister’s speech about it with care. It could have been
interpreted as leading to some potential change in the way that we
allocate aid. Yet, the Prime Minister has nailed his colours to the
mast on this to a greater extent than probably any leader in recent
times. He has been inextricably associated with arguing the case for
aid, not least last weekend. Within the Conservative Party, which is
part of the coalition, he vigorously makes the point about the value of
our aid spend in the world. That is very significant. We are just
reaching the point of achieving our goal of 0.7%. We are seeing the
returns: 5.1 million fewer lives lost. We are being told by the UN that
the eradication of poverty for under-fives by 2030 is a real
possibility, and that a further 1.7 million lives per year could
therefore be saved. When we are on the brink of that incredible
breakthrough, it would be unthinkable to look at blurring the edges
between two very distinct types of spend. They are two very necessary
types of spend in their correct context but we must not blur the edges.
There are international agreements as to what overseas development
assistance means and they come together in the Conflict Pool, the work
of which I applaud. It has been a great innovation in bringing together
the Ministry of Defence, DfID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,
getting them to work together in control of a single budget to tackle
prevention, rather than by
intervention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:23:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:23:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:23:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is quite a long time since I was in government. My first job was in
defence and, after two years there, which I enjoyed greatly and found
very challenging, the Prime Minister asked me to move to overseas
development where I became the Minister for a short while, until Tony
Crosland died and I moved to the Foreign
Office<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. When I
made the change, quite a lot of my friends asked me, wasn’t this
an incredible change to make from defence to overseas development? I
looked at them straight in the eye, because I believed it, and said,
“Not at all. Both are about human security and
well-being<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>”.
During my years in defence, I was always impressed by the number of
senior officers, civil servants and others, who used to say in
discussion, “Of course, we’ve lost if war breaks out. Our
job is to prevent war and to ensure that peace can prevail”. Of
course, development is ensuring that peace is not just the absence of
war, but it is the ability of people to live full lives and to develop
their potential.</hs_para>

this is a time of so many challenges, including hunger and
malnutrition—which is particularly sinister with its long-term
effects, not least on future productivity—of climate change and
of infant mortality still, although we must all take heart from the
great progress to which the noble Lord, Lord Bates, referred. However,
this is not a time to start raiding the aid budget. There may be very
real arguments about how we do it better, get better value for money
and prioritise better. Some of that has begun with the examination of
programmes in India and South Africa, for example. These are big,
important arguments but it

British people should take great pride that we are setting examples to
the world in our commitment to overseas aid and development. At a time
of low morale in Britain about so many things, this is something about
which we can get excited—the positive battle for humanity, and
the well-being of people and the children who are being born, or who
should be born today but still die before they have a chance to enjoy
life. It is very significant that we can say to the world,
“Don’t do as we say but follow our example because this
is a challenge that we are determined to meet”. I
make no bones about it: I congratulate the Government
unreservedly on having honoured the pledge of allocating 0.7% of GNP to
aid. There will be arguments about priorities and techniques, but
having kept that promise and that determination is something in which
the British people should take pride. That is not to say that the
example should not be followed in the battle for social justice and
against poverty, deprivation and inadequacy in our health service in
our own country, but at least in our relationships with the world we
can hold our head high. It is an example of what we should
be doing in our own society, if I may put it that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:30:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061191000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000096">There
will always be an overlap between overseas development and
defence—that is clear. Certainly, humanitarian assistance, let
alone long-term development, cannot take place if there is insecurity
and instability. Therefore, in some situations it is necessary for
defence forces and aid operations to work hand in glove. However, there
are tensions—for example, in Afghanistan. The Army liberates an
area and wants to put things in quickly which give the people a stake
in the liberation of their territory before the Taliban moves back.
Overseas development workers say, “Hang on a moment. It’s
not just a quick fix. If we are to put a school or a hospital in, it
has to be sustainable because if we have a quick fix the whole thing
will collapse and we are likely to lose everything”. Therefore,
there are real tensions between the disciplines of long-term,
sustainable development and the immediate needs of the Armed Forces.
The challenge is how we bring those two aims together in a useful and
sensible way. I always think it is very exciting when the military can
feel that on occasions it is contributing positively to human
well-being by ensuring that supplies get through and that goods are
delivered. That is something which many people in all three services of
the military enjoy and value. However, these two aims are
not the same tasks and how you marry them together will always pose a
very difficult challenge, but one with which I think we should
grapple<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:32:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061191000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061191000097">In
conclusion, we still need to give far more attention to the issues of
conflict resolution and conflict prevention, although we are giving
them much more attention than we used to. The resources to do that
should come from the aid budget although the military has a
contribution to make. I hope that in all the Government’s
considerations those issues remain
priorities.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_11_PT_1/ED90EAE8025A2831D2F162C0A8DD46D0F61B42BD" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 June 2013">Tuesday,

because there was no treatment that they could afford. They were living
desperate lives. I also remember visiting an area for internally
displaced people and seeing a group of men and a young woman who was
with them talking about condom use and how important it was in
preventing the spread of AIDS. I remember seeing street children who
were living in the sewers of the city. They came up from there to make
a life for themselves. I visited a school sponsored by an NGO that
provided street children with an education and opportunities for
employment. I visited a project funded by DevelopmentAid where young
men were building their own homes. I visited a maternity unit, which
sadly had no or very few incubators for babies. The main problem was

should be directed to alleviate poverty, but that poses the question:
what is poverty in our world today? When thinking about poverty we
should, of course, take its obvious meaning which tends to come first
to us: it is a lack of money and material resources. But poverty is not
just a lack of material resources; it can also be poor health, which
can be psychological as well as spiritual. Poverty can be not living in
a democracy in which individuals are valued. Much poverty in its
broader sense is caused by wars or other social upheavals, just as the
greatest single source of poverty in this country is arguably family
breakdown. The best way to address poverty in our country might well be
to have a co-ordinated, cross-departmental strategy to reduce family
breakdown, in as much as the Government can influence such major social

the Prime Minister was advocating in his recent remarks, I have no
problem with them. I also have no fundamental objection to our aid
programmes being integrated somewhat with our broader national
interests or security strategy. There has been a tendency in the past
for the development programme to be almost on its own plane, apart from
other aspects of government policy. But it is distinct, as has been
rightly said by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel. It always seems to me to
be part of the overall programme of what we are trying to do as a
country. Surely<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:47:28"></hs_TimeCode>
we are learning the hard way, as has been mentioned, that soft power in
all its guises is often more lastingly effective than hard power?

solution, as indeed is the case, it appears, in
Syria.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061199000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061199000020">In
relation to the Ministry of Defence, for example, I can see a strong
case for offering assistance with mine clearance, or rehabilitating
former soldiers into society after a conflict ends. We heard something
about that in the previous debate about the Offender Rehabilitation

difficult some years later. No doubt a whole range of activities, which
might be regarded as aspects of peacekeeping and peacemaking, should
involve the Ministry of Defence along with other departments. I see no
reason why that should not be the case. That should involve not only
other departments of Government, but voluntary agencies—let us

McConnell of Glenscorrodale:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the
noble Lord, Lord Empey, for raising this subject this evening and for
giving us an opportunity not just to seek clarification but to express
what is clearly a strongly held view among most Members of your
Lordships’ House. I refer to the inference that the expenditure
pattern on development might change to assist the Ministry of Defence
in what may be perceived as current difficulties with its budget, and
the real strategy at the heart of what successive Governments have been
trying to achieve, which was damaged by that intervention, or at least
the public description of
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061199000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061199000024">I

Government have done remarkably well on the agenda for international
development over these past three years. Many who were, perhaps in
advance of the 2010 election, slightly suspicious of the
Government’s commitment to international development, have been
proven wrong. The consistency with which they have applied the
comprehensive approach initially begun by the previous Government, by
improving and expanding upon some of the procedures that were put in
place, such as the Building Stability Overseas strategy, the extension
of the Conflict Pool following its review, the establishment of a
National Security Council, and the implementation this year of the 0.7%
of gross national income of our national budget for international
development, have all been important steps on the right
road.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061199000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061199000026">It is
not just in their individual actions that the Government have been
right. Having watched this closely and been pleased at what has
happened over the past three years, even I was surprised to see the
Chancellor on television at the time that this issue was raised,
presumably by one of the Prime Minister’s aides, back in
February or March, whenever it was first in the news. The Chancellor
said that it was in this area of our expenditure, where we commit to an
international agreement and we implement that commitment, that we give
ourselves influence around the world in ways that are almost impossible
through other means. To hear that coming now on a cross-party basis
from these Houses of Parliament should give us all great
pride.</hs_para>

with dismay that I watched the debate on this issue emerge in the early
months of this year. The suggestion that money could be transferred

it is against the rules. So it was a silly thing to say in the first
place—it cannot be done. The idea that the international
development budget could be used for non-international development
purposes was never going to have any traction, and therefore to suggest
that for public consumption was frankly silly. Secondly, and allied to
that, it is dangerous. It puts in danger those in the field who are
trying to work in the most difficult of countries and
situations—those states referred to by the noble Lord, Lord
Bates. It therefore makes the lives of those who take on the most
difficult challenges in our world today more
difficult<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:56:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

suggestion reverses the strategy begun by the previous Government,
built upon by this Government, on the comprehensive approach that says
that, in today’s 21st-century modern world, defence, development
and foreign relations cannot exist independently of each other. They
will be successful only if they work
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061199000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061199000030">Fourthly,
the suggestion reduces our influence internationally. Not only has the
UK been implementing this strategy at home for most of the last decade,
it has been leading the international strategy on this debate as well.
When I was the previous Prime Minister’s special representative
for peacebuilding between 2008-10, I had the fascinating privilege to
visit United Nations missions around the world, with both peacebuilding
and peacekeeping missions. People consistently said to
me—particularly local people, or those involved in national
government in countries around the world where these missions
exist—that the lack of co-ordination between defence,
development, peacebuilding and peacekeeping, between a national
strategy and the international intervention of agencies and
donors, and the lack of a comprehensive strategy were the
biggest blocks to building peace and ensuring that development is able
to take place
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061199000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061199000031">If
we have learnt that lesson anywhere over the past decade, we have
learnt it in Somalia, where we have seen remarkable progress over the
past two or three years. We should never be complacent about the
situation in Somalia and the Horn of Africa, certainly not in the short
or medium term. The European Union, the United Nations, the World Bank,
individual donors, those involved in development and those involved in
military training and expertise are all coming together in one
strategy, and making a difference in trying to build a new democratic
parliament and some opportunity for Somalia to build its way out of the
horrors of the past 20 or 30 years. To reverse that strategy now and to
play games with this issue is a dangerous thing to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061199000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061199000032">I hope
that there will be further clarification. The Minister has clarified
this matter in your Lordships’ House before, but I hope tonight
she will be able to do so once more. I also hope that in seeking this
clarification we will say clearly to the Government that it is
essential that they not only implement this strategy here in the UK,

Tonge:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord
Empey, on securing this debate and bringing this topic to the attention
of the House. It has triggered a memory for me. As a new Member of
Parliament way back in 1997, I can recall very well that a new defence
review was being undertaken. I attended an interesting discussion
between Ministers past and present about the concept of defence
diplomacy. To my innocent ears, it sounded like a new dawn. One of the
MoD’s eight missions was
to,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13061199000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061199000077">“dispel

would fund these activities; it was brilliant. The new dawn soon faded,
however, as young and not so young Ministers got the smell of cordite
in their nostrils, or whatever it is that makes men—it is mainly
men, I am afraid—go to war in order to try to solve the
world’s
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T20:00:30"></hs_TimeCode>. The

have not heard much about defence diplomacy since then, but I am
extremely pleased and almost proud, although I do not like that word,
that our coalition Government have committed to spend 0.7% of GNI on
international development, 30% of which will be spent on fragile
states, which we all know are the poorest in the world and unlikely to
achieve the millennium development goals. Conflict produces poverty and
poverty causes violence and war; we all know that cycle. I appreciate
that because of this, there needs to be co-operation between the
Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for
International Development.</hs_para>

am extremely concerned, however, at the suggestion that by some sleight
of hand the protected DfID budget will be used to shore up the
unprotected MoD budget. What a fall from grace that would be. How
cynical it appears, especially if the money is used directly or
indirectly for things like helicopter gunships. That would do great
harm to our reputation for international development throughout the
world. Development and military activity, even defence diplomacy if it
is still practised, however well intentioned, must be seen as separate
activities. Journalists have reported from Afghanistan that the Taliban
has attacked aid workers because they were thought to be collaborating
with western forces. NGOs—Christian Aid in particular
—have expressed their fears that aid workers’ lives will
be in danger in fragile situations if they are thought to be colluding
with the military. It would be
disastrous.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061199000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-0002.htm#13061199000036">The
best way to bring about peace and stability is through poverty

chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Population Development
and Reproductive Health, I must add that around 350,000 girls
and women die every year in pregnancy and childbirth. The majority 
<?notus-xml column=1587?>of them live in fragile and conflict-wracked states with no access to
family planning or safe abortion, obstetric care, or even skilled birth
attendants. I must also remind the House that there is an enormous
unmet need for voluntary family planning around the world. The
consequences of not providing family planning resources are
unsustainable population levels, which lead to conflict over the
world’s diminishing resources. It is a very important link.
While on the subject of women and girls, the Minister would expect me
to say that we must not allow Department for International Development
money for safe abortion after rape in armed conflict to be diverted
away from this very necessary service because of the aid policies of
other countries such as the

demand for aid in fragile states for it to be diverted to the needs of
the Ministry of Defence, however hard it argues the case that fragile
states need military intervention. It is too dangerous to contemplate,
both for the people in the country affected and for aid workers
operating there. I have every sympathy for Ministers who are seeing
their precious defence budget cut, but the remedies are staring them in
the face. Perhaps I may make a few suggestions. First, we must stop
thinking that the United Kingdom should intervene in every conflict and
civil war around the globe. Secondly, we must stop just fighting
terrorism and start addressing the causes of terrorism—noble
Lords would expect me to mention the plight of the Palestinians.
Thirdly, please can we abandon the ridiculous notion that Trident needs
to be replaced? Some £20 billion to £25 billion could be
saved in a stroke on Trident alone. That would pay for a few helicopter
gunships.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_11_PT_1/1B95887C529F358CDB44744D2E957DCAABCFD1A5" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 June 2013">Tuesday,

ordering, about the concord that we have to try to create and support
across the world, my military friends would remind me that the military
has always been involved in creating concord through delivering what we
call aid or humanitarian support. I can give examples of this from
Alexander the Great to the Napoleonic Wars. More recently, there is a
priest in the diocese I serve who was in the Royal Air Force. He tells
moving stories about his time as a serviceperson of being involved in
humanitarian work such as the rebuilding of schools and getting
supplies through lines in order to feed people who were
trapped behind them. There is a long and important tradition of the
military playing a constructive role in the delivery of what we would
call aid. In that sense, we need to look at that military capability,
which is often important in a natural disaster. Aid agencies tend to
need to plan and budget carefully, but the military has the resource
and dynamism to get in there and connect. If the military is
going to be part of the aid scenario, we have to look at how that
co-ordinates with what we understand about aid, aid agencies and DfID.
Is there a case for joint training and planning, especially in relation
to natural disasters, and should a co-ordinated effort be made? It is a

peace that aid agencies, DfID and others stand for alongside the
military trying to develop and preserve concord, particularly through
aid exercises. Let us think about aid more narrowly—the peace
that comes from the heart through trying to connect human beings by
helping women and girls, reducing infant mortality or whatever it might
be. As the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, there are tensions because, to
deliver aid, people try to offer a kind of neutrality about the
political context of finding order and concord. Whether there is peace

agencies and those in partnership with DfID try to work in partnership
with the local, and often the local can see aid workers, if they are
associated with the military, as foreigners and the enemy. Therefore,
the aid operation on the ground, working through partnership, is put in
serious danger by being associated with a foreign power.</hs_para>

course, as we have heard, the whole aid thrust of DfID and the
aid agencies is about poverty reduction. It is not just about
good ordering and trying to create the stability that people need. It
is about positive things, such as tax justice, land distribution and
trade arrangements. There is a much bigger agenda than the military can
ever be involved in. So there is a place for military
co-operation with the delivery of aid in some contexts.
However, that must not compromise the ability of DfID and aid agencies

conclude by asking the Minister to address a number of questions.
First, will poverty eradication remain the key purpose of UK aid?
Secondly, will the 0.7% commitment be targeted to aid and development

quadruple lock to preserve that? Thirdly, what plans are there for the
MoD and DfID to work more closely together? Fourthly, does the Minister

such legislation in the gracious Speech, and no indication has been

not appeared to date, as promised. On top of that, we are hearing
suggestions from the centre of government that some United Kingdom aid
might be directed to prop up a defence budget facing further cuts and
also to promote trade interests and British business. As has been said,
the Prime Minister announced just under four months ago that he was
“very open” to spending money from the UK aid budget on
peacekeeping and other security operations, and that he would like to
see more of the aid budget diverted to defence by building up

today’s debate is an opportunity for the Government to put

<?notus-xml column=1590?>and targeted and how a cross-government approach can better prevent and
tackle instability. However, any suggestion that aid money can be used
to offset deep defence cuts is misleading, since UK aid money can
legitimately be used, in accordance with internationally agreed
guidelines, only for security, demobilisation and peacekeeping, and not
for core military activities. The major proportion of UK aid money must
continue to be used to alleviate poverty, improve basic services and
support job creation, all of which are central to ending conflicts
everywhere. In that regard, can the Minister say whether any DfID

development aid works, since it saves lives, helps reduce inequality

Britain’s interests, since the unrealised potential of

economy. It is now time for the Government, when they come to respond,
to say why the Prime Minister made the statements he did—to
which the noble Lord, Lord Empey, referred—if there is no change
in policy. In the light of some recent off-the-record briefings and ad
hoc policy statements, as well as the continuing absence of promised
legislation, it is also for the Government to show that their direction

compromised by either the consequences of their failure to meet

in a period of austerity, I am very proud of the fact that we have done
that and know how important it is morally. Singing, I suppose, in

Lord Listowel, and other noble Lords emphasised that and pointed out
what a difference it makes to the poorest around the world. However, it

particular article may and generally will embody a multitude of

make these points at length as they are important for the context of
some of the debate we will be having on these earlier groups, which are
largely around two aspects of the Government’s proposals. The
first is, why have they chosen to pull back from the decision they
originally had in mind during the consultation exercise to abandon the
unregistered design right, or  
<?notus-xml column=325?>at least combine it with the community unregistered design right, a
measure that would at least have some logic to it. They have chosen not
to do so and we wish to probe that. Secondly, why is there
tentativeness in their proposals to try to provide a commonality of
approach between the registered and unregistered design

a ring to it because those in authority have seen, opined upon and
sufficiently thought well of the design presented to them that they
have registered it, much in the way that a small “c” with
a circle around it has denoted copyright. The truth is that a
registered design is nothing of the sort and seems to be a mainly
bureaucratic exercise. The article has not been made but the design is
registered simply on the basis of a submission and payment of a fee to
the registry. I simplify to make the point but that is the essence of
it. At the same time, and organically, the unregistered design right
has grown up over the years and has provided a sensible and appropriate
way, particularly in design industries such as fashion, effectively of
securing a monopoly power for people to use in a way that will allow
them to get a return on the investment of their creativity and
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:35:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

trying to help the Government in the sense that if the UDR is retained
it would be a half-way point, as I have hinted, to combining it more
closely with EU design law. I should be grateful for responses from the
Minister on that. In support of my suggestion, I simply provide two
more quotations. On the question of whether one should think about
combining across Europe a single unregistered design process, the FICPI

come forward with the proposals that underlie the first part of the

would be a considerable advantage in reviewing and simplifying the
design area. That started with the Hargreaves report, which pointed out
the complexity to which I referred. Instead, we have proposals that are
much the same as before but with a few minor changes. We are not
getting the sort of clarity that would help the industry to support the
growth in our design capacity, contribute to our creative economy and
improve the economic prospects of this country. The essence of these
amendments is: why are the Government not considering modifying the
test for infringement at least to be aligned with the community

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I am sure that the noble Lord,
Lord Stevenson, was only trying to be helpful with his first amendments
but, from the word go, he has a certain way of frightening the horses.
The reaction to his amendment by the design community, perhaps apart
from the seven professors who lurk in the background to these and
similar amendments tabled by the noble Lord—I am glad to say
that we firmly rejected their wise advice on the Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Bill—is that this is a last-minute change to
emasculate unregistered design right, which is relied upon by almost
every designer, as opposed to registered design. The noble Lord knows
the scale of the use of unregistered design rights; more than 100,000
designs annually are protected by them, whereas only some 4,000 are
protected by registered design. The whole purpose of unregistered
design is to be analogous to copyright. That is what UK unregistered
design right is about. It is very long established. The term for
unregistered design rights is of course much shorter than for
copyright, which was always the intention. However, the noble
Lord’s amendment is extremely radical.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:39:40"></hs_TimeCode> am sure that
he does not really believe that this is the right way forward. I heard
what he said about the Government's approach being merely piecemeal,

hope that the amendment is purely provocative and designed to have a
debate but the noble Lord should know that many individual designers up
and down the country would be absolutely horrified if the amendment
passed and if unregistered design right did not have the scope that it
now has. I will not go into the way in which the test is put forward in
terms of whether it is worldwide or original and what sort of
protections are given. It is sufficient to say that in almost every
respect<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> small

My Lords, at the outset of Committee, it may be
helpful to remind everyone why the Bill is important. The measures in
the Bill support business in driving economic growth and innovation by
encouraging enterprise and expanding the range of economic sectors in
the UK. Absurd maze or not, the designs and patents measures in the
Bill will deliver many of the remaining commitments from the government
response to the Hargreaves review of intellectual property and growth,
which the Prime Minister commissioned in
2010.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061188000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000017">The Bill
will achieve three things. First, it will make it easier for business
to understand what is protected under design and patent law, providing
greater certainty for investors and reducing costs for business.
Secondly, it will strengthen IP protection, including through the
introduction of criminal penalties for copying UK registered designs.
Thirdly, it will make the international and European IP system work
better, helping UK business to be successful abroad. These measures
will help our vitally important IP-intensive businesses and I look
forward to the chance to debate the detail over the course of this
Committee. I appreciate the sentiments expressed by the noble Lord,
Lord Stevenson, and I look forward to continuing to engage
with him 
<?notus-xml column=327?>and all other noble Lords on the substantive and
other issues raised during our consideration of the
Bill.</hs_para>

change the legal definition of the UK unregistered design right to
mirror that of the EU Community design, as set out in the Community
design regulation. The result would be harmonisation with the European
design right. Although I accept that the measure would simplify the
design legal regime in the UK, the change would not be welcomed by the
UK design industry. I am most grateful for the support given by my

was almost complete support for the retention of the UK unregistered
design right, in its current form, in response to the
Government’s consultation. In particular, this was due to its
application to some functional designs, for which the UK design right
is unique. The result of this amendment, changing all elements of the
current definition of the UK design unregistered right apart from its
duration, would be unpopular with many parts of the design industry,
because many of its designs would lose their
protection.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061188000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000020">Amendment
7 would harmonise the conditions of UK unregistered design infringement
with EU law, as set out in the European directive and regulation. These
are also the same conditions that apply to the UK registered design.
This would be a fundamental and significant change to the application
of unregistered design law in the UK. Since its introduction in 1988, a
considerable body of case law has built up relating to the infringement
of unregistered designs, one of the leading cases being PepsiCo v
Grupo. Businesses and the legal profession have also spent a
considerable amount of time in building a clear understanding of this
case law.</hs_para>

Government are concerned about the effect that the change would have in
altering the way in which infringement of the UK unregistered design is
determined before the courts. The current test has been interpreted
narrowly in a number of leading cases. This is in contrast to the test
applied in EU law, which is potentially wider in scope. It would be
troubling indeed if the change meant that existing designs were
suddenly subject to infringement actions from which they were
previously free. Furthermore, while the wider scope of the EU
unregistered right may be justified given that it has a lifespan of
only three years, the Government considers that it would be
inappropriate for a right that lasts up to 15 years, as is the case
with the UK unregistered design right, to enjoy wider protection. There
would be serious concerns about the effect of this on
innovation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061188000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000022">The
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, asked what the Government are doing
generally to align EU and UK rights. The Government are seeking,
through this Bill, to align design rights wherever possible—for
example, through the changes proposed to amend the rules on
commissioning and defences to infringement as a general clause. The
noble Lord also raised some general points on the Government’s
proposals in the Bill and their decision not to go for wholesale
reform. We listened carefully to stakeholders, who told us that there
was value in both the formal registered right and the less formal
unregistered right, which enable certain businesses 
<?notus-xml column=328?>that work in fast-moving fields, such as the fashion industry, to enjoy

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> Perhaps I may probe the noble Lord a
little further on his views on what the optimum period for protection
for design rights ought to be. It seems to me that, as a principle,
protection of intellectual property ought to be for the minimum period
consistent with encouraging innovation. There is a very large
difference between the position in the European Union and the position
under UK law. If the European Union provides protection for up to three
years and under our own domestic law we provide protection for up to 15
years, that is a huge discrepancy. Will the Minister help us to
understand the Government’s thinking on what really would be the
optimum period of protection? Fifteen years seems a very long period. I
appreciate that there are all sorts of situations and all sorts of
varieties of design, and that longer protection may be more appropriate
for some than for others, but what does he think should be the guiding
principle?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061188000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000024"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13061188000300" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000300">Viscount

technical question. It is true that there is a clear discrepancy
between three and 15 years. I think that it would be best if I write to

Borrie:</Member></B> Perhaps I may pursue this a little further. At
Second Reading, I raised the point that in terms of intellectual
property the grant of copyright or the grant of registered or
unregistered design can result in a big improvement in competition. It
encourages creativeness and innovation and it encourages the emergence
of new competition. On the other hand, competition
generally—meaning competition of new and old, old and
new—surely means, to re-emphasise the point made by my noble
friend Lord Howarth, that if because of the 15 years or any other
substantial period general competition is confined and there is no
competition for a particular design or copyright area, then the period
is too long. In all the studies that have been made, including
Hargreaves and so on, I wonder whether the rather vital matter of
whether it should be 15 or 10 years or whether it should be so many
months has been considered and reconsidered afresh in order to see how
applicable these periods of time are for the
future.</hs_para>

comment. I think that I said earlier that I would copy in all noble
Lords who are in Committee. I can certainly confirm that. The noble
Lord, Lord Borrie, made some valid comments. Again, they are on quite a
technical question and aligned with what the noble Lord, Lord Howarth,
said. It is a difficult equation to get right because there are so many
variables. I imagine that it would depend on the type of product being
considered; I am sure that there are various other variables. It is
therefore better to write a substantive response to cover all these
issues. Existing protections have worked for many years and industry
seems content with 15 years and, indeed, with three years. Having said
that, I accept that there is a discrepancy between the two. In relation
to the unregistered design right, a mark has to be copied, but I think
the answer is that your Lordships who are in the Committee deserve a
full reply. I would be interested to learn more

noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, ended on an interesting point, which is
that it is true that, when analysed back, the unregistered design right
is in essence copyright by another name. However, it provides in the
design production capacity the same sort of protections that we were
debating on the ERR Bill in relation to 3-D objects, which the
Government have taken powers to turn away from. I think that, under
that design regime, copying more than 50 of an artistic design that was
turned into a 3-D object and manufactured gave protection for 25 years.
I might be getting mixed up between the rights. Yet that 25-year period
has been replaced by the life of the designer plus 70 years. One could
ask, but one would immediately run up against the points made by my
noble friend Lord Howarth, why they have chosen to retain the design
approach—a limited period of five years then five years, plus a
further five—for unregistered designs and not taken what might
be the logical step of saying, “If it is copyright by another
name, why did we not move that way for the whole of this

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for that
intervention, but I think that that is the point I am trying to make.
We are dealing with particular aspects of the design industry, which
under this Bill is the production of individual designs that may or may
not lead to products being created. However, the point made in the
Section 52 debates—they became something else and were not on
Section 52, but we know what we are talking about<I>—</I>was
about a system of providing what my noble friend Lord Howarth said was
missing in all our debates. What is the minimum period consistent with
supporting innovation? Do we think that it lies more in the region of
short terms such as five, 10 or 15 years, or even three
years? Is that sufficient time to earn the return back on a particular
artefact? I agree with the Minister that obviously it depends on the
artefact. Alternatively, are we saying that any activity involving the
production of original creativity deserves a period of the life of that
designer plus 70 years? The two do not run together well.</hs_para>

has kindly said that he will write, this deserves more of a debate and
discussion, possibly outside the confines of this Bill, so that we as a
country think hard about this stuff, because we do not act alone. We
are obviously straining to provide certainty and satisfaction in these
areas for those who live and work in the United Kingdom. To a limited
extent, that is extended to the European Union—and, in a
particular measure on patents, to others affected by international
treaties. But we are mainly talking about a UK arrangement that cannot
extend beyond our borders and certainly does not run in other countries
involved in copying or making articles that may or may not have a
resemblance sufficient to warrant intervention through our legal
processes, when they are brought back and sold here, as designs that
originated

think that we have got to the heart of this issue in this debate, which
is a pity. The Minister was using the argument that the Bill was in
part a completion of the Hargreaves recommendations but, as I said at
Second Reading, Hargreaves did not take us to some of the conclusions
in the Bill; he was very careful in many cases to point out that there
were problems in the area and to suggest that more work was required
before any Government could get down to it. At the very least, there
had to be an overall review, which we have not

system has to match the tests properly set by my noble friend Lord

law. For example, in the Registered Designs Act 1949, the analogous
concept of novelty covers the whole of the European Economic Area. The

far as suggesting introducing the concept of novelty but did suggest
widening the meaning of commonplace to ensure that designers in the UK

I want to explain why the Government were consulting on changing the
definition of “commonplace”, as in Clause 1, to cover the
whole of the EEA, even though the Bill is only amending coverage in the
EU. Following the consultation and on further reflection, the
Government came to the conclusion that an additional layer of
complexity to the law would be created in the eligibility criteria for
design right if the geographical areas were different for the
definition of “qualifying country” and for
“commonplace” to which the noble Lord alluded.</hs_para>

intend to secure the position of people who have commissioned designs?
They have invested capital and made an important personal commitment to
commissioning a design. In future, the design right of that design is
to be vested in the designer and not the commissioner. I do not object
to that in principle but I should be grateful if he would clarify how
the commissioners’ interests are to be secured in this new
situation. Is it to be by way of contract between the commissioner and
the person he employs? If so, what ought the commissioner to stipulate
in the contract of his employee? However, supposing that the designer
is freelance or an independent contractor, how strong will be the

this in principle, responses were mixed when it came to the question of

something in this. It can be unclear whether a design falls to be
protected by copyright or unregistered design right. The boundary turns
in part on whether the design is for an “artistic work”
or for something other than an artistic work, which is rather a narrow
point of difference. Identifying whether something is an artistic work
such as a sculpture, which, as we now know, does not include a
stormtrooper helmet from the “Star Wars” films but which
might, I am told, include toy soldiers, engravings—including car
floor mats—and works of artistic craftsmanship is a concept over
which there is much confusion. This illustrates the points behind the
difficulty here.</hs_para>

states it is no infringement of UDR to do an act which infringes
copyright. If ownership is in the same hands and a person has
permission to use the unregistered design right but it turns out that
the design is an artistic work, they infringe—although a court
might fashion an implied licence with respect to copyright. If the
ownership is in different hands, the same problem might arise and there
would be no possibility of such a licence. The matter varies, too, with
whether Community unregistered design rights are involved. Here there
is a closer overlap, as there is no equivalent of Section 236 since a
person can infringe both copyright and Community unregistered design
right at the same time. One could imagine a grant of a licence to use
Community UDR and then issues arising as to copyright infringement,
especially as copyright remains national in character and ownership is
more readily divided. We would be grateful if the Minister can steer us
through some of the issues here and explain why the Government took the
view they have. I beg to move.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment seeks to
provide an exemption against accusations of infringement of UK artistic
copyright for UK and EU unregistered designs. Currently, Clause 5
extends the exemption only to registered Community designs. The
amendment concerns the complex issue, which the noble Lord, Lord
Stevenson, alluded to, of the balance between the rights of the
assignee and the interests of the copyright holder. In general, the
copyright holder is entitled to assert his rights against any
infringement. However, Section 53 overrides that ability but is
currently restricted to registered rights. The exemption is restricted
to registered rights because they are in the public domain and
therefore already open to public scrutiny and challenge, including by
the copyright holder.</hs_para>

include unregistered rights because they are not open to public
scrutiny in the same way, there is no official register of rights and
therefore copyright holders do not have the same opportunity to see
what rights are being claimed and 
<?notus-xml column=342?>to challenge those rights when they deem necessary. In light of this,
the Government do not believe it is appropriate to provide an
equivalent exemption of the kind suggested by this amendment.</hs_para>

Stevenson, asked whether we should just extend this clause to
unregistered rights anyway. In addition to the public policy reasons
already elaborated upon, there are also difficulties in ensuring that
the exception is being applied correctly. For example, one of the
conditions is that the person relying on the exception has to be acting
in good faith on the basis of the registration. There is no
registration for unregistered designs, so this condition cannot be
fulfilled.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061188000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000097">As
a general point on the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson,
Professor Hargreaves in his review of intellectual property identified
the complexity of the designs legal landscape as a problem for
business. There is an overlap between UK artistic copyright, which
covers photographs, sculptures and paintings, and registered design,
but sometimes permission is given to use one and not the other. The
defence makes sure that businesses that have permission to use a
registered design can defend themselves against accusations of
infringement of UK artistic copyright. The noble Lord is correct that
it is a complex area. I do not know whether I have shed any light on
the matter but I ask him to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para>

comments. When we were debating some of the Hargreaves exceptions in
the ERR Bill, I was at pains to try to draw out the Minister on various
issues raised of a popular culture mode. In the exception on parody, I
was able to suggest to him that he needed to update his knowledge of
Gangnam issues. I almost demonstrated to him, but of course
<I>Hansard</I> is not very good at picking that up. However, I still
treasure the moment. I did not get much of a response and therefore
thought that today I would try a different angle with a “Star

up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061188000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000099">The
“Star Wars” case was fascinating because it wound its way
up through the various levels on what seemed to be a narrow point about
whether you could claim that the helmet—I see the noble Lord,
Lord Clement-Jones, nodding in his place; I am sure he would be able to
enlighten us further on this point—created for the stormtroopers
in “Star Wars” was simply a registered design or a
sculpture. Coming from a film background, I can imagine even props as
being of extreme artistic importance, and I can take the point both
ways. I do not think the Minister responded to my jibe that this might
be enough to get him going, so perhaps he can write to

understand that the unifying theme here, if there is one, is that the
Government wish to go with the market, as it were, reflect the UDR as
the decision of choice of most designers and make that regime as simple
as possible. As I have said several times, we are not doing our overall
regime enough service if we ignore some of the points of comparability
and dissonance that exist between registered designs and unregistered
rights and the Community moves that are going forward. I would be
grateful if the Minister could write to me 
<?notus-xml column=343?>on this point because this is something to which we might wish to
return. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</hs_para>

slightly wider by requiring all orders under Clause 8 to be subject to

Clause 8 or Clause 11. In addition to the amendments tabled between us,

the Minister will be able to give either convincing reasons for
continuing with the negative procedure or will accept the fact that the

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, this follows on from the
discussion that we have been having in relation to the willingness of
the Government for the United Kingdom to join, in its own right, the
Hague agreement. It refers to the fact that in the consultation process
the majority of respondents were in favour of the UK becoming a member
of the Hague agreement in its own right. In a sense, that is very good
because, as I understand it, the Hague agreement will be a very
effective way of progressing the ability of those who originate
materials and wish to earn from them to secure that right across
territories and, increasingly, across the world, as the agreement is
not limited to the United Kingdom or indeed to the European Union.
Therefore, it is an important
step<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:47:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

out by one of the respondents, the UK simply joining the agreement in
its own right may not be sufficient to take the trick in this area, as
the agreement is very little known and there would be a steep learning
curve. The Government agree that there is work to be done here and they
have confirmed that the IPO will work with a range of interested
parties to publicise these and other changes to the law. Our amendment
would put a little weight behind that by giving the Government a
six-month window in which to get their show on the road.</hs_para>

representatives of the design professions, and legal and other
advisers. However, this is something where a bit more hearts-and-minds
activity is required, and it would be very helpful if, in responding,
the Minister could, as I said, put some flesh on that by explaining
what is going to happen on the ground. I beg to

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
friend Lord Stevenson for raising what I think the Committee will agree
is a very important issue. Intellectual property law is infernally
complex and difficult. It is labyrinthine, as my noble friend remarked
a little earlier this afternoon. For the businesses that the Government
rightly seek to assist through this legislation, there are real
difficulties in understanding the law.</hs_para>

is of course a long-standing principle that ignorance of the law is no
excuse. However, the department will of course want to facilitate a
good understanding of the law. It would be helpful if the noble
Viscount would unfold his thinking to us about how this is actually to
happen. Does the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills
have the address of every business in this country, including sole
traders and the myriad little businesses that come and go, perhaps
entering different incarnations, which are very hard for anybody to
trace? Of course he does not. Perhaps he expects them to have recourse
to the websites of the business department and the IPO: is it envisaged
that those websites should provide an encyclopaedic account of
intellectual property law? I imagine it is not, although I am sure that
the IPO, not least through the opinion service that this Bill
legislates for, will always do its best to help people to understand
the law as it may apply in their circumstances, and to know what
opportunities the law creates for
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:50:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061188000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000117">My
noble friend referred to the design professions and their
representatives. However, I do not think anybody can be confident that
the design professions necessarily represent perfectly everybody who
practises in the relevant fields. Hard-pressed business people
operating from day to day will often find it pretty difficult to know
the rules of these very complex games. This debate is useful because
government ought always to reflect on the practical impact of their
legislation on those whose lives and businesses it will affect. As I
noticed and readily acknowledge, the purpose here is to give assistance
to business. However, the task of enabling small traders to steer their
way through this labyrinth, small and medium-sized enterprises in
particular, is massive. I am grateful to my noble friend for tabling

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his
contribution and my noble friend Lord Howarth for making additional
points in relation to the proposal in the amendment. Behind this short
debate lurks the proposal later in the Bill to have an annual report to
Parliament on IP work, and it is helpful that the Minister finished on
that point. To anticipate that debate, we will be arguing that to draw
the report in the rather narrow terms currently specified in the Bill
may be too tight, so perhaps we can come back to this issue when we get
to that clause because the recent exchange gave us examples of that. It
would be helpful to have a better understanding of how engagement with
the wider group involved in the creative industries and in design, in
particular, is going. Simply reporting 
<?notus-xml column=348?>on the economy and growth will not get across that engagement in
sufficient detail, so this may be something to which we will

contribution to our economy that will flow from a better understanding

people to work in them to questions about whether design form DF12A

the consultation, suggestions were made that the relevant form should
include a statement indicating whether any associated unregistered
design right had been assigned to the same assignee. There was also a
suggestion that it might require an assertion about whether the
assignment of a registered right to a non-resident national or a
non-reciprocating country would also extinguish an unregistered design
right, which would be a further step. These are aspects of a debate we
have been having throughout this afternoon’s 
<?notus-xml column=349?>sitting of the Committee in which we are trying to understand better
what makes people wish to use the UK unregistered design right and not
the UK registered design right. There are good reasons, we have had
them and, to a certain extent, I think we understand them, but it is
still intriguing how, by the backdoor, a copyright-style approach has
become the preferred choice. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, gave

majority of designs circulating and fuelling the creative economy in
this country are unregistered design rights with a monopoly position
that runs up to 15 years, with the last five years not quite in the
same mode. To the extent that this matters, the formal position adopted
by the UK Government in the past, and available to all designers, to
register the design has not happened. I thought that the IPO was right
to raise the question of whether more could be done to create a
register of more sanguinity and impact by including in the process more
information about the individual designs being registered, and whether
more could be offered to those who wish to search the register as it
becomes more electronic and more available on the internet. What other
associated designs or associated unregistered designs might
apply?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061188000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000132">The
amendment is intended to probe the direction in which the original
consultation appeared to be going, which was to bulk up the register,
to give the registrar more powers to try to provide something of real
value to those who wish to engage with design, design registration and
subsequent manufacture—even to the extent, as floated in the
consultation, of making that a voluntary rather than a statutory
provision. That would seem to me, and to others, a good step in the
right direction. We would add value to what was available to those who
wished to register, as well as adding content and depth, but obviously
at the expense of speed, and it would in some ways be more
bureaucratic. I understand why the Government may have decided that
this is not the way to go, but I still regret that the arrangements are
not being followed through, and I should be grateful if, when he
responds, the Minister could give us more detail about that.</hs_para>

this matter is a question about the rules on inspection documents.
Clause 9(5) allows the Secretary of State to define situations in which
documents may not be inspected. That seems a rather draconian,
censorship sort of power. There are other mentions elsewhere in the
Bill—for instance, in relation to Section 22(2)—giving a
limited but not sufficient power to prevent inspection of deferred
designs, which is the point of my question. However, I wonder whether
it is not necessary to strengthen that area and, at the same time,
limit the power of the Secretary of State to effectively withhold
information which might be valuable to those who wish to take forward
similar designs but who wish to check whether they will be guilty of an
infringement if they do. Again, that may be something that needs just a
little more thought by the Government. Whether he can answer today or

9 is designed to allow users to access information on registered
designs electronically whenever they want to—an idea fully
supported by businesses in the recent consultation. There may indeed be
circumstances in which publication of documents could cause harm, and
it is in the interests of applicants to apply an exception in such
cases. An example might be where material is commercially sensitive or
otherwise confidential. Such exceptions are best made explicit in rules
because they can be changed more easily and quickly to reflect the
needs of business. The report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory

power to make such changes will be limited to the circumstances that
arise in this clause—for example, if the registrar’s
opinion disparages any person in a way that is likely to cause harm or
if material were considered immoral or likely to cause offence. This
power will be subject to the general requirements of administrative
law, and the scope of any rules relating to the registrar’s

turn now to Amendment 15, which introduces a specific modification to
an official form. It allows the registrar to give directions specifying
that the form shall include a statement indicating whether or not any
associated unregistered design right has been assigned to the same
assignee. The Government recognise that this requirement might
encourage businesses involved 
<?notus-xml column=351?>in such assignments to consider ownership of all the potential rights
associated with their design, and it may help third parties to more
readily track any changes in unregistered designs.</hs_para>

places an additional burden on those seeking to register an assignment
by requiring them to go through additional checks on the status of the
unregistered design, to establish whether the unregistered right still
exists or has expired, and whether it has previously been assigned to a
different party. It could, in fact, delay updating the register if
those details needed to be checked. Part of the rationale for removing
Section 19(3A) was for records to be kept up to date more easily. It

seeking to provide the best service it can to its customers, which

removes the requirement to use secondary legislation in relation to
forms and instead enables the use of directions, thereby mirroring
existing powers relating to similar procedural matters for both patents

that a small but important part of the unified patent court will, it is
hoped, be located in the United Kingdom and perhaps in more than one
location, it would be to the public benefit if those who practised at
this Bar or who were judges in the Bar were able to gain the maximum
exposure to the issues that are likely to arise during consideration of
the various points that will be routed through this legal process. My
first point is simply a general feeling that more expertise should be
spread around and that more people should be engaged, and that

a need to raise more public understanding on this matter. When court
cases that involve these issues are picked up, they sometimes, as we

option.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061188000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000151">All

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment put forward by the
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, is of considerable interest. The very
welcome aim and objective of Clause 10 is clearly to provide the most
cost-effective 
<?notus-xml column=353?>and quick alternative for appealing against a registrar’s opinion
and for distinguishing between matters of law and fact and so on. It is
very interesting to suggest that it is the patents county court that
would specifically deal with that, because that would meet the need for
a point of law to be referred to the court in a cost-effective way.
Rather like the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, I do not know what the
practicality of that is, but I certainly hope that the Minister will
explore the suggestion because it seems to be consistent with the aims
of the rest of Clause 10.</hs_para>

interesting that Clause 10 has been constructed, as I understand it,
very much in the way that current trade marks appeals against the

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, we understand that this is a
probing amendment. It would introduce the patents county court as an
alternative appeals body to the High Court and the appointed person.
Clause 10 reproduces the appeal routes for the IPO’s decisions
in relation to trade marks, which have proved to be very effective and
popular. This system provides two routes of appeal, one low cost and
one high cost, for those who wish to appeal a decision of the
registrar.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061188000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000156">On
the face of it, the patents county court would introduce another
relatively low-cost appeal route. However, although fees are about
£135, use of the PCC may involve legal representation, so it is
not always the case that this would be a low-cost route of appeal
compared with the High Court. In contrast, the cost to business of
using the appointed person is currently zero. In addition, because the
appointed person is a relatively informal route, businesses have
traditionally, in the trade mark field, represented themselves. This
means they also avoid the additional legal costs that might be incurred
if they went through the PCC or the High Court. In cases sufficiently
important to warrant appeal to a court, the Government believe that the
PCC offers less flexibility to businesses than the High Court because
it places limits on costs that may be recovered and limits hearings to
two days. It is likely that this would be too restrictive in complex
cases or cases requiring cross-examination. Introducing the PCC as a
third route of appeal does not appear to add significant benefits;
rather, it simply appears to add another layer of complexity in the
decision-making process for business. Therefore, the Government are not
convinced that adding this other route of appeal would serve a useful
purpose. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his
amendment.</hs_para>

that the Minister used was that it would not necessarily be a low-cost
route because it might have to involve legal representation. In
reflecting on this debate, I hope he will think again about that
because there will be some people who will want to have a low-cost
route, and in that context it seems that a court that has set out from
the start to say that it will not sit for more than two days and that
it will limit costs is rather a good thing, not something to be scorned
in trying to ensure that efficiency and effectiveness are used in the
legal process, but that may be another matter. If there was a way in
which it was clear that the route using the PCC was specifically
designed for not-complex cases, that would meet our concerns about
trying to build up and support it while not risking the very good
arguments that have been put forward by the Minister. Perhaps he will
reflect on that, and we could see whether there is an accommodating
route forward when we come to this on Report. I beg leave to withdraw

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> My Lords, in this Clause there is
a proposal to add a new Section 28A to the Registered Designs Act 1949
to enable the registrar to provide opinions about designs. We and the
respondents to the consultation generally welcome this proposal.
However, we believe that proposed new subsections 28A(6) and 28A(7)
seem to be contradictory. Subsection (6) of the proposed new section
seems to say that an opinion is not a decision. If it is, presumably it
has no legal force and is therefore not appealable. There is logic in
that formulation. However, subsection (7) seems to provide that such
opinions are appealable. Why is that? On what grounds are they
appealable and to whom? Would a successful appeal change the nature of
the opinion? If it had been tested in the courts, it would suggest that
it would be different. Can the Minister therefore provide us with some
clarification? Our amendment seeks to provide only an opportunity for
the noble Viscount to read some suitable words into the record. I beg

Young. This idea is that having had an opinion service available for
some time in relation to patterns, that is now to be brought over to
the subject of designs as well. It seems a most useful device, enabling
people to get an opinion for what I believe to be a relatively low cost
to the applicant. Having that instead of taking legal proceedings or,
at any rate, allowing a certain delay until legal proceedings are
brought seems most helpful. However, it does not seem to be appropriate
when, as the clause specifies, this is not a decision. My noble friend
read out the bits of the clause which are relevant to this. It is an
opinion; the clause specifies that. It is authoritative because it is
coming from a source that ought to know the answer but, by not being a
decision, surely it is inappropriate that there should be an appeal. It
somehow takes away from the great value of an opinion, which is to give
something straightforward in the opinion of the people who ought to
know. Having it without an appeal would enable it to be done quite
quickly.</hs_para>

businesses who receive a design opinion from the registrar should have
the right to appeal that decision to an appointed person. This ensures
that a person who is aggrieved by an opinion is able to get a second
view on whether the opinion was arrived at correctly in the first
place. In particular, it is an important next step before parties
consider formal legal proceedings, which could be time-consuming and
costly.</hs_para>

appeal for the design service reflects the principles established in
the existing patent opinions service. The patent service has been well
used, as has the ability for the opinion to be subject to a review
procedure. Furthermore, a right of appeal was considered particularly
important in the light of the European Convention on Human Rights: an
adverse opinion could affect the value of the right and hence the
proprietor’s ability to make use of it in business. It is
therefore important to offer an appeal for design opinions to ensure
that the necessary safeguards are in
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061188000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000163">Noble
Lords commented that the routes of appeal against a decision by the
Intellectual Property Office include an additional route of appeal to
the High Court. This is because decisions by the IPO can be legally
binding and can have an impact on a party’s rights. In contrast,
the opinion provided by the opinion service is
non-binding—indeed, it is an opinion, as the noble Lord, Lord
Borrie, pointed out. That is why in subsection (6) of Clause 11, the
proposed new section sets out that:</hs_para>

designed to be low cost and non-binding. The route of appeal
available—an important principle to uphold, given the underlying
economic value of the property right—is also low cost and
appropriate to the non-binding nature of the opinion

be subject to compensation. In the mean time, I ask that the noble

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a continuation
in some senses of the debate that we have just had and an attempt to
probe a little further about the opinions service. The Minister was
clear about what is intended here. My noble friend Lord Young made the
point that the wording in the Bill might set people off on the wrong
track with its notions of appeal. An appellate position is usually
quasi-legal, if not legal, and therefore people will get into the wrong
mode if the wording remains as it is. The suggestion might be to
reflect a bit more about how this could be expressed in the Bill
without setting people off down the wrong track. However, if the
Government were minded to accept this amendment, it would certainly
become a different beast, and I recognise
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061188000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000167">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:26:47"></hs_TimeCode>
am not trying to frighten the horses because it is not our game. The
point here is that in the consultation responses a number of
respondents expressed concern that some gaming may be involved in the
use of the opinions service. That means that large companies might
simply utilise the opinions service but ignore it, in the sense that
the process of going in to get an opinion from the registrar could be
forced on the smaller company or individual designer, who would go to
some expense, but not much, to get an opinion from somebody who should
know, in the words of my noble friend Lord Borrie, and would take that
opinion, which perhaps supported the view that the design was covered
by an unregistered design arrangement, or had a copyright, or whatever
it is that the registrar would be able to opine on. The designer would
go back to the larger company and say, “See, I have evidence now
that you have done me a terrible wrong by stealing my design and using
it, and I wish to be recompensed for it”. The company would just
laugh in the face of that person and go straight to court, 
<?notus-xml column=357?>raising proceedings that might be very expensive and effectively using
economic muscle to get rid of the small
designer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061188000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000168">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:28:26"></hs_TimeCode>
our amendment were accepted, the judge or the court could take into
account when awarding costs and damages whether the defendant or
claimant had gone to the registrar and then ignored that opinion. I
hope that that is not falling into the trap of giving this a legal
status that it does not deserve or has not earned, but it adds teeth to
the process, which would be useful to those who had to judge or settle
claims in a way that would be effective and could raise the stature of
the opinions service in the medium and long term. This is the thinking
behind the amendment. The intention is to try to build up and support
the opinion service by giving it a bit of steel behind its decisions,
but without, I hope, falling into the trap of creating a quasi-legal
approach. I beg to

non-binding. Although, in practice, the opinion may be used as part of
a submission to the courts in support of an argument such as expert
evidence, it will not hold a legal status. This will help ensure that

by the use of lower fees for the electronic filing of trade mark

online and therefore the Government see no reason why this figure
cannot be achieved for online design applications. The IPO has recently
migrated trade mark registrations to a fully electronic document

design registration. The latter forms a commitment in the published

drafting leaves something to be desired, but the intention is clear.
There is a reference in the consultation document to the way in which
applications for registering a design have associated with them a
possibility of a limitation or a short period of time before the form
is published. This is for commercial and other reasons and works well;
there is no reason to change it. However in the consultation the
Government floated the idea that it should be 30 months, not 12 months,
which is a substantial increase. It was interesting to read the
responses to that consultation because the Government felt that they
could do that and were suggesting that it would be done in the future.
However, it is not in the  
<?notus-xml column=360?>Bill, and therefore the arrangements are going to be left for secondary
legislation. I would be grateful in this concluding amendment in this
afternoon’s business if the Minister would give us more and
better information about what is intended, the rationale for allowing
an extension beyond the 12-month period, if there is to be one, and the
conditions under which individuals or companies can request such a
deferral of publication so that we can better understand the way in
which this operates. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061188000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000183"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:25:00"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13061188000371" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000371"><B>Viscount

Young of Norwood Green, would place a power in primary legislation for
the registrar to amend the period of deferment of design applications
from one year to up to 30
months.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061188000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000184">When a
design is registered, the applicant is issued with a certificate and
the design is published in the <I>Official Journal</I>. The deferment
period allows applicants for registered designs to delay the date of
registration where they might want to keep the design confidential.
There could be good commercial reasons for this; for example, a
business might not be quite ready to market a product and would want
the registration, and therefore publication, to coincide with the entry
of its product on to the
marketplace.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061188000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130611-gc0001.htm#13061188000185">The
powers under Section 36 of the Registered Designs Act 1949 enable rules
to be made prescribing time limits, including for the purposes of
Section 3(5) of the 1949 Act to which this amendment is addressed. In
addition, Clause 12 removes the requirement to use secondary
legislation to make minor changes in the way the IPO functions. This
will enable the IPO to specify by means of directions any necessary
changes to the content and layout of forms relating to registered
designs. A note explaining what these directions are expected to
contain has been made available and placed in the Libraries of both
Houses. The note sets out that one anticipated change will be to extend
the period of deferment for publication of design applications for up
to 30 months. The detail contained in this amendment is more
appropriately dealt with in rules or directions. I hope this will
provide sufficient reassurance to the noble Lords such that this
amendment can be

the jump from 12 to 30 months is justifiable. I understand the process,

legislation. Indeed, I had noted reference to that in the document that

than it currently does. Distribution of water is a greater problem than
a general lack of water. St Helena’s mountainous terrain means
that it has 11 disparate water systems making it difficult to pump
water from one system, and from one area of the island to another. The
